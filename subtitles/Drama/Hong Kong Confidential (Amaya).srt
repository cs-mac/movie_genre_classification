1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Lori, what's wrong with you?

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,400
I don't know...

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,359
You're all white...

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,559
Tell me what's wrong.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,399
Are you feeling sick?

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
I don't know... something's approaching...

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,639
What's approaching?

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,640
I don't know ... I'm afraid.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,159
Paul, can we go back?

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Back? How...?

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I don't know, but I have to go back somehow,

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,040
...otherwise everything's going to go wrong.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Help open this door!

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
If I tell you, will you help me?

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Leave the fucking door alone!

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Don't touch me, Paul! Leave me alone!

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Hello! I'm fine.

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,159
Change my plans, you know.

19
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,160
I'll stay here for a few days more.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
How are you?

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,559
OK. I'll let you know

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,560
as soon as I get the tickets.

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,279
I love you, love you. Bye.

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,479
That way?

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,480
No, this way.

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,599
Hello, I'd like to get a massage.

27
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes, in my room. Is it possible?

28
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Sure, sure. How much?

29
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,639
OK.Four hundred and if I change my mind

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,399
...then it's one hundred.

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,279
No, no. I won't change my mind.

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
All I need is a good massage. Right now.

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,119
OK. Half an hour.

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,039
Great. Thankyou.

35
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,040
AMAYA

36
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,439
He came in with a huge backpack full of clothes...

37
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
And threw that all on the counter.

38
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,679
Who was the person??

39
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,959
A strange man came to my laundry this afternoon.

40
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,359
He resembled some being from the jungle.

41
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Foreigner with a strange white hair-

42
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,840
...like shortly cut grass.

43
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,719
It was late for washing

44
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,679
...but he insisted he would pay double

45
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
...if everything would be ready by morning.

46
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,760
I took everything home.
We'll wash later.

47
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,279
I can't understand why...

48
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Sometimes we meet very strange people.

49
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Let's go to a restaurant this weekend.

50
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
We could invite some friends?

51
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,279
I'm too tired from all the people

52
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,159
I meet at work.

53
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,999
I want some rest at least at weekend.

54
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,919
By the way weekend is still far.

55
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Tomorrow is Friday already.

56
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,039
And then there is Saturday when you work,

57
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,679
...so what's left? Just one day...

58
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,199
...and you may work then again...

59
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,559
 like it happened two weeks ago.
I had to sit alone in front of TV entire Sunday.

60
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,559
Do you know how hard it is?

61
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,879
To watch TV alone?

62
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,559
When you watch TV,

63
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,439
I always watch it with you.

64
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,599
Weekend...

65
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
You talk like we have a free month!

66
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
This clock hangs on our wall for 23 years.

67
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,039
Remember when I was in hospital...

68
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,519
...you and Tao brought it...

69
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,279
...and I wound it up.

70
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,399
Could you oil my bike?

71
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,879
It squeaks.

72
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,559
I will.

73
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,159
What a great wedding present your parents gave!

74
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
We got money- not the clock.

75
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,719
And we bought the clock next morning.

76
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,879
We can call it a present, can't we?

77
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,880
It is a bad sign to give a clock as a present.

78
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Don't you know?
-Who are you talking with?

79
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,119
There is a strange sound.

80
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,039
Can you hear it?

81
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,599
I can't...

82
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,599
How can't you? Listen!

83
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Tick-tack-tick and

84
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,160
after the third one some kind of noise...

85
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I hear nothing but your talking.
OK! I can keep silent!

86
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,479
It seems I can hear it...

87
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,759
I told you!

88
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,239
There is a noise!

89
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,519
I have to oil it.

90
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,959
Perhaps the wheels became dusty.

91
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,479
It could start from the smallest dust,

92
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,879
even from the sweeping.

93
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,719
I don't say you're guilty,

94
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
but it's possible... ?

95
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
What did you say about the bike?

96
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,799
It squeaks.

97
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Can you oil it?

98
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,039
Strange, it's almost new.

99
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,359
What could it be?

100
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,799
Perhaps you went through puddles

101
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
and it got rusty.

102
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,920
It is more than twenty years old...

103
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,279
Oh, that's why. Throw it away!

104
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Nobody rides bicycles now.

105
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,319
I got used to it.

106
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,639
when we worked together

107
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
and I delivered laundry to clients.

108
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,839
I can't stop it

109
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,840
the same way you need the clock.

110
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,640
My life would stop if I throw it away.

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,079
Can't you see

112
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,359
I am doing an important thing?

113
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,199
Wrong time to turn it on!

114
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,639
I lost the wheel, where is it?

115
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,879
Check first before you disturb others!

116
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,839
We always wash at night,

117
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,439
why an exception today?

118
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,440
It's night already.

119
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I will certainly mend your bike.

120
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,120
What are you planning for the weekend?

121
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,119
Perhaps we could all go

122
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,120
to some restaurant or elsewhere?

123
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,199
Your brother says he's is tired

124
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,200
and would rather watch TV than chat.

125
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,199
That's not bad either.

126
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,199
Sometimes just TV is better.

127
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,479
For example they show something important

128
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,599
and you are in a restaurant.

129
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
You can miss it and never find out.

130
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,839
Two days ago I wanted to leave.

131
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,840
But then I turned onTV.

132
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,599
Can you imagine?

133
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,479
They showed fishermen

134
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,399
returning to China.

135
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,159
They had full boat of fish

136
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,719
big and small.

137
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,439
The boat was small

138
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,440
but it had a mountain offish.

139
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Just take the skis and ski down.
Tao... why are you still alone?

140
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why do you live near us?

141
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,119
I remember how you arrived -

142
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,959
you had almost nothing...

143
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,879
I got a couple of chairs

144
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,679
from the neighbors for you.

145
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
I gave you a TV set.

146
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Why don't you have a family?

147
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,839
I am used to it.

148
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
You are my family.

149
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Why?

150
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,119
What kind of massage would you like to have?

151
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,959
I would like to sign up for massage courses.

152
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,960
I read the ad.

153
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,119
Yes, we had one.

154
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,799
Lots of people signed up,

155
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,599
we can't take more.

156
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,039
Perhaps other time...

157
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,599
Couldn't you accept just one more?

158
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,599
One more?

159
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,879
Me.

160
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,239
Didn't you hear what I told you?

161
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,999
I've lost my job.

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The courses might be my rescue.

163
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
I could learn massage in one week

164
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,839
and work for you.

165
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,639
To work here?

166
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,599
Where did you work before?

167
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
What are your advantages?

168
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,159
I worked as interpreter

169
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,839
but the new department manager

170
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,399
who comes from England,

171
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,039
fired me and others.

172
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,559
He didn't explain anything

173
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,999
nor checked how we work,

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,879
if there was any reason to fire us.

175
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,879
Sure he had a reason to fire you.

176
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,399
It won't work.

177
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,719
Don't bother us!

178
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,559
We have no vacancies nor we plan any.

179
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Courses are fully booked. That's it!

180
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,119
was sending money to my parents

181
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,959
in Shanwei each month.

182
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,839
And now if I stop,

183
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,239
it will be hard for them.

184
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,559
They'll understand that I have no job

185
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,839
they will be worried.

186
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,840
They are old...

187
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I've heard hundreds of stories like yours.

188
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,399
Everyone has problems.

189
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,759
There are other places

190
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,759
where you could find job.

191
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,319
Why here and now?

192
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,799
Why do you want to be a masseur?

193
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,639
A cleaning lady- maybe.

194
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,640
But masseur...

195
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Hello! One moment!

196
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Did you work as interpreter?

197
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,439
Can I sign up for the massage course

198
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,199
that starts on Monday?

199
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Sorry, sorry. Hold on.

200
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,719
What happened? Why don't you speak?

201
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,559
What did you tell?

202
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,359
He wanted to sign up for courses,

203
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,839
but then the door bell rang.

204
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,559
He asked me to wait.

205
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,599
Of course we will wait.

206
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,879
We have time.

207
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,759
Tell him courses are available.

208
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,959
He will be admitted.

209
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,239
Courses will take one week.

210
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,399
The price for the courses, for five days...

211
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,439
Tell him 1000...

212
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,839
Better put it this way

213
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,039
there are no places left

214
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,039
but if he pays 2000 we will find one.

215
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Yes, 2000. Clear?

216
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,999
No, something is wrong -

217
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
one hour of massage costs 300.

218
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,359
So it means he will pay for courses

219
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,799
as for six massages.

220
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,559
Seven with a discount...?

221
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,359
No, wait...

222
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,319
Did he really want to attend

223
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,320
or was just interested?

224
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Sorry, I'm back.

225
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,319
So what about the massage courses?

226
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,679
Is it possible?

227
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Yes, they start on Monday from early morning.

228
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,119
Five days, 6 hours daily.

229
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,599
Mainly practical learning and

230
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
for you, as a foreigner, special price

231
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,279
for all courses, demonstrations

232
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,280
and certificate -5000 HKD.

233
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,919
Thank you for calling.

234
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,159
So whatd id he say?

235
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,479
Did he agree...?

236
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,399
Yes, he's going to be here on Monday.

237
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,399
He agreed. Good!

238
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I think I can find you a place.

239
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,079
No thanks needed.

240
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
I changed my mind.

241
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,799
Thank you but no.

242
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,799
Why not?

243
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,879
A moment ago you wanted the courses

244
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,319
more than anything in the world!

245
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,839
Yes. But not anymore.

246
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,840
But what about job and your parents?

247
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,359
You told yourself I can find

248
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,559
plenty of other places

249
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,359
and that's what I am going to do.

250
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,399
Please don't be angry

251
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,159
about things I told you.

252
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,079
I didn't appreciate you,

253
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,839
but you proved your good qualities.

254
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,119
Exactly what we need.

255
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,359
There will be a foreigner in the courses

256
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,959
and you will translate.

257
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,959
And later you might workin the saloon.

258
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,960
I promised myself I won't have

259
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,759
any business with foreigners.

260
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,959
I was looking for job

261
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,199
four days without any results.

262
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,559
Finally when I find something I like

263
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,839
I am not admitted and later...

264
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,759
Forget it!

265
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,919
You are admitted!

266
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,920
No, I will not work together with a foreigner!

267
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,519
This isn't the end of the world.

268
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
I'll find something.

269
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,799
Why did she refuse?

270
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,719
It would be a good business -

271
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,999
she would pay for the courses.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And translate free of charge.

273
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,359
Maybe I should offer her to pay less?

274
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,360
What do you think?

275
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,079
Here she comes!

276
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,999
I'll make that offer...

277
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,559
What offer?

278
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,599
I would take anything from you, son...

279
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,999
I'll do it.

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Next time I come, you won't escape.

281
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,159
I will never learn English.

282
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,359
But you do speak English!

283
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,839
I heard myself

284
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
how you helped tourists to find the way.

285
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,119
I couldn't do that.

286
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,399
I don't remember.

287
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,159
There are times, when I can talk and talk.

288
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,119
But sometimes I can't finish a sentence.

289
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,879
When you speak face to face,

290
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,719
you can gesticulate.

291
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,239
But on the phone or beside others...

292
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,999
Why are you talking about it now?

293
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,959
I'll start teaching massage

294
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,519
for a small group on Monday.

295
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,359
And one foreigner has applied.

296
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,839
Don't think about it.

297
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,639
It doesn't mean he comes.

298
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Yes, but...

299
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,719
It's nice to see people

300
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
who are in town only a few days.

301
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,519
How can you tell that?

302
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,999
By their look.

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,159
Sitting near the window,

304
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,559
watching people passing by,

305
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,119
following every person,

306
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,719
the view beyond the window changes

307
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,359
and they watch it like a movie.

308
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,079
So simple?

309
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Yes. But that's just my point of view.

310
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,239
Hi. My name is Kitty.

311
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Hi, Kitty. My name is Paul.

312
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,759
How do you recognize the people

313
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,479
who've been here longer?

314
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,279
Those two...

315
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,959
They comes here for perhaps two years already

316
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,479
to drink espresso so they can start their day.

317
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Or that man, he feels like he's at home.

318
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,719
He's reading Dickens and he doesn't even care

319
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,239
what's happening outside the window-

320
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,319
daily boredom.

321
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,439
Who is Dickens?

322
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,359
If I'm not wrong

323
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,360
he's a central forward in LA Lakers.

324
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,959
Kitty, don't listen to him.

325
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,359
He's just joking.

326
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,999
I know he is a writer.

327
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,159
What kind of books has he wrote?

328
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,959
Do you have your favorite writer?

329
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
"About three things I was absolutely positive.
First,

330
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,439
Edward was a vampire.

331
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,359
Second,

332
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,759
there was a part of him -

333
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,439
and I didn't know how dominant

334
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,679
that part of him might be-

335
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,079
that thirsted my blood.

336
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,199
And third. I was unconditionally

337
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,200
and irrevocably in love with him.".

338
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,599
To figure all this out,

339
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,599
you must have lived here for a long time?

340
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,159
It's only my third day here,

341
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,879
but I've traveled so much -

342
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,880
all places are the same- people just get inside

343
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,839
to reconstruct their Western biosphere.

344
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,039
But you didn't tell me where you're from?

345
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,519
FromTaiwan.

346
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,039
Strange, but you look like

347
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,399
you're from Europe or the States.

348
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Is that so? I came here from Taiwan.

349
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,879
What about you?

350
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,999
I came last week. From London.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,719
Lori, let's go to Taiwan.

352
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,359
I haven't been there yet.

353
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,360
I know it's not far from here. Lori...

354
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,159
So, what you are planning to do

355
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,599
while you're here?

356
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,359
Perhaps you can suggest something?

357
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,639
No. In every city each person

358
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
must find what inspires them.

359
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,599
So why are you asking?

360
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,439
Oh, there is one interesting place-Avenue of Stars

361
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,599
for famous actors and directors.

362
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,519
I was really surprised that Wong Kar Wai's star

363
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,520
is so near to Bruce Lee's monument.

364
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
So the plan is?

365
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,040
On Monday I will go to see the Big Buddha,

366
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
if you want and have time we can go together.

367
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,999
Why Monday? Why not the weekend?

368
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,679
On the weekend there are so many tourists,

369
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,039
you'd need to spend the entire day in a queue-

370
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,279
it will take more time

371
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,159
than a traveling to the Buddha.

372
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,079
Very well, I'm free on Monday.

373
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,080
OK, if you really want to,

374
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
then on Monday come to this station 10 a.m.

375
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,480
If you don't...

376
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,680
then have a nice life.

377
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,840
OK. See you....

378
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Our son sent us a letter.

379
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,800
"Mum and Dad, I'm leaving Shanwei today.

380
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,920
I got a job in the port- sorting fish.

381
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,839
Small ones to the left,

382
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,840
big ones to the right.

383
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,039
I'll spend six months there.

384
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,040
I will get a room and a good pay."

385
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
The sea was his dream from childhood.

386
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,959
And look at him now-

387
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,039
he did it! What a success!

388
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,959
"I left my apartment neat

389
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,799
in case you want to come.

390
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,800
The place is beautiful.

391
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,080
The guard has the keys."

392
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,599
He is so caring.

393
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I can feel him through each sentence.

394
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,640
He's grown up -do you see?

395
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,639
I'd like to go there.

396
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
At least-for a week.

397
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,159
Without me. I spend too much time

398
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,719
traveling to and from the job.

399
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,720
I prefer staying home.

400
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,519
Leave now?

401
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,159
Courses start on Monday.

402
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,759
Tao will need your help,

403
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,760
didn't he tell you?!

404
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,479
He did.

405
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,039
Fine! Discussion is over.

406
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,439
"Small ones to the left,

407
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,440
big ones to the right..."

408
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,759
Well said, few words

409
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,760
but what a deep meaning!

410
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,239
Our son's future!

411
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,359
Think about it- big and small...

412
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,479
I didn't realize -

413
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
for me fish was just fish.

414
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,919
I do massage for 5 years

415
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,920
but I still don't know how to do it.

416
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Maybe it's impossible to learn

417
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,479
these kind of things.

418
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Either you have it or not...

419
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,039
I don't...

420
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,040
The only person I communicate with is Tao,

421
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,919
he always supports me.

422
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,920
But when he is away...

423
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,679
I would feel much better

424
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,359
if I had a friend to talk to.

425
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,999
I spend whole day in silence...

426
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and the bike is still squeaking.

427
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,639
Tell me where the oil is.

428
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,839
I will oil it myself.

429
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,679
Perhaps I can use the same oil

430
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,399
you use for the clock?

431
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,079
I don't need much...

432
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Anyway, can I leave for one week?

433
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,999
The first day of courses...

434
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,839
You know what it means?

435
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Beginning of a new life!

436
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,959
There...

437
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,999
...somebody came for a massage and I...

438
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,359
Have you forgotten?

439
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,079
No clients before lunch! None!

440
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,879
My courses are in danger now.

441
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,199
The foreigner will come.

442
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,359
One who pays lot of money....

443
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,639
He may just go away

444
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,639
if something is wrong!

445
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
That man is a foreigner too!

446
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,039
Yes, nota local...

447
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,799
And he is the first client of the week.

448
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,279
I can't kick him out,

449
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,559
otherwise the luck will turn its back...

450
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,319
Good morning...Good morning...

451
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,479
She will make a massage and

452
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,480
I will go to trainees.

453
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,799
It's even better-

454
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
he will see lots of people.

455
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,240
He won't know they came to learn, will he?

456
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,199
Great that you changed your mind

457
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,079
and came back!

458
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,080
I was sure we would sort it out.

459
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,240
I will work... I won't work...

460
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,080
You told me you would take me as a cleaner.

461
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,919
I agree to that.

462
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,639
OK. You can work!

463
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,559
Go and look at things.

464
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Start from windowsills.

465
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,039
What's your name?

466
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,879
Lang.

467
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,880
We have Lang already.

468
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Which one don't you have?

469
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,399
OK, I will be Jasmin.

470
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,159
Jasmin. OK. Show her everything!

471
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Come with me.

472
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,999
It's good you are all here on time.

473
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We still miss one.

474
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,360
OK, we won't wait for him, let's start.

475
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,519
Before the massage

476
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,639
we have to relax the feet.

477
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,640
We'll do it by stroking.

478
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Bonjour!

479
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Merci!

480
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,159
When is the course going to start?

481
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,879
I've agreed on everything with someone

482
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,880
on Friday by phone.

483
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,199
It was a mistake to have

484
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,039
that foreigner in my courses.

485
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,599
The courses were full already,

486
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,959
but the money...

487
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,559
Why did he come earlier?

488
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,319
And you?

489
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,159
Can't you see who is coming for massage

490
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,839
and who comes to learn?!

491
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,319
And how will you understand

492
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,639
who comes for what?

493
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,239
Those foreigners will ruin my life!

494
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,319
And this one looks so confident!

495
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,479
And this one looks so confident!

496
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,479
He wears such shabby clothes.

497
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Most likely he has no money.

498
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Should I translate it for him?

499
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,319
While feet are soaking, each of you

500
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,199


501
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,479
can tell something about yourselves.

502
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,799
I did a lot of different jobs before.

503
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,119
And it was in the news

504
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,120
that more and more people

505
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,200
are into foot massage these days.

506
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,879


507
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I decided to try.

508
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,399
I worked in a factory that

509
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,400
has gone out of business last year

510
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,119
and I was jobless for almost a year now,

511
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,959


512
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,319
I would like to try this.

513
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,439
My children are all grown-up

514
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,959
and I want to find a job and learn some skills.

515
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,960
That's why I am here.

516
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,519
Hi, my name is Paul. P-A-U-L. Paul.

517
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,319


518
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,039
I am from Europe, from a country

519
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,879
no one's ever really heard of.

520
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,439
It the same wherever I go,

521
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,079
when I try to explain....

522
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Paul. From Europe.

523
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,919
Well, my story is ...

524
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,959


525
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,799
Several years ago my fiancee left me

526
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,479
because I cheated on her.

527
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,799
And since that day,

528
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,399
I am traveling around the world.

529
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,959
I worked my ass off demolishing

530
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,439
the old buildings in Manhattan

531
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,039
during the nights for a few months,

532
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,319
and then wasted all the money in Vegas

533
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,839


534
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,319
and stumbled like a beggar thru the streets.

535
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,559
With just a backpack

536
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,519
I crossed the entire country of Chile.

537
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,279
I've since been to massage courses in India,

538
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,280
Japan, and Thailand and finally ended up here.

539
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The first day of the courses was really funny.

540
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,119


541
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,999
That guy came early.

542
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Lang thought hew as a client...

543
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,799
Did anyone notice that you came here?

544
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,800
No... I guess.

545
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,799
That's good.

546
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,800
I thought about you entire weekend.

547
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,759
Your parents live in the same village

548
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,079
my son lives.

549
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,080
He sent us a letter.

550
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,440
I miss those places and my son...

551
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Why did you remind me of my parents...?

552
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,839
What happened?

553
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:03,919
Today I must send money,

554
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,159
Today I must send money,

555
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,919
otherwise they might suspect

556
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,679
that something is wrong.

557
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,799
They will start worry.

558
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,359
My previous employer

559
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,599
didn't pay the money I earned.

560
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,439
didn't pay the money I earned.

561
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,119
Honestly it was a bit different.

562
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,119
I was given the salary.

563
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,399
But I left without taking it.

564
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Then I thought it was brave, but now...

565
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,480


566
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
How much?

567
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,879
2000 HKD...

568
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,399
I don't have so much with me.

569
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,400
You don't have to give me anything.

570
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,359
...another one comes for massage-

571
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,360
I started teaching him.

572
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,239
Can you imagine?

573
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,559
I pressed him to the chair with both hands

574
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:01,879
so he couldn't stand up.

575
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,799
so he couldn't stand up.

576
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,079
He couldn't understand a thing!

577
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,080
So funny...

578
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,199
That second one was not English,

579
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
he didn't understand a word in English.

580
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,359
Can you imagine?

581
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,360
A foreigner and didn't speak English!

582
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Money. Give it to Tao.

583
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Send it to your parents.

584
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:44,959
Paul gave me money for the courses.

585
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,719


586
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,720
But I gave...

587
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,399
What money?

588
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,319
He already paid me for entire week

589
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,320
and for the morning massage too.

590
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,439
By the way- here are your 100 HKD.

591
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,440


592
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,560
I hate taking pictures.

593
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,319
Why waste all those megabites on photos

594
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,319
which are seen only by relatives and

595
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,319
only out of politeness.

596
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,559


597
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,799
And if you look at them -

598
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,959
what is that glance at the past really for?

599
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,960
The emotions and feelings have already vanished.

600
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,519
Usually the people in the pictures

601
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,159
are not even friends anymore,

602
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,160
or they live completely different lives.

603
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,359
When a partner changes

604
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,079
there's always the question of

605
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,279
what to do with the pictures.

606
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,280
You won't show it to other friends,

607
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,879
and how can you explain it if you look at them?

608
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,359
Then don't change partners.

609
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,519


610
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
But what if she leaves? What then?

611
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,039
Did you think I'd come?

612
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,040
I thought it'd be nice if you came, and you did.

613
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Take a picture of me!

614
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,359
That's how I got to Beijing

615
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,079
where I learned Chinese massage.

616
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,439


617
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,639
Most of the masseurs and my teachers

618
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,640
were visually impaired or blind.

619
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Their entire world was their hands.

620
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,159
It was very touching

621
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,599
how they were massaging children.

622
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,600


623
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
They don't hide their emotions.

624
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,400
There is great excitement in their faces

625
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,359
when they play with children

626
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:23,999
in order to relax them.

627
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,359


628
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,719
They hear and feel the child.

629
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,919
It's lunchtime.

630
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,959
We will continue after the break.

631
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,159
Paul, lunch time.

632
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,959
Continue after lunch. Ok?

633
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,639
Tao, can I stay and practice during the lunch?

634
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,479


635
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,439
As I missed the beginning I'm not sure what to do.

636
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Of course you can stay.

637
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,439
I had a boyfriend

638
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,119
who was good enough for my parents,

639
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,999
but I left and he stayed there.

640
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,359


641
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,360
Thanks God, time passed and he forgot me.

642
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,399
I was seeing other guys

643
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,400
but all they cared for was sex.

644
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I like it too but I need something more.

645
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,639
Do I look like all I can give is just sex?

646
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,719


647
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,519
Maybe that one

648
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,319
who stayed in the village is the best?

649
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,719
Perhaps it's a big city problem

650
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,679
that people need just it?

651
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,959
It is not so.

652
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,559
You can live without it.

653
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,999
I can't live like that,

654
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,599
I need it every other day.

655
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,879
Can you imagine

656
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,880
it's been three months for me without sex!

657
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,119
I don't like the guy.

658
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,639
What kind of woman

659
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,319
could possibly like him?

660
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,479
He's not good enough for sex,

661
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:50,999
an empty place,

662
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,199


663
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,200
and that tattoo on his leg.

664
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,679
I have a small butterfly

665
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,679
between my breasts.

666
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,079
There was one guy

667
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,119
with whom I fell in love so much.

668
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,479
I heard once

669
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,519
I heard once

670
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,199
that a woman of his dreams

671
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,719
should have a butterfly

672
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,159
between the breasts.

673
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,679
I made that tattoo for him.

674
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,559
It hurt so much,

675
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,399
I couldn't undress for sometime.

676
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,759
But when the pain was over

677
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,879
he managed to sleep

678
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,439


679
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,039
with my bestfriend and go abroad.

680
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,919
Hi, mom. How are you? I'm good.

681
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,679
That's howI have memories from his love.
No, no, I'm in Hong King right now.

682
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,359
Yes,just like I told you.

683
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,519
 As soon
as I get the tickets.

684
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,039
Why do you look at my hands all the time?

685
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,279
Sure. But you should see what I see here.

686
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:34,639


687
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,399
I love it. It's beautiful. Great.

688
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,759
I try to remember your movements.

689
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,479
Here is everything I like.

690
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,999
The hills, these a, the skyscrapers.

691
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,639
That's why I didn't go to lunch.

692
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,159
Is that bad?

693
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,359
Great food. Nice people.

694
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,559
Sit down instead of me and try.

695
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,159
It means you don't want it that much.

696
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,160


697
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,559
Perhaps you want to practice massage?

698
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,119
What?

699
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,799
Practice massage?

700
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,519
Where you get that idea?

701
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I haven't a slightest desire.

702
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,719
I got that dragon tattoo in Chile.

703
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,519
One day I had a strange pain in my leg

704
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,999
and after I got the tattoo -

705
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,759
a fire-breathing dragon -

706
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,639


707
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,039
the pain disappeared.

708
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,519
Everyone has their own tattoo.

709
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,679
I don't.

710
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,479
I feel these things.

711
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,439
I can feel where you have one,

712
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,440
or where you should have it.

713
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,319
You are too confident, but OK.

714
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,959


715
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,639
If you guess where it is, then...

716
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,159
Then you will show it to me.

717
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,959
OK, only if you have one,

718
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
if you don't, don't worry, ok?

719
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,320
You have a tattoo...

720
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,559
between your breasts.

721
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,439
No!Your guess was wrong.

722
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,440
Stomach. No pain, no good.

723
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Maybe your dragon can't protect you all the time.

724
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,759
Why are you so late today?

725
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,760
Tao left without any dinner...

726
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,599
I saw him downstairs eating

727
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,519
with others in the canteen...

728
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,520


729
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,840
The bike is really broken.

730
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,679
Perhaps you are right-

731
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,680
I should throw it away.

732
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,199
But what's wrong?

733
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,799


734
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Didn't I oil it?

735
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,759
How could you ride a bike

736
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,760
which gives such a noise?

737
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,239
You see how it goes -

738
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,919
if we didn't have the clock

739
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,439
we wouldn't have oil to oil your bike

740
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,440
and we would need to throw it away.

741
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,600
Everything in this world is related. Everything.

742
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,519
You - bastard!

743
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,799
Do you think you can do everything?

744
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,079
I don't understand what you are saying.

745
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,119
You don't understand?

746
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,839
Where did you lose your language skills?

747
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,519
Earlier you understood everything

748
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,639
what I told Amaya.

749
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,159
What I told was not truth at all.

750
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,239
Do you hear it?!

751
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,240
Calm down!

752
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,440
People must find a common language,

753
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,079
doesn't matter which one.

754
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,080
You are so angry...

755
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,599
Why did you pretend

756
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,600
when you understood all the time?

757
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,720
But nobody asked me if I spoke Cantonese.

758
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,560
How did you realize?

759
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,639
A friend warned me.

760
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,479
He told me that it happens sometimes.

761
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,480
Alright...

762
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,919
But how did you learn?

763
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,920
I just wanted to learn another language,

764
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,279
but when I was studying, my plans changed

765
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,280
and my life took another turn...

766
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,719
For woman?

767
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,479
I like Chinese poetry the most!

768
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,480
I remember one of my favorites:

769
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,280
I wake up with the sun up high.

770
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,839
Birds chirp everywhere in the sky.

771
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,840
Last night a rainstorm passed by.

772
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,960
Flowers must have fallen down - I sigh.

773
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,439
You know, I think I've heard

774
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,440
your voice somewhere before.

775
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,959
Where?

776
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,679
Here.In this room.

777
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,159
Shame on you!

778
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,439
How can you say such things?

779
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,639
Wasn't it you I talked to

780
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,919
when I first called to the saloon

781
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,920
asking about massage courses?

782
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,679
IsA maya all right?

783
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,879
Yes.

784
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,039
Is she really ok?

785
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,319
Sure.

786
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,279
Do not misunderstand me,

787
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,679
I just wanted to ask, just that.

788
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,679
Give me that light bulb....

789
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,680
But get me that towel first, see... there...

790
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,159
Good that we understand each other

791
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,160
from a halfword.

792
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,199
Yes, for brothers it is important

793
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,159
to understand each other.

794
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,079
Is Amaya coming home soon?

795
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,159
No. I allowed her to visit our son's house

796
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,599
to have some rest.

797
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,199
She has not been any further

798
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,719
than the noodle shop for last years.

799
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,079
That's why she did not come to work today.

800
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,719
How could she if she is gone,

801
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,720
think about it!

802
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,999
Perhaps you could screw in one of them, and...

803
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
No, I have the right one.

804
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,800
You see, there's a little dash, over the thread.

805
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,439
Only the light bulb which

806
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,440
has never been screwed in can look that way.

807
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,200
Through away the other.

808
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,399
Never mind. We'll turn on TV.

809
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,239
We'll watch it anyway,

810
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,919
it will be our light source.

811
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,239
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

812
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,240
No, two.

813
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,479
"Mom and Dad!

814
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,480
I love you very much. Your sailor."

815
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,959
Everything is shaking inside of me.

816
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,960
I feel like I won't survive.

817
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,439
I thought it wouldn't happen again,

818
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,440
but suddenly it's come back.

819
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,080
I was really scared of heights as a child...

820
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,479
I want to hear your voice.

821
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,719
I need to hear it.

822
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,720
Tell me anything, please.

823
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,520
I remember one evening in Bangkok two weeks ago,

824
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,599
it was a Monday as well.

825
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,479
I went out for a walk;

826
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,759
I like to walk in evenings, when it's not so hot.

827
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,760
You said you came from Taiwan.

828
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,679
Yeah, from Taiwan....

829
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,639
But before that I was in Singapore,

830
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,079
Kuala lumpura, and Bangkok.

831
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,599
I passed Wat Po, going down to the river

832
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,559
on a narrow street and saw the lights

833
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,759
swimming around the boats.

834
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,359
Carefree tourists were sitting

835
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,279
around the tables on deck,

836
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,199
while fragile girls with extremely long nails

837
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,200
danced among them. I could hear the music.

838
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,479
And when these boats passed each other,

839
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,480
their music mixed into a strange noise.

840
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,519
My eyes then slowly got used to the darkness.

841
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,239
And then I heard a child crying,

842
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,119
but I couldn't tell where it was coming from.

843
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,079
Then I noticed these cardboard boxes

844
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,359
by a nearby fence- it was a slum.

845
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,999
Its own little world where this kid

846
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,519
was crying just as loud as kids verywhere,

847
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,879
not knowing that nothing in life

848
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,839
will ever change. And then I understood

849
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,840
why children around the world cry the same way...

850
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,480
You didn't want a wedding...

851
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,439
I told you I wanted to be with you

852
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,959
and that we would be together,

853
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,679
I just needed time...

854
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,680
Hope is needed, not time...

855
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,679
When I saw you in the cafe, I was so excited.

856
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,279
That's what time can do. We talked and

857
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,359
I didn't feel any pain.

858
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,799
Like an old acquaintance with no real ties

859
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,599
to the past- someone I could easily meet

860
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,999
and talk to, before going on my way.

861
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,679
So I thought I could meet today

862
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,959
and nothing would happen.

863
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,879
Why did you come...?

864
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,079
I guess I just wanted to be sure...

865
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,719
I'm glad you came.

866
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,559
No! I shouldn't have tempted the past.

867
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,479
Too dangerous... I don't know how I will live now,

868
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,879
It feels like the last three years

869
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,119
have vanished. I feel just like

870
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,839
I did when you betrayed me,

871
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,840
the same sharp pain and despair... black despair...

872
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,719
The day when I accidentally found those letters...

873
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,719
for the last three years I've wondered

874
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,720
why that happened, why did I have to see them?

875
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,599
Sure, you can get mad at me

876
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,959
for looking at your private things.

877
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,159
Remember, you said

878
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,799
they weren't important to you.

879
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,839
So why did you keep them?

880
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,679
Why didn't you destroy them?

881
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,839
If you wanted to be with me...

882
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,359
Those letters from that woman...

883
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,959
Lori, please don't.

884
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,479
You were everything to me.

885
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,839
I didn't know how I would survive without you,

886
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,679
but I just couldn't do otherwise.

887
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,719
I left, but to not see you,

888
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,239
to not know where you were.

889
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,240
I loved you so much, you were to me...

890
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,519
Let's leave this place...

891
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,520
I don't want to go anywhere or see anything...

892
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,679
Take me away from here.

893
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,680
Don't leave me alone. Please.

894
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,240
Help me open this door!

895
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,080
If I tell you will you help me?

896
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,720
It doesn't work.

897
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,839
Batteries are dead.

898
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,840
But I can download pictures to my laptop.

899
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,319
Massage was wonderful. But I guess

900
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,320
I'm not the first woman who tell you that.

901
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,479
It doesn't look scary in this picture at all.

902
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,480
It's even beautiful.

903
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,120
Who is there?

904
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,079
Some Chinese woman. Maybe the maid.

905
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,039
Maybe she wanted to clean the room.

906
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,040
That early?

907
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,200
Lang! Hey, Lang!

908
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,359
It's so strange to see you here in this hotel.

909
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,799
Have you find a job already?

910
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,800
You... Why are you even thinking about it!?

911
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,999
I didn't say anything.

912
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,119
You ran from the office so quickly

913
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,759
and didn't even take your salary.

914
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,519
Why don't you come to the office tomorrow

915
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,519
or the day after and we'll sort something out.

916
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,520
No. Once I've quit, I won't go back.

917
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,760
Then I'll pay you now. Here.

918
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,600
It's two thousand dollars, isn't it? Take it.

919
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,479
I am sorry about the yesterday.

920
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,079
I'm glad that it's over.

921
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,719
Yes. I feel much better now.

922
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,199
Maybe I was wrong.

923
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,200
I would like to have a man like you around.

924
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,480
How can you talk like that?

925
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
With whom you've been last night?

926
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,639
I've secured everything.

927
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,439
You are fine with everything.

928
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,399
You have nothing to worry about.

929
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,400
All you need to do is be with me.

930
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,839
No, you listen!

931
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,399
You didn't listen last time

932
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,679
and she couldn't get out of bed!

933
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,999
You won't do it! Period!

934
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,439
You have no right to operate her

935
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,440
without her permission.And she says NO!

936
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,560
Pass the phone to her...

937
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,959
Mom, just say NO. He can't do anything.

938
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,039
Don't listen to them.

939
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,039
I promise to get you back on your feet.

940
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,039
I know how. I am your son

941
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,479
and there is no one more important to me...

942
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,480
Just hold on, ok? I love you.

943
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,359
Few days ago my mother's back constricted

944
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,360
and it won't ease up, it's probably hernia.

945
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,319
And she is in constant pain.

946
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,759
And what her doctor said?

947
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,639
The doctors say that

948
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,119
only an operation would help.

949
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,319
But I don't trust them.

950
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,599
When I was massaged,

951
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,799
every muscle in my body tingled then

952
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,359
and it filled me with energy.

953
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,799
I've been watching you

954
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,639
since the first day you come.

955
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,279
I ask myself one question -

956
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,079
why you come to our courses?

957
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,080
You've studied massage in India, in Thailand.

958
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,720
But you don't work for it. Just traveling.

959
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,480
No purpose. Maybe no woman can resist your massage?

960
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,399
Maybe. Until now.

961
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Until now? You mean something's changed now?

962
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,439
Yes, I do.

963
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,440
If you really think so, you have to go

964
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,199
to Beijing, to the massage hospital.

965
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,159
I learned there.

966
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,799
If you know what you are looking for,

967
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,639
you can find it there.

968
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,640
But only if you know what you are looking for.

969
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,599
Thank you so much. Now I can really get going.

970
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,919
I wish you to find yourself.

971
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,759
And I am absolutely sure

972
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,760
that you understand what I am saying.

973
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,759
Few minutes ago you were wondering

974
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,879
about the invisible life force or Qi?

975
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,879
In the first day I gave this lesson in Cantonese.

976
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,719
The first day when I got angry

977
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,879
and Jasmin offered to translate.

978
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,759
I saw your eyes, they looked at me

979
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,159
and your lips silently repeated the words.

980
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,759
Did you tell it to Jasmin?

981
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,679
Yes. I think if a person hides something

982
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,680
it's not right in regard to others.

983
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,999
Perhaps it's so.

984
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,999
I wish you always to be a man

985
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and behave the way you can respect yourself.

986
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,679
No, but I can send another.

987
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,759
I'm writing it down...

988
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,719
I know the address, how could I forget it?

989
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,720
We work together for three years.

990
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,280
Which room? Ok, wait.

991
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,720
Go there, tell at the reception that Tao sent you,

992
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,479
you will get a room card.

993
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,039
Call me when you come to the room,

994
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,479
I will know when you start.

995
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,679
When finished leave 100 in the reception
and bring the rest to me.

996
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,680
And remember- the longer you massage

997
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,999
the more you get.

998
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,359
Someone is coming?

999
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,360
Thanks a lot, bye.?

1000
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,680
There is nobody else, just you. I am so lucky.

1001
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,399
Today I want a full programme,

1002
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,400
the way you massage men?

1003
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,719
It is good that I met you.

1004
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,079
I want to tell you two things:

1005
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,239
first I want to give you back the money

1006
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,559
that you lent me, and...

1007
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,759
And second?

1008
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,919
You were pretending.

1009
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,319
You understood everything she said.

1010
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,999
Both of us,we have things we keep too ourselves.

1011
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,199
I wouldn't call it pretending ora secret.

1012
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,399
Life is too complicated

1013
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,839
to reveal everything at once.

1014
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,079
Some things have to be told and known.

1015
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,119
I would like to know

1016
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,399
at least one thing about you.

1017
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,999
You already know it.

1018
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,359
Yes. I think I do...

1019
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,360
So perhaps we can speak heart to heart.

1020
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,479
Each time when it rains

1021
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,919
changes happen in my life.

1022
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,919
It can be a light rain that leaves no mark,

1023
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,399
and in the morning people wouldn't even notice

1024
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,319
it's rained, but that rain brings changes-

1025
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,399
life changes.

1026
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,799
I noticed it when I was a child.

1027
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,159
I woke up one night after I heard

1028
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,559
rain hitting the window-sill.

1029
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,959
It wasn't a strong rain.

1030
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,439
It made only a light noise.

1031
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,639
But I had this strange feeling

1032
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,559
of emptiness inside. I walked to the corridor

1033
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,479
and saw the door to my parent's bedroom

1034
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,919
half open and a light on inside.

1035
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,639
And then I came closer and

1036
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,479
I saw my mother crying. I ran back to my room,

1037
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,959
hid under the sheets and cried, cried.

1038
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,999
I don't know why, but tears ran down my face

1039
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,799
just like rain drops on the window.

1040
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,639
I had this strange feeling and in the morning

1041
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,640
I found out that my father had left for good.

1042
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,999
Where are we going?

1043
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,399
I thought I was following you.

1044
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,400
I thought the same.

1045
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,039
If you can escort me

1046
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,040
then we have to go to the otherside.

1047
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,800
OK.

1048
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,840
It's much easier to survive pain when rains.

1049
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,759
It seems like the pain is washed away

1050
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,799
by rain-drops.

1051
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,800
The pitter-patter soothes your heart.

1052
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,320
Did it rain yesterday?

1053
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,399
For the past few days,

1054
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,400
it's rained almost every night.

1055
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,119
And several days ago I met the woman

1056
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,879
I parted from three years ago.

1057
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,879
And we experienced separation once more,

1058
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,880
but this time it was good for both of us.

1059
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,999
It's so strange.

1060
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
He spent almost 30 years in laundry.

1061
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,759
Peaceful work, no stress,

1062
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,079
and suddenly-death at the work place.

1063
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,080
Doctors said it was heart.

1064
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,720
Who is going to clean my clothes
 now?

1065
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,399
I left Hong Kong yesterday

1066
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,159
and wanted to see a small town

1067
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,039
and take a break after all the bustle

1068
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,040
of a big city. In three days I will continue

1069
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,520
my trip to Beijing. After that, home.

1070
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,440
Tell me something from your travels.

1071
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,120
Two years ago I was traveling in South America

1072
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,799
and came to Chile,

1073
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,719
to one town called Val Paraiso.

1074
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,999
I've always loved that feeling

1075
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,999
when you come into a hotel room

1076
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,599
for the first time and you open the curtains

1077
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,719
and you see the view. So in Val Paraiso,

1078
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,720
looking out my hotel window, I saw the view

1079
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,959
the entire town, not just town,

1080
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,960
but the roofs going down to the ocean.

1081
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,840
And on one of the roofs I saw the word Amaya.

1082
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,840
I read it to myself, then aloud - AM AYA...

1083
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,959
What a nice sound.

1084
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,759
I searched the web for the meaning of that word.

1085
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,999
And I found out that in Japanese characters,

1086
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
it means night rain. It's nice isn't it?

1087
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,039
What was there,

1088
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,040
under the roof with the title 'Amaya'?

1089
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,640
Simply a cafe.

1090
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,520
They served very nice coffee there...

1091
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,679
I have to give back the money.

1092
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,599
I won't take the money.

1093
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,279
Give it to Jasmin.

1094
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,280
She's a charming girl.

1095
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,919
I don't know how to tell you...

1096
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,599
Tell me what...?

1097
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,600
Do you know someone named Tao?

1098
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,279
Something's wrong?

1099
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,719
He called and asked me to tell you

1100
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,720
that your husband died.

1101
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,520
What...?

1102
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,640
You could come back to work, we miss you,

1103
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,679
things are not going well without you.
We are both alone.

1104
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,359
Perhaps it's wrong time and place...

1105
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,360
but maybe we could live together.

1106
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,760
You asked me why I lived

1107
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,040
all these years near you, didn't you?

1108
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,120
Yes, I did.

1109
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,879
This way I could see you at work,

1110
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,959
hear your steps in staircase,

1111
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,039
and to be nearby all the time.

1112
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,519
All these years from the day you came.

1113
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,479
I wanted you and Renshu live here.

1114
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,719
I ... loved you all those years,

1115
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,720
and I still love you.

1116
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,639
Spring departing--

1117
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,640
the birds cry out?
and the eyes of the fish are...

1118
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,359
I always forget that word.

1119
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,239
I remember the rest, but this one...

1120
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,159
It always gets lost.

1121
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,160
...are full of tears.

1122
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,559
Did you see a foreigner with
blond hair?

1123
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,959
He is...that tall...

1124
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,399
No...not really.

1125
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,999
Did you see a foreigner with blond hair?

1126
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
About that tall...

1127
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,399
I wake up with the sun up high.

1128
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,039
Birds chirp everywhere in the sky.

1129
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,759
Last night a rainstorm passed by.

1130
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,760
Flowers must have fallen down - I sigh.

1131
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,440
Paul!

1132
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,840
It's nice to see you here, but I have to go now.

1133
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,079
They told me at the massage parlor

1134
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,319
you were looking for me.

1135
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,039
I wanted to say goodbye.

1136
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,040
But you and Amaya had already left.

1137
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,480
You can do it now.

1138
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,840
Well, you can do it now.

1139
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:30,240
How did you knowI would be here?

1140
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,679
My parents live in this village,

1141
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,519
and so does Amaya's son...

1142
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,159
You must've overheard when

1143
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,879
I was talking with Amaya.

1144
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,880
But here, this place...

1145
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,639
Amaya came to me.She's leaving back

1146
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,559
to Hong Kong, and she told me you met and...

1147
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,560
OK... did she say anything else?

1148
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,160
No... well yes.She told me you talked.

1149
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
She told me about you... and about a night rain.

1150
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,880
I'm glad you came. I really wanted to see you!

1151
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,080
Me to!

1152
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,560
So goodbye then!

1153
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,560
See you Paul! Bye!

1154
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,680
You are a very beautiful woman.

1155
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,879
Know it, and be yourself.

1156
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,880
Do not care what others think.

1157
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,640
Paul!

1158
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,359
Hello, I'd like to get a massage.

1159
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,360
Yes, in m yroom. Is it possible?

1160
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,880
Sure, sure. How much?

1161
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,319
OK.Four hundred and if I change my mind

1162
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,079
then it's one hundred.

1163
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,879
No, no. I won't change my mind.

1164
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,880
All I need is a good massage. Right now.

1165
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,559
What is your name?

1166
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:02,560

1167
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,560
