2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,584

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:18,995
What about you?

Me too

6
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:30,004
lf your mom and Yoo-jin's dad are together

7
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,298
then you'll be brother and sister

00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:32,839
lt's a good thing too

9
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,041
Mom, is my dad...

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,339
...Yoo-jin's father?

11
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:49,713
Sorry, J un-sang

12
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,756
Let's get married today

13
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,819

00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:20,986
What about J un-sang?!

28
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:22,481
Sang-hyuk...

29
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,516

00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,902
J un-sang!

45
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:21,171
Sang-hyuk.

46
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,649
You thought you could get married
by yourselves like this?!

47
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:31,080
You two can' get married. You can't!

48
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,692
l'm going to stop you.

49
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,456
You two

50
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,898
can't get married!

51
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,294
J un-sang

52
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,945
ang-hyuk, what's wrong with you?

53
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:07,413
Let go of me!

J un-sang. J un-sang!

55
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,119
Sang-hyuk!

56
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:25,457
J un-sang!

57
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:37,298
What are you doing here?

58
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:41,408
Sang-hyuk

59
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,443
looked for you and Yoo-jin.

60
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,669
So l told him that you were here.
Didn't he come by?

61
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:45,937
J un-sang:...

62
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,948
Where's Yoo-jin?

63
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,279
Hey, Lee Min-hyung!

64
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,017
ls something wrong?

65
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,493
l though nobody knew...

66
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,623
What?

67
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,056
l really thought

68
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,160
nobody knew...

69
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:20,971
What's come over you now?

70
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,807
What is it now?

71
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:32,541
And why are you dressed like this?

72
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,818
Hey...

73
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,312
did Yoo-jin go with Sang-hyuk?

74
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,280
ls that it?

75
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,284
Where are you going?

76
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:23,745
What's wrong with you?

77
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:27,952
Why are you suddenly being like this?!

78
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:30,750
l don't want you to marry J un-sang!

79
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:36,830
l was going to let you go.

80
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,024
But l couldn't bear

81
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,464
the thought of you marrying J un-sang.

82
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,438
l shouldn't have let you go to
J un-sang in the first place!

83
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,641
Break up with J un-sang.

84
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:52,542
You know that

85
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,339
l can't do that.

86
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,077
l'm not asking you to come
back to me immediately.

87
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,484
J ust first, break up with him.

88
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,349
lt'll be hard for you at first

89
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,055
but you'll be OK in time.

90
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,625
You can go back to the time

91
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,250
when J un-sang came back into your life.

92
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,559
You can forget about everything

93
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,256
and start over.

94
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,291
l can't do that!

95
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:22,399
Why can't you?!

96
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,499
Everybody's against it!

97
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,360
un-sang's mother, and your mother, too!

98
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,369
You know that everybody opposes to
you two getting married!

99
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,967
Nobody's willing to give you their blessing!

100
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,131
Sang-hyuk

101
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,842
l don't care...

102
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:43,449
l don't care

103
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:46,377
if nobody gives us their blessing...

104
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:48,913
l won't feel sad

105
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,122
Even if everyone opposes...

106
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,187
lt's OK with me.

107
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,515
lt doesn't make me sad.

108
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,759
lf l just have J un-sang's love...

109
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:02,728
l don' need anybody else's blessing.
The two of us...

110
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,393
No, Yoo-jin.

111
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,635
You can't marry him!

112
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:18,064
Yoo-jin, no...

113
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,211
Sang-hyuk!

114
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:33,679
Why are you being like this!

115
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:34,982
You were the one who let her go.

116
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:37,219
You're the one who said that

117
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:38,551
you wished for her to be happy.

118
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:39,817
Jin-sook, hold still.

119
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,720
Why are you suddenly being like this?

120
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,232
You were all right up to now!

121
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,393
Why are you suddenly being like this?!

122
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,066
You guys believe in me, right?

123
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,333
You trust me, right?

124
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,705
Don't ask me anything.

125
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,042
Please, don't ask me anything

126
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,181
and just trust me.

127
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:13,578
Please...

128
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,378
Did you know?

129
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,950
How did you find out?

130
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:04,985
Did your father tell you?

131
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:09,753
Yes.

132
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:13,326
l see...

133
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,989
Everybody knew, huh?

134
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,296
You didn't...

135
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:28,037
You didn't tell Yoo-jin, did you?

136
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,278
No, l didn't.

137
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,780
l couldn't.

138
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:41,846
How could l tell her that...

139
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:51,818
How could l tell that to Yoo-jin?

140
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:57,430
What will you do now?

141
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,633
What shall l do now?

142
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:10,837
lf l asked you to overlook it...

143
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,171
lf l told you that

144
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:15,968
l wanted to run away with Yoo-jin...

145
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:22,379
What would you do?
Will you let me run away ith her?

146
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,146
J un-sang...

147
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:39,625
Hey...

148
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,527
You still haven't heard from J un-sang?

149
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:42,188
No.

150
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,459
l'm sure he went to meet Yoo-jin.

151
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,901
l didn't think

152
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,502
J un-sang meant it

153
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,103
when he asked Yoo-jin to get
married right away.

154
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,638
Yoo-jin said they were going to the cathedral,

155
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:54,564
so l thought they were going to pray.

156
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:55,868
ls there a problem between them?

157
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:57,274
lt's too dramatic.

158
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,469
Getting married all of a sudden like that.

159
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,773
Sang-hyuk's reaction, too.

160
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,913
Don't you find everything strange?

161
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,017
Yes.

162
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,115
Yoo-jin!

163
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,812
Mr. Kim and l were just talking about you.

164
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:12,922
We were so worried about you.

165
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:15,816
ls J un-sang here?

166
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:17,924
He won't answer his phone.

167
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,587
J un-sang?

168
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,692
Didn't he go to you? He went to Seoul.

169
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:25,427
Really?

170
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,135
OK, J ung-ah.

171
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:31,601
l'll call again later.

172
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,989
J un-sang.

173
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:00,885
J un-sang!

174
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,388
J un-sang...

175
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,600
Mr. Lee's not here right now.

176
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,402
He hasn't left a message either.

177
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:42,487
She's waiting outside

178
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,167
Hello.

179
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:58,329
What brings you here?

180
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,327
Do you know

181
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:03,430
where J un-sang is right now?

182
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,408
Do you know?

183
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:09,174
What do you mean?

184
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,369
J un-sang's not at his office or at the ski resort.

185
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,810
He's not at his house either.

186
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,075
l can't get in touch with him.

187
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,341
l think

188
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,883
You know, right?

189
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,447
You know where he is right now,

190
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,654
right?

191
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,487
Yoo-jin.

192
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,149
Are you still seeing J un-sang?

193
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,892
l take it that l made myself clear that

194
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,156
l'm opposed to your marriage.
l told that your mother, too...

195
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,729
l'm sorry.

196
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:42,095
l know that you're against it,

197
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:43,931
but...

198
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:49,804
We can't break up.

199
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,368
Didn't J un-sang tell you

200
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:55,011
why l'm against it?

201
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:05,287
l see. He didn't tell you, did he?

202
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,921
Go home.

203
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,352
l have nothing to say to you...

204
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,990
Mrs. Kang!

205
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:15,956
Please...

206
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,893
lf you know, please tell me...

207
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,522
Please tell me

208
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,763
where he is right now.

209
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,232
l don't know.

210
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,506
And l think it' best that
you don't try to find out either.

211
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,156
Who's my father?

212
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:48,067
ls my father J ung Hyun-soo?

213
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,861
ls my father

214
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,394
Yoo-jin's father?

215
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,747
Yoo-jin came to see me.

216
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,011
She was looking for you.

217
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:25,719
l know how hard

218
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,426
it must be for you.

219
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:32,894
You know?

220
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,401
l see. You knew.

221
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:46,534
J un-sang, l'm sorry...

222
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:54,682
Putting you through so much pain...

223
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,051
l

224
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,924
l...really

225
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:08,291
...really loved Yoo-jin's father.

226
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,662
When l brought you up

227
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:11,888
No matter what,

228
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:13,155
you were his son, and...

229
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:14,661
Stop it!

230
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:19,961
Break up.

231
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:22,630
Break up right now.

232
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:25,707
lt'll just get harder if you drag it on.

233
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:26,501
lt'll just ruin you and Yoo-jin

234
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,201
and cause you pain.

235
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:38,945
lf you can't, l'll tell her.

236
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:41,178
l'll tell her myself.

237
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,923
l'll tell her myself

238
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:47,954
why the two of you

239
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,458
can't married.

240
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,492
No!

241
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:51,692
l'm going to tell her!

242
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:53,155
No, you can't do that.

243
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:55,430
You musn't let Yoo-jin know.

244
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,327
Yoo-jin...

245
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:04,465
She won't be able to endure it.

246
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,896
Make up your mind.

247
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,267
Will you break up with her?

248
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,879
Or shall l go and tell her?

249
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,041
J un-sang.

250
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:27,249
J un-sang!

251
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,086
J un-sang...

252
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:35,958
l'll break up with her.

253
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:02,776
Where were you...

254
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,149
Yoo-jin...

255
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,216
Where were you!

256
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:08,581
Do you know how worried l was?

257
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:12,079
l'm sorry...

258
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:13,788
You wouldn't even answer your
phone...

259
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:15,992
Where were you?

260
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,324
Something came up.

261
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,957
What?

262
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,794
Oh, it's nothing...

263
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,164
lt's something

264
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:36,535
you can't tell me?

265
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:40,801
No, it's not that...

266
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:45,746
lt's just a bit complicated...

267
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,347
l too care of it.

268
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:51,480
Then

269
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:55,214
l don't have to worry anymore?

270
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:00,617
Yeah...You don't have to worry anymore.

271
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,694
OK...

272
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:14,101
Well, you're back now. l'm OK ...

273
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:16,764
l'm OK now...

274
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:44,754
Shall we go to the sea?

275
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:41,861
Now that l think about it,

276
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,267
it's the first time to the sea...

277
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:48,534
You've never been

278
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:50,668
to the sea before?

279
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:53,737
No...

280
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,076
lt's the first time to come to the sea with you.

281
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:01,418
So this is

282
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,487
our first trip to the sea together.

283
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:07,953
That's right...

284
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:11,283
This is our first trip to the sea together...

285
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:19,594
And...lt's also our last trip to the sea together.

286
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:25,235
l'm going to bid farewell to her here...

287
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:35,739
Don't cry my love

288
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:42,179
We have more time

289
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:50,918
J ust stay by me like this a little bit longer

290
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:56,586
So that l can remember

291
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:02,290
l know even if you don't say

292
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,425
We were like that all along

293
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:11,471
lf my love

294
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:20,373
is equivalent to your happiness

295
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:24,939
l won't hesitate to let you go

296
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:27,142
l promise

297
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,381
l'll be back some day...

298
00:25:32,457 --> 00:25:38,985
Promise that you'll be happy without me

299
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:42,152
The smell of the sea's nice...

300
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:44,424
The sky's so blue...

301
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:46,628
lt's nice, huh?

302
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:48,101
Yeah, it's nice.

303
00:25:50,537 --> 00:25:54,165
Do you know what that is?

304
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:57,499
An airplane.

305
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:00,271
You know, huh?

306
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:06,881
Seeing an airplane

307
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,952
makes me want to go far away...
You, too, right?

308
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:24,790
l know even if you don't say

309
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:31,001
We were like that all along

310
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:37,672
lf my love is equivalent

311
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:46,075
to your happiness

312
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:53,548
l won't hesitate to let you go

313
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:57,586
l promise

314
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:04,488
l'll be back some day

315
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:13,493
You'll be happy without me

316
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,324
You've cried for too long

317
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:23,807
l can't be by your side anymore

318
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,308
l'm sorry

319
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:33,380
l can't take care of you anymore

320
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:38,648
l have to let go of you once again

321
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:42,914
l met you again after losing so much

322
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:45,886
Now l have to send you away again

323
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,822
l promise...

324
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,758
J un-sang, J un-sang! Look at this.

325
00:27:51,196 --> 00:27:52,322
l gathered this much!

326
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:53,695
You're rich, huh?

327
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,099
lt's weird.

328
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,397
Why are there so many coins here?

329
00:27:58,535 --> 00:28:00,832
l guess people who visited here in
the summer lost a few coins.

330
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:04,070
Oh, l see!

331
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:12,077
One ice cream cone, two, three...

332
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:13,571
No!

333
00:28:13,746 --> 00:28:17,477
Give it to me.

334
00:28:18,684 --> 00:28:19,480
Give it back! Give it to me!

335
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:24,618
lt's winter here...

336
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:27,820
But these coins are from the summer...

337
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,249
What shall we do with it?

338
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:33,753
l don't know...

339
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:37,563
Shall we gather some more

340
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:39,962
and buy a yacht?

341
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,166
A yacht?

342
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:44,200
Yeah, a yacht...

343
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:51,103
And...

344
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:52,742
We can sail out into the sea...

345
00:28:54,677 --> 00:28:57,373
And never return.

346
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:00,013
l think

347
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:01,774
We'll return someday.

348
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:04,708
Time will pass...

349
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:09,112
And then the yacht will get old...
You'll get old...

350
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,682
And we'll be so tired that

351
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,451
we'll want to return...

352
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:17,391
Do you think so?

353
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:21,125
Wherever it is,

354
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,060
it's not good to go away too far.

355
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,862
l'll miss so many people.

356
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:30,701
My mom, Hee-jin, my friends...

357
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:32,735
l'l miss them so much that it'll hurt.

358
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,134
Yeah, you can't do that, right?

359
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:42,578
You'll miss too many people.

360
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,445
Right

361
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:55,983
Let's not hurt the people

362
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:59,084
that are precious to us.

363
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:16,071
Stay here.

364
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:17,903
OK? l'll be right back.

365
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:39,719
What about this?

366
00:30:41,894 --> 00:30:43,452
l thought about using you.

367
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:46,289
l thought that it'd be a good idea
to have music critics on the show.

368
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:49,991
We'll have you,

369
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:51,527
and have a different critic

370
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,267
every other day of the week

371
00:30:54,503 --> 00:30:56,402
from Monday to Saturday.

372
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:58,501
Carrying out a show

373
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,900
from a critic's perspective seemed
like a good idea.

374
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:03,771
Then who...?

375
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:06,479
We've already found one person...

376
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:09,277
Hello?

377
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:11,214
Do you have any recommendations?

378
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,579
And l think that we should carry out
the show a bit differently during the weekend...

379
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:16,178
You have a phone call.

380
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:17,551
Who?

381
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,346
Hello?

382
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:39,226
Hello?

383
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:43,431
San-hyuk.. lt's me...

384
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:45,900
Yes,

385
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:47,769
hi J un-sang...

386
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:51,577
Will you come here

387
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:54,546
tomorrow night?

388
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,351
Yes.. l'll do that...

389
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,446
l'm sorry to trouble you every time like this...

390
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,552
Are you OK?

391
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,082
Yeah, l'm OK...

392
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,688
Actually, no...

393
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:18,125
But l'll be OK...

394
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,296
Oh yeah, Sang-hyuk.

395
00:32:27,008 --> 00:32:28,599
Can l ask you a favor?

396
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:31,106
Of course.

397
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:35,380
What is it? Tell me.

398
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:40,844
l took some pictures

399
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,347
with Yoo-jin a few days ago...

400
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:46,515
l didn't think of it then...

401
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,887
l sent those pictures to Yoo-jin's house...

402
00:32:52,528 --> 00:32:54,461
They've probably arrived by now...

403
00:32:56,697 --> 00:32:58,325
Will you get rid of them

404
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,127
before Yoo-jin sees them?

405
00:33:01,935 --> 00:33:03,196
J un-sang...

406
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,930
l don't want to leave anything behind

407
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:08,737
that Yoo-jin can remember me by...

408
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:12,473
Please, do that for me.

409
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:18,579
OK, l will. l'll do that.

410
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:27,317
l'll see you tomorrow.

411
00:33:57,443 --> 00:33:58,603
What are you doing?

412
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,404
You waited for a long time, right?

413
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:03,675
Did you call someone?

414
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:07,777
Oh, yeah... To the office.

415
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,842
Where were you?

416
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:12,785
l went to buy something.

417
00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:14,850
With the coins you collected on the beach?

418
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,258
Look!

419
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,457
l bought it for you with the coins.

420
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:31,362
So that we'll have

421
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,861
something to remember our trip by.

422
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:37,836
Let's make a lot of memories here.

423
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:40,435
So that we'll have a lot to remember.
This much!

424
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:43,676
l don't want to leave anything behind that

425
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,747
Yoo-jin will remember me by...

426
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:49,841
lt's nice, huh?

427
00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:56,447
And...

428
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,022
This is my present to you!

429
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:04,358
What's this?

430
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:05,622
Turn it over.

431
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:19,165
ike you said, they flipped a coin like this

432
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:21,770
one to tell their future in the movies.
This is how you conquer your fate!

433
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:23,598
Flip it.

434
00:35:24,243 --> 00:35:26,107
You'll get the answer you want.

435
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:30,774
lt's simple

436
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,605
J ust need a little money

437
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:35,309
No matter what happen next

438
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:36,916
Fate is on our side now.

439
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:39,379
Right?

440
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:41,648
Yeah...

441
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,918
l have some left over.

442
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:50,960
Let's go and take pictures.

443
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:52,153
OK, let's go.

444
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:09,240
Let me take some of you.

445
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,473
You already took a lot of me.

446
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,076
What's better? This or this?

447
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:24,180
Come here!

448
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:26,490
One, two...

449
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:28,789
Smile.

450
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:33,521
You're more handsome when you smile.

451
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,800
Get ready.

452
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:50,474
Excuse us.

453
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:53,709
Excuse us.

454
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:59,111
Yes?

455
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,917
Do you have a room that we can use?

456
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:03,844
A room?

457
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:05,719
There aren't many people looking for
rooms these days

458
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,014
that l haven't cleaned up...

459
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:08,189
lt's OK.

460
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:10,918
How many rooms do you need?

461
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:15,329
Two...

462
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:17,860
One, please!

463
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:19,856
We're married.

464
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,289
l see...

465
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,762
Follow me.

466
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:27,369
lt's this room.

467
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,601
Won't it be too small?

468
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:32,871
lt's a bit cold.

469
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,643
lt'll start to get warm in a while.

470
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:40,071
Have a nice stay.

471
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:41,373
Thank you.

472
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:56,859
J un-sang.

473
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:01,152
To remember our first night together.

474
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,035
l'm just joking.

475
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:09,995
Get up...

476
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:22,679
lt's cleaner than l thought.

477
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:24,706
Me and my friends

478
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:26,946
went on a trip back in college and
we slept at a place like this.

479
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,741
There were about 20 people in one room then.

480
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:33,452
This is paradise

481
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:35,886
compared to then.

482
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:40,260
Oh, yeah!

483
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:45,296
l bought a toothbrush, too.

484
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,928
l bought one for you, too.

485
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:49,892
Where did l put it?

486
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:51,568
Here it is.

487
00:38:54,204 --> 00:38:55,466
Do you want to wash up first?

488
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:00,470
No.. Later...

489
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:04,070
Yeah?

490
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:13,578
Won't it be cold

491
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:15,946
in the morning?

492
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:26,586
Yoo-jin.

493
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:42,362
My memory,

494
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:48,268
l remember everything

495
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:55,575
l remember the smallest things

496
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:05,092
when l close my eyes

497
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:08,389
You're far away at a place

498
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:15,028
where l can't reach you

499
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:19,732
Not being able to tell you that

500
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:26,773
l love you that l'll wait for you

501
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:31,940
l really didn't know

502
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:38,146
l didn' t know that

503
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:44,720
l would get to meet you again like this

504
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:50,824
l'll tell you now that

505
00:40:52,295 --> 00:40:57,197
l still love you

506
00:40:58,032 --> 00:41:01,661
l wanna love you forever

507
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,670
Will you still come to me if it's not too late...

508
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:07,601
l'll be back in a while.

509
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:16,406
You are with me forever

510
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:46,993
J un-sang

511
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:50,733
l'm not afraid of anything.

512
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:53,475
Anything...

513
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,438
Nothing scares me.

514
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:59,106
As long as you're with me.

515
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:26,865
You're awake?

516
00:42:31,471 --> 00:42:32,802
What are we going to do today?

517
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:34,473
Get up quickly.

518
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:52,491
A pound of strawberries for just 1000 won.

519
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:53,856
What do you want to do?

520
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:55,791
What shall we do?

521
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:57,864
Tell me if everything

522
00:43:58,271 --> 00:43:59,101
that you want to do.

523
00:43:59,238 --> 00:44:00,263
l'll do anything you wish.

524
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:02,431
Anything?

525
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:03,771
Anything.

526
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,669
Come and get some strawberries..
3000 won for 2 pounds...

527
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:10,844
Why are you being so nice?

528
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:11,979
No special reason...

529
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:14,508
No special reason?
You're really acting strange.

530
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:16,949
lt's just for today

531
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,544
so tell me before l change my mind.

532
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,547
Really? So that's it, huh...

533
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:25,056
well, l can't let this opportunity slip away...

534
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:29,625
Hey! See the fish bread over there?

535
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:30,955
l want to eat that.

536
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:32,063
Can you buy for me?

537
00:44:32,898 --> 00:44:34,228
But we just ate!

538
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,099
Still, there's room for a fish.

539
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:38,867
OK.

540
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:44,801
Wait here.

541
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,470
Hurry up.

542
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:54,610
Ma'am, how much is it?

543
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:06,249
iss, l'm sorry, but will you carry
this for me?

544
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:09,291
My house is over there. lt's just so
heavy...

545
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Will you carry it for me?

546
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:12,387
Sure.

547
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:14,051
Thank you.

548
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:16,693
Thank you so much.

549
00:45:17,065 --> 00:45:18,725
1000 won for a pound of
strawberries.

550
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:18,287
Yoo-jin!

551
00:47:20,593 --> 00:47:21,490
J un-sang...

552
00:47:23,396 --> 00:47:25,362
What happened? lt's just so heavy...

553
00:47:26,832 --> 00:47:28,560
An old lady

554
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:29,893
asked me to carry her groceries for
her.

555
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:31,727
lt took longer than l thought.

556
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:33,633
You were gone when l came back.

557
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:34,797
You should've just waited for me there

558
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:36,165
if l wasn't there!

559
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:43,206
lt's OK...

560
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:45,266
You found me

561
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,545
didn't you?

562
00:47:50,116 --> 00:47:51,343
What if l'm not around...

563
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:54,649
hat if l'm not around to find you, then what?

564
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:00,618
Let's go.

565
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:39,877
You know what?

566
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:44,189
The day before,

567
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:47,449
a star fell off my necklace.

568
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:49,926
lt looked strong but it broke.

569
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,192
How come?

570
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,897
l think that's why

571
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,196
l got lost today.

572
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:13,442
l should go and repair it soon,

573
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,637
right?

574
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:25,446
oo-jin, can l have the necklace back?

575
00:49:27,657 --> 00:49:29,420
Why?

576
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,826
l'll go and repair it for you.

577
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:37,856
You will?

578
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:53,739
This is for you

579
00:49:57,179 --> 00:49:59,613
eturn it to me as soon as possible, OK?

580
00:50:01,282 --> 00:50:03,546
OK, l will.

581
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:19,827
Come

582
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:25,291
You know what,

583
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:27,362
we fought for the first time today.

584
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:31,134
We did?

585
00:50:34,442 --> 00:50:35,635
Yoo-jin,

586
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,534
l'm sorry l shouted at you before.

587
00:50:40,112 --> 00:50:44,105
lt's OK. lt was my fault.

588
00:50:44,482 --> 00:50:45,450
No, don't say that.

589
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:47,883
l'm sorry. l mean it...

590
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,587
You don't have to be sorry like that.

591
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,614
Still...

592
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:02,191
Then listen to my wish again tomorrow.

593
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:07,457
Don't you want to make it up to me?

594
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:10,825
lt's OK to fight from time to time.

595
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,270
l get to make a wish. lt's nice.

596
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,704
What shall l wish for this time?

597
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,265
un-sang, what shall we do tomorrow?

598
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:20,409
What shall we do?

599
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:21,974
Tomorrow...

600
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:29,213
Yoo-jin,

601
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:32,585
don' drift away when you're walking.

602
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:35,047
You get lost

603
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:36,678
because you drift away in other thoughts.

604
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:41,091
OK.

605
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:42,859
Don't get distracted

606
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:44,485
when you see something interesting in the street.

607
00:51:48,332 --> 00:51:49,696
And you know that

608
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,761
you're clumsy, right?

609
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,764
Remember the hard time we had

610
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:58,230
when you lost the blueprint at the
ski resort last time?

611
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,608
Be careful not to lose anything.

612
00:52:03,276 --> 00:52:04,436
Oh,

613
00:52:05,978 --> 00:52:07,070
and you

614
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:08,405
have to learn how to say no to others.

615
00:52:09,748 --> 00:52:11,442
Listening to every favor that
everyone asks of you

616
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:12,843
isn't always the best thing to do.

617
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:16,853
Sometimes you're being of more help

618
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:18,579
to the other person by saying no.

619
00:52:20,189 --> 00:52:21,486
Do you understand what l'm saying?

620
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:23,753
And you...

621
00:52:23,858 --> 00:52:24,950
Hey.

622
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,087
You're really acting strange.

623
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:31,387
You're acting like someone

624
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:32,999
who's going far away.

625
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:36,595
And!

626
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,032
Why do you keep on picking on my bad points.

627
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:39,929
Don't you have anything good to say about me?

628
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:42,102
Tell me my good sides.

629
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:49,141
You have none.

630
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:53,276
Really? l really have none, huh?

631
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,650
Really?

632
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:03,845
Yeah.

633
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:28,400
Yoo-jin...

634
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:37,340
l'm sorry...

635
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:59,425
Don't forget a thing.

636
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:03,292
Don't forget

637
00:54:03,902 --> 00:54:08,304
even if l'm not by your side

638
00:54:08,439 --> 00:54:11,772
Don't forget

639
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:16,401
My love

640
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:19,910
from the beginning to now

641
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,976
ls close by

642
00:54:25,052 --> 00:54:28,384
but far away

643
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:35,222
l'll take care of you

644
00:54:37,295 --> 00:54:40,888
Wherever you are

645
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:45,794
and whenever it is

646
00:54:46,435 --> 00:54:53,840
Wait for me

647
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:57,636
until l come to you...

648
00:54:57,776 --> 00:54:59,141
Wow! lt's heads!

649
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:01,977
lt means that we'll be together
forever and ever.

650
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:10,777
Even if l'm a bit late

651
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:16,955
Wait for me

652
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:22,256
until l come to you, until l do...

653
00:55:58,657 --> 00:56:03,991
l'll take care of you

654
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:12,534
Wherever you are

655
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:27,803
and whenever it is

656
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:34,381
Wait for me until l come to you

657
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:36,947
We'll go back to the time
when we first met...

658
00:57:08,911 --> 00:57:11,675
What are you doing here?

659
00:57:15,249 --> 00:57:16,374
Where's J un-sang?

660
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:18,713
Did you see J un-sang?

661
00:57:19,485 --> 00:57:20,453
Yoo-jin!

662
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,550
Where did J un-sang go?

663
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:22,677
Where is he?

664
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:27,086
J un-sang...

665
00:57:30,294 --> 00:57:31,591
left.

666
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:39,930
Don't lie.

667
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:45,799
Why?

668
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:47,770
Why would J un-sang leave?

669
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:50,470
J un-sang...

670
00:57:53,145 --> 00:57:54,270
lt's because of his mother...

671
00:57:56,414 --> 00:57:59,814
She won't allow it no matter what...

672
00:58:01,618 --> 00:58:05,383
She said she'd cut ties with him

673
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:07,251
if he married you...

674
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,254
He said

675
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:14,021
he couldn't hurt his mother anymore...

676
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:24,991
No, that's not possible...

677
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,902
lt's true...

678
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:33,709
That's why he said he had to leave you...

679
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:37,068
And...

680
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:40,947
He said he won't see you anymore...

681
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:45,984
He asked me to tell you that and left.

682
00:58:50,689 --> 00:58:52,212
That's not possible...

683
00:58:54,025 --> 00:58:55,424
That's not possible!

684
00:59:15,508 --> 00:59:16,804
Honey.

685
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,740
Did Sang-hyuk call?

686
00:59:21,012 --> 00:59:21,944
Why?

687
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:25,506
He didn' come in last night and hasn't called.

688
00:59:25,982 --> 00:59:27,813
l don' know why he's being like this these days.

689
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:30,510
Do you think

690
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:32,280
it's because of Yoo-jin?

691
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:34,718
What if he's seeing her again?

692
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,579
Nothing like that will happen.

693
00:59:38,025 --> 00:59:39,220
Don't worry.

694
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:43,528
Then do you know why he's acting like that?

695
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:46,261
Why on earth is he being like that?

696
00:59:47,966 --> 00:59:50,332
Tell Sang-hyuk that
l want to talk to him when he comes in.

697
00:59:54,938 --> 00:59:55,836
Gosh...

698
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:10,179
l remember the day

699
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:13,578
Hyun-soo got married.

700
01:00:16,254 --> 01:00:20,280
You tried to drown yourself

701
01:00:22,225 --> 01:00:23,691
right after he got married.

702
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:28,990
Do you remember that night?

703
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,432
You ran away from Choonchun

704
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:36,899
after that night.

705
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:42,133
So l thought that

706
01:00:44,676 --> 01:00:46,267
J un-sang was my son.

707
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:50,608
Why'd you bring up the past for?

708
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,675
l don't want to talk about it.

709
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:54,483
Were you already pregnant

710
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,213
with him then?

711
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:01,749
Jin-woo.

712
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,318
l thought that

713
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,585
you tried to kill yourself just

714
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:07,957
over the fact that Hyun-soo left you.

715
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:11,394
But that wasn't it, huh?

716
01:01:12,497 --> 01:01:15,897
ou were pregnant with J un-sang, weren't you?

717
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:19,935
That's why you tried to kill yourself.

718
01:01:24,073 --> 01:01:25,267
l realized that out

719
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:29,101
after meeting J un-sang a few days ago.

720
01:01:29,745 --> 01:01:31,177
Why didn't you tell me that

721
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,913
he was Hyun-soo's son?

722
01:01:46,324 --> 01:01:47,756
You loved Hyun-soo so much.

723
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:50,458
Why didn't you tell him?

724
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:57,989
You wanted to hold on to him.

725
01:02:00,035 --> 01:02:01,968
lf you told him that you were
pregnant with J un-sang,

726
01:02:04,037 --> 01:02:06,005
he wouldn't have left you.

727
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:13,173
Do you know what the difference
between you and Hyun-soo is?

728
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:18,671
lf you love someone,

729
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:22,812
you believe everything that person tells you.

730
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:28,950
You loved me,

731
01:02:30,124 --> 01:02:31,988
but Hyun-soo didn't.

732
01:02:34,026 --> 01:02:37,621
That's the difference between you and Hyun-soo.

733
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:46,665
Yes?

734
01:02:48,171 --> 01:02:49,934
You're home.

735
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:58,206
Since when did J un-sang know that

736
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:01,273
he' Yoo-jin's brother?

737
01:03:04,484 --> 01:03:05,609
He found out

738
01:03:06,518 --> 01:03:08,486
when his memory came back a while ago.

739
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,779
His memory?

740
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:15,491
Then he already knew

741
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,918
before the accident?

742
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:20,888
Yes.

743
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:24,893
How did he know?

744
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:26,327
Through who?

745
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:29,065
l'm sure

746
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:33,260
Mi-hee didn't tell him about his father.

747
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:39,040
l don't know.

748
01:03:45,315 --> 01:03:49,182
l'm not quite sure about that.

749
01:03:50,651 --> 01:03:52,050
The two of them...They've decided to break up.

750
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,248
l see...

751
01:03:58,592 --> 01:04:00,059
lt was so hard for them
to get back together again.

752
01:04:01,727 --> 01:04:03,318
lt'll be hard for them to accept the fac

753
01:04:03,995 --> 01:04:05,292
t they're brother and sister.
t they're brother and sister.

754
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,066
Even l can't believe it.

755
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:16,968
l feel so sorry for them.

756
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:24,742
l shouldn't have let Yoo-jin go.

757
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:27,542
Even if she didn't love me...

758
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:29,178
l shouldn't have let her go.

759
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,410
Then she wouldn't have had to go through this.

760
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:35,376
lt

761
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,250
would've just been me that she resented.

762
01:04:41,258 --> 01:04:42,725
l shouldn't have let her go.

763
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,589
l'll go to my room now.

764
01:04:56,537 --> 01:04:57,969
OK. Good night.

765
01:05:00,038 --> 01:05:00,902
Yes, good night.

766
01:05:03,707 --> 01:05:04,605
But...

767
01:05:05,709 --> 01:05:07,506
J un-sang and Yoo-jin...

768
01:05:09,813 --> 01:05:11,872
There should be an age difference...

769
01:05:13,516 --> 01:05:16,279
How are they in the same grade?

770
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:20,821
l'm not sure.

771
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,521
Anyway,

772
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:25,580
they're the same age.

773
01:05:26,892 --> 01:05:27,689
Their birthday is only

774
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:30,519
two months away from each other's, too.

775
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,263
The two of them have a lot in
common.

776
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:46,965
Father.

777
01:06:05,223 --> 01:06:06,211
Who is it?

778
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:13,856
Mother...

779
01:06:30,275 --> 01:06:33,640
Mother, have some tea...

780
01:06:38,715 --> 01:06:40,807
l'm not your mother anymore,

781
01:06:41,117 --> 01:06:42,276
isn't that so?

782
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:46,212
l'm sorry.

783
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:50,785
There's no reason for you to be sorry
about breaking up with Sang-hyuk.

784
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:53,458
l didn't come here because of that.

785
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,049
l don't care about that anymore,

786
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,558
but...

787
01:06:57,396 --> 01:06:59,419
Why are you still seeing Sang-hyuk?

788
01:07:00,398 --> 01:07:01,262
Mother.

789
01:07:01,999 --> 01:07:03,693
What does Sang-hyuk mean to you?

790
01:07:04,201 --> 01:07:06,464
ls he someone who's at your beck and call who
comes to you when you need help

791
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:07,933
and who you can brush aside when
you don't need him?

792
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:10,871
ls that what he is to you?

793
01:07:17,278 --> 01:07:19,769
l hear that you broke up with the guy

794
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,275
that l saw at the ski resort.

795
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:31,910
Well, l heard about your situation.

796
01:07:32,055 --> 01:07:33,682
l was surprised, too.

797
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:36,057
But l won't allow you to meet

798
01:07:36,191 --> 01:07:37,954
bSang-hyuk just ecause

799
01:07:38,093 --> 01:07:39,253
you're going through a hard time.

800
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:41,260
lt's over

801
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,319
between you and Sang-hyuk.

802
01:07:44,399 --> 01:07:45,865
Even if you were more than

803
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:48,691
ust brother and sister with J un-sang,

804
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:51,597
it's over between you and Sang-hyuk.

805
01:07:53,605 --> 01:07:58,735
other, what are you talking about?

806
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:00,241
l was shocked to hear that

807
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:02,811
J un-sang is your brother, too,

808
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,647
but it's your father

809
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:07,103
that you should resent.

810
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:09,513
Don't involve Sang-hyuk

811
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:11,919
in your problems...

812
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:13,178
Mom

813
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,853
What did you just say?

814
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:21,256
J un-sang and l are what?

815
01:08:23,161 --> 01:08:24,685
Will you...

816
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,963
Will you tell me once more?

817
01:08:29,766 --> 01:08:31,528
You didn't know?

818
01:08:33,102 --> 01:08:39,528
Mother...

819
01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:44,001
What... What did you just say?
