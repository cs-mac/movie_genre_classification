1
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:05,944
THAT MAN FROM RIO

2
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,190
Eight days of leave.

3
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,539
Yes, eight days.

4
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,599
12:00 o'clock break.
- Ooo

5
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:13,571
I'm starving.

6
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:18,840
Smell this cheese.
- Wonderful.

7
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:27,342
Professor! Professor!
- Yes?

8
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:30,575
A phone call for you.
- I'm not here.

9
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:32,690
They've robbed the museum!

10
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:35,804
What?

11
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:39,996
What? The museum?!
I'll come right away.

12
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,865
She didn't eat again.
- She didn't eat again.

13
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:59,914
See you later.
- Yes, adios Lebel.

14
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,744
Will you go out? - Of course.
- Yes, you have a girlfriend.

15
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:10,413
What if she has someone else?
- Impossible! If she has... than... And it's over!

16
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:16,959
Would you really hit a woman?
- Listen, my friend. Nobody is worthy of this.

17
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:20,783
In eight days on 14:40 train.

18
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,186
You bet! Don't be late.

19
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:26,260
Later, Lebel.
- See you, Dufourquet.

20
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,883
No one can enter.
- I'm Agnes de Villermosa.

21
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,273
That's all?
- Yes, I finished. Thank you.

22
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:45,898
There are no surface wounds.
I believe, it's a heart attack.

23
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:49,451
Poor man most likely died of fear.
- You must agree, Professor...

24
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,087
...that something here smells funny.

25
00:05:51,966 --> 00:06:01,267
He didn't touch the golden crown
or the necklace with rubies.

26
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:06,097
Most likely he's a crazy collector.
- The statuette is something really special.

27
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,929
It's priceless.
The civilization that made it has disappeared.

28
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,122
Disappeared? - The Maltek civilization.
- Maltek? And what has this to do with that? - Everything.

29
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,918
And who are the Malteks?

30
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:19,429
People of the Amazon rainforest, who were destroyed
by barbarians. - Barbarians?

31
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:22,702
Conquistadors. Europeans. You, me...
- Me?

32
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:30,127
Have you been there? In the rainforest?
- Yes, I will show you.

33
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:35,435
Photo taken three years ago.
On the day that the expedition ended.

34
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,192
Yes, I see you.

35
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:42,182
You're here.
- No, here.

36
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:48,847
And the other two?
- Villermosa, who died after we returned.

37
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:52,241
And Di Castro.
The Brazilian who financed the expedition.

38
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:00,264
Each one of you came back with your own doll,
and yours now got stolen.

39
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,500
Exactly.
- We won't get anywhere that way.

40
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:07,409
The Malteks were interested in secrets and hypnosis.

41
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,004
Do you know what was their best weapon?
- Swords, spears?

42
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,479
Poison.

43
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:17,588
That's nonsense.
- What if not all of them disappeared?

44
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:22,298
Yes... Indians dead for the last 300 years
came to Paris...

45
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:26,609
...only to steal a lousy piece of wood.
With the help of hypnosis. Obvious!

46
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,563
The statuettes are cursed.

47
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:34,633
I gave mine to the museum.
That's why they came here.

48
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,509
Villermosa kept his and died from a poisonous arrow.

49
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,460
Why didn't you tell me, Martin?
- But I did, three years ago.

50
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,173
Agnes, you came. - Of course.
- Whom do I have the honour...

51
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,082
The daughter of Mr. Villermose.
- I didn't know. But of course.

52
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,158
Excuse me, miss.

53
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:56,148
Do you know where is the statuette of your father?
- We never found it.

54
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:02,535
Father hid it before he died.
- Ah, I see. Thank you.

55
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:06,527
I will accompany the lady.
- I'll wait.

56
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,825
Look, I found something. An arrow.

57
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,378
Everyone ridiculed me and told me
that the Malteks have died.

58
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:24,170
Those morons think that I'm mad.
The rainforest swallowed the Malteks...

59
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,918
...submitted to green oblivion...
It's nice that you dropped by.

60
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:34,309
You always come if something goes wrong.
Thank you.

61
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:38,740
I would take such a little girl for a daughter at once.

62
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:44,608
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You always call me that way.

63
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:48,878
Only once every six months.
- Haven't I changed at all?

64
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:54,387
You've changed a lot. You are more...
- Feminine? Ha ha ha

65
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:58,458
Quite a little different, no?
- Yes, truly.

66
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,332
So?

67
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,329
I still age alone.

68
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:11,312
How is your aunt?
- Come for a visit, you'll find out.

69
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:13,108
Bye!

70
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:14,461
Why would they kidnap the professor?
- Because of the statuette, of course.

71
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:19,769
The story repeats itself.
- It interests me, what's with these statuettes.

72
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,440
They haven't found the statuette of Mr. Villermose?
- No. - No, no, no.

73
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,108
After the expedition my brother,
her father, hid the statuette.

74
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:33,621
After that, poor him...

75
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,138
Dreadful thing, madam.

76
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:39,888
Adrien! - Free for a whole week.
Did you get the postcard? Well, I'm here.

77
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:41,764
Greetings, auntie!

78
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,672
Whom do I have the honor...
- My pleasure. Well, until later.

79
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:50,227
We'll come back in a week.
Don't wait for me. - No.

80
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:53,020
Not now, the police is here.

81
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,458
Police?

82
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:03,439
You say that your father hid the statuette.
- Yes.

83
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:08,189
And Agnes knows where he hid it.
- At that time we lived in Rio...

84
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:12,620
She was only 14.
- He hid it at the top of the aviary.

85
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,570
An aviary in Brazil?
- I remember. At three in the afternoon everyone was sleeping.

86
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,878
I also went to take a rest...
when I saw from the window...

87
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:28,707
...how father dug a hole
and put the statuette in it.

88
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,654
He wore gloves and was all sweaty.

89
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:37,648
If we were to go there, I'd find it for sure.

90
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:47,946
Draw the location, I'll send it to the Brazilian police.
- I don't know exactly.

91
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:52,138
I would have to be there.
- Miss, your car is blocking the traffic.

92
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:55,730
My car? Let's see.

93
00:11:57,686 --> 00:12:01,638
It is blocking. I'll be there right away.
- You forgot about me?

94
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,271
I haven't forgotten about you, young man.
Come here.

95
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:10,499
Whom do I have the pleasure...
- Soldier Dufourquet, 3rd squadron.

96
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,292
A pilot, then. You don't look like one. A relative?
- No.

97
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:17,645
Fiance? - Not yet.
- What are you here for?

98
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:21,637
Agnes is a friend of mine.
- Oh, is she? - Yes, she is.

99
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,591
What are you saying?

100
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:32,574
Why did they kidnap the professor?
- The professor? Oh yes!

101
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,490
I'll tell you.

102
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:41,955
I kidnapped him.
- Listen. We'll be friends...

103
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,789
...if you don't make fun.
- Do you want details?

104
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:48,580
I stood at the window, the night was coming down...

105
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,690
...when two sinister men in black
stepped out of the car.

106
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:00,436
They walked slowly towards the professor,
reached him...

107
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:04,308
...and kidnapped him.
Shit! They kidnapped her!

108
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:23,867
Stop him!

109
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,440
Your ticket, please. - I must stop...
- You can get a ticket from the machine.

110
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,871
Get in line, like everyone else.

111
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:42,020
Agnes!

112
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,052
Thank you, sir.

113
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,804
General, general? Should I bring you a newspaper?

114
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,242
Yes, please, miss.

115
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:05,412
You didn't bring one miss?
Still, you are charming.

116
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:09,403
At your orders, general.
- At rest!

117
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,904
Like Charlesroi!

118
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:35,509
Sir, your boarding pass. You have to go there.

119
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:53,113
Agnes!
- You have to go there.

120
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:56,346
All passengers embarked.

121
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:07,563
Listen... - Sit down, sir.
- Listen to me me, please.

122
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:10,876
Please...
- Buckle up yourself. I will help you.

123
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:23,968
Dear passengers, welcome on the plane
to Rio de Janeiro.

124
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:24,967
Rio!

125
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:28,839
Can I help? - No.
- Do you need anything? - No.

126
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,112
You seat...
- It is here.

127
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,064
If Lebel could hear this!

128
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:01,970
Sir?
- I have to talk to the captain.

129
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,924
We can not disturb him.
- It's a serious matter.

130
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:06,640
They have kidnapped this girl.
- Which one?

131
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,991
The one who sits between those two men.
- Wait, please.

132
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:20,132
You passports, please. Thank you.

133
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:22,927
Thank you.

134
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,794
That's what the mister says.
- Do you know him?

135
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:36,977
No.
- Agnes, after everything...

136
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:40,290
Return to your seat. We do not want any problems.
- But Agnes...

137
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:45,798
I will notify the police in Rio.
They will put things in order.

138
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:49,871
I can explain...

139
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:46,628
Could you hold for a moment,
we need to check your passport?

140
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:02,719
You speak English? - No.
- French? - No.

141
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:07,988
Italian? - No.
- Only Portuguese? - Yes, yes. - Forget it.

142
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:25,906
This is Rio.

143
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:16,482
Americano? Liz Taylor, Cadillac,
Hollywood, Cape Canaveral.

144
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,999
I know all America.

145
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:21,950
Polish it well. And the other one.

146
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,782
Francaise? Tour Eiffel, de Gaule,

147
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:30,293
Brigitte Bardot... I know.
Five cruzeiros.

148
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:32,329
I don't have any.

149
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,226
Go your way.

150
00:24:58,274 --> 00:24:59,392
Fifty.

151
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:06,697
Here. - Thanks

152
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,053
What am I doing here?

153
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:18,034
What is your name?
- Sir Winston. - What?

154
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,668
Sir Winston.
- Bye Sir Winston.

155
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:26,177
Where are you going?
- I'm looking for a girl. - Girls!

156
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:27,255
I know where. Let's go.

157
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:32,444
No, my girl Agnes.
- Agnes? Is she pretty?

158
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:37,234
Lost in Rio. They kidnapped her
and I don't know where she is.

159
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:10,959
Wait.

160
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:47,564
Here, here!

161
00:28:20,455 --> 00:28:21,453
What's wrong?

162
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,524
Call the ambulance.

163
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,133
Hey. What's a matter with you?

164
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,597
Please mister, it's mine.
- Yes, yes.

165
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:55,182
If you don't mind, give it back. It's mine. Give it back!
- Stay away!

166
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,237
What did you see? - Let's go.

167
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:21,648
Miss Villermosa.
- She isn't here.

168
00:29:21,648 --> 00:29:24,122
A French woman, she came with two local losers.

169
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:30,389
Tell me only the number of her room.

170
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:37,934
I may not tell you this.
- Right, I'll find it out on my own.

171
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:41,686
If you insist, sir, we'll have to kick you out.

172
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:44,121
Don't worry, I'll still find her.

173
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:00,288
My dear!
- What?

174
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:05,796
Don't you remember me? - No.
So you know Pickwick?

175
00:30:05,796 --> 00:30:10,386
Of course I know this old saber.
After you, madam.

176
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:14,658
I'm glad that you like him.
- Yes, yes.

177
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:23,559
It is very kind of you.
- No problem.

178
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:30,664
Pickwick, now we'll have our nice
afternoon cup of tea.

179
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,259
What would he do without his tea.
You know how children are. - Yes.

180
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:38,049
We'll be delighted to see you again.
- Oh, thank you.

181
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:42,679
Goodbye, goodbye. - I hope to see you soon.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

182
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,751
Agnes, do you hear me? Wake up.
What have they done to you?

183
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:07,228
Wake up!
- What do you want?

184
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,927
Let's go, do you hear me?
- Stop shaking me!

185
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,122
These scumbags drugged her.

186
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:53,797
Look at me, Agnes.

187
00:32:58,348 --> 00:32:59,625
Get up.

188
00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:06,132
Smile, walk.

189
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:30,002
Agnes, go to the door and don't stop.

190
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,427
Where is she?
Where are you going?

191
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:02,934
Walk.

192
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,356
Goodbye.
- Let's go

193
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,867
Did you get the friends?

194
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,828
Wake up.

195
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:17,259
Wake up!

196
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:20,452
These lousy scumbags!

197
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,252
How pleasant.
And this looks like waves.

198
00:35:48,754 --> 00:35:49,832
Agnes!

199
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:52,706
Of course these are waves.
And this is a sea.

200
00:35:52,706 --> 00:35:59,691
Because we are in Rio.
- Rio?

201
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,722
Yes, Rio de Janeiro. Brazil.

202
00:36:03,722 --> 00:36:09,630
Do you understand?
- Brazil! Brazil.

203
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:24,400
Stop!
- Some man.

204
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,671
Don't you remember me?
- No. I don't care who you are, forget it.

205
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:31,186
Get yourself together. - You look handsome.
Something like this never happens.

206
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:35,417
She doesn't know me anymore.
- What a nice surprise.

207
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:45,636
Pleasant music, no one on the beach.
Thank you, handsome. - Stop it already.

208
00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:48,030
These scumbags!

209
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:57,251
What does he say?

210
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:05,314
We shouldn't sleep on the beach, we must go.

211
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:06,672
I'm sleepy.

212
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:11,981
We go to my house.

213
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:25,793
Come, sweetheart!

214
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,883
You live here?
- Yes. Come!

215
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:16,247
She is beautiful!
- Believe me, she's heavy.

216
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:19,042
Bring me pink sheets.
- Do you hear her?

217
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:22,834
She always wants
what I don't have.

218
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:26,626
If I say something
it's like talking to the wall.

219
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:28,223
She doesn't listen at all.

220
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,139
Woman means that she waits for you at home.

221
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:41,475
The woman is tender, understanding.
When you come home in the evening...

222
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:46,505
...you see her in the living room
playing the piano. Or the harp.

223
00:38:46,505 --> 00:38:51,734
Love at home for whom it has.
This water still doesn't know how to boil.

224
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:56,084
I'm chasing her around the world.
Is this normal? - I know. Scotch?

225
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:05,625
Chin, chin!

226
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:53,739
Where am I?
Adrien! What are you doing here?

227
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,374
Where am I? Agnes!

228
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:00,645
A... Agnes. Everything is alright.

229
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:03,639
Finally you are back to yourself. Look.

230
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:11,263
What is this? How beautiful.
- Rio.

231
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:15,255
Rio? - It's quite simple.
Yesterday I arrived with Lebel in Paris.

232
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:19,327
I went to your place...
- Dreadful!

233
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:24,835
Wonderful. - What will it be? Dreadful or wonderful?
- The ice cream is wonderful, what happened is dreadful.

234
00:40:24,835 --> 00:40:27,869
You are nailed. Better stop this.

235
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:29,825
Do you think that I'm having fun?
They can shoot me for this.

236
00:40:29,825 --> 00:40:32,699
You and your statuettes, Indians
and professor Batactan...

237
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:36,132
Catalan. Don't mix the poor man into this.
- Alright, why did they kidnap him.

238
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:39,924
And you... - They didn't dare?
- Don't get upset.

239
00:40:39,924 --> 00:40:45,472
There's more reasons to kidnap me.
Only I know where the statuette is hidden.

240
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:47,947
You aren't clear?
- So?

241
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:52,617
I plan to tell them where the statuette is.
They made a mistake.

242
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:55,252
Where are you going?
- Come, come!

243
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,567
Where?
- Just come along.

244
00:41:12,257 --> 00:41:14,252
We lived here with my father.

245
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:19,083
You don't like it.
- Yes, yes, beautiful. - Look!

246
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:23,154
The dog house.
What a sweetheart he was.

247
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:26,348
His name was Pilou.
Bernard, with a blind eye.

248
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:32,694
The chambermaid broke it with the broom.
- Beautiful...

249
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:36,926
How beautiful. - You didn't come to look around.
- You're right. Wait here.

250
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:55,128
I stood here when father came from the house.

251
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:56,645
Go to the end of the garden.

252
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:03,510
Further back. Go, go...

253
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:08,141
To the left.
You're clumsy.

254
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:14,368
Where are you? I don't see you.
- Here. - Further back.

255
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:25,904
Quickly, quickly!
Straight. Go! Stay!

256
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,690
That's good. I remember
that he stood here.

257
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:37,879
Where is the aviary?
- This all is an aviary.

258
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:43,667
At the time there weren't so many plants.
- This is life: from seed to plant.

259
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:50,693
Give me the shovel.
No, no, no, no.

260
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,528
Yes.
- Shovel.

261
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:07,018
Come on, I'm waiting!

262
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,099
Isn't it wonderful?

263
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:35,240
Run.

264
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:08,930
You asked for it!

265
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:32,521
Adrien! Help me!
Adrien, save me!

266
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:38,907
The statuette!

267
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,693
What's the problem?
- I'm warning you, don't point a gun at me.

268
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:49,646
Are you crazy? We need it.
- Adrien, what did I tell you? -  I'm going.

269
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:01,940
Why do the bad guys always win?
- They still don't know with whom they play.

270
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,257
There's a surprise waiting for them.

271
00:45:06,091 --> 00:45:08,806
Where did they go?
- You know, I can't tell you this.

272
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,520
Where did they go?
- I don't know, miss.

273
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,152
They have two statuettes. There's one left.
- Di Castro's.

274
00:45:15,152 --> 00:45:18,026
Is he from Rio?
- Yes, I think.

275
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:19,144
Most probably he's in the phone directory.

276
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:26,928
How do you spell it? - The way you pronounce it.
- As a member of the expedition he's next.

277
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:32,357
But I won't allow this.
- Stop talking and search. - Aha, di Castro.

278
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:38,743
Mr. di Castro is on the ship.

279
00:45:42,934 --> 00:45:46,886
There he is. - Easy.
- We must be fast.

280
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:49,122
We have to warn him.
- We have to get such a boat.

281
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:55,309
What if we are already too late?
What if they already killed him, stabbed him?

282
00:45:57,385 --> 00:46:00,778
The ship is his grave on the water.
- You're right, let's go.

283
00:46:00,778 --> 00:46:03,452
Damn! Only your mouth works.
- Watch your language.

284
00:46:03,452 --> 00:46:05,128
You're right, I'll go alone.

285
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,473
Wait! Are you crazy?

286
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:16,185
You'll attract attention.
- I'm not afraid of the water.

287
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:19,698
Did you learn to swim?
- No, why? - I will go.

288
00:46:19,698 --> 00:46:24,089
Don't worry.
Just don't move until I come back.

289
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:29,318
I'll be back right away.
- I'm not good enough anymore.

290
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:32,268
Is anyone here?

291
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:53,304
Hands up.
- I will explain...

292
00:49:10,463 --> 00:49:12,100
Towards the shore, darling.

293
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:36,724
I gave up my country, family,
army and friends, crossed the ocean...

294
00:50:36,724 --> 00:50:39,918
...so that I could see miss Agnes,
to kick the nosy pot lids.

295
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:40,915
Is this normal?

296
00:50:56,603 --> 00:51:02,870
Adrien, try it, it's not difficult.
- I'd rather die.

297
00:51:05,824 --> 00:51:10,974
You dared a lot to leave me alone.
Did you find di Castro?

298
00:51:10,974 --> 00:51:13,688
No.
- Wasn't he on the ship? - No.

299
00:51:13,688 --> 00:51:18,358
Is there something wrong? - No.
- You're angry, aren't you?

300
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:21,312
You have Rio at your feet.
You can manage alone quite well.

301
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:24,345
This is for you. Bye, darling.
In 4 days I have an appointment with Lebel...

302
00:51:24,345 --> 00:51:27,738
...at the station under the clock. It was nice.

303
00:51:28,457 --> 00:51:29,974
If I start something, I finish it.

304
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,884
The statuette! - Mr. di Castro.
- You know him?

305
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:36,759
I know him.
- Where is he?

306
00:51:38,436 --> 00:51:41,949
He went by plane?
- Where? - To Brasilia.

307
00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:45,501
Adrien, did you hear? He's in Brasilia.
We can still catch him.

308
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:51,130
Why not? It's not far, we'll get the subway.
Do you have a ticket? Here.

309
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,128
Smell it.

310
00:51:54,084 --> 00:51:59,992
If you loved me, you wouldn't make fun.
- I still haven't proven my love to you?

311
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,748
Words don't prove anything.

312
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:06,059
How far is Brasilia?
- Thousand, two thousand kilometers.

313
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,769
We'll need a car.
- I know. - Exactly!

314
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:15,120
You have to choose the color.
- Pink with small green stars.

315
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:24,780
Look at this little house! Butterflies!

316
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:33,043
What is this? Look.
- Pole. - No, that.

317
00:52:33,043 --> 00:52:34,361
Telegraph pole.

318
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,429
For all this you see poles.
- Leave me alone.

319
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:44,778
You are ridiculous. How could you be insensitive
to the beauty of the world?

320
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,808
Listen! A deserter in a stolen car
with a hysterical woman...

321
00:52:49,808 --> 00:52:53,121
...is a moron or a drug addict,
but is not insensitive. So what am I?

322
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:56,913
Let's go. - If I want to.
- I'll get out? - If you want to.

323
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,865
You always get what you want.

324
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:21,303
Pull!
- That's what I'm doing.

325
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:29,446
Where does it lock? - Find it out.
- Why should I be doing everything?

326
00:53:30,363 --> 00:53:33,118
Pay attention! Don't let it lose!
- But I hold it!

327
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:40,502
Get up, what are you doing?
- Yes, sergeant. At once, sergeant.

328
00:53:40,502 --> 00:53:44,295
On the floor! On your feet!
On the floor! On your feet!

329
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:54,473
How sweet you are in your underwear.
Angry?

330
00:53:55,192 --> 00:53:56,509
Answer me!

331
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:01,619
Come back!
This is the police.

332
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:12,317
Sir, could you, please, arrest me?
I deserted...

333
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:16,508
...lost my uniform and flew
with the stolen ticket of some invalid.

334
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:19,142
I fought with men
of all colors and nations...

335
00:54:19,142 --> 00:54:24,291
...and I drive around in a stolen
pink car with little green stars.

336
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:29,481
I'm also guilty of public indecency.

337
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:31,517
Sir, the handcuffs! Please.

338
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:36,028
Soldier Dufourquet, third squadron.
French air force. Do you understand?

339
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:40,977
No, eh?
Only Rio and Brasilia.

340
00:54:41,256 --> 00:54:45,647
Ah, Brasilia? 50 km.
- Too bad that I don't smuggle something.

341
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:04,448
Look!
- Yes, I know. Butterflies with ears.

342
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:09,038
Stop, the green car. It's the professor.
Stop, it's Catalan!

343
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:14,986
Who, Catalan?
- The professor is alive. We must save him.

344
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:15,985
Let's do it!

345
00:55:20,974 --> 00:55:22,132
Hold the steering wheel.

346
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:47,638
No! No! No!

347
00:55:48,796 --> 00:55:50,552
Quickly, so you don't end up there.

348
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:01,609
Professor!
- You'll hug him afterward.

349
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:06,000
Let's go, fast! Step on the gas.

350
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:21,871
Agnes! How come you are here?

351
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:26,501
They kidnapped me... and Adrien,
my fiance, saved me.

352
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,896
He has a leave.
- Keep your eyes on the road! - Thank you.

353
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:31,172
Don't mention it.
- What have they done to you?

354
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:36,081
First they kidnapped me.
- And we meet on the road to Brasilia.

355
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,752
Where are we going?
- To warn di Castro.

356
00:56:42,028 --> 00:56:43,186
- To warn him?

357
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:49,054
We must warn him before they get him.

358
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:54,603
I was afraid that they had killed you.
- No, no.

359
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:59,991
Only I know the secret of the statuettes.

360
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:04,822
Secret! I haven't come to play
cowboys and Indians.

361
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:07,775
I still have three days of leave left.
- Don't think only about yourself!

362
00:57:33,722 --> 00:57:39,389
Everywhere there'll be windows,
everywhere only glass.

363
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:44,100
So that it will be bright, full of glare
and transparent light.

364
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:49,808
Like a butterfly wing.
Such shall be the building.

365
00:57:49,808 --> 00:57:52,363
I insist.
Let's go!

366
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:02,302
Norbert!

367
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:16,912
Let's go to my place for a drink.
We'll talk there.

368
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:58,226
This is my hiding place.
Not at all.

369
00:58:58,226 --> 00:59:03,335
Ah, my fountains. Not really from Versailles,
but still cool. I hate these plants.

370
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:04,573
We'll throw them out!

371
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:10,201
No, no, no!
There won't be such crashing in my house.

372
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:11,878
Go!

373
00:59:14,991 --> 00:59:17,945
The statuette is safe.
This is the jewel in my collection...

374
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:20,979
...my most precious memory.

375
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:24,491
My youth.

376
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:28,762
And you? Still single?
You still wear a suit too small?

377
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,071
Do you like the new Brasilia?
- Very much. - And Brasilians?

378
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:39,620
How strong it is!
- I know her since she was in diapers.

379
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,252
Everything grows: the world grows
and shoots sprouts...

380
00:59:43,252 --> 00:59:49,439
...that grow like my city.
This was wilderness three years ago.

381
00:59:50,397 --> 00:59:53,112
Then some of us got together...

382
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:58,500
...and this is what happened.
- You are wonderful!

383
00:59:59,379 --> 01:00:02,892
Only you haven't changed, Norbert.

384
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:06,005
I followed your work about the Malteks.
Wonderful.

385
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:11,633
You are still such a dreamer, no?
- You don't believe me? - I'm a busy man...

386
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:17,581
...and I don't have time for daydreams.
But you aren't... - A loser?

387
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:23,569
Come on. You are wonderful!
- Mario, the statuette.

388
01:00:23,569 --> 01:00:25,205
We shouldn't bore the guests.
- They won't mind at all.

389
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,277
Would you like to see the statuette?
Here it is!

390
01:00:43,128 --> 01:00:46,601
Imitation.
- Bravo! The eyes of an expert.

391
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:51,471
It's fake.
I have a few of these.

392
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:56,660
The real one is hidden. - Where?
- Did you think in the living room?

393
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,572
Where so many people pass by?
- Good. And me?

394
01:01:00,572 --> 01:01:04,563
Is there a problem?
- Our friend is in an unusual situation.

395
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:08,356
He must be in Paris on Monday.
- Come, you have my word.

396
01:01:08,356 --> 01:01:09,353
I will arrange everything.

397
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:16,419
Tonight there will be a hydroplane
available to Mr. Catalan. - Tonight?!

398
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:17,457
Correct, in the morning before daybreak.

399
01:01:19,293 --> 01:01:24,602
Tonight you are my guests. - My leave...
- That's not important. I know that you are reasonable.

400
01:01:24,602 --> 01:01:27,516
I'll introduce to you my wife.
Norma!

401
01:01:28,634 --> 01:01:30,789
Friends from France.
We'll quickly prepare something...

402
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:35,340
...and have entertainment.

403
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:21,963
That's you!
- Unbeatable.

404
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:29,268
They call me so because I always win.

405
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:37,052
Cheers. Agnes, your eyes spill out.
- Spill out? - Full with anger and promises.

406
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:42,760
- Really?
- Your eyes are whispering, murmuring.

407
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,434
Stop throbbing! I hate noise.

408
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:49,466
Where did we stop?
- My eyes are spilling out.

409
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,338
You are frightening me.
- I hope, dear.

410
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:58,687
I took off.
The flames from the ship were high.

411
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:00,762
Suddenly I notice that I burn.
And I'm 5km above ground.

412
01:03:00,762 --> 01:03:03,716
It was just for laughter.

413
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:08,147
What is so funny?
- He's lying.

414
01:03:08,147 --> 01:03:12,418
Before the flight to Rio he still hadn't been in mid air.
- Just a second, girls.

415
01:03:12,418 --> 01:03:13,416
Just a second, girls.

416
01:03:15,212 --> 01:03:17,208
You're witty.
- Don't neglect me.

417
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:21,918
Be glad for what I still do for you?
- I'm not joking.

418
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:27,187
I think that I love you.
- There's really no dragon which I have to kill for you?

419
01:03:27,187 --> 01:03:31,738
It's over with the dragons.
- Whom do I shoot? Save? I can retire.

420
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:36,688
The slippers, mom!
- This will come. Kiss me.

421
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,805
Only if you'll be happy.

422
01:04:36,284 --> 01:04:41,154
Mario, show me the statuette.
- My friend...

423
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:47,021
...drink a bit. You didn't drink at all.
- No.

424
01:04:48,658 --> 01:04:50,774
Are you afraid that you'll be poisoned?

425
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:58,039
Like the father of Agnes.
- Why are you saying this? - You're nervous.

426
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:03,108
This is expected after all that happened.
- Is the statuette really safe?

427
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:06,700
Sure.
- I'd like to see it. - You're joking.

428
01:05:08,018 --> 01:05:09,774
You're right that you want reassurance.

429
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:16,041
As long as I guard it, it's not in any danger.

430
01:05:17,797 --> 01:05:19,873
Trust me. Come.

431
01:05:23,865 --> 01:05:26,619
Come on, come.

432
01:05:51,528 --> 01:05:53,962
After you.

433
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:08,851
Do you still believe in Maltek's treasure?
- More than anyone else.

434
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:12,404
And the answer is in the three statuettes?
- As if you didn't know.

435
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:39,228
Enter.

436
01:06:45,057 --> 01:06:49,687
Wonderful.
- I keep here the best pieces. My treasures.

437
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:50,685
And the statuette?

438
01:07:26,211 --> 01:07:27,408
So?

439
01:07:34,314 --> 01:07:34,952
Yes.

440
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:14,391
I waited three years for this.
Three years of preparations.

441
01:08:19,381 --> 01:08:25,607
You make fun of me
that I wear a suit too small.

442
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:31,715
But this loser will soon be
richer than you.

443
01:10:18,893 --> 01:10:20,449
Wait below.

444
01:10:27,874 --> 01:10:31,506
We lead! - You try.
- Are you having fun?

445
01:10:31,506 --> 01:10:34,181
Where were you?
- Here, Agnes.

446
01:10:43,801 --> 01:10:48,630
Where is di Castro?
- He left because he was tired.

447
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:52,063
I already said goodbye so we can go.

448
01:10:52,063 --> 01:10:55,735
No, as long as we're winning.
I missed!

449
01:10:55,735 --> 01:10:59,168
Forget about this stupid game.
I have to tell you something.

450
01:11:23,997 --> 01:11:27,829
20 points. - I tell you for the last time.
- I'll throw one more time...

451
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:30,224
...and then we'll go.
I promise.

452
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:37,968
It hurts!
- My patience has a limit.You won't play with me...

453
01:11:37,968 --> 01:11:41,162
...like with your own foolish lovers.
- Nobody complained. - How unfortunate!

454
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:46,989
You won't make a scene.
- It's your turn, Agnes.

455
01:11:46,989 --> 01:11:48,147
I'll do it.

456
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:04,313
Agnes!

457
01:12:11,938 --> 01:12:13,734
Wait, Adrien calls.

458
01:18:20,053 --> 01:18:23,127
Agnes, don't worry! I'm coming!

459
01:18:44,442 --> 01:18:49,313
A call for you. Mother is calling.

460
01:19:03,084 --> 01:19:07,155
Calm down, don't panic.
What's written in the book?

461
01:19:11,506 --> 01:19:15,019
Pull the control lever.
Slowly.

462
01:19:18,252 --> 01:19:19,969
Slowly, slowly.

463
01:20:58,523 --> 01:20:59,800
Agnes!

464
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,515
Everywhere there's only water.

465
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:54,941
Man would need a pontoon.
I'll jump.

466
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:16,417
No, that's not for me.
I thought it over.

467
01:22:36,215 --> 01:22:37,772
Now!

468
01:23:58,804 --> 01:24:00,759
I got him, the devil!

469
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:09,622
Also a Frenchman? It's a small world.
Where from?

470
01:24:09,622 --> 01:24:13,134
Besancon.
- And they say that we stay only at home.

471
01:24:13,134 --> 01:24:15,449
Where are we going?
- We're going to drink.

472
01:24:27,225 --> 01:24:28,582
More?
- Yes.

473
01:24:59,558 --> 01:25:04,826
You'll like it here. They have everything:
girls, drinks and music.

474
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:08,858
Paradise, my friend.
True paradise.

475
01:25:29,775 --> 01:25:31,891
Where are these two going?
- The gorillas? - Yes.

476
01:25:31,891 --> 01:25:37,080
They go to Loli, like everyone.
Come, I'll show you.

477
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:34,002
Do you like her?
This is Lola.

478
01:26:34,002 --> 01:26:38,113
In this golden throat there's a hidden character.
The girl rules the town.

479
01:26:38,113 --> 01:26:40,508
She has a business head.
Drink.

480
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,174
Listen.

481
01:27:05,217 --> 01:27:08,170
Calm down, drink something.

482
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:33,279
Good luck comes your way.
- With your help.

483
01:27:34,117 --> 01:27:37,949
Help is worthy of gold.
- He's very effective, right?

484
01:27:38,747 --> 01:27:43,058
I know how to choose men.
- The boat is wonderful.

485
01:27:43,817 --> 01:27:45,852
Give me money for the crew.

486
01:27:49,405 --> 01:27:53,796
Your fairy tale is very expensive to me.
- A few more days...

487
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:57,189
...and I'll repay you a thousand times.

488
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:05,770
I don't believe you any more.
Things I make for you.

489
01:28:07,767 --> 01:28:11,479
These statuettes are the key to the secret.

490
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:14,193
And only I discovered it.

491
01:28:17,267 --> 01:28:18,185
Look.

492
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:23,215
One...

493
01:28:28,404 --> 01:28:29,761
Two...

494
01:28:34,711 --> 01:28:35,549
Three.

495
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:48,562
The key is in the light.
Listen:

496
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:55,029
"At the source of the river, the sun melts the rocks".

497
01:28:56,066 --> 01:29:00,138
"And when you enter the holy pit,
the dead light will become alive".

498
01:29:00,816 --> 01:29:05,167
Diamonds, tons of diamonds.
The famous treasure of the Malteks.

499
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:08,480
Of course.
- You still don't believe me?

500
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:13,670
I know what it will be when you find the stones.
- I'll give you a half. - And Agnes?

501
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:17,861
What is she doing here? - Quiet!
- First you kill her father...

502
01:29:17,861 --> 01:29:23,809
...and then you show up with her.
- Only she knew where the statuette was.

503
01:29:23,809 --> 01:29:27,920
You needed her in Rio, not here.
- Enough! Don't mention her anymore.

504
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:31,832
Never!
- Alright, alright.

505
01:29:54,226 --> 01:29:56,500
He's here?
- What's wrong?

506
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,575
Some Parisian followed us.
- I'll arrange it.

507
01:30:08,037 --> 01:30:11,829
Is there anybody from Paris here?
- Me!

508
01:30:13,106 --> 01:30:14,783
You, right?
- Yes, madam.

509
01:30:14,783 --> 01:30:21,289
It's me.
- Come on, Chita!

510
01:30:46,197 --> 01:30:47,076
You hog!

511
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:23,121
You from the right, me from the left.

512
01:33:06,866 --> 01:33:08,302
Hey, Manuel!

513
01:33:16,605 --> 01:33:18,641
Could you help me? Thanks.

514
01:33:46,063 --> 01:33:48,418
Don't leave me alone!

515
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:54,709
Agnes!

516
01:35:35,148 --> 01:35:36,624
You are a monster!

517
01:35:36,665 --> 01:35:38,341
Do you really believe in this?

518
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,178
What do you think?

519
01:35:40,178 --> 01:35:41,694
I'm enchanted!

520
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:46,564
After the discovery, my work
became appreciated, it's fascinating!

521
01:35:46,564 --> 01:35:48,041
I needed a lot of time.

522
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:52,911
You don't believe in my secret
and you don't see these beauties.

523
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:56,185
Besides, you're still in love with this poor Adrien.

524
01:35:56,584 --> 01:36:00,256
Forget him. Come with me!

525
01:36:01,094 --> 01:36:04,088
Together we'll become right and enjoy glory!

526
01:36:05,605 --> 01:36:12,590
I had to use force, it came to that.

527
01:36:14,266 --> 01:36:17,859
What should I do with you?

528
01:36:18,778 --> 01:36:26,681
Could you tell me?
I don't know.

529
01:36:30,473 --> 01:36:34,145
Think about my proposal.

530
01:36:34,145 --> 01:36:36,859
See you tomorrow.

531
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,100
Adrien!

532
01:37:06,997 --> 01:37:09,751
I love you.
And do you?

533
01:37:17,216 --> 01:37:18,533
What me?

534
01:37:32,703 --> 01:37:37,893
We are going to the spring with the boat.
Two come with me, the others not.

535
01:40:47,539 --> 01:40:52,809
That's it. No doubt, we arrived.

536
01:40:53,966 --> 01:40:58,676
Wait. - I can't anymore.
- A few more minutes...

537
01:40:58,676 --> 01:41:00,313
...and this will be the end of my effort.

538
01:41:03,187 --> 01:41:08,176
2, 3, 4...
Here!

539
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:11,758
Where is Catalan?

540
01:46:41,521 --> 01:46:42,678
Agnes!

541
01:48:53,137 --> 01:48:56,689
Do they still shoot deserters?
- Because I still have two days.

542
01:48:56,689 --> 01:48:58,565
More than enough.

543
01:49:15,953 --> 01:49:19,785
Have you seen Lebel? - No.
- He'll be late.

544
01:49:23,217 --> 01:49:26,571
Run, run! Jump!

545
01:49:26,571 --> 01:49:30,682
Look, what... - Wait. I was running so fast!
Let me catch my breath.

546
01:49:30,682 --> 01:49:34,674
I brought you something. - Nice.
If you would know what I went through.

547
01:49:34,674 --> 01:49:39,863
What happened?
- I walked for three hours, three hours!

548
01:49:39,863 --> 01:49:42,936
From where?
- From home. I've crossed whole Paris.

549
01:49:43,695 --> 01:49:45,651
What an adventure.

550
01:49:53,266 --> 01:50:00,007
