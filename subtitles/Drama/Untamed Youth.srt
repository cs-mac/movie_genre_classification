THE BEST OF YOUTH
Act Two

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,419
And he spends the whole time
juggling.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,770
Standing on his head,
like this.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,615
TURIN
SUMMER OF 1982

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,538
And his feet against the wall.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,096
Then he stops and goes:

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,373
It's great.
Then when I meet him

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,095
I say "Hi, Mimmo."
And he hands me his foot.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,094
-And I go...
-Look, balloons!

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,494
I'll get you one.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,698
-What color do you want?
-Blue.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,413
Sure, that's your color.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,933
-One blue balloon.
-Sure.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,894
Well?

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,615
Are you happy
school's over?

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,175
No? But you're on vacation.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,210
Beach or mountains this year?

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,648
When will Mommy come back?

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,211
I don't know.
You know that.

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,973
Monica says

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,296
that means that Mommy's dead.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,649
What nonsense!

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,249
Don't listen to her.
That's absurd.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,499
If she's dead, tell me.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,372
Of course I'd tell you.

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,253
Why'd you let it go?

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,009
This way, if you lied,
it'll go to Mommy.

28

Her name's Sara as well.

90

Just from a distance.

91
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,378

-Looks like a henhouse.
-A pelican.

Look, a moose, with horns.
And that's a giraffe.

128
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,973
My favorite animal.

129
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,296
Why is it your favorite?

130
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,737
Because it uses its long neck
to eat the leaves off trees

131
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,499
and gaze at the sky.

132
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,573
I like animals

133
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,179
that gaze at the sky.

134
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,614
What's that?

135
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,614
-A manatee.
-It looks like a seal.

136
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,649
It looks like a seal,
but it's called

137
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,091
-a manatee.
-How do you know so much?

138
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,456
Because I read the signs.

139
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,771
Daddy, we won.

140
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,816
Yeah, we won.

FALL OF 1983

142
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,458
Good God, it's freezing!

143
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,776
And they say
it's sunny in Rome!

144

Where's the sun?
It's been days!

145

You don't have a motorcycle,
do you?

146
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,448
I don't like noise
in the patio.

147
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,614
The kitchen.

148
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,658
This is the living room.

149
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,292
Lots of light.
The furniture is new.

150
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,212
Look, over there...

151
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,854
the bedroom.

152
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,539
Perfect.

153
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,537
The TV is new,

154
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,219
the owners bought it.

155
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,537
Look, the movers,
poor lads,

156
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,617
they did four floors on foot

157
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,015
so I gave them
20,000 lira as a tip.

158
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,611
-Here.
-No, it's okay.

159
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,288
-At the end of the week.
-Fine.

160
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,811
Oh, the flowers!
The owner loves them.

161
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,732
They need watering
every day.

162
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,817
Unless it rains, of course.

163
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,294
-All right?
-Yeah.

164
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,138
If it's a bother,
I can do it.

165
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,252
No, it's no bother.
I'll do it.

166
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,016
Right, if you need anything
you can call me

167
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,972
or my husband.
We're downstairs.

168
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,852
All right, great.

169
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,974
Have a nice day.
I'll leave the keys here.

170
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,217
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

171
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,168
Everything okay,
princess?

172
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,416
<i>Give me your heart,
I want my love to explode...</i>

173
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,733
<i>I've dug a hole...</i>

174
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,296
<i>-A more sexual vitality.
-We are Mediterranean...</i>

175
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,252
<i>Latin, which means,
hot-blooded...</i>

176
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,736
<i>There's just one problem.</i>

177
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,812
<i>The new Secret Service
will handle it.</i>

178
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,129
Please.

179
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,853
Over here.

180
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,849
Hi.

181
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,976
<i>Tomorrow we start
the night shift.</i>

182
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,180
Two weeks,
then three days off.

183
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,852
<i>Then we get the day shift.</i>

184
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,495
That's the boss's office.

185
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,739
Watch out.

186
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,531
And that's yours.

187
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,210
This is the coffee machine.

188
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,693
And your desk.

189
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,456
Those are the guys
we're looking for.

190
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,533
Pretty much all of them.
The Reds and the blacks.

191
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,329
The ones we think
are in town.

192
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,098
What if we find this one?

193
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,009
What do we do?

194
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,733
It depends what she does.

195
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,578
If she reaches in her pocket,
we shoot.

196
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,935
I'd shoot even if she doesn't.

197
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,331
Just in case.
To make sure.

198
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,135
Dad, it's sticky!

199
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,296
Add flour and spread it.

200
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,899
<i>...her daughter,</i>

201
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,809
<i>who had heard shots,
and a few neighbors.</i>

202
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,937
<i>The judge was still breathing</i>

203
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,938
<i>but died on the way
to the hospital.</i>

204
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,496
There are bubbles forming.

205
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,250
<i>A reader called "La Stampa"
saying that the Red Brigades</i>

206
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,417
<i>had ordered him
to call the paper.</i>

207
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,373
<i>The Red Brigades sent another
letter claiming responsibility</i>

208
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,657
<i>to "ll corriere della Sera"
in Rome.</i>

209
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,170
<i>Judge Caccia was handling
several terrorism cases,</i>

210
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,571
<i>as well as cases related
to drug runners and the mafia.</i>

211
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,896
<i>The D.A. in Turin...</i>

212
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,935
Good morning.
Can I take this?

213
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,573
Good morning.

214
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,458
Is that you, Nicola?

215
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,414
The girl from Stromboli!

216
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,338
"The girl from Stromboli"
has a name.

217
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,690
Oh, right.

218
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,449
Don't tell me.

219
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,972
In the meantime
give me your ID

220
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,329
and I'll fill out a card.

221
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,490
<i>I left it at home.
Marcella.</i>

222
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,053
No, Mirella.

223
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,975
Oh, right.
Mirella, sorry.

224
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,408
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,090
I'll put it in my name.
Bring it back in two weeks.

226
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,539
-What if I steal it?
-I'll track you down.

227
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,731
Where do I live?
What's my last name?

228
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,132
I found you once,
I can do it again.

229
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,139
All right.

230
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,688
Are you here because of
that advice I gave you?

231
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,009
It was good advice.

232
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,812
It's a beautiful place.

233
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,092
It's lunchtime. You want to share
a sandwich and an apple?

234
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,290
I remember that day perfectly.

235
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,536
<i>I've dreamt of you often.</i>

236
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,615
Then I told my boyfriend
and he got all jealous.

237
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,539
I don't know why, he didn't
even know if you were real.

238
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,452
-Men are silly.
-That's true.

239
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,768
What about now?

240
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,614
If you tell him you saw me,
he'll kill you.

241
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,618
Yeah, he's the type.

242
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,378
<i>Actually, I left him.</i>

243
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,415
You want some?

244
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,008
You still take pictures?

245
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,773
Every once and a while.

246
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,490
You remember what you told me?

247
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,373
To look for the mystery?

248
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,051
I really liked that.

249
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,740
I've tried, to no avail.

250
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,613
I just can't capture
the person inside.

251
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,738
It's what you said.

252
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,610
Did I? I can't remember.

253
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,611
-You can't remember?
-No.

254
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,848
That's insane!
I had a nervous breakdown that day,

255
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,096
-and you can't remember.
-Apple.

256
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,008
Fine, I forgive you.

257
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,253
Only because you're handsome.

258
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,173
Don't forget the book.

259
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,498
Two weeks!

260
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,617
-Giovanna, hi.
-Hi.

261
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,094
Come in.

262
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,256
In there,
because back here...

263
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,130
How did you know where I live?

264
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,298
It was on the list
of new agents.

265
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,929
You didn't even give us
the address.

266
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,289
Have a seat.

267
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,777
I didn't know you were in Rome.

268
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,612
I got transferred
recently.

269
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,538
I'm living with Mom.

270
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,210
You've got so much space.

271
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,928
How is she?

272
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,573
How do you think?

273
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,098
You want something to drink?

274
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,332
Why didn't you tell us?
I found out by chance.

275
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,054
-You're like a stranger!
-I'll make coffee.

276
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,137
-I'm talking.
-No, you're blabbering

277
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,137
like a big sister.

278
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,974
You like playing Mother Superior,
but I have one of those.

279
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,818
Who you totally ignore.

280
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,773
What the hell do you know?

281
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,811
You're a judge,
you pass verdict!

282
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,579
<i>This isn't a courtroom!</i>

283
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,732
What did we do to you
to deserve this?

284
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,413
Giovanna, wait.

285
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,534
Giovanna!

286
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,693
Listen.

287
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,933
-Hi.
-Hi.

288
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,413
What's your name?

289
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,329
Matteo.

290
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,816
Matteo. Nice name.
Very pretty.

291
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,211
-And what's your name?
-Lolita.

292
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,810
-Where are you from?
-Venezuela.

293
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,014
What's the matter?

294
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,973
Are you sad?

295
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,853
What are you looking at?

296
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,340
-Your necklace.
-My necklace?

297
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,769
You like it?

298
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,575
Here.

299
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,099
For your girl.

300
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,975
I just don't feel up to it.

301
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,578
Maybe...

302
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,333
Maybe not.

303
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,818
The others are more decisive.

304
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,738
I'm so afraid.

305
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,297
Maybe I should...
I might not be ready for this.

306
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,653
I don't know...

307
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,298
Don't be afraid.

308
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,452
You'll be fine, you'll see.

309
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,089
Hello?

310
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,889
Hello?

311
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,935
<i>-Hello?
-Francesca.</i>

312
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,495
<i>-Listen to me.
-Okay.</i>

313
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,539
<i>I need to see you right away.</i>

314
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,337
In two hours,
at the Forum gardens.

315
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,333
<i>-Yes.
-You got it?</i>

316
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,934
Sara has grown.

317
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,418
<i>I would have brought a photo,
but I left in a hurry.</i>

318
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,492
I was so nervous.

319
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,649
Nicola said he took her
to the movies last week

320
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,010
and right in the middle
of the theater

321
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,296
she asked him
what menstruation was.

322
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,968
-What did he do?
-He explained it to her.

323
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,092
With everyone listening.

324
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,371
That's Nicola,
he can't tell the difference.

325
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,413
Young, old, crazy, sane,
he doesn't care.

326
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,009
Listen.

327
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,212
Tell Carlo to request a transfer,
to get out of Rome.

328
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,890
Actually, out of Italy.
As soon as possible.

329
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,972
Go where?

330
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,211
-How?
-Anywhere.

331
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,494
He's in danger.
Do you understand?

332
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,248
But we have small children.

333
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,658
The house, his job...

334
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,170
Besides, you know Carlo.
He won't leave.

335
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,859
-I have to go.
-No, wait, Giulia.

336
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,651
Wait, you listen to me.

337
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,010
I'll try to talk to Carlo,

338
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,099
to convince him,

339
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,412
but he'll say no.

340
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,532
He was a friend of yours before.
Save him.

341
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,253
Tell him they can't!

342
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,898
-I can't. Let me go.
-No, I won't.

343
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,978
Say he has no schedule,
that he's never alone...

344
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,056
Say he's too risky a target.

345
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,933
You have to save him, Giulia.

346
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,178
Swear that you will.

347
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,451
Do you trust me?

348
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,216
Yes. I do.

349
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,334
All right.

350
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,137
I'll try.

351
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,529
Nicola's coming to Rome
for Christmas, right?

352
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,168
Yeah, I think so.
At New Year's.

353
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,848
-For a few days.
-I want to see Sara.

354
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,972
-Just once.
-I dont know how...

355
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,616
Take her to the Coliseum.
I'll call you to say when.

356
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,969
Okay.

357
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,411
Don't tell anyone.

358
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,609
All right.

359
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,618
So what do you do?

360
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,373
-I'm an engineer.
-Well, well, an engineer!

361
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,173
Every mother's dream.

362
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,692
Maybe that's why I did it.

363
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,571
So you build dams,
bridges, buildings...

364
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,940
Yeah, I work abroad a lot.

365
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,577
<i>I have to travel often.</i>

366
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,533
-Don't you like traveling?
-No.

367
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,931
-What would you like to do?
-I don't know.

368
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,132
Maybe what you do.

369
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,532
-Be around books.
-Quit and come join me.

370
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,857
-You like chestnuts?
-A lot.

371
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,613
Give me some.

372
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,088
-How much?
-3,000.

373
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,938
That's robbery!

374
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,971
Go pick them yourself!

375
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,248
Rome!

376
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,691
-Here.
-Thanks.

377
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,538
You want to go somewhere?

378
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,014
Where?

379
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,456
Put two fingers in front,

380
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,218
raise the palm of your hand

381
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,376
and do like I do.

382
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,778
<i>Balance it and if you're
right-handed, left foot forward.</i>

383
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,254
-It looks easy.
-Sure.

384
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,973
-My turn.
-Yeah.

385
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,299
You have to use your fingers.

386
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,333
<i>-You can't otherwise.
-I have my own way.</i>

387
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,769
All right.

388
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,211
-It won't go straight like that.
-Wait.

389
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,892
Watch and learn.

390
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,495
<i>Too soft!</i>

391
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,689
Shut up!

392
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,613
Goal! Goal!

393
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,054
The word is "strike."

394
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,534
"Strike" !

395
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,333
-Get in.
-Thanks.

396
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,690
-You're soaked.
-That's okay.

397
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,460
-I have to make a call.
-Okay.

398
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,018
You're soaked.

399
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,694
I have to go.

400
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,130
I have to take a flight
in the morning.

401
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,900
-There's trouble at the site.
-How long?

402
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,898
Just a week.
I'll be back the 7th.

403
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,299
What are you doing the 7th?

404
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,738
Picking you up.

405
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,808
What time?

406
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,254
When the library closes.
Okay?

407
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,654
I found this under your seat.

408
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,048
I got it the other day

409
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,419
and I couldn't find it.

410
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,656
I don't know how it got there.

411
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,338
Is it for your girl?

412
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,969
It's for you.

413
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,779
Then put it on me.

414
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,052
<i>Relax, I'll do the shift.</i>

415
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,695
-Day and night?
-Yeah.

416
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,653
Day and night.

417
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,929
You're a pal.

418
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,728
Just as well this isn't the highway.
This car barely runs.

419
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,696
-When will you get a new one?
-A new one?

420
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,049
It runs great.

421
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,659
Dad, it's junk.

422
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,498
-It sucks.
-What do you mean?

423
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,975
This car runs great!

424
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,250
You should buy a new one.

425
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,053
My daughter's
turned into a consumer!

426
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,059
Are we poor?

427
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,454
Why, you need anything?

428
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,259
Too bad we missed Christmas.

429
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,214
<i>The gifts are at Christmas,
not New Year's.</i>

430
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,934
<i>Who says?
We do gift's at New Year's.</i>

431
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,852
Who'll be there?

432
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,819
Grandma, Aunt Giovanna...

433
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,410
-Francesca?
-Francesca, Carlo, the kids...

434
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,848
They had another baby.

435
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,175
Yeah? What's its name?

436
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,574
Asdrubale

437
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,931
-Teofrasto Calimaco.
-Calimaco?

438
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,859
-No, Nabucodonosor.
-Dad!

439
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,891
Don't pull my leg.

440
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,136
-Michele.
-Michele?

441
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,933
<i>"The trip started
on the right foot.</i>

442
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,335
The Spaniard
was an excellent ship,

443
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,135
behaving well
even in the middle of the ocean.

444
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,418
The crew were all
magnificent sailors.

445
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,455
The captain knew his job
to perfection

446
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,538
and everything seemed
to be going smoothly.

447
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,936
Until one night,

448
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,970
as he headed for his cabin,

449
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,093
Jim wanted an apple

450
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,969
and went looking in the barrel

451
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,020
where they kept the fruit."

452
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,650
-They'll never get to sleep.
-Who cares?

453
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,977
They're having fun
with their cousin from Turin.

454
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,659
-Maybe you are.
-Why?

455
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,136
-Because you have a girl.
-So?

456
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,339
We're just better,
that's all.

457
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,132
-Come on!
-It's true.

458
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,616
If you'd had a boy,
you'd be much wilder.

459
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,175
-Really?
-But she's settled you down.

460
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,976
-She's raising you well.
-Oh, right.

461
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,978
Grey hairs, eh?

462
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,978
Come on, just a couple.

463
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,133
The 40-year-old charm.

464
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,059
Hey, 37, not 40.

465
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,218
The successful older man.

466
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,214
Put your finger.

467
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,658
How do you manage with 3?

468
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,094
-Me with one...
-I'm exhausted.

469
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,415
But I like it.

470
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,929
Carlo has bodyguards?

471
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,055
What for?

472
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,452
In these times...

473
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,769
Nicola.

474
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,773
Nothing.
Michele's awake.

475
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,619
Open the door for Carlo.

476
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,416
Why the bodyguards?

477
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,938
"It is the winter
of our discontent."

478
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,176
"The bookkeeper
went up the stairs..."

479
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,416
"...where the guard
was waiting..."

480
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,338
"It's the mad doctor!"

481
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,737
-How are you?
-Fine, you?

482
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,290
My dream is a post
somewhere like

483
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,134
Denmark, Sweden, Holland...

484
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,290
Countries with shop windows.

485
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,414
The citizen walks by them
and looks inside.

486
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,172
My dream is to have
transparent banks,

487
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,369
a transparent stock market.

488
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,898
Politics, the economy...
Everything transparent.

489
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,773
So handsome...

490
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,739
I think he's asleep.

491
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,295
Maybe.

492
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,377
Not quite yet.

493
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,099
There.

494
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,737
-What's going on tonight?
-There's news.

495
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,609
I'm here, Sara...
New voives, strange faces...

496
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,418
<i>-Here, I'm an expert.
-No, he's asleep.</i>

497
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,735
He's asleep?

498
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,536
-Here.
-Careful...

499
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,093
Over here.

500
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,808
You see?
Watch the duck.

501
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,129
-Francesca?
-Asleep.

502
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,895
She's exhausted.
This time of year...

503
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,650
You were saying...
Transparency, right?

504
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,137
Nice idea,
but is it possible?

505
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,540
The others do it.
Why not us?

506
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,014
No, I mean Italians.

507
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,370
Do we like transparent things?

508
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,213
I think you're naive.

509
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,299
Ready for bed?

510
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,130
-To your crib.
-So I think...

511
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,008
Come on.

512
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,690
-Here we are.
-Don't whisper.

513
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,254
That wakes them.

514
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,610
Babies like sleeping
around noise.

515
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,608
Silence scares them.

516
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,334
There.

517
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,138
Don't worry,
he'll wake up in half an hour.

518
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,569
Gorgeous.

519
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,132
Beautiful boy.

520
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,493
What looks!

521
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,414
Bravo!

522
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,930
You're still great with kids.

523
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,216
-What about with women?
-The same.

524
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,968
-Seeing anyone?
-Nothing serious.

525
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,132
Nothing serious?
How many?

526
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,570
What an interrogation!
You're jealous.

527
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,298
Well, I'd better
come out with it.

528
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,698
I married your sister
just to be close to you.

529
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,932
I'll tell you something.

530
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,453
You have all the symptoms
of a real faggot.

531
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,260
-Why, don't you?
-Of course.

532
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,289
Listen...

533
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,451
Who do you go out with?

534
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,379
Nurses? Anesthesiologists?

535
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,252
What do you care?

536
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,457
-Where do you see them?
-Away from work.

537
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,254
-What does Sara say?
-She doesn't know.

538
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,972
And with so many,

539
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,257
you haven't found one that...?

540
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,052
Yes, I have.

541
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,090
But then things cooled off,
and nothing.

542
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,458
You didn't answer me before.

543
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,617
Why the bodyguards?

544
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,297
Have you talked to Francesca?

545
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,419
No, why?

546
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,972
You want some whisky?

547
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,608
Well, what?

548
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,772
I've been threatened.

549
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,417
That's why I have bodyguards.

550
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,739
Why did they threaten you?

551
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,972
It's not just judges,
politicians and cops anymore.

552
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,891
The other day a friend of mine
from university was shot.

553
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,295
They say:

554
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,331
<i>"Hurt one, enlighten 100."</i>

555
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,014
They want to educate us.

556
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,852
They just want to scare us.

557
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,053
And you need a bodyguard
just to go to the bathroom?

558
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,498
You see any options?

559
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,577
What about a transfer abroad?

560
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,179
I was offered a post
in New York.

561
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,569
Well?

562
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,453
Drink your whisky.

563
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,338
It tastes like malt.

564
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,337
Why don't you accept it?

565
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,491
Because that would mean
that they win.

566
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,090
How did you find out
you're in danger?

567
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,134
Giulia saw Francesca
recently.

568
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,337
Giulia came out of hiding.

569
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,689
She says she wants to see Sara.

570
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:29,374
DECEMBER 31ST, 1983

571
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,179
There's room.

572
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,938
-Take Francesca, I'll follow.
-Let's park.

573
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,258
Yeah, he works with me,
but only since a week ago.

574
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,132
Six months ago, in his bar

575
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,969
they arrested a guy just like him
with a bag of cocaine.

576
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,338
He'd brought it from home.

577
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,814
That doesn't concern me.

578
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,010
If they're wearing a jacket,
I let them in.

579
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,176
I don't care about the rest.

580
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,938
<i>Just no short sleeves.</i>

581
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,930
-He'd been arrested three times.
-So?

582
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,698
I don't ask for their records.

583
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,339
I respect the dignity
of my employees. I'm a democrat.

584
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,779
What about you?

585
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,133
Azim Mohammed.

586
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,850
Nothing.

587
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,689
It's late,
I'd like to go home for dinner.

588
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,495
-It's New Year's.
-What do I care?

589
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,971
-Somebody's looking for you.
-Who?

590
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,499
Mirella.

591
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,890
-Why did you lie to me?
-What are you doing here?

592
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,370
I want you to answer me.

593
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,372
Why didn't you say
your name was Matteo?

594
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,018
How did you find out?

595
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,780
The kid who checks ID
at the bowling alley.

596
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,538
He says you go a lot.

597
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,810
He said you were a cop.

598
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,450
I'm an investigator.

599
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,651
But everyone else
investigates me.

600
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,289
My sister, you...

601
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,249
Everyone sticks their noses
in my life.

602
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,769
What do you want?

603
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,373
Just to see you.

604
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,772
I thought we got along.

605
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,096
-So what?
-Nothing.

606
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,938
-Just that...
-What?

607
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,414
What?

608
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,576
-I have work to do.
-Why do you do this?

609
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,657
I'm on duty,
I haven't got time.

610
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,853
I don't understand.
I'm going crazy.

611
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,015
Why did you say all that stuff
in Sicely?

612
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,728
"What's your name?"
"Nicola."

613
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,931
-Why?
-We can talk if you want.

614
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,892
But not here or now.

615
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,013
Relax, I'm leaving.

616
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,892
-I won't bother you again.
-Good.

617
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,413
You like books because you can
close them whenever you want.

618
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,574
But in real life
it's not up to you.

619
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,528
You're wrong.

620
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,451
It's always been up to me.

621
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,136
It was up to me
to stop seeing you.

622
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,539
That's not a choice.

623
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,492
Don't you see?

624
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,616
I'm a scumbag. A loser.

625
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,048
You got it?

626
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,733
Will you leave now?

627
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,579
I don't think you are.

628
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,256
What the hell
do you want from me?

629
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,849
-Nicola...
-Matteo, my name is Matteo!

630
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,738
Go on, scram.
Go away.

631
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,175
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

632
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,052
we're playing
Merchant at the Fair.

633
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,091
-No, please!
-Yes, yes.

634
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,734
Come on, it's fun!

635
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,216
Don't be snobbish,
Merchant at the Fair.

636
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,052
-Who gets to be the Merchant?
-You do it.

637
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,534
<i>Someone impartial,
like a judge.</i>

638
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,492
-No, no.
-A judge, a judge!

639
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,169
It has to be a man.

640
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,577
I'm not a merchant.
Carlo would be better.

641
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,739
-Come on, Carlo!
-I'm not a merchant either.

642
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,408
<i>But I'm the most entertaining.</i>

643
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,456
Hand out the chips.

644
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,093
Read it

645
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,972
and if you agree,
sign it.

646
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,368
<i>You wait, my partner
will take you downstairs.</i>

647
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:37,378
Wait, we haven't finished.
Sit down.

648
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,419
Sit down!

649
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,337
How much is he paying you
to go to jail for him?

650
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,175
-What are you saying?
-How much?

651
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,371
-That's a serious accusation.
-Shut up,

652
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,140
-you piece of shit.
-I won't!

653
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,650
I want to see a lawyer!

654
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,494
Is he your supplier?

655
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,372
Is he?

656
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,979
Isn't he?

657
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,336
Where do you get money for this?

658
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,218
From him?
Tell me!

659
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,734
Is that it?

660
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,654
Is it?

661
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,216
Who the hell are you?
Jesus!

662
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,890
You can't screw me over.

663
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,689
You can't interrogate someone
like this.

664
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,257
-I want a lawyer.
-You'll remember tonight forever!

665
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,779
Lawyer my ass!

666
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,291
You won't get away with this.

667
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,615
You're in trouble.

668
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,896
I have a friend at City Hall.
He'll transfer you both...

669
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,810
I don't care.
I'll kick your ass!

670
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,419
-You don't know me!
-Calm down!

671
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,812
You can't do this to me.

672
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,928
What the fuck are you doing?

673
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,335
Are you crazy?
Get out of here.

674
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,179
You'll get me in trouble.

675
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,333
You got that?

676
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,371
He has nothing to do with it.

677
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,450
<i>Everyone ante up 500.</i>

678
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,616
It's almost midnight!
Come on!

679
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,094
I have a huge...

680
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,575
a huge stack of cards...

681
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,452
that even Agnelli would envy,

682
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,651
for the paltry sum of

683
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,498
<i>-1 ,500 lira.
-1 ,600!</i>

684
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,373
1 ,600 going once,
says the doctor, 1 ,600...

685
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,298
-2,000.
-Adriana, 2,000.

686
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,333
<i>-2,500.
-2,500, little Sara.</i>

687
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,699
-2,800.
-2,800, says Orlandino.

688
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,777
Who'll give you the money?
Me?

689
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,811
-Daddy will.
-Mommy will.

690
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,454
He's taken the cards
from Mr. Agnelli.

691
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,379
"On such a windy, rainy night...
who would call at such an hour?"

692
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,571
-Who could it be?
-Who?

693
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,729
Happy New Year, Mom.

694
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,336
I knew you'd come!

695
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,419
Come in, come in.

696
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,694
Merry Christmas!

697
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,491
-How are you?
-Fine, you?

698
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,490
Happy New Year.

699
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,936
-Hi.
-Welcome.

700
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,529
Hi, Carlo.

701
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,298
Wrong place.
This is no gambling den.

702
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,334
Little sister.

703
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,258
"The bedouin" and "the warrior."

704
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,252
Don't touch it,
it's your change.

705
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,372
-Where are the other two?
-Asleep.

706
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,735
What?

707
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,928
Take off you jacket.

708
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,691
-Sara!
-Hi!

709
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,253
-You remember me?
-You're the crazy driver.

710
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,658
And right here for

711
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,613
the crazy driver,
we have a nice little spot.

712
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,538
For the kind gentleman.

713
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,332
Two cards for you, sir.

714
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,691
Right, here I have a huge stack

715
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,415
<i>of cards...
He lifted his finger.</i>

716
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,656
<i>-Orlandino said...
-6,500!</i>

717
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,170
<i>-6,500... Orlandino!
-7,000.</i>

718
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:23,168
Don't go too high,
Sara won't have enough.

719
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,691
I'll finance Sara.
I can lend you

720
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,299
up to a million.

721
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,651
Okay, but I don't like these
under the counter loans.

722
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,249
-No loans allowed.
-10,000!

723
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,257
No, that's insider trading!

724
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,371
-8,300.
-8,300.

725
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,129
<i>Orlandino, that amount
is worthy of Uncle Scrooge.</i>

726
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,217
10,000 clears the field.

727
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,935
10,000 going once, going twice,
10,000 three times...

728
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,939
The card is...

729
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,257
The grape.
Who has the grape?

730
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,576
-Not me.
-Frances...

731
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,691
-He's asleep.
-And the others?

732
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,288
Sleeping as well.

733
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,933
Sara, you want to go to bed?

734
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,971
No, I'm a grown-up,
I want to win!

735
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,336
All right, all right.

736
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,050
I remind you
there's a grape out there.

737
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:16,253
And what would any Christmas be
without... the weaning child.

738
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,496
-Here.
-It was the last one.

739
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,138
Mom, I have to call the office.

740
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,659
Go in my room.

741
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,058
<i>-How many left?
-Nine cards.</i>

742
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,091
Hold on, one moment.

743
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,337
Everyone concentrate.
It's an animal.

744
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,850
<i>-Carlo.
-No, but it starts with...</i>

745
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,732
<i>-You go on.
-Start with the first syllable.</i>

746
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,212
-I'll be right back.
-Horse.

747
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,059
-No, it jumps.
-A goat.

748
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,776
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

749
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,291
You still have my notes?

750
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,172
Yes, ten, ten, ten!

751
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,254
<i>-You were so smart!
-So smart...</i>

752
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,295
-What should I do with this?
-Here, I'll put it in a drawer.

753
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,173
No, not in a drawer.
There are kids around.

754
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,573
I'll put it somewhere.

755
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,816
I'll leave you to make your call.

756
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,212
Listen, Mom...

757
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,573
I don't know if I can stay.
I have work...

758
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,095
That's all right.

759
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,689
<i>Just coming was already a gift.</i>

760
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,494
Shall I close it?

761
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,615
Yes, thanks.

762
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,932
We have here an animal.

763
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,139
And I'm very sorry,
so very sorry,

764
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,857
because Adriana
has the zebra.

765
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,019
<i>I'm not home,
please leave a message or...</i>

766
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,253
Hey, I'm hungry.
I'm going for something to eat.

767
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,859
Who'll watch your cards?

768
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,654
Go around
or you'll wake the kids.

769
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,009
Okay.

770
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,969
We have an animal...

771
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,778
that lives in water,

772
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,739
in water, lakes...

773
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,498
It's the swan.
The swan, the swan.

774
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,179
Hold on, Sara.

775
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,894
-Sara, the swan.
-No, dammit!

776
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,013
Relax, you're still in.
Two, two, two, one...

777
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,652
What, are you leaving?

778
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,296
-It's an emergency.
-Yeah, right.

779
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,934
<i>You want some turron?</i>

780
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,499
-Something sweet.
-No!

781
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,497
At least say goodbye to Mom.

782
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,098
-I don't have time.
-Come on, it's time.

783
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,214
-No. Are you staying in Rome?
-Yeah, a couple days.

784
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,899
-See you.
-Yeah. Call me.

785
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,010
You promise?

786
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,332
-Yeah.
-You sure?

787
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,089
What?

788
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,219
First prize is the cat!

789
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,615
You win! Very good!

790
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,219
What do you say?

791
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,296
Long live the Fair!

792
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,173
Long live the Fair,
Long live the Fair!

793
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,814

01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,771
the ambulance, the police...

810
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,131
A girl appeared,
a very pretty girl.

811
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,739
Brunette, dark eyes...

812
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,374
-I can't remember the eyes.
-It doesn't matter.

813
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,652
I'm only saying because
I'd never seen girls around.

814
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,976
Your brother never brought
women home.

815
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,250
I would always joke, I'd say:

816
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,974
"Such a good-looking man
with no lady friends?"

817
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,052
Go on, please.

818
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,730
So this girl suddenly appears

819
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,778
and she asked about
your brother.

820
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,615
I hardly had time to tell her
what had happened.

821
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,455
She didn't say a word.
She just ran off.

822
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,454
-Maybe you know her.
-No, I don't.

823
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,538
Such a good person!

824
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,537
Such a nice man!

825
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,255
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry.

826
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,008
Listen,

827
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,578
this might sound like
a crazy thing to say,

828
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:55,818
but I don't think your brother
jumped on his own.

829
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,494
-Someone...
-Don't be absurd!

830
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,168
-I'm sorry.
-Please, take her away.

831
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,052
Officer, take her away.

832
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,179
I'm sorry, Doctor.
We need to identify the body.

833
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,497
-Is your brother coming?
-No, I will.

834
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,371
-Are you sure?
-I'll go.

835
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,133
You stay with Mom.

836
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,135
-Okay.
-Please, stay with her.

837
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:20,695
Okay.

838
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,892
Mom, we have to go.

839
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,972
All these books...

840
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,251
Get some bags.

841
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,771
We'll take some books with us.

842
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,450
We can't take them now, Mom.

843
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:51,133
Maybe tomorrow.
I'll take care of it.

844
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,333
Just a few.

845
01:07:49,227 --> 01:07:50,057
Mom!

846
01:07:54,707 --> 01:07:59,337
Please! Calm down!
Calm down!

847
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:01,265
Mom!

848
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,062
That's enough.

849
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:09,821
Stop it.

850
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,784
Mom, calm down!

851
01:09:22,627 --> 01:09:24,697
<i>I should have noticed.</i>

852
01:09:27,347 --> 01:09:29,303
<i>I didn't realize.</i>

853
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:34,061
<i>Maybe I did see it coming,
but...</i>

854
01:09:38,347 --> 01:09:39,905
I'm eating with Guilia.

855
01:09:42,147 --> 01:09:43,978
I could have stopped it.

856
01:09:47,827 --> 01:09:49,783
At the door.

857
01:09:54,467 --> 01:09:56,617
He turned and looked at me.

858
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,860
And I...

859
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:03,145
closed the door

860
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:05,423
and nothing,
I erased it.

861
01:10:06,587 --> 01:10:08,782
Now there's nothing.

862
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:14,021
The staircase of his building,

863
01:10:14,227 --> 01:10:17,663
the sawdust on the ground,
the books, the lady downstairs...

864
01:10:20,627 --> 01:10:22,424
I should have stopped them.

865
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:30,303
I loved them both,
but...

866
01:10:33,547 --> 01:10:35,424
I wasn't able to

867
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,539
enclose them

868
01:10:39,747 --> 01:10:41,180
with my love.

869
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:43,503
It was my idea of freedom.

870
01:10:46,387 --> 01:10:49,299
I thought everyone had the right
to live as they pleased.

871
01:10:52,307 --> 01:10:54,298
But what freedom is there
in death?

872
01:10:59,987 --> 01:11:01,500
What happened?

873
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:06,017
Did it really happen?
Because I...

874
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:08,620
I don't believe it.

875
01:11:12,547 --> 01:11:14,617
I know it's real

876
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:18,619
when I look at Mom.

877
01:11:20,587 --> 01:11:22,703
Just as well you're here.

878
01:11:24,307 --> 01:11:26,980
Not for long.
I requested a transfer to Sicily.

879
01:11:27,187 --> 01:11:28,666
I leave in a month.

880
01:11:29,027 --> 01:11:30,301
Sicily?

881
01:11:30,747 --> 01:11:33,978
They need people.
No one wants to go.

882
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:41,183
You know, I still have

883
01:11:41,387 --> 01:11:44,618
<i>a postcard of yours from 1966
in Cape North.</i>

884
01:11:45,027 --> 01:11:47,177
<i>It was written in Norwegian,
I think.</i>

885
01:11:47,627 --> 01:11:50,346
And below the translation reads:

886
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:54,026
"Everything that exists
is beautiful."

887
01:11:54,507 --> 01:11:56,418
With three exclamation points.

888
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:59,419
Do you still believe that?

889
01:11:59,947 --> 01:12:02,415
Not in exclamation points
anymore.

890
01:12:05,107 --> 01:12:06,256
Listen, Giovanna.

891
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:10,061
Giulia's in Rome.

892
01:12:10,347 --> 01:12:11,985
I'll be seeing her tomorrow.

893
01:12:12,187 --> 01:12:15,463
She wants to see Sara.
She wants Francesca to take her.

894
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:18,745
But I decided to go myself.

895
01:12:18,947 --> 01:12:21,142
-I won't listen to this.
-I'll say it again.

896
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:24,863
-Giulia wants to see Sara.
-Would you shut up?

897
01:12:25,067 --> 01:12:26,386
Not this time!

898
01:12:26,587 --> 01:12:28,339
Tomorrow morning.

899
01:12:28,547 --> 01:12:31,778
-At the Coliseum at ten.
-What do you want me to do?

900
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:36,499
You think it's easy for me?

901
01:12:37,947 --> 01:12:39,665
To ask you to catch her

902
01:12:39,867 --> 01:12:41,664
and lock her up?

903
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:46,379
What do you think
I should do?

904
01:12:47,147 --> 01:12:49,138
Wait until someone gets killed?

905
01:12:51,107 --> 01:12:52,825
Wait till she gets killed?

906
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:12,901
Come on, let's go!

907
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:26,062
Dr. Carati? Excuse me.

908
01:14:26,747 --> 01:14:28,738
Giorgia wants to talk to you.

909
01:14:29,707 --> 01:14:31,857
No, tell her I can't.

910
01:14:33,627 --> 01:14:34,980
Francesca.

911
01:14:40,427 --> 01:14:41,860
All right, bring her out.

912
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,301
I'll wait here.

913
01:14:50,467 --> 01:14:51,900
How should I tell her?

914
01:14:54,427 --> 01:14:55,906
How?

915
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,376
Go on.

916
01:15:00,307 --> 01:15:01,626
Be strong.

917
01:15:51,507 --> 01:15:53,657
Giorgia,
I have something to tell you.

918
01:15:56,347 --> 01:15:57,621
Something bad

919
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:01,019
has happened.

920
01:16:03,347 --> 01:16:05,736
I had Giulia sent to prison.

921
01:16:07,147 --> 01:16:08,262
I'd thought that...

922
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:09,980
I think that

923
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,066
it's

924
01:16:12,987 --> 01:16:15,626
the best for her,
especially for her.

925
01:16:19,787 --> 01:16:21,300
This was

926
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:24,225
her choice, and I think...

927
01:16:27,107 --> 01:16:28,460
it's for the best.

928
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,623
There's something else

929
01:16:35,027 --> 01:16:36,585
I wanted to tell you.

930
01:16:50,787 --> 01:16:52,061
Matteo...

931
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:02,259
Matteo...

932
01:17:07,467 --> 01:17:09,219
Matteo...

933
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:15,946
Matteo!

934
01:17:26,907 --> 01:17:30,263
"I wander along the tracks
of the eternal void,

935
01:17:30,507 --> 01:17:32,657
fleeing from this fateful day

936
01:17:32,987 --> 01:17:37,026
leaving behind the hordes of care
that torment me.

937
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:39,464
And as I contemplate peace,

938
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:42,022
the warrior spirit
that roars within me sleeps."

939
01:17:42,587 --> 01:17:44,020
Shall I comment?

940
01:17:53,867 --> 01:17:54,982
Shall I comment?

941
01:18:01,187 --> 01:18:04,702
The sonnet "At dusk"
is an inspirational work

942
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:09,458
by Ugo Foscolo, containing
the wonderful onomatopoeia:

943
01:18:10,307 --> 01:18:12,775
"The warrior spirit
that roars within me."

944
01:18:13,387 --> 01:18:16,345
The onomatopoeia is contained
in the Italian "r" and "th" :

945
01:18:17,307 --> 01:18:19,901
"The warrior spirit
that roars within me."

946
01:18:20,787 --> 01:18:24,416
You can practically hear
the roaring soul of the poet.

947
01:18:47,747 --> 01:18:49,180
Sit down, Berardi.

948
01:18:53,147 --> 01:18:54,296
Sit down.

949
01:19:47,947 --> 01:19:49,300
Adriana?

950
01:19:57,267 --> 01:19:58,985
How are the kids doing
in French?

951
01:20:00,307 --> 01:20:01,376
Fine.

952
01:21:28,907 --> 01:21:32,900
-Your wife has been informed.
-We're not married.

953
01:21:34,267 --> 01:21:35,939
She refuses to see you.

954
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:37,819
Say that her daughter's here.

955
01:21:38,307 --> 01:21:41,026
Tell her I'm not leaving
until I see her.

956
01:21:41,227 --> 01:21:42,216
All right.

957
01:22:00,347 --> 01:22:02,019
Where's Sara?

958
01:22:03,707 --> 01:22:05,459
Outside with Giovanna.

959
01:22:06,507 --> 01:22:07,781
I'll bring her in.

960
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:10,704
First I need to talk to you.

961
01:22:13,827 --> 01:22:15,055
I won't leave you alone.

962
01:22:15,987 --> 01:22:18,820
-You're in here, but...
-I can't hear you.

963
01:22:23,427 --> 01:22:25,702
You remember right before
Sara was born?

964
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:27,784
The way we argued?

965
01:22:28,787 --> 01:22:31,426
We'd say:
"It's just a piece of paper."

966
01:22:33,347 --> 01:22:35,542
Well, I think
it's more than that.

967
01:22:36,467 --> 01:22:37,741
Giulia,

968
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,857
I want you to be my wife.

969
01:22:45,347 --> 01:22:46,541
You hear me?

970
01:22:48,147 --> 01:22:49,546
I want to marry you.

971
01:22:51,307 --> 01:22:52,581
Giulia, please.

972
01:22:54,507 --> 01:22:57,499
Marry me.
I'm proposing.

973
01:22:58,187 --> 01:22:59,256
Giulia!

974
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:01,505
Giulia, please!

975
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,066
Now you listen to me.

976
01:23:06,627 --> 01:23:08,265
Don't come here anymore.

977
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:10,025
Don't bring Sara.

978
01:23:10,227 --> 01:23:12,502
Don't write...
Just leave me alone.

979
01:23:12,707 --> 01:23:14,777
-Wait, I'll bring in Sara!
-I can't see her.

980
01:23:14,987 --> 01:23:16,978
-Of course you can!
-I don't want to!

981
01:23:17,187 --> 01:23:18,586
She wants to see you!

982
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:21,859
She can't remember your face.
She was four years old!

983
01:23:22,067 --> 01:23:23,739
You have to see her!

984
01:23:25,387 --> 01:23:28,060
Please, Giulia!
Please, please!

985
01:23:28,827 --> 01:23:30,340
-I can't...
-Yes, you can.

986
01:23:32,147 --> 01:23:34,183
You can, you can.

987
01:23:35,467 --> 01:23:36,695
Come on, Giulia.

988
01:23:37,867 --> 01:23:41,746
We'll wait a second.
She can't see you crying.

989
01:23:43,867 --> 01:23:44,902
All right?

990
01:24:04,467 --> 01:24:05,502
Thank you.

991
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:24,136
Sara!

992
01:24:26,427 --> 01:24:28,463
Sara, honey, look at me.

993
01:24:32,107 --> 01:24:34,382
How you've grown, Sara!

994
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:38,903
Look at me, sweetie.

995
01:24:44,947 --> 01:24:49,543
-Weren't you blond?
-I can be blond again.

996
01:25:05,227 --> 01:25:08,981
SPOLETO
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

997
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,985
Monfalco! You've got mail!

998
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,901
SPRING OF 1992

999
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:23,502
Monfalco, you've got mail.

1000
01:26:00,227 --> 01:26:01,455
<i>My love,</i>

1001
01:26:01,987 --> 01:26:04,342
<i>I'm sending you something
only you can read.</i>

1002
01:27:15,587 --> 01:27:16,702
Ma'am!

1003
01:27:21,867 --> 01:27:22,982
Ma'am!

1004
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:26,777
Return to sender.

1005
01:28:14,347 --> 01:28:15,780
Come on, Sara!

1006
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:21,300
Come on, Sara, let's go!

1007
01:28:22,027 --> 01:28:23,540
Ready!

1008
01:28:33,747 --> 01:28:34,896
Go.

1009
01:28:35,987 --> 01:28:37,181
Come on, Sara!

1010
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:02,346
You see this medal?
It's from a swimming

1011
01:29:02,547 --> 01:29:04,185
competition in 1964.

1012
01:29:04,947 --> 01:29:06,585
This way you have
at least one.

1013
01:29:06,787 --> 01:29:08,778
Are you kidding me?

1014
01:29:09,107 --> 01:29:11,621
I want my own.
I should have won.

1015
01:29:11,827 --> 01:29:14,341
I always beat her in practice.

1016
01:29:15,747 --> 01:29:17,021
Go on, eat.

1017
01:29:20,507 --> 01:29:22,065
I'm going to Milan tomorrow.

1018
01:29:22,267 --> 01:29:24,781
-Can you stay at Alessia's?
-To do what?

1019
01:29:24,987 --> 01:29:26,181
<i>To serve as an expert.</i>

1020
01:29:27,027 --> 01:29:28,858
A suicide attempt
in a prison.

1021
01:29:29,067 --> 01:29:32,104
-I've been named a judge.
-Who is it?

1022
01:29:32,547 --> 01:29:34,344
The manager of a public company.

1023
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:37,824
The defense requested
his release.

1024
01:29:38,067 --> 01:29:42,185
-They say he's going crazy inside.
-They steal and then they complain.

1025
01:29:44,227 --> 01:29:45,296
How do you know?

1026
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,659
He's where he belongs.
He should have been more careful.

1027
01:29:50,627 --> 01:29:53,187
-Why do you say that?
-People get into trouble

1028
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:54,979
and then we pay for it.

1029
01:30:01,027 --> 01:30:03,063
Why don't you ask me
what I'm thinking?

1030
01:30:03,707 --> 01:30:05,026
Because I know.

1031
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,659
I know when you think
of your mom.

1032
01:30:07,867 --> 01:30:11,018
Others without kids
can do whatever they want.

1033
01:30:11,547 --> 01:30:12,662
Not her.

1034
01:30:13,147 --> 01:30:15,138
I think your mom
knows that.

1035
01:30:15,867 --> 01:30:17,619
That's why she feels guilty.

1036
01:30:17,827 --> 01:30:19,465
She should.
She deserves it.

1037
01:30:19,667 --> 01:30:21,783
-She didn't kill anyone.
-Because you stopped her.

1038
01:30:39,347 --> 01:30:42,384
She won't see me.
She can't.

1039
01:30:43,107 --> 01:30:44,859
All right,
what do I care?

1040
01:30:45,267 --> 01:30:47,383
But what about you?
You write her

1041
01:30:47,627 --> 01:30:50,664
and she doesn't answer.
You visit her and she won't see you.

1042
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:52,744
You piss me off
more than she does.

1043
01:30:53,387 --> 01:30:56,060
-What should I do?
-Find someone else.

1044
01:30:56,507 --> 01:30:58,338
My friends are crazy about you.

1045
01:30:58,547 --> 01:31:00,742
Alessia, for example.
Don't you like her?

1046
01:31:00,947 --> 01:31:04,098
-What are you talking about?
-You have gotten older.

1047
01:31:04,307 --> 01:31:05,262
I have?

1048
01:31:05,467 --> 01:31:07,105
You've got a belly.

1049
01:31:07,307 --> 01:31:08,456
You should be careful.

1050
01:31:10,747 --> 01:31:12,624
Are you still in love with her?

1051
01:31:14,187 --> 01:31:15,620
I don't know.

1052
01:31:16,067 --> 01:31:18,979
I think you are.
I read your last letter...

1053
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:21,018
-You what?
-By accident.

1054
01:31:21,227 --> 01:31:22,421
It was on the table.

1055
01:31:22,787 --> 01:31:25,779
It's obvious
you still think about her.

1056
01:31:25,987 --> 01:31:28,057
-I don't want you to.
-If you don't mind,

1057
01:31:28,267 --> 01:31:30,303
I'd like to handle
my own affairs, all right?

1058
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:33,941
Fine, sorry.

1059
01:31:40,147 --> 01:31:42,502
Did we just have a fight?

1060
01:31:43,947 --> 01:31:45,539
No, we didn't.

1061
01:31:46,547 --> 01:31:48,458
You and I never fight.

1062
01:31:48,907 --> 01:31:50,181
No? Why's that?

1063
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:53,464
Because I love you too much.

1064
01:31:55,787 --> 01:31:57,459
<i>You don't tell me very often.</i>

1065
01:31:58,187 --> 01:31:59,905
There's a lot
I don't tell you.

1066
01:32:01,547 --> 01:32:03,060
For example?

1067
01:32:04,067 --> 01:32:06,183
I've decided to move to Rome.

1068
01:32:06,387 --> 01:32:07,979
With Francesca and Carlo.

1069
01:32:08,747 --> 01:32:10,226
I want to study Restoration.

1070
01:32:10,427 --> 01:32:12,338
You'd have to check
with them first.

1071
01:32:12,547 --> 01:32:13,696
It's already done.

1072
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:19,498
Would it upset you
if I leave?

1073
01:32:25,467 --> 01:32:28,743
I know, but I'm leaving anyway.

1074
01:32:43,227 --> 01:32:44,626
Idiot.

1075
01:32:58,987 --> 01:33:00,136
Tell me one thing.

1076
01:33:01,067 --> 01:33:03,297
You can't speak,
or you won't?

1077
01:33:09,867 --> 01:33:12,939
<i>I was summoned by the court.
Your lawyer approved.</i>

1078
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,697
Do you agree
with this decision?

1079
01:33:17,427 --> 01:33:19,019
Say yes or no.

1080
01:33:25,947 --> 01:33:27,175
I know you have a daughter.

1081
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:29,816
So do I.

1082
01:33:31,547 --> 01:33:34,744
With kids, the shame of
being in prison is unbearable.

1083
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:40,377
But our kids are much stronger
than we are, much more alive.

1084
01:33:40,587 --> 01:33:42,339
They have too much to discover

1085
01:33:42,587 --> 01:33:45,465
<i>to be torn apart
by what their fathers do.</i>

1086
01:33:47,347 --> 01:33:48,621
Or mothers.

1087
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:52,822
Are you here to decide
if I'm nuts?

1088
01:33:53,787 --> 01:33:56,255
Let's just say your lawyer
wouldn't mind at all.

1089
01:33:59,067 --> 01:34:01,183
My wife and daughter
don't know the truth.

1090
01:34:02,867 --> 01:34:05,097
Until yesterday,
I didn't either.

1091
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:08,105
You didn't know
you'd committed a crime?

1092
01:34:08,307 --> 01:34:10,582
You work in a hospital,
right?

1093
01:34:12,347 --> 01:34:14,986
There must be companies there
paying commissions.

1094
01:34:15,427 --> 01:34:17,463
Normally five or ten percent.

1095
01:34:18,427 --> 01:34:20,782
Is it possible
you never noticed?

1096
01:34:22,707 --> 01:34:25,585
Or it occured to you,

1097
01:34:25,787 --> 01:34:29,302
but you looked the other way,
like millions of Italians.

1098
01:34:31,387 --> 01:34:33,264
Then one day a judge appears.

1099
01:34:33,707 --> 01:34:35,902
And says the commissions
aren't commissions anymore.

1100
01:34:36,107 --> 01:34:37,586
Now they're called bribes.

1101
01:34:38,387 --> 01:34:41,265
<i>And that financing political
parties is illegal.</i>

1102
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:44,095
That I'm a thief.

1103
01:34:44,627 --> 01:34:45,946
Now that's news!

1104
01:34:47,147 --> 01:34:48,500
Prison isn't just for

1105
01:34:48,707 --> 01:34:51,426
poor people stealing apples
anymore.

1106
01:34:52,507 --> 01:34:54,737
Now there's real justice.

1107
01:34:55,707 --> 01:34:58,744
They forget that
they were lining up to pay.

1108
01:34:59,147 --> 01:35:01,820
Buying favors,
pulling strings, eliminating

1109
01:35:02,027 --> 01:35:03,096
competition.

1110
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:06,216
Now they want to change
the world.

1111
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:07,820
Believe me, doctor.

1112
01:35:09,347 --> 01:35:11,303
Nothing has changed.

1113
01:35:12,347 --> 01:35:13,860
It's all a lie.

1114
01:35:14,827 --> 01:35:16,385
They only lock up
idiots like me

1115
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:18,225
who get caught.

1116
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:20,026
But the others,
and there are plenty...

1117
01:35:20,227 --> 01:35:22,980
<i>keep doing the same:
stealing comfortably.</i>

1118
01:35:26,227 --> 01:35:27,546
It's Italy.

1119
01:35:28,587 --> 01:35:31,147
I didn't make it.
And neither did you.

1120
01:35:33,387 --> 01:35:36,538
It's the Italy our fathers created,
believe me.

1121
01:35:40,507 --> 01:35:42,179
No, not my father.

1122
01:35:43,267 --> 01:35:44,620
Believe me.

1123
01:35:46,387 --> 01:35:48,696
Your father was a good person.

1124
01:35:51,387 --> 01:35:54,026
And you like being one, too,
right?

1125
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:25,259
-Have you got a catalogue?
-Sure.

1126
01:38:26,707 --> 01:38:27,742
Here.

1127
01:38:27,947 --> 01:38:29,016
Thank you.

1128
01:38:32,227 --> 01:38:35,105
-Are the photos for sale?
-Yes, most of them.

1129
01:38:35,907 --> 01:38:38,137
-"Most"?
-Well...

1130
01:38:39,267 --> 01:38:41,223
The one from the billboard isn't.

1131
01:38:48,787 --> 01:38:50,015
Where was this?

1132
01:38:51,867 --> 01:38:53,459
What was he doing?

1133
01:38:54,787 --> 01:38:55,856
Have you asked?

1134
01:38:58,947 --> 01:39:00,903
No, the person who took it
wasn't there.

1135
01:39:03,547 --> 01:39:05,458
Here's the name.
It's a woman.

1136
01:39:06,027 --> 01:39:08,461
Look... Mirella Uta.

1137
01:39:14,147 --> 01:39:15,546
Maybe it was for her.

1138
01:39:18,227 --> 01:39:19,342
What was?

1139
01:39:21,147 --> 01:39:22,626
The eyes.

1140
01:39:23,867 --> 01:39:25,619
Maybe it was for her.

1141
01:39:27,187 --> 01:39:28,506
Who could she be?

1142
01:39:29,707 --> 01:39:32,062
Who knows when she met Matteo.

1143
01:39:34,027 --> 01:39:35,745
How does she know him?

1144
01:39:36,107 --> 01:39:37,620
Why do you ask?

1145
01:39:37,827 --> 01:39:40,022
She probably passed him
on the street.

1146
01:39:40,227 --> 01:39:41,421
You're wrong.

1147
01:39:42,907 --> 01:39:44,386
They talked.

1148
01:39:52,947 --> 01:39:55,381
If you like the book
you can keep it.

1149
01:39:59,267 --> 01:40:01,656
But I want you
to go and meet her.

1150
01:40:03,307 --> 01:40:04,740
Who?

1151
01:40:04,947 --> 01:40:06,699
Her, Mirella.

1152
01:40:09,307 --> 01:40:10,786
I want you to talk to her.

1153
01:40:11,827 --> 01:40:14,295
How will I find her?
What for?

1154
01:40:15,867 --> 01:40:18,859
-Because I said so.
-You're not my boss.

1155
01:40:19,067 --> 01:40:22,025
I do what I think is right,
and this isn't.

1156
01:40:25,467 --> 01:40:26,980
Are you offended?

1157
01:40:28,067 --> 01:40:29,705
Do you do as I say?

1158
01:40:31,627 --> 01:40:33,140
Have I asked you to leave?

1159
01:40:34,867 --> 01:40:37,586
How many times have I told you
to move in

1160
01:40:37,787 --> 01:40:40,745
with EIda and Gina?
Do you listen to me?

1161
01:40:40,947 --> 01:40:42,778
-I'm better here.
-No, you're not.

1162
01:40:43,307 --> 01:40:45,582
You think you are,
but you're not.

1163
01:40:45,987 --> 01:40:49,821
To know for sure you have
to try living on the outside.

1164
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:54,579
We're releasing everyone,
and you insist on staying.

1165
01:40:54,787 --> 01:40:57,426
You're not nice anymore.
You've changed.

1166
01:40:58,027 --> 01:40:59,824
You're not even good.

1167
01:41:00,027 --> 01:41:03,986
You were, but not anymore.
You were nice, but not anymore.

1168
01:41:45,227 --> 01:41:48,617
<i>And they complain
that people don't pay taxes!</i>

1169
01:41:48,827 --> 01:41:52,137
<i>They've already paid too much,
way too much!</i>

1170
01:44:19,227 --> 01:44:20,216
Excuse me!

1171
01:44:20,427 --> 01:44:23,624
-The station chief?
-In back on the right.

1172
01:44:23,827 --> 01:44:25,260
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

1173
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:29,900
Where were you going?

1174
01:44:32,947 --> 01:44:35,017
To find who took the photo.

1175
01:44:39,627 --> 01:44:41,026
What for?

1176
01:44:42,987 --> 01:44:44,784
To talk to her.

1177
01:44:47,387 --> 01:44:49,298
I worked it out
with the police.

1178
01:44:50,547 --> 01:44:52,902
We can go.
We can go, can't we?

1179
01:44:56,107 --> 01:44:58,098
But I won't take you back
to the clinic.

1180
01:44:59,187 --> 01:45:03,226
-No, Nicola, I can't.
-Yes, you can.

1181
01:45:04,067 --> 01:45:06,137
-No, no, no...
-Yes, you can.

1182
01:45:06,347 --> 01:45:07,462
You're already out.

1183
01:45:08,307 --> 01:45:11,105
You have Marcello's jacket on.
Marcello's wondering:

1184
01:45:11,307 --> 01:45:13,025
"Where's my jacket?"

1185
01:45:13,227 --> 01:45:15,616
You took the tramway,
all by yourself.

1186
01:45:15,827 --> 01:45:17,146
You're already out.

1187
01:45:18,867 --> 01:45:20,459
I won't take you back.

1188
01:45:40,387 --> 01:45:41,820
That's the house.

1189
01:45:42,707 --> 01:45:44,459
Are the others awake?

1190
01:45:44,747 --> 01:45:45,896
I think so.

1191
01:45:46,347 --> 01:45:49,419
A bus will be coming by
to take them to work.

1192
01:45:54,347 --> 01:45:56,383
You think I can do it?

1193
01:45:57,467 --> 01:45:59,423
You already have,
don't you see?

1194
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:05,301
Then thank you.

1195
01:46:07,107 --> 01:46:08,859
Don't thank me.

1196
01:46:09,307 --> 01:46:11,901
Matteo's the one who convinced you
to leave the clinic.

1197
01:46:12,627 --> 01:46:14,379
<i>This is a gift from him.</i>

1198
01:46:16,867 --> 01:46:19,586
-Come and visit me.
-Of course I will.

1199
01:46:19,787 --> 01:46:22,620
I'll come and visit
every once and a while.

1200
01:46:22,827 --> 01:46:25,057
Come on, smile!

1201
01:46:25,547 --> 01:46:27,424
This is a big day.

1202
01:46:28,187 --> 01:46:29,745
Aren't you happy?

1203
01:46:36,587 --> 01:46:37,861
Go on.

1204
01:46:38,827 --> 01:46:41,421
-Come with me.
-No, I won't.

1205
01:46:41,867 --> 01:46:43,698
Get your bag, ring the bell

1206
01:46:44,547 --> 01:46:46,219
and they'll open the door.

1207
01:46:51,147 --> 01:46:54,298
-Here, you keep it.
-No, I gave it to you.

1208
01:46:54,507 --> 01:46:55,986
On the last page

1209
01:46:56,187 --> 01:46:57,825
they list the title
of each photo.

1210
01:46:58,507 --> 01:47:00,737
Matteo's is number seven.

1211
01:47:21,707 --> 01:47:23,777
-Hi, Giampiero.
-Hi, Giorgia.

1212
01:47:41,987 --> 01:47:43,215
Sev...

1213
01:47:45,427 --> 01:47:46,416
en.

1214
01:47:58,507 --> 01:48:02,466
MATTEO WHEN HE WAS NICOLA

1215
01:48:08,387 --> 01:48:09,661
<i>Of course, but...</i>

1216
01:48:09,867 --> 01:48:12,256
isn't there a way
to locate her?

1217
01:48:15,187 --> 01:48:16,586
I see.

1218
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:19,057
Thanks anyway.
Goodbye.

1219
01:48:20,387 --> 01:48:22,218
I talked to the agency, but

1220
01:48:22,867 --> 01:48:24,095
she doesn't live in Milan
anymore.

1221
01:48:24,507 --> 01:48:27,658
She moved to Palermo
to cover the massacre.

1222
01:48:28,067 --> 01:48:29,625
What are you talking about?

1223
01:48:30,827 --> 01:48:33,387
They've killed Judge Falcone.

1224

<i>PALERMO

Your honor!

1227
01:49:03,987 --> 01:49:06,660
-Where are you going?
-To see Doctor Carati.

1228
01:49:06,867 --> 01:49:09,222
Not today.
You'll have to leave.

1229
01:49:09,427 --> 01:49:12,658
-I'm her brother, Nicola Carati.
-Can't you see what's going on?

1230
01:49:12,867 --> 01:49:14,858
Please go away.

1231
01:49:17,787 --> 01:49:20,824
<i>There's Rosaria,

Wait here.

1257
01:50:31,467 --> 01:50:32,536
Hi!

1258
01:50:34,347 --> 01:50:37,020
I knew you were here,
but things have been a mess.

1259
01:50:37,947 --> 01:50:39,505
I saw you this morning.

1260
01:50:40,027 --> 01:50:41,619
I couldn't get close.

1261
01:50:44,787 --> 01:50:46,266
I'm tired.

1262
01:50:47,387 --> 01:50:48,979
We're all tired.

1263

<i>We don't even know
where to start.</i>

1264
01:50:51,987 --> 01:50:54,706
I feel like hiding my head
like an ostrich.

1265
01:50:55,267 --> 01:50:56,416
You're no ostrich.

1266
01:50:58,867 --> 01:51:00,505
Why are you in Palermo?

1267
01:51:00,707 --> 01:51:04,143
I have to see someone.
Are you free for lunch?

1268
01:51:04,347 --> 01:51:07,544
I can't even have you over
to my place.

1269
01:51:07,907 --> 01:51:10,341
We have half an hour,
we have to stay here.

1270
01:51:11,107 --> 01:51:12,859
How's Mom?
And Francesca?

1271
01:51:13,067 --> 01:51:14,466
I haven't been to Rome
in ages.

1272
01:51:14,667 --> 01:51:15,543
And Sara?

1273
01:51:15,747 --> 01:51:18,056
Sara has turned into
a beautiful girl.

1274
01:51:18,467 --> 01:51:22,460
She always was.
How's your lovelife?

1275
01:51:23,147 --> 01:51:24,262
And yours?

1276
01:51:24,467 --> 01:51:26,935
I'm the judge here.
I ask the questions.

1277
01:51:31,067 --> 01:51:32,341
Hello?

1278
01:51:33,027 --> 01:51:34,506
Thanks for calling.

1279
01:51:35,347 --> 01:51:38,578
Yeah, fine.
Tomorrow, yes.

Where?

1281
01:51:40,147 --> 01:51:42,900
All right. Good night.

1282
01:51:49,547 --> 01:51:51,344
It's not what you think.

We educate our children
to respect others.

1284
01:52:00,787 --> 01:52:02,982
We instill a sense of duty.

1285
01:52:05,547 --> 01:52:08,107
We instill a sense of justice.

1286
01:52:10,747 --> 01:52:14,660
We instill morality.

1287
01:52:18,987 --> 01:52:22,104
We teach them not to beg for

1288
01:52:22,307 --> 01:52:23,865
what is ours by right.

1289
01:52:27,947 --> 01:52:31,542
We instill resistence
to the mafia.

1290
01:52:34,627 --> 01:52:38,586
We must never forget
Giovanni Falcone.

1291
01:52:42,267 --> 01:52:43,780
We must never forget

1292
01:52:43,987 --> 01:52:46,979
all those killed by the mafia.

1293
01:52:50,867 --> 01:52:52,095
We must always

1294
01:52:52,307 --> 01:52:55,538
remember them
as our own family.

1295
01:53:00,387 --> 01:53:03,777
We must love each other
like brothers.

1296
01:53:07,027 --> 01:53:11,384
We must defend our love
by example.

1297
01:53:23,947 --> 01:53:25,585
Sorry to keep you waiting,

1298
01:53:25,787 --> 01:53:28,381
<i>but I have to develop them
this afternoon.</i>

1299
01:53:28,587 --> 01:53:30,100
We'll talk later.

1300
01:53:43,467 --> 01:53:44,820
Aren't you bored?

1301
01:54:00,787 --> 01:54:02,015
Thank you.

1302
01:54:06,587 --> 01:54:08,896
The photo you saw
was taken here.

1303
01:54:11,027 --> 01:54:12,938
Right here.

1304
01:54:14,587 --> 01:54:16,305
It was very different.

1305
01:54:18,427 --> 01:54:20,657
There were orange tablecloths.

1306
01:54:26,347 --> 01:54:28,144
Had you known him long?

1307
01:54:29,947 --> 01:54:31,665
Five minutes.

1308
01:54:35,147 --> 01:54:36,500
He said his name was Nicola.

1309
01:54:37,907 --> 01:54:40,740
Later, in Rome...

1310
01:54:41,787 --> 01:54:44,984
I don't know why,
but he never told me his real name.

1311
01:54:46,107 --> 01:54:47,256
I found out for myself.

1312
01:54:51,907 --> 01:54:53,863
I found out that last day.

1313
01:54:55,067 --> 01:54:56,102
When...

1314
01:55:01,307 --> 01:55:03,298
<i>The next night I left.</i>

1315
01:55:03,627 --> 01:55:05,424
I went home.

1316
01:55:06,187 --> 01:55:08,337
I wanted to come back
to the island

1317
01:55:09,587 --> 01:55:11,384
to find some silence.

1318
01:55:14,147 --> 01:55:16,183
So you saw him again in Rome?

1319
01:55:25,547 --> 01:55:26,821
A few hours before...

1320
01:55:31,707 --> 01:55:32,935
I'm sorry.

1321
01:55:36,827 --> 01:55:38,465
I can't.

1322
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:42,905
Neither can I.

1323
01:55:44,787 --> 01:55:46,937
I still can't talk to anyone
about it.

1324
01:56:05,907 --> 01:56:07,306
I'm sorry.

1325
01:56:13,947 --> 01:56:15,778
I have to leave soon.

1326
01:56:22,067 --> 01:56:24,137
How can you live on an island

1327
01:56:25,147 --> 01:56:26,500
with your job?

1328
01:56:26,747 --> 01:56:27,941
I don't work much.

1329
01:56:28,787 --> 01:56:30,106
Enough to get by.

1330
01:56:30,627 --> 01:56:32,219
Whenever necessary.

1331
01:56:34,707 --> 01:56:37,380
<i>When there's important stuff,
like today.</i>

1332
01:56:40,627 --> 01:56:41,980
Are you going back to Turin?

1333
01:56:42,787 --> 01:56:44,345
Yes, tonight.

1334
01:56:44,867 --> 01:56:46,220
Back to my daughter.

1335
01:56:47,347 --> 01:56:48,621
You have a daughter?

1336
01:56:51,067 --> 01:56:53,217
Her name is Sara.
She's 18 years old.

1337
01:56:53,787 --> 01:56:55,539
Next year

1338
01:56:56,067 --> 01:56:57,739
she'll study Restoration.

1339
01:56:57,947 --> 01:57:01,496
-She's all grown up.
-Yeah, she is.

1340
01:57:02,827 --> 01:57:04,465
Have you got kids?

1341
01:57:08,787 --> 01:57:09,936
One.

1342
01:57:11,187 --> 01:57:12,666
He's seven and a half.

1343
01:57:13,027 --> 01:57:15,097
<i>He starts third grade
in September.</i>

1344
01:57:21,027 --> 01:57:22,540
His name is Andrea.

1345
01:57:23,427 --> 01:57:25,338
And he's as handsome as Matteo.

1346
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:36,138
-Morning!
-Good morning.

1347
01:58:36,467 --> 01:58:39,777
-Can I help you?
-No, it's okay, sir.

1348
01:58:40,227 --> 01:58:42,343
-Sir?
-Nicola!

1349
01:58:42,547 --> 01:58:45,380
Mom, you look like
a poor old lady!

1350
01:58:45,667 --> 01:58:47,817
I am a poor old lady!

1351
01:58:56,387 --> 01:58:57,979
Why's it so dark?

1352
01:58:58,307 --> 01:59:01,583
-I don't like the light.
-It's like a dungeon in here.

1353
01:59:01,787 --> 01:59:04,176
-Or a funeral parlor.
-I can't be bothered to open them.

1354
01:59:04,387 --> 01:59:07,697
-Without Giovanna...
-I'll do it.

1355
01:59:07,987 --> 01:59:11,059
-Let there be light!
-Don't make such a fuss.

1356
01:59:11,387 --> 01:59:13,582
Come on, look what
a nice day it is.

1357
01:59:13,787 --> 01:59:16,062
-No, please...
-Look at that sun!

1358
01:59:20,147 --> 01:59:21,739
I have something to tell you.

1359
01:59:23,227 --> 01:59:24,785
It's wonderful news.

1360
01:59:27,307 --> 01:59:29,263
It's about Matteo.

1361
01:59:30,867 --> 01:59:34,337
One of those unpredictable things
he used to do.

1362
01:59:36,067 --> 01:59:38,501
In Palermo I met a woman,
Mirella.

1363
01:59:38,787 --> 01:59:40,061
She had an relationship
with Matteo.

1364
01:59:41,227 --> 01:59:43,616
-A relationship?
-Yeah, they were in love.

1365
01:59:44,467 --> 01:59:45,616
Mirella had a child

1366
01:59:46,227 --> 01:59:48,343
<i>after Matteo had already died.</i>

1367
01:59:48,747 --> 01:59:50,066
His name is Andrea.

1368
01:59:50,507 --> 01:59:53,340
And I think he'd like to meet
his grandmother.

1369
01:59:55,107 --> 01:59:56,301
A boy?

1370
01:59:56,827 --> 01:59:58,101
Yes, Mom. A boy.

1371
02:00:03,787 --> 02:00:05,345
The train to Naples
leaves in an hour.

1372
02:00:06,027 --> 02:00:09,099
We can catch the ferry to Sicily
from there.

1373
02:00:11,467 --> 02:00:12,502
Wait a second.

1374
02:00:13,867 --> 02:00:15,539
What's wrong, Mom?

1375
02:00:16,147 --> 02:00:17,739
You want a glass of water?

1376
02:00:19,227 --> 02:00:20,376
I...

1377
02:00:21,027 --> 02:00:22,301
I can't.

1378
02:00:23,307 --> 02:00:24,535
I'm not ready.

1379
02:00:24,747 --> 02:00:26,977
What do you mean?

1380
02:00:28,547 --> 02:00:30,856
-How do you know it's true?
-It's true, Mom.

1381
02:00:31,067 --> 02:00:32,261
I saw him.

1382
02:00:32,987 --> 02:00:36,138
<i>Why didn't she say anything
after all this time?</i>

1383
02:00:37,267 --> 02:00:39,019
Why didn't she write?

1384
02:00:39,227 --> 02:00:43,539
We think bad news is normal,
but good news is hard to believe.

1385
02:00:46,467 --> 02:00:47,616
Come on, Mom!

1386
02:00:48,387 --> 02:00:50,139
-Let's go.
-I can't.

1387
02:00:50,347 --> 02:00:52,178
Come on, Mom.

1388
02:00:58,707 --> 02:01:01,175
Sara wants to move in with
Carlo and Francesca.

1389
02:01:01,387 --> 02:01:03,947
I know,
we talked about it.

1390
02:01:04,467 --> 02:01:07,698
So I'm the last one
to hear about it. Great.

1391
02:01:07,947 --> 02:01:10,984
-Do you mind?
-No, of course not.

1392
02:01:11,187 --> 02:01:12,540
On the contrary.
I understand.

1393
02:01:13,347 --> 02:01:15,861
Sara needs a home
with a mother in it.

1394
02:01:16,067 --> 02:01:17,625
And Francesca
is a great mother.

1395
02:01:20,027 --> 02:01:21,176
Thanks, sweetie.

1396
02:01:21,947 --> 02:01:23,141
Why?

1397
02:01:23,587 --> 02:01:27,262
For never being jealous
of your siblings.

1398
02:01:27,467 --> 02:01:29,662
Not my siblings.
But there is someone...

1399
02:01:30,027 --> 02:01:32,302
-Who?
-Your students.

1400
02:01:32,507 --> 02:01:35,579
-You're jealous of my kids?
-Yeah, of your kids.

1401
02:01:35,787 --> 02:01:36,936
You took them to museums,

1402
02:01:37,147 --> 02:01:39,786
you brought them home,
corrected their homework...

1403
02:01:39,987 --> 02:01:41,500
You loved them more than us.

1404
02:01:41,747 --> 02:01:44,580
I had to replace their families.

1405
02:01:44,787 --> 02:01:47,540
At home their parents
never talked to them.

1406
02:01:47,747 --> 02:01:49,817
So you talked to them.

1407
02:01:51,347 --> 02:01:52,541
I talked to them.

1408
02:01:53,667 --> 02:01:55,862
And I should have
talked more to you.

1409
02:01:56,067 --> 02:01:57,944
Mom, that's enough.

1410
02:01:58,187 --> 02:02:00,576
Mom, don't look at me like that.

1411
02:02:00,787 --> 02:02:03,255
Don't speak Milanese,
you're awful at it.

1412
02:02:04,587 --> 02:02:07,021
How did you adapt to Rome?

1413
02:02:07,227 --> 02:02:09,297
<i>I loved it from the start.</i>

1414
02:02:10,107 --> 02:02:11,540
That decrepit air...

1415
02:02:11,747 --> 02:02:13,783
Rancid, stuffy...

1416
02:02:14,587 --> 02:02:18,023
All those cynical people,
so rude...

1417
02:02:18,227 --> 02:02:20,980
It's just full of irony.

1418
02:02:21,187 --> 02:02:23,576
-You know how I met your dad?
-No.

1419
02:02:24,107 --> 02:02:27,179
In the market.
Back then he used to sell

1420
02:02:27,387 --> 02:02:29,343
vegetables, produce...

1421
02:02:30,027 --> 02:02:32,905
He'd bring them from Naples,
one of his businesses.

1422
02:02:33,547 --> 02:02:36,015
There he was,
at the orange stand,

1423
02:02:36,227 --> 02:02:38,866
with a sign:
"Spanish oranges."

1424
02:02:39,867 --> 02:02:41,664
And I said:
"Are they really Spanish?"

1425
02:02:41,947 --> 02:02:44,984
And he said: "Ma'am,
can't you hear the castanets?"

1426
02:02:46,747 --> 02:02:48,499
-And what did you do?
-Nothing, I...

1427
02:02:48,707 --> 02:02:51,380
I bought the oranges
and married him.

1428
02:04:09,747 --> 02:04:11,100
Andrea, they're here.

1429
02:04:19,747 --> 02:04:20,941
Hello.

1430
02:04:22,507 --> 02:04:23,906
Hello...?

1431
02:04:24,107 --> 02:04:25,859
Hello, Grandma.

1432
02:04:26,067 --> 02:04:28,183
-Hello.
-Hi, uncle!

1433
02:04:28,387 --> 02:04:32,175
Your grandma said "hello."
Stop crying.

1434
02:04:46,707 --> 02:04:48,504
I think they're getting along.

1435
02:04:51,787 --> 02:04:54,859
I wanted to say...
Thank you.

1436
02:04:55,787 --> 02:04:58,176
-What for?
-For letting us come.

1437
02:04:58,387 --> 02:05:01,060
-It's normal.
-You could have said no.

1438
02:05:01,387 --> 02:05:02,615
Oh, come on!

1439
02:05:11,627 --> 02:05:13,697
-Where's your school?
-There.

1440
02:05:13,907 --> 02:05:16,865
-That's the high school?
-No, it's in Lipari.

1441
02:05:18,947 --> 02:05:22,860
-Where's Lipari?
-There. But it has no volcano.

1442
02:05:23,627 --> 02:05:25,504
-Are you afraid of the volcano?
-No.

1443
02:05:26,187 --> 02:05:28,655
-What are you afraid of?
-Nothing.

1444
02:05:28,987 --> 02:05:32,184
How lucky!
I'm afraid of lots of things.

1445
02:05:32,387 --> 02:05:34,378
For example,
I was afraid to come here.

1446
02:05:34,587 --> 02:05:36,896
-You're afraid of the sea?
-Yes.

1447
02:05:37,547 --> 02:05:40,903
-You can't swim?
-That might be it.

1448
02:05:41,107 --> 02:05:43,063
It's easy, I'll teach you.

1449
02:05:48,707 --> 02:05:51,380
<i>"I speak of the faith
that had never left him,</i>

1450
02:05:51,787 --> 02:05:54,460
not even when he was
on the verge of desperation.

1451
02:05:55,027 --> 02:05:58,337
The faith that comes
from experience.

1452
02:05:58,987 --> 02:06:02,024
He continued on,
as if telling himself

1453
02:06:02,227 --> 02:06:05,537
about his own bravery
and talent.

1454
02:06:06,027 --> 02:06:07,745
Everything seemed so clear..."

1455
02:06:08,707 --> 02:06:10,425
Keep reading!

1456
02:06:12,947 --> 02:06:17,145
"So clear that in his mind
his tone of voice never changed."

1457
02:06:44,267 --> 02:06:47,782
They're photos...
photos of Matteo.

1458
02:06:49,747 --> 02:06:51,783
I couldn't look at them again.

1459
02:06:53,947 --> 02:06:55,824
I've tried many times.

1460
02:06:57,387 --> 02:06:59,264
My hands shake.

1461
02:07:03,027 --> 02:07:04,346
You keep them.

1462
02:07:08,027 --> 02:07:11,736
Andrea will be curious
to see what his father looked like

1463
02:07:12,867 --> 02:07:14,346
as a boy.

1464
02:07:31,627 --> 02:07:33,026
Can we look at them together?

1465
02:08:03,147 --> 02:08:04,546
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1466
02:08:04,787 --> 02:08:06,220
-Thanks for everything.
-Bye.

1467
02:08:07,187 --> 02:08:08,381
See you soon, eh?

1468
02:08:09,467 --> 02:08:11,059
Let's go, Mom.

1469
02:08:14,227 --> 02:08:16,183
I'll miss your eyes.

1470
02:08:16,747 --> 02:08:18,465
No crying, eh?

1471
02:08:18,747 --> 02:08:21,978
Don't make me nervous
or I'll smack you one.

1472
02:08:22,227 --> 02:08:23,546
Why don't you stay?

1473
02:08:24,667 --> 02:08:26,464
-What?
-There's plenty of room.

1474
02:08:26,667 --> 02:08:28,419
I'd really like that.

1475
02:08:28,627 --> 02:08:30,219
And so would Andrea,
right?

1476
02:08:30,427 --> 02:08:31,542
Yeah, Grandma, stay!

1477
02:08:32,787 --> 02:08:34,220
Stay, you heard them.

1478
02:08:36,707 --> 02:08:39,175
-I have to clothes.
-You have lots of stuff.

1479
02:08:39,387 --> 02:08:42,106
Have Francesca send
anything else you need.

1480
02:08:43,387 --> 02:08:45,298
-You think?
-Sure.

1481
02:08:45,507 --> 02:08:47,623
Mom, can't you hear
the castanets?

1482
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:49,900
Can't you hear them?

1483
02:09:27,827 --> 02:09:31,297
You know which is the gas?
The one on the right!

1484
02:09:31,507 --> 02:09:33,418
Relax, Mom.
I've got it covered.

1485
02:09:34,267 --> 02:09:38,306
There's lots of hats.
What do I do with them?

1486
02:09:41,027 --> 02:09:42,506
I'll keep them.

1487
02:09:43,427 --> 02:09:45,383
I didn't put in
the flower dress.

1488
02:09:46,587 --> 02:09:51,581
No, hold on. She wants it.
I'll get it for you.

1489
02:09:51,787 --> 02:09:53,015
-Here.
-Thanks.

1490
02:09:53,747 --> 02:09:54,896
Hi, Grandma.

1491
02:09:55,787 --> 02:09:58,859
Great. I'm learning Roman.

1492
02:09:59,547 --> 02:10:01,219
Yeah, and how are you?

1493
02:10:02,307 --> 02:10:05,936
Good. Grandma,
about the flower dress...

1494
02:10:06,387 --> 02:10:09,777
Are you sure you need it?
It's in fashion again.

1495
02:10:11,427 --> 02:10:13,736
But on you it would
look ordinary, right.

1496
02:10:13,947 --> 02:10:15,505
You're awful!

1497
02:10:16,947 --> 02:10:19,666
Why do you want to look older
than you really are?

1498
02:10:19,947 --> 02:10:21,983
-That's enough.
-Not if I wear it.

1499
02:10:22,187 --> 02:10:25,145
-Francesca agrees.
-It looks great on her.

1500
02:10:25,347 --> 02:10:27,702
-Go on, tell Grandma.
-No, really.

1501
02:10:27,907 --> 02:10:31,536
You remember that photo
with Dad in Capri?

1502
02:10:31,747 --> 02:10:32,975
Are you ready?

1503
02:10:35,427 --> 02:10:37,895
Are you sure
it looks good on me?

1504
02:10:38,107 --> 02:10:40,746
Yeah, you look great.

1505
02:10:41,507 --> 02:10:44,499
Though with heels who knows...

1506
02:10:44,907 --> 02:10:47,375
I can't stand up in heels.

1507
02:10:47,587 --> 02:10:50,465
Hurry up, the kids
are getting out of school.

1508
02:10:50,667 --> 02:10:52,419
-Can I drive?
-You'd better not.

1509
02:10:52,627 --> 02:10:54,902
-Come on, let me!
-No, please.

1510
02:11:20,707 --> 02:11:22,140
Thank you.

1511
02:11:34,107 --> 02:11:36,098
I like this place.

1512
02:11:36,307 --> 02:11:38,138
<i>It's falling apart.
Too much work.</i>

1513
02:11:38,347 --> 02:11:40,781
-But it's pretty.
-You have to take care of yourself.

1514
02:11:40,987 --> 02:11:42,898
I'll talk to the owner.

1515
02:11:43,107 --> 02:11:44,904
Yeah, talk to the owner.

1516
02:12:20,507 --> 02:12:23,385
-When's the break over?
-Professor!

1517
02:12:23,587 --> 02:12:25,942
Slavery doesn't exist!

1518
02:12:26,055 --> 02:12:27,647
-Since Lincoln!
-You hear?

1519
02:12:27,855 --> 02:12:30,050
What hard workers!

1520
02:12:34,055 --> 02:12:36,364
<i>"Parrari picca,
travagghiari assai."</i>

1521
02:12:40,775 --> 02:12:43,926
-Less talking and more working.
-Got it?

1522
02:12:44,375 --> 02:12:47,845
You're bringing him up right,
Professor!

1523
02:12:59,535 --> 02:13:05,246
<i>TUSCANY, VAL D'ORCIA
SPRING OF 1995</i>

1524
02:13:20,495 --> 02:13:21,928
Here we are.

1525
02:13:25,615 --> 02:13:26,809
Well?

1526
02:13:30,455 --> 02:13:33,606
A minute of silence
before this poetry, eh?

1527
02:13:36,695 --> 02:13:40,131
What? Don't look at me
like that,

1528
02:13:40,335 --> 02:13:42,405
it's one of the most beautiful
places in the world.

1529
02:13:42,615 --> 02:13:45,254
-The view is amazing.
-Just as well, because...

1530
02:13:45,455 --> 02:13:48,174
-Is this it?
-It's made of clay.

1531
02:13:48,375 --> 02:13:51,572
-It's in ruins!
-Come on, boys.

1532
02:13:51,775 --> 02:13:53,606
Use your imagination!

1533
02:13:54,295 --> 02:13:58,368
Men of little faith,
with no imagination. This way.

1534
02:13:59,655 --> 02:14:00,883
Well?

1535
02:14:01,455 --> 02:14:03,605
Two, three brilliant solutions.

1536
02:14:03,895 --> 02:14:05,965
-Brilliant?
-Brilliant?

1537
02:14:06,175 --> 02:14:08,814
Look at these cracks!
Bigger than my hand!

1538
02:14:09,015 --> 02:14:12,769
-It needs to be rebuilt.
-The foundation is cracked!

1539
02:14:12,975 --> 02:14:16,570
Yeah, but I called you,
Micavi Construction.

1540
02:14:16,775 --> 02:14:20,324
But if we rebuild over clay...

1541
02:14:21,055 --> 02:14:23,569
Here, a beam.

1542
02:14:23,775 --> 02:14:26,050
Red ceramic tiles,
like the square in Siena.

1543
02:14:26,895 --> 02:14:29,534
You been there?
All you do is complain?

1544
02:14:29,735 --> 02:14:31,885
<i>What are you complaining about?
You make a fortune!</i>

1545
02:14:32,095 --> 02:14:36,486
-Now you're the owner!
-All I have is debts.

1546
02:14:36,695 --> 02:14:38,686
No, the owners always complain.

1547
02:14:39,215 --> 02:14:40,694
That's enough of that!

1548
02:14:40,895 --> 02:14:43,853
The windows are okay
where they are.

1549
02:14:44,055 --> 02:14:47,968
I'd use aluminum...

1550
02:14:48,175 --> 02:14:50,450
-Not aluminum!
-Aluminum!

1551
02:14:50,655 --> 02:14:52,611
-Not aluminum!
-You'll kill him!

1552
02:14:53,015 --> 02:14:56,564
Look at the kitchen.
It's amazing.

1553
02:14:56,895 --> 02:14:59,011
Francesca wants a big kitchen.

1554
02:14:59,295 --> 02:15:02,446
Look at that chimney.
It's magnificent.

1555
02:15:02,895 --> 02:15:05,534
Here's the bathroom...

1556
02:15:06,535 --> 02:15:08,491
And the kids' bedroom...

1557
02:15:08,695 --> 02:15:10,890
Every room has
its own bathroom.

1558
02:15:11,095 --> 02:15:14,371
Every room.
Here's another office...

1559
02:15:15,095 --> 02:15:16,494
Or whatever.

1560
02:15:16,775 --> 02:15:18,413
Let's see what
you come up with.

1561
02:15:19,015 --> 02:15:21,688
And here's the problem:
these basins.

1562
02:15:22,295 --> 02:15:26,493
I don't know if I should keep them.
What do you think?

1563
02:15:27,055 --> 02:15:30,934
That doesn't matter.
The problem is

1564
02:15:31,135 --> 02:15:33,012
you need a layer of aeration...

1565
02:15:33,215 --> 02:15:36,764
The floors, original handmade
fired clay.

1566
02:15:36,975 --> 02:15:39,694
You know what that costs?

1567
02:15:39,895 --> 02:15:43,092
I want original handmade
fired clay.

1568
02:15:43,295 --> 02:15:44,569
Micavi.

1569
02:15:45,575 --> 02:15:47,645
It's an official request.

1570
02:15:48,335 --> 02:15:51,168
Micavi Construction,
can it be done?

1571
02:15:51,775 --> 02:15:52,890
Look at that.

1572
02:15:54,855 --> 02:15:56,811
Goddamn it!

1573
02:16:02,895 --> 02:16:04,453
Can it be done?

1574
02:16:06,415 --> 02:16:07,973
Well, it depends.

1575
02:16:08,375 --> 02:16:11,526
If you ask me with the respect
I'm due,

1576
02:16:11,855 --> 02:16:14,210
maybe we can oblige.

1577
02:16:26,455 --> 02:16:29,049
Where's that wood!
I'm starving!

1578
02:16:29,255 --> 02:16:30,768
Coming, one second!

1579
02:16:30,975 --> 02:16:33,569
You sound like a boss!

1580
02:16:36,015 --> 02:16:39,690
<i>You know there's a boy
chasing after Sara?</i>

1581
02:16:40,255 --> 02:16:42,166
Yeah, Francesca told me.

1582
02:16:44,335 --> 02:16:47,452
-What's he like?
-He comes over every day.

1583
02:16:47,655 --> 02:16:49,611
-Every day?
-Every day.

1584
02:16:49,815 --> 02:16:52,488
He picks her up,
takes her to school...

1585
02:16:52,695 --> 02:16:55,493
-Brings her home at night...
-At least he brings her home.

1586
02:16:55,695 --> 02:16:59,051
-He brings her home.
-Thank God.

1587
02:16:59,255 --> 02:17:02,133
What's he like?
Is he a good kid?

1588
02:17:02,975 --> 02:17:05,773
Yeah, like us at his age.

1589
02:17:06,735 --> 02:17:09,408
<i>That's comforting, thank you.</i>

1590
02:17:10,775 --> 02:17:14,404
-You'll soon be a granddad.
-Hey, watch it!

1591
02:17:14,615 --> 02:17:18,051
-Grandpa, where are you?
-Don't provoke me!

1592
02:17:18,335 --> 02:17:21,168
<i>-Come on, we're hungry.
-We need to start a fire.</i>

1593
02:17:21,375 --> 02:17:24,014
Carlo, grab a newspaper.

1594
02:17:24,215 --> 02:17:25,773
-We'll make a fire.
-My newspapers?

1595
02:17:25,975 --> 02:17:28,170
-Your newspapers.
-Go find one.

1596
02:17:53,455 --> 02:17:54,649
Hello?

1597
02:17:55,575 --> 02:17:56,894
Giulia, where are you?

1598
02:17:57,135 --> 02:17:59,410
No, she's at school.
She'll be back later.

1599
02:18:01,375 --> 02:18:02,728
Hello?

1600
02:18:54,655 --> 02:18:57,647
-Can I park it here a minute?
-Just a minute.

1601
02:19:01,895 --> 02:19:04,204
Thanks, I'll be right back.

1602
02:19:09,095 --> 02:19:10,164
Hi.

1603
02:19:18,215 --> 02:19:19,967
-Shall I call her?
-No.

1604
02:19:24,935 --> 02:19:27,733
-Won't you come over?
-No, I'm leaving.

1605
02:19:33,055 --> 02:19:34,170
Who's that?

1606
02:19:34,375 --> 02:19:36,684
Mimmo, her boyfriend.

1607
02:19:42,495 --> 02:19:44,850
-I have to go.
-Wait a second.

1608
02:19:45,175 --> 02:19:47,609
-Don't tell her you saw me.
-Why?

1609
02:19:48,335 --> 02:19:50,405
-Please.
-I'll give you a ride.

1610
02:19:52,615 --> 02:19:53,968
No, stay here.

1611
02:19:54,855 --> 02:19:56,573
I can take you.

1612
02:19:57,935 --> 02:19:59,163
Stay here.

1613
02:20:20,775 --> 02:20:22,731
You mustn't inhibit his gestures.

1614
02:20:23,015 --> 02:20:25,575
It would be like saying
they're senseless.

1615
02:20:26,455 --> 02:20:29,288
They might make sense to him,
you understand?

1616
02:20:29,495 --> 02:20:32,328
Yes. It seems impossible to me.

1617
02:20:32,895 --> 02:20:34,647
Nothing's impossible.

1618
02:20:35,415 --> 02:20:38,407
Yeah, but I don't know
what to do.

1619
02:20:38,815 --> 02:20:40,726
Try to find the sense in them.

1620
02:20:41,215 --> 02:20:42,330
Nothing more.

1621
02:20:42,535 --> 02:20:44,366
It's like deciphering
hieroglyphics.

1622
02:20:44,575 --> 02:20:48,454
But in the end we managed
to decipher them, right?

1623
02:20:49,695 --> 02:20:51,811
We'll have the usual meeting.

1624
02:20:52,095 --> 02:20:55,212
-Call the others.
-We'll meet you inside.

1625
02:20:56,135 --> 02:20:58,729
No, let's do it out here,
under that tree.

1626
02:20:59,975 --> 02:21:01,374
Bien, my dear children,

1627
02:21:01,575 --> 02:21:04,089
see if you can guess
this animal.

1628
02:21:08,575 --> 02:21:10,884
Now my assistent,
Giacomo,

1629
02:21:11,895 --> 02:21:14,329
will do his mime for us.
Please.

1630
02:21:15,095 --> 02:21:16,448
<i>Very particular.</i>

1631
02:21:16,895 --> 02:21:19,250
This is a very difficult animal,

1632
02:21:20,375 --> 02:21:24,573
<i>and Giacomo displays
his great gift for mime.</i>

1633
02:21:24,775 --> 02:21:27,494
-A lizard!
-No, but close.

1634
02:21:27,695 --> 02:21:30,767
It's an animal that slithers...
that slithers...

1635
02:21:30,975 --> 02:21:32,647
-A worm!
-Not a worm.

1636
02:21:32,855 --> 02:21:36,325
-It slithers, but not a worm.
-A snail!

1637
02:21:36,775 --> 02:21:37,924
Not a snail.

1638
02:21:38,135 --> 02:21:39,966
It's not poisonous.

1639
02:21:41,495 --> 02:21:44,373
And let's say it's...
It's very smooth.

1640
02:21:44,775 --> 02:21:47,608
-A caterpillar!
-No, it's smooth, so it's a...

1641
02:21:47,815 --> 02:21:49,726
-A snake!
-Good, a snake!

1642
02:21:49,935 --> 02:21:51,891
Giacomo did a marvelous job.

1643
02:21:52,095 --> 02:21:54,563
<i>After huge success in Monaco,
Paris and London</i>

1644
02:21:55,535 --> 02:21:58,652
our very own Giacomo
will now perform his last mime!

1645
02:22:02,095 --> 02:22:04,529
This is a very difficult animal.

1646
02:22:04,775 --> 02:22:06,333
-A hare!
-Not a hare.

1647
02:22:06,535 --> 02:22:09,049
Nicola, shall I leave
your mail in your office?

1648
02:22:09,255 --> 02:22:10,654
No, I'll read it here.

1649
02:22:10,855 --> 02:22:12,686
The mail has arrived.

1650
02:22:12,895 --> 02:22:14,453
-A fox!
-No.

1651
02:22:14,655 --> 02:22:16,850
<i>No certificate...</i>

1652
02:22:17,495 --> 02:22:19,372
A postcard from Giorgia.

1653
02:22:19,575 --> 02:22:20,530
A mouse!

1654
02:22:20,735 --> 02:22:23,044
A letter...
But there's a mistake.

1655
02:22:23,255 --> 02:22:27,567
This letter is for
Doctor Nicola Carati.

1656
02:22:27,775 --> 02:22:30,164
-Who's that?
-You!

1657
02:22:30,775 --> 02:22:32,254
-Me?
-Yeah, you!

1658
02:22:32,455 --> 02:22:35,527
You're right!
Jesus, I always forget!

1659
02:22:36,895 --> 02:22:39,329
-You read it, Giacomo.
-He doesn't know how!

1660
02:22:39,535 --> 02:22:42,288
-Sure he does, you'll see.
-I know how to read!

1661
02:22:42,495 --> 02:22:43,723
He knows how, too.

1662
02:22:46,295 --> 02:22:48,411
No, I'll open it, because

1663
02:22:48,655 --> 02:22:50,407
the glue

1664
02:22:50,775 --> 02:22:51,844
<i>is particular.</i>

1665
02:22:52,295 --> 02:22:53,523
There.

1666
02:22:54,175 --> 02:22:55,654
You read it.

1667
02:22:57,055 --> 02:22:58,647
So everyone can hear.

1668
02:22:58,855 --> 02:23:02,609
<i>Silence!
An important letter!</i>

1669
02:23:03,695 --> 02:23:05,526
"Dear Nicola:

1670
02:23:05,735 --> 02:23:08,727
I would have preferred

1671
02:23:09,335 --> 02:23:11,565
not to write

1672
02:23:12,415 --> 02:23:16,010
this letter.

1673
02:23:17,655 --> 02:23:21,364
You mother

1674
02:23:21,855 --> 02:23:24,927
has passed away.

1675
02:23:26,015 --> 02:23:30,406
She didn't suffer,

1676
02:23:31,135 --> 02:23:35,925
she went in her sleep

1677
02:23:37,895 --> 02:23:40,329
very quietly.

1678
02:23:41,735 --> 02:23:43,487
I write you

1679
02:23:44,775 --> 02:23:46,572
now

1680
02:23:46,855 --> 02:23:48,766
because

1681
02:23:49,415 --> 02:23:55,172
she made me promise

1682
02:23:55,615 --> 02:24:00,131
that when

1683
02:24:00,855 --> 02:24:03,733
she was gone

1684
02:24:04,615 --> 02:24:08,847
I wouldn't

1685
02:24:09,175 --> 02:24:11,609
bother

1686
02:24:12,535 --> 02:24:14,366
anyone.

1687
02:24:15,135 --> 02:24:17,171
A kiss.

1688
02:24:17,495 --> 02:24:20,726
See you soon.

1689
02:24:21,335 --> 02:24:23,530
Mirella."

1690
02:24:26,335 --> 02:24:27,563
Good, Giacomo.

1691
02:24:30,695 --> 02:24:33,004
You read great.

1692
02:24:33,655 --> 02:24:34,929
Very good.

1693
02:25:34,055 --> 02:25:36,489
Is there sea where my dad
is buried?

1694
02:25:39,295 --> 02:25:40,648
No, not closeby.

1695
02:25:40,855 --> 02:25:42,846
You should bring him.
Near the sea.

1696
02:25:46,375 --> 02:25:47,410
You're right.

1697
02:25:48,815 --> 02:25:50,726
I'll bring him.
I promise.

1698
02:25:53,775 --> 02:25:55,208
What was he like?

1699
02:25:56,535 --> 02:25:57,763
Him?

1700
02:25:58,455 --> 02:26:00,093
He was like Achilles.

1701
02:26:00,415 --> 02:26:03,293
You know who Achilles was?
Your grandma must have told you.

1702
02:26:04,975 --> 02:26:06,886
He was brave and sad like him.

1703
02:26:08,015 --> 02:26:10,575
He hoped the gods
would take him away early.

1704
02:26:10,935 --> 02:26:12,687
You know how the gods are.

1705
02:26:13,215 --> 02:26:15,331
The best people,
the ones they love most,

1706
02:26:15,535 --> 02:26:17,127
<i>are sent to Earth</i>

1707
02:26:18,175 --> 02:26:21,372
and later taken away.
But they leave a mark

1708
02:26:22,015 --> 02:26:23,767
so that we don't forget them.

1709
02:26:24,495 --> 02:26:26,053
You're that mark.

1710
02:26:27,175 --> 02:26:30,611
This morning, looking at the atlas,
you looked just like him.

1711
02:26:32,495 --> 02:26:35,089
We did the same thing, long ago.
We looked at an atlas,

1712
02:26:35,295 --> 02:26:38,253
because we wanted
to take a trip.

1713
02:26:39,055 --> 02:26:41,410
We had to go somewhere far away,

1714
02:26:42,575 --> 02:26:44,930
where there was only sea.

1715
02:26:46,655 --> 02:26:48,532
<i>That place was called
Cape North.</i>

1716
02:26:49,055 --> 02:26:49,965
Where's that?

1717
02:26:54,215 --> 02:26:55,409
There.

1718
02:27:00,615 --> 02:27:02,048
And did you go?

1719
02:27:02,535 --> 02:27:05,527
I tried, but didn't make it
all the way.

1720
02:27:06,775 --> 02:27:09,005
Your dad wanted to go,

1721
02:27:09,895 --> 02:27:11,965
but in the end
he lost interest.

1722
02:27:14,335 --> 02:27:16,326
The gods were calling him.

1723
02:27:18,575 --> 02:27:21,692
Yeah, the gods
were calling him.

1724
02:27:49,255 --> 02:27:52,804
-Why don't you stay longer?
-I have to leave today.

1725
02:27:54,735 --> 02:27:56,805
Tomorrow the kids
have a test.

1726
02:27:58,575 --> 02:28:01,408
-I don't want to go back.
-Then stay.

1727
02:28:02,335 --> 02:28:05,008
I'll take you to France,
to Greece,

1728
02:28:05,575 --> 02:28:07,645
to Africa,
wherever you want.

1729
02:28:07,855 --> 02:28:08,844
Go on, choose.

1730
02:28:17,495 --> 02:28:19,406
Will it be another 3 years?

1731
02:28:19,615 --> 02:28:21,571
No, of course not.

1732
02:28:22,735 --> 02:28:24,851
It's great to see you,
Andrea...

1733
02:28:55,295 --> 02:28:58,731
SPRING OF 2000

1734
02:29:03,815 --> 02:29:05,533
It's definitely beautiful.

1735
02:29:05,895 --> 02:29:08,455
Beautiful?
It's sublime!

1736
02:29:08,935 --> 02:29:11,051
A paradise.
We told him when we saw it.

1737
02:29:11,255 --> 02:29:13,485
I told him right away:
" Buy this house."

1738
02:29:13,695 --> 02:29:16,607
-He didn't want to.
-And we insisted.

1739
02:29:16,815 --> 02:29:19,124
-So we said: " Buy it."
-And convinced him.

1740
02:29:21,015 --> 02:29:23,973
Look at that orchard!
It's new!

1741
02:29:24,175 --> 02:29:26,848
-He even put in palm trees.
-In front?

1742
02:29:27,055 --> 02:29:30,092
They're small, but...

1743
02:29:31,615 --> 02:29:35,403
You made a nice little sum
on this project, eh?

1744
02:29:35,615 --> 02:29:37,810
Money off my friends?

1745
02:29:38,015 --> 02:29:39,846
You never make money
off of friends.

1746
02:29:40,055 --> 02:29:43,491
-No, in spirit.
-In spirit, right.

1747
02:29:43,695 --> 02:29:47,244
In the spirit of giving
without receiving.

1748
02:29:49,055 --> 02:29:51,011
But they're driving me crazy.

1749
02:29:51,215 --> 02:29:53,046
Your sister is worse
than he is.

1750
02:29:53,415 --> 02:29:56,646
Watch what you say
about my sister.

1751
02:29:57,175 --> 02:29:58,369
<i>I'll come after you.</i>

1752
02:29:58,575 --> 02:30:02,534
She wants the roof tiles darker
so the match the...

1753
02:30:02,735 --> 02:30:07,092
-She has her reasons, right?
-Fine, but...

1754
02:30:07,735 --> 02:30:10,329
Your car can barely make it...

1755
02:30:10,535 --> 02:30:13,333
It's getting old.
Like us.

1756
02:30:13,815 --> 02:30:14,964
Carlo!

1757
02:30:18,375 --> 02:30:20,684
-Francesca!
-Is anyone home?

1758
02:30:25,335 --> 02:30:29,567
Observe, please...
observe the arch.

1759
02:30:30,695 --> 02:30:33,084
-Wonderful.
-This...

1760
02:30:34,215 --> 02:30:37,173
-The orchard.
-My favorite place.

1761
02:30:37,495 --> 02:30:39,406
Very Japanese...

1762
02:30:39,615 --> 02:30:40,843
Sara!

1763
02:30:41,535 --> 02:30:43,730
-Your daughter's getting married?
-Yeah.

1764
02:30:45,655 --> 02:30:47,293
Are you happy?

1765
02:30:48,775 --> 02:30:51,005
-Yeah.
-So tell me.

1766
02:30:51,215 --> 02:30:53,570
Did he ask your permission?

1767
02:30:54,455 --> 02:30:57,925
He did.
With lots of respect.

1768
02:30:58,455 --> 02:31:00,491
He's a good kid.

1769
02:31:00,975 --> 02:31:01,964
Good.

1770
02:31:02,935 --> 02:31:05,130
He needs a haircut.

1771
02:31:05,695 --> 02:31:06,923
You're right.

1772
02:31:08,375 --> 02:31:11,845
Look at this opening!
It's magnificent.

1773
02:31:12,495 --> 02:31:14,884
<i>A great work
by a great artist.</i>

1774
02:31:15,335 --> 02:31:18,884
<i>You're like Brunelleschi,
Leon Battista Alberti!</i>

1775
02:31:22,975 --> 02:31:25,125
Some day this will all be yours.

1776
02:31:25,495 --> 02:31:26,814
Thanks.

1777
02:31:27,015 --> 02:31:28,846
Let's go for a swim.

1778
02:31:29,775 --> 02:31:32,209
-A swim?
-You bring a suit?

1779
02:31:32,415 --> 02:31:35,532
-You seen my gut?
-Give me a one-piece.

1780
02:31:35,735 --> 02:31:37,805
All I have is a thong, but...

1781
02:32:00,815 --> 02:32:02,692
We're glad you could make it.

1782
02:32:03,055 --> 02:32:04,374
So are we.

1783
02:32:04,575 --> 02:32:06,247
It's amazing here.

1784
02:32:06,455 --> 02:32:08,525
That's why I invited you.

1785
02:32:09,775 --> 02:32:11,970
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

1786
02:32:12,215 --> 02:32:14,331
-And you?
-Fine, fine.

1787
02:32:15,055 --> 02:32:17,125
Are you glad your daughter's
getting married?

1788
02:32:17,335 --> 02:32:18,529
Very much.

1789
02:32:19,455 --> 02:32:22,094
-Are you happy?
-Yes.

1790
02:32:24,175 --> 02:32:25,403
Everything's okay?

1791
02:32:27,375 --> 02:32:29,093
-Yes.
-Good.

1792
02:32:35,095 --> 02:32:37,051
I'm going to talk to your son.

1793
02:32:37,295 --> 02:32:39,763
-I'll leave you two.
-See you later?

1794
02:32:39,975 --> 02:32:41,488
-Bye.
-Bye.

1795
02:32:44,615 --> 02:32:46,094
Well?

1796
02:32:50,375 --> 02:32:52,730
-How are you?
-Fine.

1797
02:32:53,535 --> 02:32:55,127
Good answer. Concise,

1798
02:32:55,335 --> 02:32:56,609
brief.

1799
02:32:57,575 --> 02:32:59,054
Growing a beard?

1800
02:32:59,255 --> 02:33:00,973
Or have you just not shaven?

1801
02:33:01,175 --> 02:33:02,608
How do I look?

1802
02:33:02,815 --> 02:33:04,294
What matters

1803
02:33:04,495 --> 02:33:07,407
is what the girl you like
thinks of it.

1804
02:33:08,055 --> 02:33:09,204
That I don't know.

1805
02:33:09,415 --> 02:33:10,928
Then ask her.

1806
02:33:11,615 --> 02:33:12,809
What's she like?

1807
02:33:14,175 --> 02:33:15,290
Pretty?

1808
02:33:16,415 --> 02:33:18,406
-Very.
-Have you told her?

1809
02:33:19,695 --> 02:33:21,811
-It's not easy.
-I know.

1810
02:33:23,255 --> 02:33:24,688
But tell her anyway.

1811
02:33:24,895 --> 02:33:26,408
First tell her she's pretty,

1812
02:33:27,175 --> 02:33:28,847
then tell her so are you.

1813
02:33:29,055 --> 02:33:31,444
-What does that mean?
-You're handsome.

1814
02:33:31,655 --> 02:33:34,647
The question is whether you look
better with or without the beard.

1815
02:33:35,335 --> 02:33:37,132
Is she funny?

1816
02:33:38,255 --> 02:33:39,449
I don't think so.

1817
02:33:39,695 --> 02:33:42,926
-Forget plan A. Plan B.
-Jump her bones?

1818
02:33:43,135 --> 02:33:46,571
How could I tell my nephew
to do such a thing?

1819
02:33:47,975 --> 02:33:49,203
What's her name?

1820
02:33:50,855 --> 02:33:52,811
-Ermione.
-Ermione?

1821
02:33:54,815 --> 02:33:56,043
Jump her bones.

1822
02:33:56,255 --> 02:33:58,644
Get out of here!
I couldn't.

1823
02:33:59,095 --> 02:34:00,892
I know you couldn't.

1824
02:34:01,295 --> 02:34:04,446
-Let go.
-No, I won't!

1825
02:34:12,455 --> 02:34:15,094
The happy couple.

1826
02:34:16,735 --> 02:34:19,647
-Such beautiful curls!
-Leave him alone, Dad.

1827
02:34:19,855 --> 02:34:21,573
Fine, I won't touch.

1828
02:34:22,175 --> 02:34:23,733
I need to talk to you.

1829
02:34:25,055 --> 02:34:26,374
Come on.

1830
02:34:28,255 --> 02:34:29,449
What is it?

1831
02:34:31,215 --> 02:34:32,614
<i>Sara, my love:</i>

1832
02:34:33,295 --> 02:34:35,763
<i>I'm working in Florence,
at the library.</i>

1833
02:34:36,015 --> 02:34:40,054
<i>The other day I saw a newspaper
from 1966</i>

1834
02:34:40,575 --> 02:34:43,009
<i>and I found a photo.
I thought you might want</i>

1835
02:34:43,215 --> 02:34:46,207
<i>to see what your mom and dad
looked like as kids.</i>

1836
02:34:46,495 --> 02:34:49,771
<i>You were born of the love
between two happy people,</i>

1837
02:34:50,055 --> 02:34:51,966
<i>and all the sadness
that came after</i>

1838
02:34:52,175 --> 02:34:54,325
<i>had nothing to do with you.</i>

1839
02:34:55,415 --> 02:34:58,088
<i>I'm trying to start over,
far away from everyone.</i>

1840
02:34:58,415 --> 02:35:00,565
<i>I know my presence bothers you,</i>

1841
02:35:00,975 --> 02:35:03,535
<i>and I hate to bother anyone.</i>

1842
02:35:06,655 --> 02:35:07,804
It came a few days ago.

1843
02:35:14,735 --> 02:35:16,054
That's you and Mom, right?

1844
02:35:18,695 --> 02:35:20,492
In Florence, in 1966.

1845
02:35:23,575 --> 02:35:24,928
What do I do?

1846
02:35:27,495 --> 02:35:29,565
It depends how strong you are.

1847
02:35:30,495 --> 02:35:33,328
-Are you happy?
-Of course!

1848
02:35:36,375 --> 02:35:38,491
Then it's time to be generous.

1849
02:35:42,095 --> 02:35:44,006
Goodbye!

1850
02:36:41,015 --> 02:36:43,404
IN MEMORY OF THE AID
GIVEN TO FLORENCE

1851
02:36:43,615 --> 02:36:46,652
BY YOUTHS FROM ITALY
AND ABRO AD

1852
02:36:46,855 --> 02:36:49,244
AFTER THE FLOODS IN 1966

1853
02:37:10,575 --> 02:37:11,610
Mom!

1854
02:37:13,415 --> 02:37:14,894
Giulia!

1855
02:37:40,775 --> 02:37:41,924
Sara.

1856
02:37:43,735 --> 02:37:45,054
Mom!

1857
02:37:52,135 --> 02:37:53,853
Mom, have you got a bed?

1858
02:37:54,815 --> 02:37:56,931
Yeah, mine,
but it's small.

1859
02:37:57,295 --> 02:37:58,648
We'll squeeze in.

1860
02:37:59,255 --> 02:38:02,053
I'd rather sleep here.
I don't feel like driving.

1861
02:38:02,775 --> 02:38:04,003
-Hello.
-Yes?

1862
02:38:04,215 --> 02:38:06,331
-Can you take our picture?
-Sure.

1863
02:38:09,415 --> 02:38:11,975
Here goes.
Move your heads closer.

1864
02:38:12,375 --> 02:38:13,933
Say "cheese."

1865
02:38:15,215 --> 02:38:16,443
-There.
-Thanks.

1866
02:38:16,655 --> 02:38:19,123
<i>-You're welcome.
-Arigato.</i>

1867
02:38:20,335 --> 02:38:21,654
<i>"Arigato."</i>

1868
02:38:23,775 --> 02:38:27,131
Let's go do a little shopping.

1869
02:38:27,415 --> 02:38:29,087
For my new house.

1870
02:38:29,615 --> 02:38:31,048
Where can we go...?

1871
02:38:31,935 --> 02:38:34,210
There's lots of stuff here.

1872
02:38:35,015 --> 02:38:38,928
This could be for bread,
but it's too sad for me.

1873
02:38:39,295 --> 02:38:42,014
These would be okay
for plate settings.

1874
02:38:43,095 --> 02:38:45,484
I don't know.
For pots...

1875
02:38:45,695 --> 02:38:48,004
Something brighter,
that stands out.

1876
02:38:49,695 --> 02:38:50,844
What's that?

1877
02:38:51,255 --> 02:38:52,893
A cast to make hats.

1878
02:38:53,975 --> 02:38:56,569
-Can we have a look?
-Sure.

1879
02:38:56,775 --> 02:38:57,924
Thank you.

1880
02:39:24,735 --> 02:39:26,805
It's the famous
"Maestro di Santo Spirito."

1881
02:39:27,495 --> 02:39:31,249
Two brothers painted it,
Domenico del Mazziere's sons,

1882
02:39:31,655 --> 02:39:33,054
Agnolo and Donnino.

1883
02:39:33,335 --> 02:39:35,929
But I like Donnino
much better,

1884
02:39:36,175 --> 02:39:38,564
I think he painted the baby.

1885
02:39:38,775 --> 02:39:40,003
Look at it.

1886
02:39:41,255 --> 02:39:42,654
It's beautiful.

1887
02:39:42,935 --> 02:39:45,654
"ll Maestro de la Conversazzione
di Santo Spirito."

1888
02:39:46,095 --> 02:39:49,724
And this is one of
Maso di Banco's greatest works.

1889
02:39:49,935 --> 02:39:51,573
My favorite.

1890
02:39:52,695 --> 02:39:54,845
All these virgins with babies...

1891
02:39:57,055 --> 02:39:59,046
Why do you like them so much?

1892
02:40:02,815 --> 02:40:04,294
You're pregnant!

1893
02:40:04,935 --> 02:40:06,687
Nobody knows yet.

1894
02:40:13,455 --> 02:40:15,332
How can I help?

1895
02:40:16,255 --> 02:40:18,132
There is one thing you can do.

1896
02:40:18,575 --> 02:40:21,135
-What?
-Play for me.

1897
02:40:22,335 --> 02:40:24,690
-Where? How?
-There's an organ.

1898
02:40:27,935 --> 02:40:30,529
I haven't played in ages.
I can't.

1899
02:40:31,255 --> 02:40:34,611
Besides, we'd have
to ask for permission.

1900
02:40:35,575 --> 02:40:37,213
Fine, forget it.

1901
02:40:39,335 --> 02:40:41,565
I ask only one thing of you,

1902
02:40:41,775 --> 02:40:44,494
and you can't because
we have to ask permission?

1903
02:40:45,775 --> 02:40:47,208
You wanted to change

1904
02:40:47,415 --> 02:40:50,134
the world and now you need
permission to play?

1905
02:42:19,735 --> 02:42:21,054
Right.

1906
02:42:22,335 --> 02:42:24,053
Let's go.

1907
02:42:29,095 --> 02:42:31,086
One more?

1908
02:42:31,375 --> 02:42:33,411
No. I'm dead.

1909
02:42:37,735 --> 02:42:39,168
I'll abstain.

1910
02:42:47,535 --> 02:42:50,811
Give me a hand,
I need a crane.

1911
02:42:52,055 --> 02:42:54,489
-Slowly...
-Easy.

1912
02:42:55,935 --> 02:42:59,814
-Slowly...
-What are we doing?

1913
02:43:00,575 --> 02:43:01,769
Careful.

1914
02:43:03,895 --> 02:43:07,410
This way,
the exit's over here.

1915
02:43:11,135 --> 02:43:12,124
However...

1916
02:43:13,095 --> 02:43:13,925
you

1917
02:43:14,855 --> 02:43:18,086
should get one thing
straight in your mind.

1918
02:43:19,375 --> 02:43:21,969
-Should I?
-Go ahead.

1919
02:43:23,735 --> 02:43:24,884
I will.

1920
02:43:25,455 --> 02:43:29,573
Stop thinking of your brother
Matteo as an obstacle.

1921
02:43:29,895 --> 02:43:32,773
If you continue to think of him
as an obstacle

1922
02:43:32,975 --> 02:43:34,931
you'll end up hating him.

1923
02:43:36,775 --> 02:43:38,049
Are you drunk?

1924
02:43:39,415 --> 02:43:41,167
Yes. Good night.

1925
02:43:45,695 --> 02:43:47,014
However...

1926
02:43:50,935 --> 02:43:52,163
However.

1927
02:44:03,335 --> 02:44:06,054
-It's okay.
-There was a thigh there.

1928
02:44:06,255 --> 02:44:07,847
You made a mess.

1929
02:44:20,015 --> 02:44:22,245
Sure you won't come
to the wedding?

1930
02:44:23,535 --> 02:44:26,174
No, I'll come visit
when the baby's born.

1931
02:44:26,815 --> 02:44:27,804
You promise?

1932
02:44:30,055 --> 02:44:31,010
Good.

1933
02:44:37,615 --> 02:44:39,048
Do you always wear those?

1934
02:44:39,895 --> 02:44:41,044
The sunglasses?

1935
02:44:43,695 --> 02:44:45,014
You look better without.

1936
02:44:46,895 --> 02:44:48,851
-Bye.
-Bye, sweetie.

1937
02:45:28,015 --> 02:45:30,051
-Good morning.
-Morning.

1938
02:45:30,935 --> 02:45:32,004
-Hi.
-Hi.

1939
02:45:34,055 --> 02:45:35,010
Hi.

1940
02:45:43,575 --> 02:45:44,803
You want some coffee?

1941
02:45:45,895 --> 02:45:47,248
Yes, thank you.

1942
02:45:54,615 --> 02:45:57,971
-Have you had breakfast?
-Yes. Some milk?

1943
02:45:59,895 --> 02:46:01,123
Yes, thank you.

1944
02:46:12,255 --> 02:46:13,893
Did you sleep
in your clothes?

1945
02:46:14,095 --> 02:46:15,414
No, I didn't sleep.

1946
02:46:16,255 --> 02:46:18,450
Are you worried
about something?

1947
02:46:20,895 --> 02:46:22,089
Sara?

1948
02:46:22,495 --> 02:46:23,848
No, not at all.

1949
02:49:04,935 --> 02:49:06,846
That time, on the boat,

1950
02:49:07,415 --> 02:49:08,848
I wanted to kiss you.

1951
02:49:09,255 --> 02:49:10,608
Me, too.

1952
02:49:19,335 --> 02:49:25,683
NORWAY
SPRING OF 2003

1953
02:49:46,055 --> 02:49:47,249
<i>Dear uncle...</i>

1954
02:49:47,455 --> 02:49:49,446
<i>or should I call you Dad?</i>

1955
02:49:50,095 --> 02:49:51,050
<i>Anyway...</i>

1956
02:49:51,415 --> 02:49:54,088
<i>Dear Nicola:
We finally made it.</i>

1957
02:49:55,255 --> 02:49:56,847
<i>Sometimes I think I recognize</i>

1958
02:49:57,055 --> 02:49:59,728
<i>the places described to me
when I was a kid.</i>

1959
02:50:00,495 --> 02:50:02,451
<i>Maybe it's just a fantasy.</i>

1960
02:50:14,815 --> 02:50:17,045
<i>It's nice doing things
with the people you love,</i>

1961
02:50:17,335 --> 02:50:19,087
<i>even though Ermione
is very stubborn</i>

1962
02:50:19,295 --> 02:50:21,092
<i>and always changing her mind.</i>

1963
02:50:21,575 --> 02:50:23,008
<i>Are they all like that?</i>

1964
02:50:23,375 --> 02:50:26,526
Why not?
Where are you going?

1965
02:50:26,935 --> 02:50:28,050
Go on!

1966
02:50:28,495 --> 02:50:30,213
Come on, please!
Come here!

1967
02:50:30,415 --> 02:50:34,044
<i>I convinced Ermione to take a flight
with me to Cape North.</i>

1968
02:50:34,655 --> 02:50:37,852
<i>She's terrified,
but it'll save us three days.</i>

1969
02:51:15,935 --> 02:51:19,371
<i>I see the midnight sun
fall to the horizon,</i>

1970
02:51:19,815 --> 02:51:21,931
<i>but then it stops
and never reaches the sea.</i>

1971
02:51:22,615 --> 02:51:25,368
<i>I remember my father,
my mother and you,</i>

1972
02:51:26,135 --> 02:51:28,205
<i>how you always say
that everything is beautiful.</i>

1973
02:51:28,535 --> 02:51:32,130
<i>I think you're right.
Everything is really beautiful.</i>
