1
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:52,281
- I should get a Rune Pedersen.
- Exactly.

2
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:57,926
It is you who is Rune, what? Come with me. This way.

3
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:12,567
So.

4
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:20,483
That you will not have to enter. Not there either. And is not it.

5
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,805
Take off your clothes. Alt.

6
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:30,967
Pants, underpants, undershirt ... Alt.

7
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:41,204
Stand over there and go down on their haunches!

8
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:46,119
Farther down. Up again.

9
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:51,197
Lift left foot. Thank you. Right. Thank you.

10
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:56,038
Spit out the gum! Thank you.

11
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:59,718
Gap and stretch out your tongue!

12
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:03,364
Hands. Palms upward.

13
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:07,004
Run them through your hair this way.

14
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,802
Thank you.

15
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:20,916
Out of curiosity ... What have you done to end up on the 4-West?

16
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:27,761
The other is the much greater than you. You should know that awaits you.

17
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:32,803
They know you're going. You must have done something very stupid.

18
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,279
Bear!

19
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:16,606
What will the new cell have?

20
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:19,959
He should have 465

21
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,204
Come here.

22
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,400
465 is your cell. Welcome.

23
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:02,004
Is everything okay?

24
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:28,918
- What do you want?
- Can I get the cleaning?

25
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:34,361
- I want to wash the cell.
- It will do later.

26
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,162
You are out in the yard first.

27
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:20,757
Claus! What will you do with it?

28
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:26,201
It's ok. He said it was too soft.

29
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:30,686
- It's not yours.
- He will not have it.

30
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:33,880
It belongs to the cell.

31
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,285
Be so good. Add it to your cell!

32
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:43,358
- He will not have it!
- Shut up. Otherwise, go to bed.

33
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:50,679
The whole gang. If someone says a knyst to, then it's goodnight.

34
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:56,918
Helmuth, you varførst. Go into the cell! Good night!

35
00:06:57,128 --> 00:07:00,165
You can also enter the cell.

36
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:04,805
Are there any more that would be smart?

37
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,683
Now what the heck me be quiet!

38
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,799
Thank you.

39
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:14,444
It's unbelievable.

40
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:33,168
Welcome to Horsens!

41
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:32,319
Come here. Lie still!

42
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:37,556
I've been waiting for you. It was my buddy to put down.

43
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,443
Such things can not get away with.

44
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:46,119
Either tap the other, or you'll get credit.

45
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:51,686
You should take the guy in the red jacket. He goes next to the Negro.

46
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:56,086
Look at him! Remember how he looks!

47
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:59,598
Look at me! Do you remember him?

48
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:03,483
Give him credit, or you'll get credit.

49
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,885
Put now before I change my opinion!

50
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,203
Do you have cigarette, Sune?

51
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:41,366
- Can I get one?
- Sure.

52
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:11,360
What the hell laughing at? What's so funny?

53
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:16,084
Walls, give a damn about it! Go out and calm down!

54
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:21,086
Be seated!

55
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:31,078
I heard that you should do one thing for us.

56
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:37,965
Think you can do it?

57
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:44,959
There are Albanians. Drive out the teeth on him.

58
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:51,641
Do it in the second floor when we are in the yard, when the guards are not there.

59
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:56,968
Make it real! He will not be able to come back for a while.

60
00:11:57,168 --> 00:12:01,286
- What happens to me afterwards?
- Nothing.

61
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,685
You fit just yourself.

62
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:43,797
Out in the yard, you are last!

63
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:47,881
Otherwise there will be nothing.

64
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,886
Set up the pace if you want to go out!

65
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:34,361
- Though with some fresh air.
- I can penetrate.

66
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,965
<i>Now I close fourth.</i>

67
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,439
Next.

68
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:15,607
Be quiet. Shut up and calm you down!

69
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,966
Not more shit now.

70
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:39,083
I'm sick of this. Next time it will be the hole!

71
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,598
Shut up and do what you will!

72
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:48,721
Thank you.

73
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:52,716
Your turn. Come here.

74
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,802
Turn around.

75
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,238
Next.

76
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:40,605
<i>- We close a vdelingen.
- Into c ellene.</i>

77
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,398
<i>468 closed.</i>

78
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,327
465 closed.

79
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:54,161
<i>461 closed.</i>

80
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:04,407
When we go, buddy. Extinguish it there!

81
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:07,566
Faster.

82
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:15,039
Come on!

83
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:18,797
What did you do the stairs?

84
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:23,559
What did you do the stairs? Reply!

85
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:28,398
Who beat him? You know for sure. Answer me!

86
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:35,040
You owed the other a service. If you are not new there?

87
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:40,766
- Are not you? Answer properly!
- I do not know, damn it!

88
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:46,247
Do not you know? Are you stupid? What?

89
00:19:56,768 --> 00:20:02,286
Tell us now. You did, huh? What?

90
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:05,844
Go to hell, you fucking pig!

91
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:14,763
- No mertull. Answer now!
- I do not know, damn it!

92
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:20,406
Well, you know it. You are full of crap. Who did it? Answer now!

93
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:23,202
"I don't know!"

94
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:28,326
Then a few days of solitary confinement.

95
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:11,599
Hello, my friend. Have you come back?

96
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,997
Have you missed me?

97
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,676
I've missed you.

98
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:28,278
What are you hiding?

99
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:30,604
Nothing.

100
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:34,960
Turn around, then and show me nothing.

101
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:42,682
- To Hell. Is it your sister?
- It's my boyfriend.

102
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:47,200
Is that your girlfriend? She is leaking.

103
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,525
How the heck could you get her?

104
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:55,116
Are you in control of her?

105
00:22:55,328 --> 00:23:00,686
Do you know what she's doing now? She fucks a nigger for sure.

106
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:05,564
Shit so clean and tidy you have it.

107
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:11,445
The clothes are fine. Has your mom been here?

108
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:17,199
Do you like to clean?

109
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:21,117
- What?
- It's ok.

110
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,845
You are so damn good to clean ...

111
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:35,998
A fucking idiot piss off the leader. You can wash it.

112
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,439
Could you do it?

113
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:41,923
- What?
Yes

114
00:23:44,728 --> 00:23:48,846
- Keep them for me! Want to taste?
No

115
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:54,201
Do not you want one? Take a fucking grape now!

116
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:02,000
Are not they good?

117
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,324
Gap!

118
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:07,997
One more time.

119
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,004
One more time. Gap now.

120
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,723
One more time.

121
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:21,478
One more time. Gap. Higher!

122
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:26,317
Sune!

123
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:32,558
- What are you doing here?
- See here. That's his girlfriend.

124
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:39,245
It is not his girlfriend. Do you have nude pictures of her?

125
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:41,803
Want to buy some?

126
00:24:55,248 --> 00:25:00,083
Check the type walls. He looks Rune.

127
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,324
Taste in hairstyles.

128
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:05,884
- Is it really clean now?
- What?

129
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:11,082
Can you put a baby there? Add you there!

130
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:16,521
Add yourself now like a little baby! In the fetal position.

131
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:20,721
On the side and pull up my legs.

132
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:24,045
Suck on your thumb now.

133
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:28,683
So fucking pathetic you are! Get up.

134
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:41,599
You know what? You are doing a good job.

135
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,766
You can get this-

136
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:49,723
- And dick sucking pictures and with hairy legs.

137
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:54,604
But it lets you hang.

138
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:59,120
- Nice, huh? Say that I'm good!
- You are kind.

139
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:01,603
I thought you almost.

140
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:06,686
Rune ...

141
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:12,246
You will help me as much as you help masons.

142
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:17,841
I'm beginning to dislike you. Do you understand?

143
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:21,927
When I say "jump", so you just ask "how high".

144
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:25,120
I take no more shit now.

145
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,557
What happens?

146
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:52,319
We went not to the same transport?

147
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:55,201
My name is Rashid.

148
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,961
Rune.

149
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:04,242
- How long will you sit?
- Two years.

150
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:08,327
You?
- One year.

151
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:12,806
With good behavior, it is probably less.

152
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:20,606
- Is there anyone who bothers you?
- No, it is not.

153
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:25,757
Take it easy. No one bothers me either.

154
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:37,397
- Want a cigarette?
- No, I do not smoke.

155
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:43,399
- Thinking of your health. Do you like your job?
- It's quiet and nice.

156
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:47,647
- It's better than cleaning up.
- What the heck are you doing?

157
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:52,285
Get some friends! I'll talk to him.

158
00:28:54,248 --> 00:28:59,686
After work, go to the cell and stay there for half an hour.

159
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:06,366
Do not go, masons. I will talk to you.

160
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:10,686
Do not stand and hang. Give me a towel!

161
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:14,164
A clean towel, damn.

162
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:22,240
- What happened on the ward yesterday?
- What do you mean?

163
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:24,803
Yes, he said.

164
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,717
This ertåpelig. It was the third time.

165
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:33,126
- You have to recruit better people.
- It is not easy.

166
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:35,080
Fuck him.

167
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:39,600
You can take a proper chat with him.

168
00:31:39,808 --> 00:31:43,847
- I will not see him again.
- No problems.

169
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:46,357
Sharpen up now.

170
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:16,286
- Are you ready?
- I'll just ...

171
00:32:16,488 --> 00:32:20,083
You are ready. I will talk to you.

172
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:29,167
It should be something that the guards can not see.

173
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:34,647
Go and soap into the windows to guard the room, so they can not see out.

174
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:51,765
Jesper, what does he do? Have you spoken out about it?

175
00:32:57,048 --> 00:33:00,961
- What are you doing?
- I polish the windows.

176
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:08,198
- What was that?
- Go out of office!

177
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:13,282
- What are you doing?
- Wiper windows. Kim said yesterday.

178
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:17,686
- Have you heard anything about it?
- He said it yesterday.

179
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:22,837
I'd take the floor and windows. It's dirty here.

180
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:24,959
So go ahead, then.

181
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:34,441
Nicely. Do the rest too!

182
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:53,277
Alarm! An attack down here. Come, quick!

183
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,646
Hurry!

184
00:33:57,848 --> 00:33:59,918
Go!

185
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:05,803
Stay away!

186
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:08,568
To hell!

187
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:53,519
What the hell ... Do not like my drawings?

188
00:34:56,888 --> 00:35:00,198
Have you rolled a joint for us?

189
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,687
Keep watch at the door!

190
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,276
Shall I light it?

191
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:29,403
So you got the order of things?

192
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:34,606
Right on the nose. He howled.

193
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:39,836
We threw him into the sink. And into the radiator.

194
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:44,280
Into the shower. Then he was silent.

195
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:50,723
I had to drag him away in the end. "Now hold up," I screamed.

196
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:55,206
I do not know if he heard it, but he has enough understood

197
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:02,838
I had said that smoke and money should not be arrived at once.

198
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:07,519
- Then we have the second problem.
- I know.

199
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:11,198
We must think of what to do.

200
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:14,764
The monkeys down there has not gained anything in three weeks.

201
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:19,041
After that the Albanians breasts themselves.

202
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:24,402
Think out something, otherwise we lose livelihood. Close the door.

203
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:47,046
Move up.

204
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:52,242
You can damn well do not open the door when I stand here with a joint?

205
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:54,564
Think about it!

206
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:06,637
Hi, Grandma. It's Rune.

207
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,284
It goes well. How are you?

208
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:15,642
That's good. I wonder if you want to visit me.

209
00:38:15,848 --> 00:38:18,203
In Horsens.

210
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:22,526
Take with you some of Kinder eggs that I like.

211
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:26,323
Kinderegg. Sjokoladeegg.

212
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:32,603
That's good. I can not talk more now. Bye.

213
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:40,643
- What happens?
- Not much.

214
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:43,760
I never finished the dishes.

215
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:48,519
You are on 2-West, what? Can you do me a favor?

216
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:52,084
Go to the first toilet to the left.

217
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:58,124
Check whether you can open the door that sits at the bottom of toilet seat.

218
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:00,967
I'm coming!

219
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:03,398
Do it.

220
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:17,641
Say stop!

221
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:20,885
Do you get smoke here?

222
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:36,038
- How are you?
- Good.

223
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:41,363
You've lost weight, huh?

224
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,446
- I think it?
- Yes, it does.

225
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:51,087
- Do you get good food? What did you today?
- Potatoes.

226
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:56,521
- You must surely have been something more?
- It was hash.

227
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:07,402
It feels strange to sit here. I do not know what to say.

228
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,645
Can not we just sit here?

229
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:18,117
I have something for you.

230
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:21,126
These.

231
00:40:21,328 --> 00:40:25,924
- It was such you would have?
Yes

232
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:37,124
- Thank you.
- Do not take everything!

233
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:49,042
- You must show what was inside.
- Should I open it?

234
00:40:55,608 --> 00:40:57,963
A small lion.

235
00:40:58,168 --> 00:41:02,320
Remember when we were in the zoo? It liked you.

236
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:07,158
We were often there. You never got enough.

237
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:11,839
We went to the circus and all sorts of places.

238
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:16,121
You were a very happy boy.

239
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,407
You were always so happy.

240
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:29,081
Dear boy ... Soon it is over and then you're going to get it good.

241
00:41:29,288 --> 00:41:32,598
It will work out forever.

242
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:41,201
- You must give me a hug.
- Grandmother ...

243
00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:43,797
It must.

244
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:46,647
Pass the coffee!

245
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:50,084
Ok.

246
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:57,281
Get your head.

247
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:01,122
Get your head.

248
00:42:01,888 --> 00:42:05,324
Bye, Rune.

249
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:07,803
We erferdig.

250
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:32,326
- Could you open it?
Yes

251
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:36,237
- Can you stick your hand?
- Do it.

252
00:42:36,448 --> 00:42:40,441
Go into the bathroom at seven.

253
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:43,799
The time now seven sticking your hand when I flush.

254
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:48,684
Then, tap three times when you have caught it.

255
00:42:48,888 --> 00:42:54,918
You'll see what it is when you take it. Do not forget to put the hatch in place.

256
00:42:55,128 --> 00:42:58,325
No one will know what we do.

257
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:47,805
<i>Rune ....</i>

258
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:51,796
<i>- Open!
- I'll bore shit done.</i>

259
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:57,605
<i>Close up now, otherwise I'm going to give a shit c ella di.</i>

260
00:43:57,808 --> 00:44:01,084
<i>- Now, damn it!
- I come.</i>

261
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:07,724
Did you get it? That I sent down.

262
00:44:07,928 --> 00:44:10,601
There was nothing.

263
00:44:15,608 --> 00:44:18,725
If you do not believe this, then.

264
00:44:25,408 --> 00:44:30,436
- Don 't you see what we can do now?
- Yes, I'm not completely stupid.

265
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:37,363
- Which banks?
- Is there Mince woodpecker?

266
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:42,119
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Come in.

267
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:46,884
During the four eyes.

268
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:53,722
Under four eyes? It sounds dirty. Are you dirty?

269
00:44:56,008 --> 00:44:59,205
"What is it?"
- I can help you.

270
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:02,605
- With what?
- With it there.

271
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:05,800
Close the door and sit down!

272
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:16,966
I can get things down to the 2-West.

273
00:45:17,168 --> 00:45:20,205
First on Krita. So money in advance.

274
00:45:20,408 --> 00:45:25,641
If something disappears, I pay. Otherwise I will have a share.

275
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,477
And then you leave me in peace.

276
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:34,125
Let you alone? Only if it works out.

277
00:45:34,328 --> 00:45:37,001
It does.

278
00:45:40,928 --> 00:45:43,726
Think about it.

279
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:51,518
Why? I have nothing to lose. Say that the masons to come back.

280
00:45:56,968 --> 00:46:00,722
What is it? Your little gay.

281
00:46:06,488 --> 00:46:08,080
Swallowed him?

282
00:46:22,928 --> 00:46:26,000
I will talk to you.

283
00:46:29,288 --> 00:46:32,200
You should go help us.

284
00:46:32,408 --> 00:46:36,367
Close the door. I have something for you.

285
00:46:42,168 --> 00:46:44,318
Do not look.

286
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:20,237
- Hello.
- What happens?

287
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:27,359
Wait there.

288
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:39,238
- It lacks a bundle.
- Yes, I know.

289
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:41,359
Be so good.

290
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:53,042
- How you tell them?
- It's not my money.

291
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:58,527
- I need to know how much it is.
- Do you think I trick you?

292
00:49:10,968 --> 00:49:16,838
- It lacks a 50-patch.
- No, it does not.

293
00:49:17,048 --> 00:49:19,801
Yes, it does.

294
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:27,401
Bullshit. I almost got heart attack.

295
00:49:27,608 --> 00:49:32,045
- This goes well.
- Where is bloody good!

296
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:36,480
It could not have gone better. Yes, it could ...

297
00:49:36,688 --> 00:49:40,078
- How are you?
- Good.

298
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:39,198
I will talk to you. Come!

299
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:42,964
The road.

300
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:55,408
What do you say about air change? Mini to move. You can get the cell.

301
00:50:55,608 --> 00:51:01,285
This view is slightly better than on the other side.

302
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:13,844
And then we have poker night tonight. It's just to get there.

303
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:36,599
- Johnny agrees. The old, then?
- I give myself.

304
00:51:36,808 --> 00:51:41,165
- Now we will see a great hand.
- Yes, it comes.

305
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:47,683
- Holy shit so bad you give.
- I know.

306
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:50,880
I give myself.

307
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:55,637
Do you like to rub up against me?

308
00:51:59,488 --> 00:52:05,563
- I am so fucking sick of you!
- I'm just joking.

309
00:52:05,768 --> 00:52:08,441
Do you think it was funny?

310
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:37,124
- Do you like your new apartment?
- It's fine.

311
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:40,286
You are now on the sunny side.

312
00:52:42,528 --> 00:52:48,524
The lady up there, I know. Visit her up too?

313
00:52:48,728 --> 00:52:53,882
I found this inside of walls.

314
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,602
Thank you.

315
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:12,324
- Now, Ladby. Is the game soon?
- It begins to approach.

316
00:53:12,528 --> 00:53:16,282
- We have marked the path.
- We had to help him.

317
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:22,444
- Should we have heating first?
- No, they have warmed up enough.

318
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:26,687
- Who plays?
- QPR against FCK.

319
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:30,927
Queers Park plays in yellow. They can not escape.

320
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:35,599
- They often try to escape.
- Yes, they do.

321
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:39,483
Now it is immediately kick off.

322
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:42,361
The game is started.

323
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:47,198
It is an own goal! The first goal ...

324
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:50,047
We lead with a 1-0!

325
00:53:50,248 --> 00:53:52,284
Queers Park ...

326
00:53:53,528 --> 00:53:56,486
1-1. Is he alone on the track?

327
00:53:56,688 --> 00:54:02,285
Now it is clear. Come on, Queers Park.

328
00:54:05,848 --> 00:54:10,205
Own goals again. The goalkeeper is ready and staring!

329
00:54:10,408 --> 00:54:14,640
What is this? I put in more food.

330
00:54:14,848 --> 00:54:18,443
- The lining makes them focused.
- He is angry ...

331
00:54:22,328 --> 00:54:24,398
Close the door!

332
00:54:25,408 --> 00:54:27,842
Quiet and calm.

333
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:33,603
Do not be afraid of it!

334
00:54:36,448 --> 00:54:39,406
It does not take much to ...

335
00:54:47,488 --> 00:54:51,276
For hell, come now.

336
00:54:57,848 --> 00:55:02,876
You little bastard! Open the cage. Is it a predator you have?

337
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:37,565
- Do you know who have small dick?
- Who?

338
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,840
- Walls.
No

339
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:44,518
- Why check your cocks?
- Do not you?

340
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:47,720
If you have never checked anyone else's dick?

341
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:54,720
- I stand up and do not stare.
- It allows for the heck not me either!

342
00:55:54,928 --> 00:55:58,125
I'll just happen to see ...

343
00:56:02,248 --> 00:56:07,481
If you are finished, we have food to be made and dishes are included.

344
00:56:07,688 --> 00:56:11,601
Go ahead! Is that understood?

345
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:50,319
- 3-2 to the Danes!
- You play fucking good.

346
00:57:15,408 --> 00:57:18,286
What is it, man?

347
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:21,207
I know what you're doing.

348
00:57:21,408 --> 00:57:26,721
As of now do business directly with me.

349
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:30,364
I do not know what you're talking about.

350
00:57:30,568 --> 00:57:34,880
"Do not know" ... Are you a stupid Danish?

351
00:57:35,088 --> 00:57:37,522
Are you stupid or what?

352
00:57:37,728 --> 00:57:40,959
Or is it Rashid who is lying?

353
00:57:41,168 --> 00:57:43,841
Should I talk to him?

354
00:57:45,928 --> 00:57:51,161
So can I talk to walls. He will certainly know.

355
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:54,678
- Ahmed, set up the goal!
the word "why?"

356
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,527
Because I said so.

357
00:57:59,448 --> 00:58:05,045
- Okay. Then I will have the same price,
- We can not talk about it now.

358
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:08,001
Are you still here? Put!

359
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:12,924
Sune!

360
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,960
You should not have told how we are doing.

361
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:52,047
I had no choice.

362
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:57,402
Now I have to do business with Bazhir, and I do not trust him.

363
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:03,956
- It's me who carries it.
- The same who have it in the ass.

364
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:08,446
We are worthless now that everyone knows how we are doing.

365
00:59:08,648 --> 00:59:12,960
You'd understand if you were in my situation.

366
00:59:19,248 --> 00:59:24,003
I want a decent chunk. More than usual.

367
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,961
How much?

368
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:32,037
How much will the small Arab space? Three times the usual.

369
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:36,526
- I can not fix.
- Yes, do it.

370
00:59:37,648 --> 00:59:44,963
What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of the tattooed gay?

371
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:48,205
See why I get it tonight!

372
00:59:48,408 --> 00:59:51,957
Have you heard that Albanians are here again?

373
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:28,282
Can I talk to you?

374
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:40,279
I will send three times more than usual tonight.

375
01:00:45,288 --> 01:00:48,564
You obviously trust the monkeys there.

376
01:00:48,768 --> 01:00:54,684
Can you do it? It is you who have problems if something goes wrong.

377
01:00:54,888 --> 01:00:57,641
You'll take the chance.

378
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:02,968
Where's my queue?

379
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:09,843
Fire.

380
01:02:11,568 --> 01:02:14,241
You made good today.

381
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,402
What happens?

382
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:33,523
- Do you have my ...?
- I have no money.

383
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:40,719
I swear that I do not have them.

384
01:02:43,168 --> 01:02:46,478
He said you had made it that way.

385
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:26,601
What are you staring at?

386
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:42,763
Fix your money! I do not care how you do it, but do it.

387
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:47,598
I know nothing. I thought that you and Bazhir had a deal.

388
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:04,166
Reply parliaments are trying to fool us.

389
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:08,441
- Is it you he talks to?
Don't know?

390
01:05:08,648 --> 01:05:12,163
- The monkeys messing with us.
- Which "us"?

391
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:18,000
- Reply parliaments fooled us.
- What the hell do you mean by "us"?

392
01:05:21,368 --> 01:05:25,759
Have you money? Listen up, damn it!

393
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:29,563
- Do you have money?
- Yes. No problems.

394
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:33,283
- What moves you about, then?
- The monkeys are trying to fool us.

395
01:05:33,488 --> 01:05:36,844
- Who they are wondering?
- Us!

396
01:05:37,048 --> 01:05:40,961
Which "us"? There is no "us"!

397
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:55,606
What's so fun?

398
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:08,436
Grandmother, it's Rune.

399
01:06:08,648 --> 01:06:13,005
Thanks for visiting. Yes, that was nice.

400
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:19,602
Yes, Grandma, you have some spare money?

401
01:06:19,808 --> 01:06:23,278
Save Money. Money.

402
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:27,803
No

403
01:06:30,328 --> 01:06:32,637
It does not matter.

404
01:06:32,848 --> 01:06:37,922
Take it easy, Grandma. There is no problem. I was just wondering.

405
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,244
Bye.

406
01:06:41,688 --> 01:06:43,883
Our Lord and Savior.

407
01:06:44,088 --> 01:06:48,127
You who are with us with all your love wealth.

408
01:06:48,328 --> 01:06:51,479
Let us receive your flesh and blood

409
01:06:51,688 --> 01:06:56,125
- In memory of you and as confirmation of our faith.

410
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:24,317
I have talked with the old.

411
01:07:24,528 --> 01:07:28,043
You have an outstanding.

412
01:07:28,248 --> 01:07:31,923
I have it under control.

413
01:07:35,768 --> 01:07:40,888
- You control nothing.
- I find it out.

414
01:07:41,088 --> 01:07:46,845
The down there have something that is ours, and that you have gone for good.

415
01:07:47,048 --> 01:07:53,362
- I'm going for a solution.
- Say it again, so I turn up.

416
01:07:57,888 --> 01:08:01,278
Do you realize how serious this is?

417
01:08:04,968 --> 01:08:08,881
The only reason that Ali is not hartatt you, -

418
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:15,163
- Is that the old has protected you. But it's over with now.

419
01:08:16,288 --> 01:08:19,758
You must think of something.

420
01:08:19,968 --> 01:08:24,484
Will not you at something, do it another.

421
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,882
Sleep well.

422
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:03,766
You owe me money.

423
01:09:03,968 --> 01:09:06,766
What the hell is wrong with you?

424
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:09,482
You owe him money?

425
01:09:13,328 --> 01:09:15,967
I'll cut you, you bastard!

426
01:09:22,608 --> 01:09:24,758
You are dead, fucking gay.

427
01:09:30,608 --> 01:09:32,803
Keep him on!

428
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:50,766
Shut up, damn it!

429
01:09:56,688 --> 01:09:59,680
- Are you ready?
- Turn him!

430
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:08,241
Now he is strapped.

431
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:05,321
If you have both the showers? Do you have any problems, or?

432
01:13:58,008 --> 01:14:04,481
I spoke with Bazhir. He would like to buy some more.

433
01:14:04,688 --> 01:14:09,045
The guards took his money. It was not his fault.

434
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:12,877
Come! We can not talk here.

435
01:14:13,088 --> 01:14:15,158
Come on, man.

436
01:16:43,288 --> 01:16:45,518
Rune ...

437
01:17:36,608 --> 01:17:38,439
Guard!

438
01:17:39,728 --> 01:17:45,325
Who went into the cold room? You must have seen something.

439
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:47,723
Answer now.

440
01:17:52,848 --> 01:17:56,363
Was not he your friend?

441
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:20,127
Rashid ... Walls will talk to you.

442
01:19:21,968 --> 01:19:24,357
How are you, Rashid?

443
01:19:24,568 --> 01:19:26,843
- How are you?
- Good.

444
01:19:27,048 --> 01:19:33,999
- They interrogated you, what? What happened?
- Nothing. What would happen?

445
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:37,996
Some speak when they are interrogated.

446
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:42,724
We sit in the shed. It's freaking cold.

447
01:19:45,048 --> 01:19:48,757
- Do you know what the morning coffee is?
No

448
01:19:48,968 --> 01:19:52,324
- Have you never heard of it?
- Is that coffee?

449
01:19:52,528 --> 01:19:56,043
He does not know what tomorrow's coffee.

450
01:19:56,248 --> 01:19:59,445
It is called at least morning coffee.

451
01:19:59,648 --> 01:20:06,042
You take the kettle and fill it with oil. Olive oil.

452
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:11,281
So pour a pound of sugar into it.

453
01:20:11,488 --> 01:20:14,719
And then the boil.

454
01:20:14,928 --> 01:20:19,638
When sugar is completely melted, -

455
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:23,921
- You go into the cell to the informer who, -

456
01:20:24,128 --> 01:20:28,565
- Pulling away the covers, nor the oil over him.

457
01:20:30,608 --> 01:20:36,319
There once was a little song bird that sat in my cell say.

458
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:40,480
We made the morning coffee for him.

459
01:20:40,688 --> 01:20:44,727
I have never heard anyone scream so much.

460
01:20:46,488 --> 01:20:51,801
Sometimes you have to set an example when someone is talking too much.

461
01:20:52,008 --> 01:20:54,647
That's why stuff happens.

462
01:20:59,768 --> 01:21:05,877
I just wanted you to know that. Now we drive on as usual.

463
01:21:27,568 --> 01:21:32,722
- What is he doing?
- He will eat. Give me a plate!

464
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:38,605
_jeg do not want him here.
- It's ok for me. Understood?

465
01:21:45,288 --> 01:21:48,963
Can you give him a fork?

466
01:21:49,168 --> 01:21:51,728
Eat now.

467
01:22:25,568 --> 01:22:29,038
"What is it?"
- It's ok.

468
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,320
It's tough.

469
01:22:32,528 --> 01:22:35,281
Real tough. I know.

470
01:22:35,488 --> 01:22:39,447
Fortunately it's not your fault.

471
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:46,086
- He should not die.
- It's the way it is here.

472
01:22:47,328 --> 01:22:50,718
Continue to be focused now.

473
01:22:50,928 --> 01:22:54,443
- You will not be here forever.
No

474
01:22:59,728 --> 01:23:06,679
Concentrate on your tasks! Then everything to work out.

475
01:24:16,008 --> 01:24:19,603
<i>Rashid? How erdu?</i>

476
01:24:19,808 --> 01:24:25,838
- Rashid, you've visited.
- I'll just change clothes.

477
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:29,120
- Come on.
- It takes two seconds.

478
01:24:29,328 --> 01:24:32,764
- You visit. Now!
- It takes two seconds.

479
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:36,961
Will not you take them? Come now!

480
01:24:38,648 --> 01:24:41,401
It was not so difficult?

481
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:49,408
Are you okay, honey? How has the little kiddo that?

482
01:24:50,768 --> 01:24:53,407
How are you?

483
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:04,477
You have no idea how much I miss you. I can not sleep at night.

484
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:07,725
I think about you all the time.

485
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:17,916
I do not understand how you think. What is going on with you?

486
01:25:32,888 --> 01:25:37,837
God will guide you. You ask your prayers well?

487
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:45,967
Do not lie to me. Do you pray regularly?

488
01:25:49,768 --> 01:25:55,798
- Why do you say no?
- What do you want me to say?

489
01:27:40,328 --> 01:27:44,003
Kim ... I will go to the mosque.

490
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:47,803
Not now. It's the middle of the night.

491
01:27:48,008 --> 01:27:52,843
I will go there now. Only this time around. I need it.

492
01:28:14,688 --> 01:28:16,883
Kim ...

493
01:28:18,528 --> 01:28:21,725
I would like to chat with you.

494
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:29,836
What is it Rashid?

495
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:36,080
I know how these are smuggled in prison.

496
01:28:55,728 --> 01:28:58,561
That I never saw.

497
01:28:58,768 --> 01:29:03,000
Go and live it to the proper owner.

498
01:29:04,888 --> 01:29:11,441
Son your last three months, and be not involved in this.

499
01:29:11,648 --> 01:29:14,606
It's too good for you.

500
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:23,082
There is another thing ...

501
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:27,958
I know who killed Rune.

502
01:29:28,168 --> 01:29:31,285
There were masons and Albanians.

503
01:31:18,248 --> 01:31:21,240
Good morning, Rashid.

504
01:31:23,168 --> 01:31:28,003
You have something that is mine. Where is the damn egg?
