1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,813
What I'd like to do today is
get your version of what happened.

2
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:19,406
- You mean the truth?
- Of course.

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,615
First, just state your name and
your occupation for the record.

4
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:26,697
Egg Shen, bus driver.

5
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,461
Bus driver.
What kind of bus and where, please?

6
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:38,377
Tour bus. Bus for tourists.
San Francisco Chinatown.

7
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:44,508
Thank you.
Now, before we get to the meat of this thing,

8
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:47,934
do you at the present time
have any knowledge

9
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,772
of the whereabouts of
a Mr Jack Burton or his truck?

10
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:54,557
- Oh, God. Will you leave him alone?
- Mr Shen, please.

11
00:00:54,652 --> 00:01:00,940
You could be in a great deal of trouble. Half
a city block explodes in a ball of green flame.

12
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,070
Green flame! All hell is breaking loose here.

13
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:06,734
And there are people
who say you're involved,

14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,872
that you might be responsible,
that you're a very dangerous man.

15
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:16,753
- Now, if you’re protecting Jack Burton...
- You leave Jack Burton alone!

16
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:21,927
We are in his debt. He showed great courage.

17
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:30,055
OK.

18
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:33,894
But if I'm gonna be your attorney,
there are a few things I have to know

19
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,438
that still don't make any sense to me.

20
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,604
Like...

21
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,652
do you really believe in magic?

22
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,405
You mean Chinese black magic?

23
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:48,495
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

24
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:54,121
Are you still serious about this? And
monsters and ghosts as well, I suppose?

25
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:57,378
Sure. And sorcery.

26
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:04,005
And I suppose that you expect me
to believe in sorcery as well?

27
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:06,504
- Of course.
- Why?

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,925
Because it's real.

29
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,095
How can I know that, Mr Shen?

30
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:15,267
- How?
- Yes, how? Help me out here.

31
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,562
Please.

32
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,862
See? That was nothing.

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,156
But that's how it always begins.

34
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,620
Very small.

35
00:02:57,191 --> 00:03:02,316
This is Jack Burton at the Pork-Chop Express
and I'm talkin' to whoever's listen in'.

36
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:04,563
It's like I told my last wife.

37
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:07,693
I says "Honey,
I never drive faster than I can see."

38
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:11,735
"Besides that, it's all in the reflexes."

39
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,875
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express and
take his advice on a dark and stormy night.

40
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,885
When some wild-eyed maniac
grabs your neck,

41
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,888
taps the back of your head
up against a barroom wall,

42
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:32,972
he looks you crooked in the eye
and asks you if you’ve paid your dues,

43
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:39,016
you just stare that big sucker back in the eye
and remember what Jack Burton always says.

44
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:44,104
"Have you paid your dues, Jack?"
"Yes, sir, the cheque is in the mail."

45
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:06,584
Well, you see, I'm not sayin' that I've been
everywhere and I've done everything.

46
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:10,675
But I do know it's a pretty
amazing planet we live on here,

47
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:16,140
and a man would have to be some kinda fool
to think we're all alone in this universe.

48
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,306
I can't believe you're stuck on even.
This is odd!

49
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:42,183
All right, even! Another even! Come on!

50
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,228
You want one more? All right!

51
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:52,944
- What do we got? He can't count.
- Even!

52
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:56,902
Learn how to play some fan-tan here,
buddy-boy!

53
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:59,286
Three!

54
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:22,263
Heaven and earth, boys. What can I tell ya?

55
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:29,319
You like that one?
What did he say, Wang? In English?

56
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:33,153
Something about beginner's luck.
It doesn't translate. But he quits.

57
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:39,279
He quits? What is this? It's a brand-new day
and he's still got 100 bucks in his pocket.

58
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:44,248
I'm not gonna complain, because I'll bet
I'd have lost my shirt in the next 20 minutes.

59
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:47,421
Breaks my heart to do this,
but the next time I'm down here,

60
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:51,550
you'll gang up on Jack so fast
he won't know what the hell happened.

61
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:54,091
- No.
- Ah, sure. Easy come, easy go, Wang.

62
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,341
No!

63
00:06:57,223 --> 00:07:00,141
Not next time. Now.

64
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:05,520
Is this gonna get ugly now? I hope not.

65
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,810
I thought what we were here,
racial differences aside,

66
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:12,520
was a couple old friends,
both of us Californians.

67
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,187
Shit, Wang. It's only a game.

68
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,702
Nothin' or double.

69
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,874
This knife cuts this bottle in half.

70
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,158
- Nothin' or double.
- Bullshit.

71
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,827
- Nothin' or double.
- Why, man? Don't be stupid.

72
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:33,008
- I need the money.
- I got near a thousand bucks here, Wang.

73
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:35,300
1,148, Jack.

74
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:44,227
OK. But not that bottle.

75
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:48,481
This bottle.

76
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:55,070
OK.

77
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:58,027
You're outta your mind, Wang. God bless ya!

78
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:13,124
- It's all in the reflexes.
- It always works at home.

79
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:18,969
Have me over for dinner some year and prove
it. In the meantime, pay up: $1,148 times two.

80
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:21,927
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I didn't hear that.

81
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:27,307
- I'm just a poor Chinese boy, you know?
- You own a restaurant. That's more than me.

82
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:32,273
Yeah, right. What I meant was,
I don't got that kind of money on me.

83
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,315
That's what I thought you meant.
Where's your truck?

84
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:37,737
- I gotta go somewhere.
- No, you don't.

85
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:41,240
I do. How about we meet in my restaurant
in a few hours? I pay then.

86
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:43,902
- You pay now. Where you gotta go?
- The airport.

87
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:47,330
- Yeah, right. Over my dead body.
- If need be.

88
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:52,537
- I'll follow you.
- You don't trust me? That makes me sad.

89
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:56,629
- It reminds me of an old Chinese joke.
- Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in.

90
00:08:56,719 --> 00:09:01,132
- You were gonna follow me, Jack.
- I know, then I came to my senses.

91
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,884
- So who are we pickin' up?
- A girl. I don't wanna talk about it.

92
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,265
- A girl? Where from?
- Peking.

93
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:12,055
This is a big day in my life. I should
have gone home and gotten 40 winks.

94
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,937
A girl from China? All right, I never done that.

95
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:19,821
I picked up girls from everywhere else,
but never from China. Is she pretty?

96
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:24,577
- I'm gonna marry her, Jack.
- Oh, God!

97
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:28,910
I've known her since we were kids.
I haven't seen her in five years.

98
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,754
I came here alone.
I worked my fingers till they bled.

99
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,914
Before you knew me, I slept on the floor.

100
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,339
I saved every nickel to bring her here
because I love her so much.

101
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:43,547
I can't eat, sleep or think properly without her
any more. She'll put my whole life in order.

102
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,345
Boy, listen to me. Real tough guy.

103
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:49,555
You sound a little nervous, pal.

104
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:55,562
That's why the bottle didn't slice. My mind
and my spirit are goin' north and south.

105
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:08,364
Flightnumber26 has just arrived
at gate number seven.

106
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,959
Whoa. Who is that?

107
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:20,093
She has green eyes.
You know how rare that is, Jack?

108
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:24,970
- How can you tell from here?
- Not her. She's trouble. Miao Yin.

109
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,762
Beautiful green eyes, like creamy jade.

110
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,644
Trouble, huh?

111
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,696
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Absolutely not.

112
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:51,200
- Would you consider jumping right into...
- Sure, but not with a man in your condition.

113
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:55,870
- What's wrong with my condition?
- Try standing downwind where I am.

114
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:59,378
- It's Miller time.
- You know what I say when it's Miller time?

115
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:03,882
Wait a minute!

116
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:06,345
- Don't!
- Don't what?

117
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:12,054
The Lords of Death. Street gang. Punks
from Chinatown. What are they doing here?

118
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,847
Tara!

119
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,718
Miao Yin!

120
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,152
Excuse me.

121
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:15,083
Let's you and me have a little talk, friend.

122
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,876
What?

123
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:19,001
Where'd you get that?

124
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:28,714
Wait a minute, pal.

125
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:31,887
Get that one!

126
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,184
Come on, Jack!

127
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:00,544
Where?

128
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:03,955
Call the cops!

129
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:28,313
Son of a bitch must pay!

130
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:35,205
What's goin' on, Wang?
Why'd they steal your girl?

131
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,751
You tell me! How come it's not safe to walk
in Central Park or to give a stranger a lift?

132
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:45,375
- Because the world's full of crazy people.
- The American girl knew something was up.

133
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,707
Stay away from her. She's a lawyer.

134
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:50,756
She's a what? Oh, come on!

135
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:55,049
- What the hell...?
- They got a clubhouse where they hang out.

136
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:57,349
- To sharpen their knives?
- I can't ask you to...

137
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,476
- Where is it?
- Thank you, Jack.

138
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,451
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Mr Egg Shen, with this wonderful tour.

139
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:13,202
Sit back and enjoy yourselves, see?

140
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:18,993
Long time ago, Chinese men with
gold-rush fever flooded into California.

141
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:22,583
We call Gum Shan - Mountain of Gold, see?

142
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,874
Leaving behind their wives and children.

143
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:30,546
Working for years to complete
the transcontinental railroad,

144
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,966
saving all their pennies.
And then they sent for their families

145
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:39,102
to help build this beautiful Chinatown
you see outside your window

146
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:42,223
this fine warm day.

147
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:15,388
- Go right, down that alley. Lords of Death!
- What alley?

148
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,347
Go right! Now!

149
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,497
- Where the hell are we?
- Come on, Jack.

150
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:47,745
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't suppose you saw a...

151
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,801
No.

152
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,093
Keep moving.

153
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,616
- What is it? A parade?
- A funeral.

154
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,375
- A fighting tong. They're Chang Sings.
- A fighting tong?

155
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:33,414
Don't panic, Jack.
They're OK. They're good guys.

156
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,210
Maybe we should try a different alley.
What do you say?

157
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:47,935
Wang, these guys, these Sing Dings.
They got enemies?

158
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,563
- Wing Kong.
- Who wear red turbans?

159
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,609
Holy shit!

160
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,985
These guys are animals, Jack.

161
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,698
- What's happening, Wang?
- Chinese standoff.

162
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:31,703
A what?

163
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,002
Don't make a sound.

164
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:44,341
Who's that?

165
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:57,041
No questions! Just get outta here, Jack!

166
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,553
Jack!

167
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,891
- I think it was Lo Pan.
- Who?

168
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:43,579
- Don't look, Jack!
- I already did.

169
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:45,749
- Who? I mean, what?
- Lo Pan. Come on!

170
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:49,791
- I can't see!
- It's OK. It's only temporary. Over here.

171
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,298
Bend over.

172
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,800
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:22:56,895 --> 00:23:00,476
I ran straight through him, Wang.
How the hell did I do that?

174
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:03,138
- You didn't. It only appeared that way.
- Right!

175
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:08,229
- Lords of Death, Jack.
- OK, I'm goin' home. Keep your money.

176
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:10,481
- Hey, Wang Chi!
- Lookin' for us?

177
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:13,907
- They know your name.
- That's not good. Let's go!

178
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,991
- My truck!
- Forget it!

179
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:44,474
Lords of Death controlled by the Wing Kong,
Jack. Just errand boys for the Wing Kong.

180
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:49,063
Great! Who wiped out all those
yellow turbans? Those guys were winning.

181
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:57,235
He says it was the Storms. The Three Storms.

182
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,702
Three guys did all that? Listen.

183
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,705
What about that...
whatever it was I ran straight through?

184
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:05,040
Fast!

185
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,221
Lucky us. We made it.

186
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,177
- All right, where's my truck? I'm outta here.
- Isn't your truck insured?

187
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:25,810
- Of course it is.
- Then smart man gets it later.

188
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,434
- Smart man calls the cops.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

189
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:30,524
So do I!

190
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:37,782
Mutual Fidelity Insurers of Sacramento.

191
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:42,118
Well, there's gotta be a listing, honey.
I pay 'em six G's a year in premiums.

192
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:48,247
China is here, Mr Burton.
The Chang Sing, the Wing Kong.

193
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:52,968
- They've been fighting for centuries.
- What does that mean? "China is here"?

194
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:58,011
I don't know what that means. All I know is,
this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air

195
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:03,555
in the middle of an alley, while his buddies
fly around, cuttin' everybody to shreds,

196
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:07,727
and he stands there, waiting for me
to drive my truck straight through him,

197
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:11,400
- with light comin' out of his mouth!
- Jack, please.

198
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:16,361
- When did this happen?
- It didn't, not like he says.

199
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,323
Yeah, it did. Two hours ago. Tall guy, weird
clothes. First you see him, then you don't.

200
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:24,988
Lo Pan appeared on the street?

201
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,210
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to alarm you, Uncle.

202
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:33,709
I'm gonna tell you about an accident
and I don't wanna hear "act of God", OK?

203
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,337
All right, look. What's your name?
Mine's Jack Burton.

204
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:40,929
- Good afternoon, Mr Wong.
- Eddie Lee, meet my friend, Jack Burton.

205
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:44,434
- Eddie's the new maît re d' here.
- And a whole lot more.

206
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,104
Well, I don't know my policy number.
It's in the glove compartment.

207
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:51,026
Just look under B-U-R-T-O-N, will ya?

208
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,732
- Jack Burton?
- Yeah.

209
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:57,482
Boy. The guy you always told me about.

210
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:02,199
- Then that was your abandoned truck.
- Abandoned, like hell!

211
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,494
Hello. Hello?

212
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:06,159
Oh, Christ!

213
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,335
Bad news. The Lords of Death
stole it after you ran away.

214
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,121
- They stole my truck?
- Take it easy, Jack. You're with friends.

215
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:15,588
- We'll find it for you.
- Damn right you will.

216
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:20,553
And my money. And time is money to a guy
like me. And your phone is dead, by the way.

217
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,096
- How do you think I feel? I lost a whole girl!
- The Lords of Death were only on a joyride.

218
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:28,345
Not acting on orders from the Wing Kong.

219
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:32,057
They just wanted a girl to sell
and Miao Yin got in the way.

220
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,643
Plus, the skirmish you guys stumbled into.

221
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:39,234
Lo Pan, the word is, ordered the boss of
the Chang Sings, Mr Lem Lee, assassinated.

222
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,698
- That was his funeral.
- It was a war, Eddie.

223
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:46,283
- What are you doing here?
- Don't panic. It's only me, Gracie Law.

224
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:47,537
Great.

225
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:50,876
Just passing the neighbourhood
on a dark and stormy night?

226
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:53,999
- This is my neighbourhood.
- Sure it was a war.

227
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,420
And anybody that showed up was gonna join
Lem Lee in the hell of being cut to pieces.

228
00:26:58,511 --> 00:27:01,216
- Hell of being what?
- The Chinese have a lotta hells.

229
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:05,683
- And what the hell is Gracie Law doing here?
- She can't get enough of me.

230
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,390
He wishes. Look, you know me.

231
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,896
I'm always pokin' my nose where it
doesn't belong and, I admit it,

232
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:14,272
this mix-up is my fault, sort of.

233
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,228
But I have it on good advice that the punks
that jumped me and took his truck,

234
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:22,486
they took the girl they kidnapped to the
White Tiger's for a quick sale. Who was she?

235
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:27,073
- My fiancée. The White Tiger's?
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

236
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:30,784
If we go tonight, we can buy her back.
A warrant's too complicated,

237
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:33,630
- violence out of the question...
- Hold it! Slow down.

238
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:36,170
- I'm feelin' like an outsider here.
- You are!

239
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:39,710
Jack, listen. I need more of your help.
I can't pay you today, OK?

240
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:42,294
- Shit.
- How can I? I need the cash for Miao Yin.

241
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:47,265
- And it's gonna cost. She's got green eyes.
- Seriously? That's an extra.

242
00:27:47,353 --> 00:27:49,973
It's like leather bucket seats: double the price.

243
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:54,891
- Look, this Lo Pan I ran over... through...
- Has spirit-medium powers.

244
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:59,861
Like the immortals.
His flesh and his bones are atomised.

245
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:02,700
He becomes the dream.

246
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:05,571
- What?
- That's an exaggeration, Jack, I promise.

247
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:07,038
Please, help me.

248
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:09,489
I got a great idea.

249
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:24,421
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

250
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:28,015
Look, this is as far as I go,
because I'm a dead giveaway, see?

251
00:28:28,102 --> 00:28:32,052
I'd go in there with you, but they know
my face and they'd wanna push it in.

252
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:34,817
- Not while I'm around.
- It's all up to you now, Jack.

253
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:37,059
My destiny rests in your capable hands.

254
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:39,773
- I'll do my best.
- Make them drop their guard.

255
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:41,488
- I'll try.
- Look stupid.

256
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:43,401
He does.

257
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:47,573
Boy, it sure is rainin' cats and dogs.

258
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:51,497
The cab driver said... He told me that I could...

259
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:54,833
Well, that the White Tiger would...

260
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,961
Just a minute, please.

261
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:08,473
Excuse me for a second, guys.
I think I know that car.

262
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:15,518
What's she doing now?

263
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,564
Strange girl.

264
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:25,153
That building there. The White Tiger.

265
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:29,158
God, it's creepy. Do we have to go in?
Because I will, if we have to.

266
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:32,580
I'll go anywhere or do anything
to get my story. It's my big break.

267
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:37,209
Just sit tight. We've got one of our best men
inside right now, stirring the pot.

268
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:57,691
How do you do, ma'am? Henry Swanson's
my name and excitement's my game.

269
00:29:57,775 --> 00:30:01,108
- Cash or charge?
- Gosh! Cash, I guess.

270
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,401
I mean, it's not deductible, is it?

271
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:08,653
Mrs O'Toole will take care of your needs.

272
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:10,867
Boy, I wish these were in colour.

273
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:14,702
Because what I really am
in the mood for is a girl with green eyes.

274
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,413
And price is no object, Mrs O'Toole.

275
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:21,546
Fresh off the boat's the way I like 'em.
The more exotic the better.

276
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,420
Chinese girls do not come with green eyes.

277
00:30:43,153 --> 00:30:45,691
- Too long. Let's go in.
- It's only been ten minutes.

278
00:30:45,782 --> 00:30:47,857
Give the guy a chance.

279
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:53,115
- So how long you been in the US of A?
- Three months.

280
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:56,122
- Where from?
- Hong Kong.

281
00:30:56,208 --> 00:31:01,285
What happens? You stay here a while?
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

282
00:31:01,464 --> 00:31:05,081
Maybe. Take your tie off, please.

283
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:08,379
Yeah, I know what you mean.
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

284
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:13,974
Holy shit!

285
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:51,449
Green explosions? People flyin' in and out?
That was not real. I wanna talk to the cops.

286
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:54,485
I want my truck back.
Now where the hell am I?

287
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:57,863
- My office. Sit down.
- You sleep in your office?

288
00:32:57,955 --> 00:33:02,831
What I need to get straight is...
These Storms, what are they? Magicians?

289
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,751
- Yeah, sort of. It's hard to explain.
- Try real hard.

290
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:09,756
If the Storms have Miao Yin,
there's one place they'd go.

291
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:13,921
Lo Pan. The godfather of Little China,
Mr David Lo Pan.

292
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:17,264
You mean the Lo Pan that's
chairman of the National Orient Bank

293
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:19,557
and owns the Wing Kong Trading Company,

294
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:23,226
but who's so reclusive
that no one has laid eyes on him in years?

295
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:25,769
Who the hell are you, anyway?

296
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:29,357
I'm Margo Litzenberger.
I'm with the Berkeley People’s Herald.

297
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:33,858
I've been trying to get somebody from
the press to listen to me about this, Burton.

298
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:38,860
It's not possible that you saw David Lo Pan.
The bastard's afraid to show his face.

299
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:41,873
- He's got more enemies...
- He's got Miao Yin. I'm going!

300
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,283
- Are you nuts?
- Who's that?

301
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:47,330
It's OK, Tara. You can go back to sleep.

302
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:49,746
- From the airport.
- This morning, sure.

303
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,384
That's why I was there. I was protecting her
civil rights, making sure she gets a chance.

304
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:58,384
This is just so shocking. I mean,
I must just be so monumentally naive.

305
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:00,716
- You are.
- Now we have to grab your fiancée...

306
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,976
Wait a minute! I'm a reasonable guy,

307
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:06,636
but I've experienced
some unreasonable things.

308
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:10,516
- It depends on how you look at it.
- The hell it does! So somebody

309
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,984
- tell me what is goin' on!
- The truth?

310
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:15,231
- I can take it.
- We don't know.

311
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:22,237
- I'm going now, alone if I have to!
- Where? It's pouring out.

312
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:25,997
- Lo Pan's. The Wing Kong Exchange.
- The Wing Kong Exchange?

313
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:29,869
The most dangerous den of madmen
in Chinatown? You can't waltz in like...

314
00:34:29,964 --> 00:34:34,591
Like the wind. Yes, I can, Miss Law.
My mind and my spirits are as one.

315
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:37,595
- As two. I said I was comin'.
- I'd go with you...

316
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,598
I know. There's a problem with your face.

317
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:44,762
OK! You people sit tight,
hold the fort and keep the home fires burning.

318
00:34:44,854 --> 00:34:48,389
If we're not back by dawn, call the president.

319
00:34:58,201 --> 00:35:03,787
- This is gonna take crackerjack timing.
- Total concentration. You ready, Jack?

320
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:05,949
I was born ready.

321
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:12,205
I love working nights.

322
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:14,292
Don't get up. Phone company.

323
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:17,836
All right, boys, where's the main panel?
Probably through here.

324
00:35:26,772 --> 00:35:28,729
Wang.

325
00:35:37,532 --> 00:35:41,066
Good work, Jack.
I think they actually fell for it.

326
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:47,825
Well, last time we had this problem was
on account of squirrels chewin' the wires.

327
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:52,080
- I'd better locate the central junction box.
- I think it's down there.

328
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:58,635
What does that say?

329
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,637
- Hell of boiling oil.
- You're kidding!

330
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:04,012
Yeah, I am. It says "Keep out."

331
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,895
We've got to do something!

332
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:20,690
Goat butts against a hedge
and its horns become entangled.

333
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:25,906
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.
- Miss Gracie Law, Mr Egg Shen.

334
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,570
Egg's kind of our local authority on Lo Pan.

335
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,240
- He's helping us out.
- It has been almost two hours.

336
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:34,670
- Let's go over there, beat down the door...
- No, Miss Law.

337
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:39,963
We have to gather our strength,
because now there's clouds and thunder.

338
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:43,423
The image of difficulty at the beginning.

339
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:47,346
But finally we shall bring order out of chaos.

340
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:55,020
- Look.
- Yeah.

341
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:58,063
What you got here is two
people dragging a third.

342
00:36:58,154 --> 00:37:00,230
Miao Yin!

343
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,378
- You did that, right?
- I guess so. I hope so.

344
00:37:23,972 --> 00:37:26,261
Jack, check this out.

345
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,635
So what is this? Chinese or somethin'?

346
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,433
- Countin' backwards?
- Not backwards. Downwards.

347
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:47,861
Of course the Chinese mix everything up.
Look at what they have to work with.

348
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:52,829
There's Buddhism, Confucianism
and Taoist alchemy and sorcery.

349
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:57,337
We take what we want and leave the rest.
Just like your salad bar.

350
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:01,466
But there is one thing
even David Lo Pan must acknowledge.

351
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:08,052
All movement in the universe is caused by
tension between positive and negative furies.

352
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:12,554
- So when the furies are out of balance...
- As they are in Lo Pan, who is cursed.

353
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:15,813
Then the people
turn into demons and live for ever.

354
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,229
Repulsive and evil,
existing only to plague the living.

355
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:25,563
Well then, what you're saying is
this David Lo Pan... What is he? A ghost?

356
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:31,697
Plays at being a man.
A creature of vast, dark, destructive power.

357
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:37,285
All right, out this hatch and up the cable.
Does that sound like a brilliant idea or what?

358
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:40,296
The cable is three storeys high
and covered with grease.

359
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:44,297
Exactly. It's real and we can touch it,
so at least we know where we stand.

360
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:46,178
Yeah, in deep shit.

361
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,463
- What?
- What the hell...?

362
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:54,848
- Shit!
- See?

363
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:57,855
You think they'd let us
walk in and out like the wind?

364
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,646
Yes.
I thought that was your whole damn point!

365
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:03,108
My point was to find Miao Yin at any cost!

366
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:06,115
- This is salt water, Wang.
- And get your truck back!

367
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,818
- I'll buy another one.
- But there's only one Miao Yin!

368
00:39:37,814 --> 00:39:39,890
Jesus Christ! Where are we?

369
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:42,474
Hell of the upside-down sinners!

370
00:39:56,917 --> 00:40:01,129
Hey, you! Come on over here
and fight like a man!

371
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:43,828
Shit, Jack. I don't like the looks of this.

372
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:48,881
- Where are we, Wang?
- You are nowhere!

373
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:17,071
Oh, boy.

374
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:20,118
Look, we came here to see David Lo Pan,
all right?

375
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:22,494
David Lo Pan?

376
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:26,170
- Then you have succeeded, Mr Burton.
- What, you?

377
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,257
- I don't get this at all. I thought...
- Shut up, Mr Burton!

378
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:34,424
- You are not put upon this world to "get it".
- Come on! Lo Pan is like...

379
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:36,388
Nothing you can understand.

380
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:41,717
There are many mysteries and unanswerable
questions, even in a life as short as yours.

381
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:45,478
The way I see it, it doesn't mean
we shouldn't ask. Where's my truck?

382
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:49,944
You are not looking for a truck. You're
looking for a girl. A girl with green eyes.

383
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,364
- Yes.
- She must be something extraordinary.

384
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:56,072
Or I'm not about to waste another 2,000 years.

385
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:59,697
There can't be many Chinese girls
with green eyes these days.

386
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:03,076
- There are not. Never were.
- So beggars can't be choosers.

387
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,245
But I can!

388
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:08,882
Tell me about Miao Yin.

389
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:11,255
What province is she from? Hunan?

390
00:42:11,968 --> 00:42:16,097
Her mother? Her father?
He must be a holy man. I must know.

391
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:19,717
You got a tongue, Dave. Ask her yourself.

392
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:29,648
Mr Burton, if you have an influence over
your youthful friend, you better exert it now.

393
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:33,781
Otherwise I will send both of you to
the hell where people are skinned alive.

394
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:36,237
It's that simple. Understand?

395
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:41,035
- Are you crazy? Is that your problem?
- No, he means it, Jack.

396
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:46,248
My problem is this place.
This place is my tomb. I'm buried here.

397
00:42:46,337 --> 00:42:52,458
A young man, a king, a warrior,
is entombed in this old man's crippled body.

398
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:56,675
And all I need is a woman, Mr Burton,

399
00:42:56,765 --> 00:43:00,014
a special kind of woman
with dragon-green eyes,

400
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,522
to make me whole and young again, so that I
may rule the universe from beyond the grave.

401
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:08,939
- Ch'ing-ti. The God of the East.
- Who, him? This guy?

402
00:43:09,026 --> 00:43:11,018
No, not me, Mr Burton.

403
00:43:12,405 --> 00:43:16,947
My demon. The god I must appease
in order to regain my heart, my blood.

404
00:43:17,576 --> 00:43:21,277
A girl with green eyes to satisfy Ch'ing-ti,

405
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:24,242
a girl brave enough
to embrace the naked blade.

406
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,539
- When I find her, I will marry her.
- Never!

407
00:43:26,627 --> 00:43:29,035
Ch'ing-ti will be happy and my curse lifted.

408
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,964
You can rule the universe
from beyond the grave.

409
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:34,456
- Indeed!
- Or check into a psycho ward.

410
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:36,959
Whichever comes first.

411
00:43:37,054 --> 00:43:41,929
What, I'm supposed to buy this shit? 2,000
years and he can't find a broad to fit the bill?

412
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:45,137
Come on, Dave, you must be doin'
somethin' seriously wrong.

413
00:43:45,228 --> 00:43:50,936
There have been others, to be sure.
There are always others, are there not?

414
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:55,190
You seem to be one who knows
the difficulties between men and women,

415
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:57,654
how seldom it works out.

416
00:43:58,201 --> 00:44:01,570
And yet we all keep trying, like fools.

417
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:09,454
Who are these people? Friends of yours?
Now this really pisses me off to no end!

418
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:13,128
- Come on, stick around!
- Where's Miao Yin? In this building?

419
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:14,840
- Safe.
- Where is she?

420
00:44:14,926 --> 00:44:18,460
Safe.
Safer with me than any creature on earth!

421
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:22,973
Go ahead. You want bad publicity?
Give us the run-around.

422
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:27,270
But this woman has a deadline,
and her pen is mightier than your sword.

423
00:44:27,355 --> 00:44:30,142
- Yeah.
- No visitors.

424
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:34,561
- I don't make the policy around here.
- Come on, man! Give 'em a tour.

425
00:44:34,653 --> 00:44:37,026
What's it gonna hurt?

426
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:40,441
I can help you.

427
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:11,846
- Are you OK, Jack?
- Yeah.

428
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:18,154
We're in a room.
No windows, a few skeletons.

429
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:21,359
- Where's the light coming from?
- The floor.

430
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:40,381
With the easing of trade restrictions,

431
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:45,382
next year we'll start importing
a lot of strange things from Peking.

432
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,511
What sort of strange things?

433
00:45:48,603 --> 00:45:51,010
Are we going up or down?

434
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:53,181
It feels like down.

435
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:15,410
Great. Thank you, Jack.

436
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:20,499
I think we've come up. First we went down.
Now they've brought us up.

437
00:46:21,594 --> 00:46:26,505
Two, three feet thick, I'll bet. Probably
welded shut and covered with brick by now.

438
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,513
- Don't give up, Jack.
- OK. Let's just chew our way outta here!

439
00:46:30,603 --> 00:46:33,225
Lo Pan has plans for us,
or we'd be dead doornails.

440
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:38,439
Which Lo Pan? Little old basket case
on wheels, or the ten-foot-tall roadblock?

441
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:43,486
- One and the same person, Jack.
- You know something you're not tellin' me.

442
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:45,983
Myths and legends.

443
00:46:46,745 --> 00:46:50,030
- I don't wanna insult you.
- No, no. Go ahead.

444
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,452
Insult me.

445
00:46:54,419 --> 00:46:57,918
It's about all sorts of scary things:
an ancient army of the dead,

446
00:46:58,006 --> 00:47:01,540
the Spirit City and monkey sacrifices.

447
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:03,792
The First Sovereign Emperor of China,

448
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,885
that mad monarch who federated our
seven warring states, defeated Lo Pan

449
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:13,217
and imposed upon him
that horrible curse of no flesh in 272 BC.

450
00:47:14,147 --> 00:47:18,524
A lot of Chinese hear these things
when we're kids, then we grow up,

451
00:47:19,486 --> 00:47:21,609
and pretend not to believe them.

452
00:47:22,197 --> 00:47:25,114
- No horseshit, Wang.
- No horseshit, Jack.

453
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,574
I don't blame you. I'm Chinese and I don't
even wanna believe it, but it's for real.

454
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:33,154
Sorcery, the Chinese black magic.

455
00:47:38,546 --> 00:47:40,622
Blindfolds!

456
00:47:59,735 --> 00:48:01,858
You make one move...

457
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:11,902
Now, let's try that again.
Don't make me kill you, tough guy.

458
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:15,705
Come on, Jack!

459
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,243
- Come on!
- How?

460
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,758
- Great work, Jack.
- Yeah.

461
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:20,094
We're all in: me, Gracie and Margo. Uncle Chu
and Egg are in Egg's bus, ready to get us out.

462
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,684
- Right.
- Here, Jack.

463
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:23,851
I'll trade ya.

464
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,608
All right, which way?
Fast, before they wake up.

465
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:30,319
There, I think. Down there.

466
00:49:36,665 --> 00:49:38,741
No pathetic excuses.

467
00:49:39,752 --> 00:49:45,955
I smell the blood of human beings.
Find them. Boil them until their flesh falls off.

468
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,459
You heard me!

469
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,684
Empty.

470
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:51,698
I need you, Miao Yin.

471
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:56,695
You, whose eyes flash like emerald lightning.

472
00:50:57,746 --> 00:51:01,696
Ch'ing-ti, make me flesh again soon.

473
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,337
Please.

474
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:08,921
Let's go. It's clear.

475
00:51:14,763 --> 00:51:16,839
Safety!

476
00:51:20,728 --> 00:51:22,305
Wang!

477
00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:30,940
First time you ever plugged somebody?

478
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:33,529
- Course not.
- Come on!

479
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:37,194
You wanna go up or down?

480
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:39,362
- Up or down?
- Up.

481
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:06,058
All has become strange.

482
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:12,942
A world so unreal and yet,
at once, so frightening.

483
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,425
Open up or I'll blow his head off!

484
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:45,518
Open! Or he dies in the name of Ch'ing-ti

485
00:52:45,604 --> 00:52:49,471
and your souls speed with his
to the hell of the oily dragon!

486
00:53:16,677 --> 00:53:18,836
- You all right?
- Yeah.

487
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,434
- Margo!
- Jack!

488
00:53:25,521 --> 00:53:29,303
- Where's Gracie?
- On the floor next door. She's a wildcat.

489
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:33,063
- How are you gonna spring us?
- I have no idea.

490
00:54:10,606 --> 00:54:13,097
That way maybe.

491
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:18,771
Wang, haul ass!

492
00:54:33,588 --> 00:54:35,496
Come on, keep movin'!

493
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:38,675
Margo, jump in!

494
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:42,633
- In there? Are you nuts?
- Go!

495
00:55:13,961 --> 00:55:16,451
- Where's Margo?
- I don't know.

496
00:55:19,843 --> 00:55:20,791
Where are we?

497
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:23,174
- Where's Eddie?
- Beats me.

498
00:55:26,308 --> 00:55:28,384
Where's Jack?

499
00:55:30,228 --> 00:55:32,304
Jack!

500
00:55:34,273 --> 00:55:36,349
Jack?

501
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:40,437
Jack!

502
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:49,032
- Sorry, I'm just thrilled to be alive.
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.

503
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:59,497
- It's like some giant garbage disposal.
- I think it is, sort of.

504
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,589
Will you just stop rubbing
your body up against mine?

505
00:56:03,678 --> 00:56:05,801
I can't concentrate when you do that.

506
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:09,887
What a pig you are, Burton! I mean, really!

507
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:16,436
- Where's Jack?
- It's OK. Everybody relax. I'm here.

508
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:19,940
Jack, I know where we are.
This is a central... what do you call it?

509
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,780
- Sewer?
- Yeah. Water comes in up there.

510
00:56:22,864 --> 00:56:27,610
Seawater from the bay fills this room. They
divert it through pipes to different chambers.

511
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:31,237
I bet up there's where
we first got on that elevator.

512
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:02,482
All right, we're almost outta here.
From here on, it gets normal.

513
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:04,777
Offices, storerooms: a nice false front.

514
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:08,363
I count to three, open the door, and we go.

515
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:10,408
- Everybody got that?
- Ready?

516
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:12,987
Follow the leader. One, two, three.

517
00:57:17,002 --> 00:57:18,746
We may be trapped.

518
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:24,123
Hide!

519
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:27,966
- Hide?
- Hide! They only saw me!

520
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,388
We fight together, Jack. Do or die.

521
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,862
Time to go.

522
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:34,739
The bus is right outside in the parking lot.

523
00:58:55,934 --> 00:59:00,845
Here's the deal. I run interference and
you bring up the rear. Can you handle that?

524
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,887
Can you?

525
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,891
Well, what a night's work!
You got a problem like that again,

526
00:59:05,985 --> 00:59:08,821
- you reach for the sky!
- Let's go!

527
00:59:11,075 --> 00:59:13,151
Come on, come on.

528
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,489
- You're doin' real good, guys.
- Come on, Jack!

529
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:22,121
Let's go! Open the doors!

530
00:59:25,547 --> 00:59:27,670
- Hurry!
- Move it, Egg!

531
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,210
Duck!

532
00:59:47,277 --> 00:59:50,397
We made it. Holy shit, we made it!

533
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:53,943
- Where's Miao Yin?
- Inside.

534
00:59:54,534 --> 00:59:56,242
Somewhere inside.

535
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:00,914
Where's Gracie?

536
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:20,516
Put me down, you overstuffed monster!

537
01:00:24,649 --> 01:00:27,483
Let me go! Let me go!

538
01:01:05,606 --> 01:01:07,729
What does it mean?

539
01:01:07,816 --> 01:01:10,522
Two girls with green eyes?

540
01:01:10,612 --> 01:01:12,735
After all these years.

541
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:18,361
You bastards! Unchain me! You're not
gonna get away with this. Where's Lo Pan?

542
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:22,529
This one has fire as well!

543
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:26,537
Listen,
I've had it up to here with you maniacs.

544
01:01:26,627 --> 01:01:30,755
I wanna see that disgusting
flesh-peddler David Lo Pan in person.

545
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:35,881
Unless the coward's afraid to see
an unarmed girl one-on-one!

546
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:38,504
Where is he?

547
01:01:47,773 --> 01:01:52,648
You know what this is?
This is like some radical Alice In Wonderland.

548
01:01:52,736 --> 01:01:56,900
- That's what this is.
- Then you've got a best seller on your hands.

549
01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:02,946
- Call the police. You're not a one-man army.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

550
01:02:06,376 --> 01:02:08,119
Here he is, Jack.

551
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:11,876
No, these are our friends.
These are the Chang Sings.

552
01:02:11,964 --> 01:02:15,250
- Any of 'em savvy English?
- Hey, man. Who is this guy?

553
01:02:15,343 --> 01:02:17,170
All right. You got any guns?

554
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:22,718
Not against Lo Pan, but here's one for you
to make you feel better, like Dirty Harry.

555
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:25,893
I'll stick with these. You comin' with us, Egg?

556
01:02:25,978 --> 01:02:30,888
Of course, Jack. It's my destiny. Besides,
if I don't you'll never make it out alive.

557
01:02:30,982 --> 01:02:33,556
- I'm on board too then.
- Yeah, sure, kid.

558
01:02:33,653 --> 01:02:37,400
- You can't keep the press out. It's America.
- You're not going back there.

559
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:40,062
You're stayin' here with Eddie and Uncle Chu.

560
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:43,195
- Eddie? But he's...
- He's got a crush on you.

561
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:47,914
- You mean like you've got on Gracie?
- Are you kidding? I just want my truck back.

562
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:51,334
What do I know?
She's not even your type. All brains.

563
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,496
Come on, let's go!

564
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:05,971
Play your cards right, you live to talk about it.

565
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:30,993
Oh, boy.

566
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:35,254
Are you OK? Are you Miao Yin?

567
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,624
Yes. Miao Yin.

568
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:41,720
- Who are you?
- Lo Pan.

569
01:03:41,805 --> 01:03:45,338
You have come to seek me out
with your green eyes.

570
01:03:45,432 --> 01:03:47,472
Yes.

571
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:49,516
- No, no.
- Yes.

572
01:03:51,396 --> 01:03:57,022
- What's going on here? Some kind of...?
- Magic. The darkest magic.

573
01:03:57,111 --> 01:04:03,399
My soul swims in it, scattered across time,
trapped in the world of formlessness.

574
01:04:03,826 --> 01:04:07,824
Until I find her and marry her.

575
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,289
Marry her?

576
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:14,581
The girl with green eyes.
The girl who can tame the burning blade.

577
01:04:16,781 --> 01:04:21,194
Miao Yin or Grace Law.

578
01:04:31,629 --> 01:04:35,876
- Great start. It's the other way.
- The front door will get you nowhere.

579
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:39,585
- Here, let me hold that.
- A brave man likes to feel nature on his face.

580
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,928
And a wise man has enough sense
to get in out of the rain.

581
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:57,732
- He lives here?
- He owns the block. He's a rich guy.

582
01:04:57,822 --> 01:05:01,156
- Rich? This place is a dump, Wang.
- To Western eyes.

583
01:05:01,243 --> 01:05:04,159
The stuff in these bottles is priceless.

584
01:05:05,497 --> 01:05:08,497
Well, all set?

585
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:12,074
Yeah. Ready when you are, Egg.

586
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:33,270
- Jack next.
- Where does it go?

587
01:05:33,357 --> 01:05:36,275
- Down. Lo Pan is down there.
- Down where?

588
01:05:36,361 --> 01:05:39,361
- Where is the universe?
- Come on, Jack. Don't be afraid.

589
01:05:39,446 --> 01:05:41,522
Afraid? Are you kidding?

590
01:05:55,756 --> 01:06:00,050
- Where in the hell are we?
- Underneath Chinatown.

591
01:07:00,654 --> 01:07:02,978
That is not water.

592
01:07:03,072 --> 01:07:05,527
Black blood of the earth.

593
01:07:05,617 --> 01:07:09,910
- Do you mean oil?
- I mean black blood of the earth.

594
01:07:09,996 --> 01:07:15,204
A thousand years ago, huge earthquakes
turned the world upside down.

595
01:07:17,462 --> 01:07:19,953
Many normal people were killed.

596
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:26,297
Many unnatural people roam free

597
01:07:26,388 --> 01:07:30,966
to commit great offences against the gods.

598
01:09:17,332 --> 01:09:22,327
They have survived the burning blade,
tamed the savage heart.

599
01:09:25,173 --> 01:09:27,462
I will marry both women.

600
01:09:29,427 --> 01:09:32,000
Prepare them.

601
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:48,688
What is that?

602
01:09:50,408 --> 01:09:54,405
- It sounds like...
- Something breathing underwater?

603
01:09:54,495 --> 01:09:56,154
Yeah.

604
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:08,041
You will come out no more!

605
01:10:08,134 --> 01:10:11,798
What? What'll come out no more?

606
01:10:11,886 --> 01:10:14,129
Come on.

607
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:16,298
Dammit!

608
01:10:29,112 --> 01:10:31,188
Miao Yin?

609
01:11:09,778 --> 01:11:11,901
Hey, Wang!

610
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:14,562
- Egg!
- Jack, come on!

611
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:32,797
It's OK, Jack. Wing Kong storeroom.
Emergency provisions.

612
01:11:32,884 --> 01:11:35,839
We're inside Lo Pan's domain.

613
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,839
Christ!

614
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:41,757
Later.

615
01:11:41,853 --> 01:11:46,479
We're getting close. Real close.
And now for some more bad news. Ready?

616
01:11:46,566 --> 01:11:51,062
- This gets worse? Come on!
- 2,258 years ago

617
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:53,644
the First Sovereign Emperor...

618
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:58,734
He subjugated Lo Pan, made him of no flesh.

619
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:03,618
- Only an evil dream.
- Get to the goddamn point, Egg.

620
01:12:03,707 --> 01:12:08,915
In order to be whole again, he had to find
this certain girl of his prophecy,

621
01:12:09,004 --> 01:12:11,674
and marry her to appease the God of the East.

622
01:12:11,757 --> 01:12:14,877
But to appease the emperor,
he had to kill her.

623
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:16,795
Kill her? No!

624
01:12:16,886 --> 01:12:21,014
Well, let's go. What are we talkin'
Chinese history for when we gotta get...

625
01:12:21,099 --> 01:12:24,599
We are getting ready to strike the final blow.

626
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:28,352
- If we reach Lo Pan...
- When we reach Lo Pan.

627
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,228
...then the power in this flask
will be our only hope

628
01:12:31,318 --> 01:12:36,229
against the Bodhisattva of the underworld,
the ultimate evil spirit.

629
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:41,323
Yes. Only a dream can kill a dream.

630
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:44,574
I've waited for this for a long time, Jack.

631
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:48,413
The evil dream will die.

632
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:56,040
Wing Kong outside.

633
01:13:22,829 --> 01:13:26,362
- Were they real?
- Yeah. Dressed for Lo Pan's wedding.

634
01:13:26,456 --> 01:13:28,532
What's in the flask? Magic potion?

635
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:31,082
- Yeah.
- Thought so. Good. Do we drink it?

636
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:32,914
- Yeah.
- Good. Thought so.

637
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:13,794
I am the past,
come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!

638
01:14:16,048 --> 01:14:20,425
My God, no! Please!
What is that? Don't tell me.

639
01:14:20,511 --> 01:14:24,840
A guardian. What it sees, Lo Pan knows.

640
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:27,388
They have returned.

641
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:31,641
And this time they are not alone.
Egg Shen is with them.

642
01:14:31,731 --> 01:14:37,402
Little bastard sorcerer has brought them
through the Bog of the Dead Trees.

643
01:14:37,487 --> 01:14:39,194
Egg Shen?

644
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,239
Egg Shen! You have come
a long ways to find me, but it is too late.

645
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:48,656
There are two girls with green eyes,
and I will marry them both.

646
01:14:48,748 --> 01:14:52,081
And then I will sacrifice Gracie Law
to appease my emperor,

647
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:56,414
and live out my earthly pleasures
with Miao Yin.

648
01:14:59,049 --> 01:15:02,300
That's right, Egg Shen.
The best of two worlds.

649
01:15:09,184 --> 01:15:11,758
You never know till you try.

650
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:13,930
Let's get outta here.

651
01:15:24,408 --> 01:15:27,279
You know what I don't like?
Where is everybody?

652
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,659
Preparing for Lo Pan's wedding.

653
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:44,000
We should not be in here, not this easily.
It's a setup, I'm tellin' ya.

654
01:15:44,095 --> 01:15:47,547
Lo Pan is about to take his queen.
He's too busy to care.

655
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:50,392
So where is he, Egg? Where?

656
01:16:21,966 --> 01:16:24,043
- Jack, here!
- What?

657
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:29,715
- Hollow.
- Fuck it.

658
01:16:34,354 --> 01:16:38,055
- I know. It's an elevator. It only goes down.
- Yeah, look.

659
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:42,063
- Hey, all right!
- Time for the medicine!

660
01:16:49,828 --> 01:16:53,446
- Cheers!
- This does what again, exactly?

661
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,161
Huge buzz.

662
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:58,959
Good!

663
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:03,339
You can see things no one else can see,
do things no one else can do.

664
01:17:03,425 --> 01:17:05,713
- Real things?
- As real as Lo Pan.

665
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:09,882
- What more can a guy ask for?
- The six-demon bag!

666
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:13,721
Terrific. A six-demon bag.
Sensational. What's in it, Egg?

667
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:16,596
Wind! Fire! All that kind of thing.

668
01:17:16,687 --> 01:17:19,178
Here's to the army and navy
and the battles they have won.

669
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:21,979
Here's to America's colours,
the colours that never run.

670
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:24,774
May the wings of liberty never lose a feather.

671
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:43,252
I feel pretty good. You know, I'm not...

672
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:46,341
I'm not scared at all. I just feel kind of...

673
01:17:47,343 --> 01:17:50,095
- I feel kind of invincible.
- Me too.

674
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:54,129
- I got a very positive attitude about this.
- Good. Me too.

675
01:17:59,981 --> 01:18:02,519
Is it gettin' hot in here, or is it just me?

676
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:05,735
Ch'ing-ti! Ch'ing-ti!

677
01:18:06,571 --> 01:18:10,272
Great Ch'ing-ti, equal with heaven,

678
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:16,321
come into our presence
and witness this holy matrimony.

679
01:18:16,414 --> 01:18:20,115
- Miao Yin.
- And the ultimate evil spirit.

680
01:18:25,425 --> 01:18:28,839
And now, my beloved disciples,

681
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:31,335
the moment of truth.

682
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:33,967
The needle of love.

683
01:18:37,477 --> 01:18:40,478
- I'd like to shoot that bastard.
- Not until he's married.

684
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:43,185
- Then he's flesh.
- Then it's too late.

685
01:18:43,275 --> 01:18:45,516
Ch'ing-ti!

686
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:50,402
You, who shake the heavens
and descend from the east,

687
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:54,191
all I ask in order to conquer this universe

688
01:18:54,286 --> 01:18:58,663
is that you grant me flesh and blood.

689
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:03,578
Yes! Guide my hand

690
01:19:04,379 --> 01:19:08,542
as I insert this needle into Miao Yin.

691
01:19:09,426 --> 01:19:13,256
Let him complete the ceremony.
Then he is ours for certain!

692
01:19:13,345 --> 01:19:15,920
Come, my love. Give it to me.

693
01:19:29,113 --> 01:19:31,021
It's working!

694
01:19:32,658 --> 01:19:34,734
I'm mortal!

695
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:45,161
Look out, guys!

696
01:20:00,768 --> 01:20:02,429
No way!

697
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:08,248
Come, Miao Yin, it won't hurt.

698
01:22:09,107 --> 01:22:10,565
Shit!

699
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:20,105
Take her.

700
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,428
Peasant magic!

701
01:23:20,803 --> 01:23:22,879
You never could beat me, Egg Shen.

702
01:24:29,162 --> 01:24:30,622
- It's me.
- Are you all right?

703
01:24:30,707 --> 01:24:33,873
- Never mind me. We gotta get Lo Pan.
- Where is he?

704
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,334
Wang!

705
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:37,211
Come on.

706
01:24:39,215 --> 01:24:41,291
Pull it apart. Come on!

707
01:25:08,494 --> 01:25:12,788
- Where does this go?
- Up. To Lo Pan's office. It's cooler up there.

708
01:25:12,873 --> 01:25:15,959
- From there we can...
- Do you have a gun, I hope?

709
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:19,459
- I have a knife.
- A knife? He's 12 feet tall!

710
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:22,832
Seven. Don't worry.
I can handle him. I took something.

711
01:25:22,925 --> 01:25:25,630
I can see things no one else can see.

712
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:30,470
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I was getting married.

713
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:35,718
He was marrying both of us,
just because my eyes are green too.

714
01:25:44,989 --> 01:25:47,562
Oh, God. Is this really happening?

715
01:25:54,832 --> 01:25:58,118
- Look into my eyes.
- No! Never!

716
01:25:58,211 --> 01:26:02,125
I have suffered so much pain and agony.
Look at me!

717
01:26:02,215 --> 01:26:05,999
No! I don't understand. I don't belong to you!

718
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:09,926
No, you don't. You belong to Ch'ing-ti.

719
01:26:10,014 --> 01:26:12,850
I must sacrifice you,
but I love you and I need you.

720
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,140
No!

721
01:26:15,228 --> 01:26:17,434
Here, take her! Take the bitch!

722
01:26:17,522 --> 01:26:20,357
- Master, you are flesh!
- I am?

723
01:26:20,984 --> 01:26:23,985
I am! It worked!

724
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:26,857
Ch'ing-ti is appeased.

725
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:32,579
Now we must satisfy the First
Sovereign Emperor by destroying this!

726
01:26:32,662 --> 01:26:34,868
Not so fast, gentlemen.

727
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:38,620
Is it too much to ask, Thunder?
Kill him! For me!

728
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:43,537
It won't solve anything, Dave. Too many
people have been droppin' like flies already

729
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:47,248
and where's that gettin' us? Nowhere, fast.

730
01:26:47,342 --> 01:26:50,759
Nah, you know what Jack Burton
always says at a time like this?

731
01:26:50,847 --> 01:26:53,847
- Who?
- Jack Burton. Me!

732
01:27:02,191 --> 01:27:04,350
Old Jack always says

733
01:27:04,861 --> 01:27:06,983
"What the hell?"

734
01:27:32,763 --> 01:27:34,223
It's a good knife.

735
01:27:36,643 --> 01:27:38,517
Goodbye, Mr Burton.

736
01:28:02,752 --> 01:28:05,243
It's all in the reflexes.

737
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:10,091
Wang!

738
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:19,926
You all right?

739
01:28:20,019 --> 01:28:22,178
- Hey, thanks.
- Wait a minute.

740
01:28:57,933 --> 01:29:00,009
I don't think he's gonna stop!

741
01:29:04,356 --> 01:29:05,850
Come on!

742
01:29:25,711 --> 01:29:28,202
- We got a problem.
- There!

743
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:02,319
Come on, Jack!

744
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:06,325
Jump, Jack!

745
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:19,340
- This whole place is melting!
- Hello! Hello!

746
01:30:20,223 --> 01:30:24,351
- How'd you get up there?
- It wasn't easy! Stand aside!

747
01:30:29,066 --> 01:30:31,272
Take it away!

748
01:30:50,879 --> 01:30:52,789
Hang onto this.

749
01:30:55,009 --> 01:30:57,001
Watch out, Wang Chi!

750
01:31:06,478 --> 01:31:08,554
Go for it, Wang!

751
01:31:29,293 --> 01:31:32,163
- Go!
- Come on, Jack, hurry!

752
01:31:34,172 --> 01:31:36,745
There's my truck... My truck!

753
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:39,297
Get in.

754
01:32:00,866 --> 01:32:02,988
- They took the key.
- Do you have a spare?

755
01:32:03,076 --> 01:32:05,995
Course I do, but it's underneath the...

756
01:32:08,583 --> 01:32:12,366
- What was that?
- 6.9 on the Richter scale. Hang on!

757
01:32:20,845 --> 01:32:23,383
- Sorry.
- Don't you know how to drive this thing?

758
01:32:23,472 --> 01:32:25,049
Relax.

759
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:41,361
Stop! Red light!

760
01:32:45,537 --> 01:32:47,991
Take it easy. OK, we made it.

761
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:50,654
Yeah.

762
01:32:50,749 --> 01:32:54,877
Look at that.
Doesn't that make you feel good?

763
01:32:54,962 --> 01:32:57,038
Terrific.

764
01:32:58,341 --> 01:33:00,630
The light's green. You can go.

765
01:33:19,236 --> 01:33:22,357
- What are you doin', Jack?
- I'll be right back.

766
01:33:22,447 --> 01:33:24,938
Where are you goin', Egg?

767
01:33:25,659 --> 01:33:27,735
My work's done.

768
01:33:28,453 --> 01:33:32,403
Lo Pan is dead and the evil spell's been lifted.

769
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:36,993
Years ago I promised myself a long vacation.

770
01:33:37,087 --> 01:33:39,081
It is time to collect.

771
01:33:39,173 --> 01:33:42,507
Well, why don't you go on over to China?
Visit the motherland?

772
01:33:42,593 --> 01:33:47,172
Well, China's in the heart, Jack.
Wherever I go, she's with me.

773
01:33:49,684 --> 01:33:53,978
- So what are you gonna call it?
- I don't know.

774
01:33:54,063 --> 01:33:59,222
Maybe you can come over to my place later
and help me find a title?

775
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:04,570
- Here, Jack. Nothin' or triple.
- Nothin' or double.

776
01:34:04,657 --> 01:34:07,409
Triple. You earned it.

777
01:34:07,743 --> 01:34:10,447
You're right, I did. Thanks, Wang.

778
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:16,239
Well, last chance. I'm a rich man now.

779
01:34:16,335 --> 01:34:20,167
I can give up the open road,
sell my truck, settle down.

780
01:34:20,673 --> 01:34:23,245
Couldn't have that on my conscience.

781
01:34:23,341 --> 01:34:26,177
The only way it might work
is if you buy a bigger truck

782
01:34:26,262 --> 01:34:29,760
with a cosy little apartment
in back, just big enough for two.

783
01:34:29,848 --> 01:34:35,224
That sounds pretty great. But sooner or later
I rub everybody the wrong way.

784
01:34:37,232 --> 01:34:39,521
Well, let me think about it.

785
01:34:43,237 --> 01:34:47,069
God, aren't you even
gonna kiss her goodbye?

786
01:34:50,871 --> 01:34:52,413
No.

787
01:34:54,624 --> 01:34:57,743
- See you around, Burton.
- Never can tell.

788
01:35:02,798 --> 01:35:04,874
Bye, Jack.

789
01:35:08,345 --> 01:35:11,714
We really shook the pillars of heaven,
didn't we, Wang?

790
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:14,513
- No horseshit, Jack.
- No horseshit.

791
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:40,201
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express
and take his advice

792
01:35:40,295 --> 01:35:44,244
on a stormy night, when the lightning's
crashin', the thunder's roarin',

793
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:48,124
and the rain's comin' down
in sheets thick as lead.

794
01:35:48,219 --> 01:35:51,173
Remember what old Jack Burton does
when the earth quakes

795
01:35:51,264 --> 01:35:56,175
and the poison arrows fall from the sky
and the pillars of heaven shake.

796
01:35:56,269 --> 01:36:01,144
Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big old
storm right square in the eye and he says

797
01:36:01,232 --> 01:36:04,897
"Gimme your best shot, pal. I can take it."
