1
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,000
Nine-hundred and fifty-four.

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,600
Nine-hundred and fifty-bloody-five.

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Another few more,
and that's the lot for Friday.

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,700
£14, 3 and tuppence
for 1,000 of these a day.

5
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,600
No wonder I've always got a bad back,
though I'll soon be done.

6
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,100
I'll have a fag in a bit.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
No use working every minute God sends.

8
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,100
I could finish in half the time
if I went like a bull...

9
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,500
...but they'd only slash me wages,
so they can get stuffed.

10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,700
Don't let the bastard's grind you down.
That's one thing I've learned.

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,100
Jack's one that ain't learnt it.
He wants to get on.

12
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,100
"Yes, Mr. Robboe. No, Mr. Robboe.
I'll do it as soon as I can, Mr. Robboe".

13
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,700
And look where it got Robboe,
a fat gut and lots of worry.

14
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,600
Fred's all right.

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,800
He's one of them who knows
how to spend his money, like me.

16
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,100
Enjoys himself.

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,100
That's more than them poor beggars know.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,400
They got ground down before the war
and never got over it.

19
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,200
I'd like to see anybody try
to grind me down. That'd be the day.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,400
What I'm out for is a good time.

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,800
All the rest is propaganda.

22
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,100
- Do you want your money, mum?
- Okay.

23
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Here you are.

24
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,800
Everything go off all right at work?

25
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,800
Aye, all right.

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,600
Did you hear about the accident
in the three-speed shop today?

27
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
No, not much.

28
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Another cup of tea, Vera, luv.

29
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,900
I got you someaught good,
seeing as it's Friday night.

30
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,000
This fellow got his hand caught in a press.

31
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
He didn't look at what he was doing.

32
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
'Course, he's only got one eye...

33
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,300
...he lost the sight in the other
watching telly day after day.

34
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,400
Ta, luv.

35
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,500
Mind what you're doing, can't you?

36
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,100
That Arthur Seaton's going to get
a good rattling one of these days.

37
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,200
- Busy tonight, isn't it?
- You should see next door.

38
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
There's a boozing match going on.
A young chap.

39
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,800
- He's downed eight pints already.
- Eight pints? He's having a good time.

40
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,100
Bring us another couple of pints.

41
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,800
- Want help down there?
- I'll let you know if I do.

42
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,300
That sailor's near had it, if you ask me.

43
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,300
Thanks, George. Take one for yourself.

44
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,100
"What do you want
if you don't want money?

45
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
"What do you want if you don't want gold?

46
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
"Say what you want
and I'll give it to you, honey

47
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,800
"Wish you wanted my love, baby"

48
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,900
Come on, then, sup up!
I've lost count now.

49
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,500
All right, there's plenty of time.

50
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Get the stuff down.
They'll be closed in a bit.

51
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,400
You won't get anymore
till 12:00 tomorrow.

52
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Don't worry, I will.

53
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,800
He's out.

54
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Make sure you don't fall.

55
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,100
I don't know how he does it, I really don't.

56
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Not that it's anything to be proud of.

57
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,500
You get thirsty working
that machine all week.

58
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,100
- I'm going over.
- All right, but hurry up.

59
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,600
It will be closing time
in a couple of minutes.

60
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
Pint.

61
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,900
- Now then, what is it?
- A pint.

62
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,600
Time, now, ladies and gentlemen, please.

63
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Look what that young beggar's done.
This is my best suit.

64
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,800
Cheeky daft, isn't he?
Don't even apologize.

65
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,200
Go on, apologize.

66
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,400
Don't just sit there. Do something!

67
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,700
Time, ladies and gentlemen, please.

68
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,100
Did you get in through
the scullery window?

69
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,700
You never think, do you?

70
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
You'll have all the neighbors talking.

71
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,700
I left the pub in a hurry,
or I'd have waited for you.

72
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,000
I heard all about it.

73
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Falling down stairs and spilling
your beer on that woman.

74
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,700
Wasn't my fault.
Somebody pushed me from behind.

75
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,300
I tripped on the rail
coming down the stairs.

76
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll believe you. Thousands wouldn't.

77
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,800
I'm not going in that pub again
until they get that rail fixed.

78
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,900
Come here.

79
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
What for?

80
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,400
You shouldn't have drunk all that beer
with that loudmouth.

81
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
You've had a drink.
I can smell it a mile off.

82
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

83
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,700
I've had two beers
and a couple of orange squashes.

84
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,500
You can't call that boozing, now, can you?

85
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Don't let's stay down here too long.

86
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,800
Let's go upstairs.

87
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,200
Come on.

88
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
I wish Jack would bring your lad
from Skeggy every week.

89
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll bet you do.

90
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,800
He'll be gone till tomorrow.
Best make the most of it.

91
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,600
- Don't worry.
- Can't you wait till we get upstairs?

92
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,300
Come on, Brenda, wake up, duck.

93
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,000
That's nice.

94
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,500
What's the time, luv?

95
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
It's half past 11:00.

96
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
What?

97
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,400
You're having me on again.

98
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
Of all the liars,
you're the biggest I've ever known.

99
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,600
I always was a liar, a good one and all.

100
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,900
Liars don't prosper.

101
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,300
It's only 10:00.

102
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,100
Good.

103
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,400
What a time we had last night.

104
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,700
It seems years.

105
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
You're lovely Brenda.

106
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Pour us some more tea, duck.
It's thirsty work, falling down stairs.

107
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,200
Two, ain't it?

108
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
Thanks.

109
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,900
You're good to me Brenda, luv.
And don't think I don't appreciate it.

110
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,400
It'll be the last breakfast you have
in this house if you don't hurry.

111
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,200
Jack will be home soon.

112
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,500
No more kiss and cuddle if he sees you.

113
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,400
- When shall I see you again?
- I don't know. Not for a while.

114
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,500
We don't want Jack catching on, do we?

115
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,300
What about the welfare club?
Can't we meet there for a change?

116
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,100
Tell him you're in the dance team.
He'll believe you.

117
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
I don't know. Work next week.

118
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,600
I'll be hard at it,
sweating me guts out at that lathe.

119
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,300
It's a hard life if you don't weaken.

120
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
No rest for the wicked.

121
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,500
Come on, hurry up, will you, please?

122
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
He's coming on the bike, I think.

123
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,100
Get a move on.

124
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,100
- I'll see you.
- Get going, will you?

125
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Hello, Mum!

126
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Come on, Tommy,
let's get your clothes off.

127
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,900
Give us that.

128
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,400
How did my duck
get on at the seaside?

129
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,100
Have a nice time?

130
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,300
- We had a good time, didn't we?
- Smashing.

131
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,800
I didn't expect you back so soon.

132
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
We had a clear run
all the way down from Lincoln.

133
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,500
Who's in there?

134
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
Nobody as I know.

135
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,900
Perhaps a cat got in.

136
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,200
- He was on the run, remember?
- He settled her, though.

137
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,900
- Threatened to chuck her off Trent Bridge.
- I'd forgotten.

138
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,700
She decided to settle for a quid a week
out of court rather than get a good wash.

139
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
- Never heard a word after that, did we?
- No!

140
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,400
You're out of your way, aren't you?

141
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,800
Your two kids are outside
covered in ice cream.

142
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,500
- No wonder they never eat dinner.
- Go out last night?

143
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,800
Yes, we went to Flying Fox, and oh, dear!

144
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,100
I had so many gins,
I thought I'd never get home.

145
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,700
As long you as had a good time.
A beer and stout.

146
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,500
- What you having?
- Same again.

147
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,300
I'll have a stout as well.
You should have been with us.

148
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,100
Ethel clicked with a bloke and he
brought us all drinks, the whole gang of us.

149
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,700
He must have gone through 5 quid,
the soft bastard.

150
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,700
He had a car. I suppose he could afford it.

151
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,400
He thought he had a good thing.

152
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,900
You should've seen his face drop when
she went home with us instead of him.

153
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,700
I wish I'd been there.

154
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,700
You can't beat a bit of fun can you?

155
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,600
- How's your mum these days?
- She's all right. She's got a lot to do.

156
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,500
How's Johnny getting on in Australia?

157
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,400
You know, I reckon
Johnny's better off out there.

158
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,500
- He never did well in this country, did he?
- Though he always was a good worker.

159
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,900
He had to be, poor beggar.
He had it hard when he was a kid.

160
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,200
Me and your mum struggled
to bring your lot up.

161
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,000
- Them was rotten days.
- I know.

162
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,800
- It won't happen again, I'll tell you that.
- I was talking to a bloke.

163
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,900
He's always going on, you know,
"You can't beat the good old days".

164
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I got hold of my pick, and I said:

165
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,300
"Say anything else about the
'good old days', as you call them...

166
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
...and I'll split your stupid head open".

167
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,100
I would, too!

168
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,400
Look at him. Can't take his eyes
of that young girl over there.

169
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,400
Not me, I'm courting already.
I was looking at the calendar.

170
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I believe you.

171
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,800
- Are you coming, Mum?
- All right, I'm coming.

172
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,300
I'll be going now. You coming, Bert,
or shall you stay with Arthur?

173
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,800
If I don't get home,
they'll fetch me for fear that she'd starve.

174
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,300
I'm hungry myself.

175
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
How about some fishing this afternoon?

176
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Okay, we'll get the bikes out.

177
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,700
I'll meet you at Trowel Bridges.

178
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,400
Remember me to your mum.

179
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,000
Bit quiet today?

180
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,500
Isn't it? Should've seen it a couple
of weeks back. Nearly lost our license.

181
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Didn't you hear about it? Big fight.

182
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,900
Took us a couple of days to clean up
after that little lot.

183
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,900
- Yes, what can I get for you?
- Two packets of crisps.

184
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,300
Are you sure you can afford it?

185
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,900
What are you drinking?

186
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,500
Sharp, ain't he?

187
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Is it somebody's birthday?

188
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Mum's anniversary, if you want to know.

189
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,800
- I can't see your dad.
- That's because he's not there.

190
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,100
- Is he coming?
- I shouldn't think so.

191
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,200
He left her 15 years ago today,
and she's just having a drink on it.

192
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,300
I'm glad someone thinks it's funny.

193
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,600
Have a drink, while you're here.

194
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,100
- All right, I'll have a small shandy.
- Small shandy, please.

195
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,400
What's that you're drinking?
It looks like treacle.

196
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,300
- Beer and stout. Try a drop.
- No. I tasted it once, it was horrible.

197
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm not a boozer, either, but I'm going
fishing, and I like a drop beforehand.

198
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,100
Just a minute, I'll take these to mum.

199
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,700
- You've been taking your time.
- I've been waiting to get your crisps.

200
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,400
Another beer and stout.

201
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,000
I won't be long.
I'm just talking to this bloke I know.

202
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,200
- Is your mum a bit deaf, then?
- Yes, she is, a bit.

203
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
No, thanks, I don't smoke.

204
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,400
- What's your name?
- Doreen.

205
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,500
- Rotten name, ain't it?
- What's wrong with it?

206
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,900
Mine's Arthur. Neither of them is
up to much but it's not our fault, is it?

207
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,900
- Where do you work, then, Doreen?
- Me?

208
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,700
Iris's, the hairnet factory.
I've been there ever since I left school.

209
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,200
All right, I will have a fag.

210
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm in the engineering trade myself.

211
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,900
Drink up. Have another shandy.
It's your mother's anniversary.

212
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,200
No, thanks.

213
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,300
What do you do in the week, Doreen?
Do you ever go to pictures?

214
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,800
Only on Wednesdays. Why?

215
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,300
That's funny, I go on Wednesdays.

216
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,900
- Which one do you go to?
- The Granby, as a rule.

217
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll see you next Wednesday, then, at 7:00.

218
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,300
Fast worker, aren't you?
All right, but not in back row.

219
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
I can't see unless I sit in back row.

220
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
If I get any nearer to the front,
the picture gets all blurred.

221
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,700
You want glasses, by the sound of it.

222
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,100
I'll get some, but they make me look like
a cock-eyed rent collector.

223
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,700
I expect they do.

224
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,800
- I'll see you on Wednesday, then.
- All right.

225
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Don't be late.

226
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,100
I won't be, but if I am,
you'll just have to wait, won't you?

227
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,200
I noticed that girl meself this morning.
Smashing bit of stuff.

228
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,400
Shouldn't think she'd want aught to do
with a madhead like you.

229
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
They all want a good time.

230
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,800
That's what you all think.
This one looks different.

231
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,000
First kiss and she'll expect
an engagement ring.

232
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,700
I took a tip from the fishes.

233
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,500
Never bite unless the bait's good.

234
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,900
I won't get married till I'm good and ready.

235
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,500
- Got to get married sometime, right?
- Why don't you try, then?

236
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Ain't found anyone who'd have me yet.

237
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
It costs too much to get married.

238
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,800
A lump sum down
and your wages a week for life.

239
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,200
- Most blokes got nothing else to work for.
- I have.

240
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,600
I work for the factory,
the income tax, and the insurance already.

241
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,500
That's enough for a bit.

242
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,300
They rob you right, left, and center.

243
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,100
After they've skinned you dry,
you get called up in the army and get shot.

244
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,100
That's how things are.
It's no good going crackers over it.

245
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,800
All you can do is work and hope
one day something good will turn up.

246
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,400
Maybe. But you've got to be as cunning
as them bastards.

247
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,600
Take a few tips from the fishes.

248
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
They all get caught in the end.

249
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,100
Can't keep their chops off the bait.

250
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,200
Wasn't a bad-looking girl, was she?
Sharp and all.

251
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,300
Still going round with this married piece,
ain't you?

252
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
It'll be a good job when you're married.

253
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Her poor husband will be able
to get a bit of rest, then.

254
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,300
Serves him right for being so slow.

255
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,500
If he made her like being in bed with him,
she won't go out with me.

256
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,700
You'll get your face bashed in
one of these days.

257
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,300
Don't worry, I can look after meself.

258
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,600
Just you be careful,
and use a bit more sense.

259
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,100
I'll watch it.

260
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,800
I don't know...

261
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,200
Work tomorrow.

262
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,300
Aye, me and all.

263
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,600
There's Old Ma Bull with her halfpenny.

264
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
She's naught else to do, the nosey parker.

265
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,800
Spreading tales about me going with
married women and boozing.

266
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,100
It's all bloody lies.

267
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,000
Make sure it is...

268
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,700
Any room for a rabbit's arse, Jack?

269
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,200
You've clicked, by the look of it.

270
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
I'll tell Brenda if you're not careful.

271
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,200
She wouldn't believe you.
She can trust me.

272
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,700
Can she, though?

273
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,500
That stuff will give you
galloping dog rot, it's poison.

274
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,400
A bloke in frame shop got laid up
for six weeks from drinking the firm's tea.

275
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,700
Stomach trouble.
You should bring your own flask.

276
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
If it's good enough for others, for me also.

277
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,300
Don't bet on that. Think of No. 1.
Share and share alike's no good.

278
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,400
You wouldn't think like that
if you won the pools.

279
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Wouldn't I? I'd see the family right
but nobody else.

280
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,200
If I got begging letters like most blokes,
know what I'd do?

281
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
- What?
- Make a bonfire.

282
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,900
Have you had aught to do with
putting a rat on her bench?

283
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,700
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I bet it was you, you young rogue.

284
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,500
Me, Mr. Robboe? I've got so much work,
I can't move from my lathe.

285
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't go around tormenting women.
You know that.

286
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,800
I don't know. Somebody did it,
and I reckon it's you.

287
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,700
You're a bit of a Red if you ask me,
that's what you are.

288
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,300
That's slander.

289
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I'll see my lawyers about that.
I've got a witness.

290
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I don't know,
but I'll get the bloke that did it.

291
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
What a life, I get blamed for everything.

292
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,900
He came up to me earlier on.

293
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Said I was to go on nights in frame shop.

294
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,400
What?

295
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,000
In frame shop, on nights.

296
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,000
I wouldn't fancy that.

297
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I don't mind. It'll be a change.

298
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,400
That's not the first time
that bastard's called me a Red.

299
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,000
Not that I wouldn't vote Communist
if I thought it'd get rid of blokes like him.

300
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,100
I did vote for them last election.
Did I tell you?

301
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,900
I shouldn't have voted
'cause I was under 21...

302
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,500
...but I used my dad's vote
'cause he was in bedridden.

303
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,700
I said my name
was Harold Spencer Seaton.

304
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,900
I didn't believe it till I was outside.

305
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,400
You could've got ten years
if they caught you.

306
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,800
- You were lucky.
- I told you I was.

307
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,500
That's what all these loony laws are for,
to be broken by blokes like us.

308
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,300
You might cop it one of these days.

309
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Perhaps you won't be so cocky,
once you settle down.

310
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,000
- I shan't be doing that for a while.
- There's naught wrong with married life.

311
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm married.
Went into it with my eyes open.

312
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,600
Married life's all right if you're good
to each other and not too bossy.

313
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,300
I believe you, then.

314
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Thousands wouldn't.

315
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
You off out again?

316
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,300
I'm up to Minnie's for a bit.

317
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,200
- She's expecting her baby next week.
- You've been seeing a lot of her lately.

318
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,700
It isn't much fun being on nights.
We never get out together now.

319
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,100
How much longer do you think it will last?

320
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,900
- You've only been on a fortnight.
- I know. It might be another six months.

321
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,800
Still, you don't mind it all that much,
do you?

322
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,800
It means more money, and that's useful.

323
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,000
We could get a television and
you won't have to go out so much.

324
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,800
No, I won't, will I?

325
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,300
I won't be long.

326
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,900
Peggy will be here soon
to look after Tommy.

327
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,700
That sounds like Jack's bike.

328
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,100
Can't be. Jack's not been at the club
for weeks.

329
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,400
- Are you fit?
- Yeah.

330
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,400
You've got a bit of lipstick on you.
There.

331
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
I wonder if Jack does know anything.

332
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,600
'Course he don't.

333
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,200
Funny, isn't it?

334
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,000
- I told him, once or twice.
- What?

335
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,400
That I was going
up to the club to play darts.

336
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,000
He said he'd come one of these days
to see if I really did.

337
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,500
He'll believe aught.

338
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
He never did come, though.

339
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm sure he doesn't suspect anything.

340
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
- Do you think he does?
- No, we're too cunning.

341
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,300
I wonder what we'd do if he did find out.

342
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
We could always get married.

343
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,700
Can't imagine that. He'd never make
a divorce of it, anyway. I know Jack.

344
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,600
As long as we go on loving each other,
that's all that matters.

345
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
- That is Jack's bike, isn't it?
- What? Where?

346
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,300
It's his, you know.

347
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
What should we do?

348
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,100
You said you were going to your sister's.
You'd better go there.

349
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,300
- You coming back with me?
- I'll show my face, and he won't suspect.

350
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,700
- When will I see you again?
- I don't know.

351
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,000
- Better wait a bit, hadn't we?
- I'll come round in a night or two.

352
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,200
Come on, Charlie, give us a pint.

353
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,700
- What are you drinking?
- Ta.

354
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,700
- I'll have a mild.
- Another mild please, Charlie.

355
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,700
- When's the next strike, Tom?
- There's naught to strike about yet.

356
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,700
I expect you're too busy
with young women for that, anyway.

357
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,600
- Not me, I spend my time at the bookie's.
- I believe you!

358
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,100
How are you getting on? How's Brenda?

359
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
All right. Can't grumble.

360
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,900
This ale tastes as if it has been pumped
straight out of the Trent.

361
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Mine's all right.

362
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,700
I don't suppose you get out much,
now you're on nights.

363
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
It's a dog's life.

364
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm going out this weekend.
My brother's on leave from Leicester.

365
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
He's doing his stretch in the service?

366
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,600
No, he's a regular.
He's a big, broad lad, strong as a bull.

367
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,100
You wouldn't think we were brothers.

368
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,100
His pal's coming over as well.
Expect we'll have a night out somewhere.

369
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,500
It's good to get out a bit.
I do a spot of fishing, now and again.

370
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,700
- Your brother home for long?
- Fortnight.

371
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,200
There's one thing about him. He'll always
help if I'm in any sort of trouble.

372
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,500
If anybody does aught against me,
I can always rely on him.

373
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,800
I was with him and his pal once,
and we set on a bloke.

374
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,200
I never want to do that again.

375
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,100
But people like that should be careful,
though, never to pick on the wrong bloke.

376
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,400
I saw fight like that once.

377
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,200
This was with two soldiers and all.

378
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,500
They set onto a bloke,
and he wiped the floor with them.

379
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,300
It was horrible, blood all over.
I had to turn me head away.

380
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,400
- This place is more dead than alive.
- You want another?

381
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,400
I've got a date. You have work soon, no?

382
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
- I'll see you.
- All right.

383
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,700
That wasn't a bad picture.
I knew it would end like that, though.

384
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,700
You could see it a mile off.

385
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,300
Pictures always make me thirsty.

386
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,100
- Fancy a drink?
- No.

387
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,900
Let's get a bus home
so you can meet Mum.

388
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,600
She'll get some supper for us.

389
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,200
Will she mind you bringing me back?

390
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,100
No, she likes company.

391
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,900
All right.

392
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,400
- Don't be long there, Doreen.
- I shan't be, Mum.

393
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,000
How about tomorrow?

394
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,700
If you like.

395
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
We can go to the White Horse for a drink.

396
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm not all that keen on boozing.

397
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,100
All right, I'll get somebody else
for tomorrow.

398
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,600
See if I care.

399
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,000
Don't get like that, duck.

400
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,900
Come on in, and shut that door!

401
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
I shan't be a minute, Mum.

402
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
I'll see you next Wednesday.

403
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,800
Okay, see you next Wednesday.

404
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,000
I thought you were never coming in
off that porch.

405
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,300
It's all right, Mum, I'm coming up.

406
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,900
If you'll spare me a minute,
I'll give you your wages.

407
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,100
- I shan't say no.
- You'd be the first one who's ever did.

408
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,900
How much this week?

409
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,900
£14. It's more than the tool setters get.

410
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,600
When I started here,
I took home 7 bob a week.

411
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,300
But in them days,
7 bob was worth something.

412
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,200
A packet of fags were a tuppence.
You had a marvelous time starving.

413
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,000
But they've stuck me
near 3 quid tax this week.

414
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,700
Don't blame the firm for that.
Don't grab so much.

415
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,900
I don't grab. I earn every penny of it.

416
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,900
I don't say you don't. I don't want anyone
to know how much you take home.

417
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,800
They'd all be at my throat
asking for a raise.

418
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,200
You could sack them, couldn't you?

419
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,900
Just like them good old days
you were just telling me about.

420
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Here you are, Mum, me board.
Six bob this week, buy yourself something.

421
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,100
Thanks, Arthur, me old duck.

422
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,000
- He's a good lad to you, ain't he?
- He is and all.

423
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,000
Takes after his dad for hard work,
don't he?

424
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,400
Come here, you!

425
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,800
Another cup of tea, love.
He's paying that, you know.

426
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,200
Old blood chop, that's what you are.

427
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,900
You shouldn't be so rough with him.

428
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,100
He's all right. What do you feed him?
He's like a cannon ball.

429
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,400
Eats like an horse.

430
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,000
Our Bert didn't want his dinner last night,
and that little beggar scoffs every bit.

431
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,100
Get out, eh! Look at him.
Can't keep his hands off it.

432
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,600
Lock up your hair clips,
else he'll be in the gas meter.

433
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Shut up, you daft nit,
putting ideas into his head.

434
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,700
Go to the shop, and buy
a fiver's worth of dolly mixtures.

435
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Stop tormenting him, Arthur.

436
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,200
- He's all right.
- Come back here!

437
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,400
Quick one, eh?

438
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,900
Give me that fiver back,
and I'll give you a tenner. Come here!

439
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,900
Give me that!

440
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
I'll get you some toffees.

441
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,000
Chalk it up, will you, Mrs. Roe?

442
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,700
There was someaught else I wanted,
but I can't think of it.

443
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
I'll buy you some caramels.

444
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,500
Look where you're going.

445
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,300
Sorry, I didn't see you.
Sixpence of caramels, please.

446
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
You think you own the place,
young bleeder.

447
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,200
What are you talking about? You're daft.

448
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm not so daft that I don't know
about your games.

449
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,400
I've seen you out with them
as you shouldn't. Not the first time, either.

450
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,200
- You have, have you?
- I have.

451
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,200
I know about you and all.

452
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,500
You're not past a bit of rum stuff, are you?

453
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,100
- Bet your old man doesn't know about that.
- Go on, you!

454
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,100
Come on, let's go, we're not safe.
She's a nutcase.

455
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll clout you one of these days!

456
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,500
Ta-ta, Fluffy!

457
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,700
- What's all the rush?
- Come on, shift.

458
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,900
I'll help you with the tea in a minute.

459
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,700
I'm bringing it in, if Tarzan here will let me.

460
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,300
Why are you frightened?
A kiss won't hurt you.

461
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,400
What do you think I am?
I don't even know you!

462
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,900
- Give us a kiss, and then you will.
- No, get off!

463
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,800
- You men are all the same.
- I'm different.

464
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
You don't look it to me.

465
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,500
I am.

466
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,800
I think you're a little cracker.

467
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,100
Looks as if you're having a birthday party.

468
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,400
I don't know, what a mess the house is.
I thought you were clearing up for me.

469
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,700
I was, Mum.

470
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,500
I just brought my pals up for a moment.

471
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,700
You know Arthur, me young man,
don't you?

472
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,200
How do, Mrs. Greatton?

473
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,100
Look at this mess. I don't know.
You might help me a bit at times.

474
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,700
- I was going to clear up in a minute.
- I'm sure you were.

475
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,000
People coming to supper and all.

476
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
That's one way to make you feel at home.

477
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,300
- We'll be going, Bert. Are you fit?
- I'm sorry about my mum.

478
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
If you've got company coming,
we'd better go.

479
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,100
You can always drop in to our house,
you'll be welcome.

480
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,800
It's not my fault my mum's like she is.

481
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,500
Ta-ta, sweetheart.

482
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,300
Say good night to your mum for me.

483
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,700
- Since when's he been your young man?
- Not long.

484
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,000
- He looks a bit rook, if you ask me.
- He's all right.

485
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,500
You don't know him yet, do you?

486
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,100
Not like you know him, I don't suppose.

487
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Anyway, I like him.

488
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,000
- Did you get anywhere?
- No. You?

489
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,500
No. That Betty's barmy.
She wouldn't let me get near her.

490
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,900
You've got to marry them
these days before you get aught.

491
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
Not if they're already married.

492
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,000
What's up with you?

493
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Stop it. You make too much fuss.

494
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,300
What's the matter with you tonight?

495
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,700
I'll tell you what's the matter with me.
I'm pregnant.

496
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Good and proper this time,
and it's your fault.

497
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,800
It's bound to be my fault, isn't it?

498
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,100
Of course it is. You never take care.
You just don't bother.

499
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,700
I always said this would happen one day.

500
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,500
What a wonderful Friday night.

501
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,400
How do you know?

502
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,300
You never believe anything, do you?

503
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,300
I suppose you've got to see the kid
before you believe me.

504
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,900
I'm 12 days late.

505
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
That means it's dead sure.

506
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,100
- Nothing's dead sure.
- This is.

507
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,300
Don't.

508
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,500
How do you know it's mine?

509
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,600
Don't you want to take the blame, now?

510
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,900
- You're backing out.
- Blame? There's no blame.

511
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
I want to know if it's mine.
It's not sure.

512
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,500
It's yours, right enough.

513
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,700
I haven't done aught with Jack
for many months.

514
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't want to have it,
I'll tell you that now.

515
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,800
Have you tried aught? Took aught, I mean.

516
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,100
Some pills. They didn't work.
30 bob they cost me, down the drain.

517
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,900
- God Almighty!
- He won't help you.

518
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,100
Look, you've got to do something,
you know.

519
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
Don't you want to have the kid?

520
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
You'd like me to have a kid by you?

521
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Another one won't make a difference.

522
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,500
Don't talk so daft.

523
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,300
What do you think having a kid means?

524
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,500
You're doped and sick for nine months,
your clothes don't fit, nobody looks at you.

525
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,400
One day you're yelling out,
and you've got a kid.

526
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,200
That's not so bad.

527
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,700
But you've got to look after it
for the rest of its life.

528
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
You ought to try it sometime.

529
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,700
If that's how you feel.

530
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,600
How do you expect me to feel?

531
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I'll see Aunt Ada. She'll know what to do.

532
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,400
She's had 14 kids of her own, and I'm sure
she's got rid of as many others.

533
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,100
I hope she knows something...

534
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,100
...because if she don't,
there'll be a hell of a row.

535
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,500
Don't worry.

536
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,700
You'll be as right as rain in a week or two.
We'll go see about it tomorrow.

537
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,800
- I'm all right.
- Okay.

538
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,700
Come on.

539
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,700
Anybody in?
Bring out your dead, Aunt Ada.

540
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,000
It's you, Arthur, come in.

541
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,500
- Where's the tribe?
- Gone to the pictures.

542
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Sit yourself down,
and I'll give you a cup of tea.

543
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,900
I can see Bert still works at pit.

544
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,100
I'm glad you've come. Sunday afternoon
is the only time I get a bit of peace.

545
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,500
I like somebody to talk to.

546
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,100
I thought I'd come see you.
I'm worried about someaught.

547
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,700
What would a good-looking chap
like you worry about?

548
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,700
I'm not worried, I never worry,
you know that.

549
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
It's a mate of mine at work.

550
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,600
He's got a girl in trouble
and doesn't know what to do.

551
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,100
That's a daft thing to do.

552
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,500
Couldn't he have been a bit more careful?

553
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,800
He'll just have to face the music
like our Dad did.

554
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,500
Give me that kettle.

555
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,800
Isn't there someaught to be done? People
can get rid of it by taking things, right?

556
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,500
- How do you know about that?
- I read about it in the Sunday papers.

557
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,400
You don't want to mess with such things.

558
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,000
It's for me mate. He's in trouble.

559
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,500
He's a good bloke. He'd do it for me. You
can't let a mate down at a time like that.

560
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,800
It's you, isn't it?

561
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,000
It's you who's in trouble.

562
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,100
It is, if you want to know.

563
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,500
I knew a woman who went
to prison for doing that.

564
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,300
I don't know what to tell you.

565
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
I thought you'd be able to help me.

566
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,700
Thought I'd be able to help you?
Just like that? You brainless loon!

567
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,500
You ought to have more bloody sense.

568
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,900
You can't expect to get out of fixes
as easy as that.

569
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,200
I've got nobody else to turn to.

570
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,300
Why don't you marry her,
if she's a nice girl?

571
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,300
She's already married.

572
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
You are in a bloody fix.

573
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
That's why I came to you.

574
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,700
I don't know.

575
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,800
All right, then, bring her to see me.

576
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,000
Thanks.

577
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,500
- I can fetch her now, if you like.
- The sooner the better.

578
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,500
Let's get it over with.

579
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,300
- I'll be back.
- All right, get going.

580
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
You didn't take long, did you?

581
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,600
Come in, Brenda, duck.

582
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,100
- This is my Aunt Ada.
- Hello.

583
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,300
Let's hope you get out of it
as quick as you got into it.

584
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,400
I don't expect it will be that easy, either.

585
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
It won't. Come on in.

586
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,100
Sit yourself down.

587
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,300
How are you feeling?

588
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,700
You know how it is, I'm not too bad.

589
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,000
It ain't right, is it?
I think men get away with murder.

590
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,400
They do don't they?

591
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,500
I don't know that much.

592
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,500
Don't be such a big head.
And get cracking so I can talk to her.

593
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,400
- What's your name, duck?
- Brenda.

594
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,800
- Hello Arthur, how are you?
- All right.

595
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,500
Been to see my mum?

596
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,600
- Don't tell us aught.
- There's naught to tell.

597
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,400
- I'll go get my tea, then.
- Come for a walk.

598
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,700
- What's up? You don't look happy.
- I'm all right. Come on.

599
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,700
Okay.

600
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,000
- What's up?
- It's that fella!

601
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,200
Let's see what's happened.

602
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,500
Hey, you!

603
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,300
I saw you, I saw what you did.

604
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,700
Get down to that phone box
and get the police.

605
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Here, take his other arm.

606
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,900
- What's he done?
- Threw something through that window.

607
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,200
We're holding him for the police.

608
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,100
He ought to get put inside.

609
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,900
Don't worry, we're holding him.

610
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,500
- Rat face.
- You'll get the strap for this.

611
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,600
Right across your back.

612
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,900
- I wanted a vase for my mother.
- That window wasn't worth breaking.

613
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,800
Don't talk to him.
He can do his talking to the police.

614
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,600
He'll talk to them.

615
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,700
I only buried her three months ago.
I wasn't doing any harm.

616
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,400
You didn't have to do this.

617
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,900
Why don't you leave him alone,
you old bag?

618
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,000
Cheeky young beggar!

619
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You'll get six months in Lincoln.

620
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,300
Let me go.

621
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,000
Listen to the way he's talking to her.

622
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,300
Walk off, nobody'll stop you.

623
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,000
Don't put ideas into his head
or you'll be in trouble.

624
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,000
Shut your bleeding rattle, rat face.

625
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,100
What good is it to you,
handing him to coppers?

626
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,000
Go on, get going. Run.

627
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,800
All right! What's the trouble?

628
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,100
This man smashed that window.
I saw him and that woman did.

629
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,800
Any other witnesses?

630
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,800
I don't know how rat face
could do a thing like that.

631
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,100
Because she's a bitch and a whore.

632
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,800
She's got no heart.
She's a swivel-eyed get.

633
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,500
She wants poleaxing.

634
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,100
Some people would narc
on their own mother.

635
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
We're living in a jungle.

636
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,700
That bloke was a spineless bastard.
He should've run.

637
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,100
I don't know.

638
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,200
Still, there's one thing I can do...

639
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,800
Right.

640
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,800
We held him till the police came.

641
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,300
But that Arthur Seaton was
telling him to run away.

642
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,300
He never was any good, that one.

643
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,100
He went off when the police arrived.

644
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,400
...always the same. Breaking little
Johnny's toy train when he was five.

645
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,000
Don't worry, he'll get checked
one of these days.

646
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,500
Strewth!

647
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,500
God all-bleedin'- mighty, somebody got me.

648
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,600
What's wrong? What happened?

649
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,000
Who's done that?

650
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,100
I know who did it.

651
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,900
I'll wait until tonight till
my old man gets home. Come on.

652
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,500
Always gossiping about me, so smack!

653
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,200
- A pellet gets her right on the arse.
- I'd like to have seen that.

654
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,600
- She didn't know what hit her.
- Fat old cow. Serves her right.

655
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,900
If you get put in clink,
I'll send you a file in a cake.

656
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,700
She'll have a bruise as big as a pancake.

657
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,900
Right.

658
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,800
- Tenner.
- Tenner, I'm with you.

659
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,200
- Two bob.
- Two bob? In that case, I'll see you.

660
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,600
Beat that.

661
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,800
Done.

662
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,400
- I'll go.
- If it's anybody for money, say Mum's out.

663
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,000
It's old Ma Bull, I thought she'd be back.

664
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,300
- Shall we let her in?
- Yeah, I'll get my gun.

665
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,600
Don't do that. I'll bluff it out for you.
She won't twig aught.

666
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,000
Go in.

667
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,000
What do you want?

668
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,300
I hear you've been shooting at my missis.

669
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,200
Who me? You've got the wrong bloke,
I don't even live here.

670
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,400
Perhaps it wasn't anybody at this house.

671
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,500
Couldn't have been.
There ain't any guns here for a start.

672
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,500
- Arthur's got a gun, I know he has.
- He ain't. You've got the wrong house.

673
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,100
I'll have less of your cheek.

674
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,400
I got shot and I'll find out by whom.

675
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
- It weren't Arthur, he's ain't home.
- I didn't think it was anybody here.

676
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,300
Shut your mouth.

677
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,400
- I ain't found him yet but...
- Get out else you'll get another.

678
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,700
That's it. He is the one who shot me.

679
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,300
In your fat gut this time.

680
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,100
What are you standing there for? Hit him!

681
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,100
Take laughing boy with you.

682
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,100
We'll see about this!

683
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,700
I'll settle that beggar, once and for all.

684
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,500
Did you see her old man's face
when she told him to hit you?

685
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,700
If she goes to the cops,
she can't show them the bruise.

686
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,000
Whose deal?

687
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,200
We'll have no cheating this time.

688
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,300
- That was the Bulls, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

689
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:18,600
They said I shot Mrs. Bull with an air gun,
but they are lying as usual. Shilling.

690
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,500
I told you never to let them in the house.

691
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,400
I hate nosey parkers like that.

692
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,300
It's a wonder they didn't want
a pound of sugar too.

693
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,300
They just barged in, couldn't stop them.

694
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,700
I'd have stopped them.

695
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,900
- What have you got?
- A full house.

696
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,900
What a twister!

697
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
- I'll go.
- Pack it up now, Bert, I'm mashing tea.

698
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,000
Doreen! Hello duck, come in.

699
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,300
A work pal of mine lives near here
so I thought I'd drop in.

700
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,800
Take your coat off. My mum's out
but have some supper.

701
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
I won't stay long.

702
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,000
- How do, Doreen? How's Betty?
- She's all right, thanks.

703
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,300
I thought it'd be daft
not to call being so near.

704
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,700
I'm glad you did. I'd have been mad
if you hadn't and I'd found out.

705
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,300
- Was your mum mad at us on Sunday?
- No.

706
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,300
That door never stops, does it?

707
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,700
Mum's all right, but she's a bit
funny sometimes, being deaf like she is.

708
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,700
This woman says he shot her
with an air gun.

709
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,400
Air gun? There's no air gun in this house.

710
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,600
- We'll have a look, shall we?
- What?

711
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,300
Come in, then, if you like.
Shut the door after you, will you?

712
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,000
- Which one was it?
- Him.

713
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,000
She says you threatened her
with an air gun, is that right?

714
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,100
When was this?

715
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,200
You know when it were, just now.

716
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,400
What have I been doing for the last hour?

717
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,900
Don't be bloody daft, what do you mean?

718
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,100
Tell them, go on.

719
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,100
You know what you've been doing.
Playing cards with Bert here.

720
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,400
And losing, too.

721
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,400
It's no good, they'll never own up to aught.

722
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,400
You've got cheek coming here,
saying we've got an air gun.

723
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,300
Some would do aught to cause trouble.

724
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,500
Look, I can't mess around here all night.

725
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,200
Stop making trouble in the yard.

726
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,100
If there's any more row I'll be down
with the Inspector to sort you out.

727
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,400
Just watch it.

728
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,800
And I don't want to come back here again.

729
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,800
- That put him in his place.
- About time, I should say.

730
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,200
Ta very much.

731
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,400
Just keep away for a bit, will you?

732
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,500
Did you see that kitchen?

733
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,100
- They didn't get much out of us.
- They never would.

734
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,700
It's not every day we beat the coppers.
Bert, clear the floor.

735
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,400
Come on, let's dance.

736
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,300
- Dad, this is Doreen.
- Hello.

737
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,800
Do you come here often?

738
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,500
Hello, duck.

739
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,900
Been here long?

740
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,300
Ten minutes.

741
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,200
I was just looking at the lovely view.

742
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,600
You'd better come down to earth, then,
hadn't you?

743
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,600
How did it go at Aunt Ada's?
Did it go all right?

744
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,100
No, it didn't.

745
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,200
It was just one of them old wives' tricks.

746
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,400
She made me sit in a hot bath
for three hours and drink a pint of gin.

747
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,200
I'll never go through that again.

748
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,800
It was terrible.
I thought I was going to die.

749
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,500
And it didn't work.

750
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,100
- How do you feel now?
- What do you think? I got over it.

751
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,400
I don't know, I can't think of aught else.

752
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,300
Somebody told me the other day
they'd see you out with a young girl.

753
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
He was a bloody liar, then.

754
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,100
Do you think I'm daft, Arthur?

755
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,800
You don't care as much for me as you did.

756
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,900
That ain't true, you know I like you a lot.

757
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,200
I know you do. You can see it a mile off.

758
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,200
It's not my fault
if you don't believe me, is it?

759
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
You know the trouble with you?

760
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,000
You don't know the difference
between right and wrong.

761
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,200
I don't think you ever will.

762
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,500
Maybe I won't, but I don't want
anybody to teach me, either.

763
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,400
You'll learn, one day.

764
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,900
We'll see.

765
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,100
But it's now that matters, isn't it?
We've still go to clear this mess up.

766
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,700
I'll try one last thing.

767
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,800
What?

768
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,600
A girl I know told me of a doctor
that would do it.

769
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,400
- Where?
- It doesn't matter where, I've the address.

770
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
I don't know, all this mess...

771
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,700
You got me into it. Don't back out now!

772
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,400
I'm not trying to.

773
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
And I never would, either.

774
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,100
I may as well tell you.

775
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,000
This doctor wants 40 quid.

776
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,500
- I'll get that for you.
- When?

777
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,400
I'll have it for you in a couple of days.

778
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,700
You're getting off light.

779
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,000
- You know the girl in our firm?
- Which one?

780
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,100
You know. Tina, the one in the photo.

781
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,300
What about her?

782
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,600
She got married yesterday.
She looked ever so nice.

783
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,700
What was the bloke like,
could you smell the drink?

784
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,500
He must have been drunk to get married.

785
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,800
You're in a rotten mood today.

786
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,200
I lost five quid at the races.

787
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,500
Serves you right,
you shouldn't waste your money.

788
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,900
It's not wasted, I enjoy betting.

789
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,100
I don't care what you do with your money.
It's naught to do with me.

790
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,900
Stop telling me off, then.

791
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,300
I'm not telling you off. You don't think
I'm bothered about you like that do you?

792
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,700
That's not what you just said
in the pictures.

793
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,300
You're a pig bringing it up like that.

794
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,500
I like you telling me off.
I like it a lot in fact.

795
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,000
- You ought to show it.
- I do.

796
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,800
No, you don't.

797
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,800
Why don't you ever take me where
it's lively and full of people?

798
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,600
- It's always the pictures or a walk at night.
- That ain't true.

799
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,500
- One would think you're ashamed of me.
- I'm not, I can tell you that.

800
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,100
I'll take you to the fair on Saturday night.

801
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,800
If you like.

802
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,500
Having a good time?

803
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,800
Not bad, I'm with some pals from work.

804
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,000
I had to come out or I'd go crackers.
I've been worrying about you all week.

805
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,000
You can stop worrying.

806
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,100
Is it all right?

807
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,400
- Did you see that doctor?
- I went. I didn't stay.

808
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,400
- Why?
- I've decided to have it, face what comes.

809
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,200
You want to have the kid now?

810
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,700
- I must get back. Jack will wonder.
- I want to help you.

811
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,200
Do you?

812
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,300
Yeah, what can I do?

813
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,300
There's nothing much you can do, is there?

814
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,400
I must go. Jack will be looking for me.

815
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,500
I must get back. I've got to get back.

816
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,100
- Wait.
- They mustn't see us together.

817
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,400
Come here!
What the hell have you been doing?

818
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,300
They busted me, right enough.

819
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,600
Still, I'd had my bit of fun.

820
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:44,400
It ain't the first time
I've been in a losing fight.

821
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,300
It won't be the last, either, I don't suppose.

822
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,300
How long have I been lying here?

823
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,400
A week?

824
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,100
I can't think.

825
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,000
Mum called me barmy when I told her
I fell off a gasometer for a bet.

826
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:18,200
But I'm not barmy. I'm a fighting pip
that wants a pint of beer, that's me.

827
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,500
But if any bastard says that's me...

828
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:27,200
...I'll say I'm a dynamite dealer waiting
to blow the factory to Kingdom Come.

829
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,000
I'm me and nobody else.

830
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,400
Whatever people say I am,
that's what I'm not.

831
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,500
Because they don't know
a bloody thing about me.

832
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,100
God knows what I am.

833
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,000
Come in.

834
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,500
Come in, this is a surprise.

835
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,700
I came to see how you were.

836
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,500
I'm not bad,
I'll be as right as rain in a day or two.

837
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,900
Take your coat off and sit.

838
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
This is a nice room.
Are all the clothes yours?

839
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,300
Just a few rags.

840
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,200
They must have cost a pretty penny.

841
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,800
I get good wages.

842
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,900
I've been worried about you all week.

843
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,300
You were in a state when we brought
you home. What happened?

844
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,800
I got knocked down with a horse and cart.
I didn't see it. I thought I was a goner.

845
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,300
You even told your own mum you fell off
the gas works for a bet.

846
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,200
You won't tell anybody, will you?

847
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,700
Why should I?
It pays to keep your trap shut.

848
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,100
No, it don't.

849
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,600
I've just told you, haven't I?

850
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,700
I told you I got run over
with a horse and cart.

851
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,600
You are a liar.

852
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,000
You won't like it if I tell you.

853
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,500
I won't mind.

854
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,500
I got beat up with two soldiers.

855
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,100
What for?

856
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,700
I was seeing a married woman
and her husband set them on me.

857
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,600
Two on one, so they beat me.

858
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,200
I'd have flattened them
if it had been one at a time.

859
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,400
That's why you left us at the fair?

860
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:53,100
It wasn't. I saw a mate on the Dodge-'ems,
owed me five quid, I went to collect it.

861
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,900
I didn't see you after that,
what happened to you?

862
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
You talk to me like I was a bit of muck.

863
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,100
Don't look at it like that, I'm sorry.

864
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
You look it.

865
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,300
Come here.

866
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,500
Come on, come here.

867
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,600
I'm glad you came. I'd have been
down in the dumps if you hadn't.

868
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,500
I wondered how you were.

869
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,900
- I bought you some fags.
- Thanks.

870
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,600
What's it like outside?

871
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,500
- It's a bit cold.
- Not in bed.

872
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
It's warm under the blankets. Come try.

873
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,700
- What do you take me for?
- We're courting, aren't we?

874
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,400
You might call it courting.

875
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,300
You're a nice girl, I like you a lot.

876
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,800
I'd like you to stay with me for good so
I don't get run down by any more horses.

877
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,900
The trouble with me is
I'm always bumping into things.

878
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,800
It's not much of a paying game.

879
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,100
You'll have to watch where you're going.

880
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,500
I've never seen anybody look
as nice as you.

881
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,500
I'll buy you a ring next week if you're nice.

882
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,300
Come on, give us a kiss.

883
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,400
Come in, Bert.

884
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,200
Hello, Aunt Vera. All right, Uncle Harold?

885
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,500
All right. How's things at the pit?

886
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,000
Black, but I can't grumble.
Where's the lad?

887
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,500
Still in bed. Take his clean shirt up
while you're about it.

888
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,700
Right-o!

889
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,300
It's time he got up.

890
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,500
What's up, the telly's broke?

891
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,500
Here comes the laundryman.

892
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,300
- Sorry, I didn't know you were here.
- Hello, Bert.

893
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,500
- How are you feeling, Arthur?
- I'm all right.

894
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,100
Your mum sent this shirt up.

895
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,500
Thanks, I suppose it's time
I was getting up.

896
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,900
I'll be going now, Arthur.

897
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,400
Don't go! I just popped up.

898
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,100
I have to go now, my mum's expecting me.

899
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,900
- How's Betty these days?
- She's all right, thanks.

900
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,400
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

901
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,700
- So long, Bert.
- Ta-ta.

902
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,900
Ta-ta, love. I'll see you at your house.
Goodbye.

903
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,000
Smashing nurse. I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was here.

904
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,200
- Come plodding in here.
- Nobody told me downstairs.

905
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,700
- Are you two going steady?
- What does it look like?

906
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,900
- What do you think?
- She's lovely, I must say.

907
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,800
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine, now.

908
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,700
- Fancy fishing this afternoon?
- No, I'll go tomorrow.

909
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,400
- Why not this afternoon?
- I've got a date with Doreen!

910
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,400
You were born dead lucky.

911
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,000
Your mum takes all night
to read the paper.

912
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,900
Does she read slow
or is she looking at the adverts?

913
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,800
She reads every word.

914
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,100
She loves the newspaper
more than a book.

915
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,800
Mum, your kettle's boiling.

916
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,000
I heard it.

917
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,100
I thought she was never going
to get out of that chair.

918
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,000
She won't be a minute. She's just
filling her hot water bottle.

919
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,900
I'm off to bed.

920
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,900
Don't be long yourself.

921
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,700
I won't be. Arthur's just going in a minute.

922
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,600
He's got ever such a long walk home.

923
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,900
I have and all. I'll get cracking in a bit.

924
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,300
Don't be late.

925
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,100
It's after 11:00 now.

926
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,500
I'll wash cups up before I come.

927
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,500
I'll take these cups...

928
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,400
Let's make as if you're going first.

929
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,800
- Good night, then, Arthur.
- Good night.

930
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,300
We'll have to do it a bit louder,
you know she's deaf.

931
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,800
Good night, then, Arthur.

932
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,700
Good night, duck. See you soon.

933
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,100
What are you doing round this way, then?

934
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,300
I'm just going to press shop.

935
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,600
I'm on days now.

936
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,800
I thought you might be coming to see me.

937
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,700
- No good in that, is there?
- Isn't there?

938
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,500
You thought the swaddies had killed me?

939
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:20,900
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I didn't think you would, you're that sort.

940
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,400
Until you get bashed in the face,
then you squeal like a stuck pig.

941
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,100
You caused a lot of trouble
between me and Brenda.

942
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,700
You can't deny it, neither. It wasn't right.

943
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,100
You don't have to tell me
what's right and what isn't.

944
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,100
How is Brenda, anyway?

945
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,500
She's okay.

946
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
She'll be all right with me.

947
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,100
I'll look after her.

948
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,900
Keep that between you and me.

949
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,400
If you ever try to see her again
you'll get more trouble from swaddies.

950
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,300
They won't find it so easy next time
whether I'm on my own or not.

951
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,400
You're too much of a trouble maker.

952
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,300
You should take things as they come
and enjoy life.

953
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,000
I do enjoy life.

954
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,300
Just because I'm not like you,
don't think I don't.

955
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,200
I'll see you sometime.

956
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,600
Yeah.

957
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,300
Give over.

958
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:56,400
I thought you weren't going to get
married till you were good and ready.

959
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,300
I hadn't met Doreen then.

960
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,700
- What's the score with Brenda?
- Finished. We packed it up.

961
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,600
I reckon it was time. Don't you?

962
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,000
Maybe.

963
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,300
She's a good sort, though.

964
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,800
I've given her lots to put up with.

965
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,000
What's her husband like?

966
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,000
A bit of a dope.

967
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,000
He's not a bad bloke.

968
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,200
I told you to lay off weeks ago,
not that you took a blind bit of notice.

969
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,900
You've got to enjoy yourself.

970
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,900
You've got to keep
your feet on the ground.

971
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,400
I can't see much use in that.

972
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,900
People settle down, before they know it,
they've kicked the bucket.

973
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,800
It ain't altogether like that.

974
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,300
I know.

975
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,300
It would be, if you didn't watch it.

976
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,200
Easier ways of getting things
than lashing out all the time.

977
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:45,100
You think so? If I get mixed up
in what goes on, that's my business.

978
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,200
- I suppose it is.
- You bet it is.

979
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,900
I've got some fight left in me,
not like most people.

980
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,500
I'm not saying you ain't.
Where does all this fighting get you?

981
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,800
Ever see what not fighting's got you,
like Mum and Dad?

982
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,400
What do you mean?
They've got all they want.

983
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,600
They've got television and a packet of fags
but they're both dead from the neck up.

984
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,800
I'm not saying it's their fault.

985
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,900
Their hash has been settled for them
so all the bloody gaffers...

986
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,900
...can push them around like sheep.

987
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,000
I've seen you in some funny moods...

988
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,100
...but I've never seen you like this before.

989
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,900
There's a lot more in life
than mum and dad have got.

990
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,200
I've got one!

991
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,000
It's good to be out.

992
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,600
It's nice out here.

993
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,900
Peaceful, for a change.

994
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,300
I asked mum if we could live at home.

995
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,700
She said it would be all right.

996
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,200
Until we get a new house.

997
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,400
I wouldn't mind living in an old one myself.

998
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,600
I would.

999
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,900
I want a new home
with a bathroom and everything.

1000
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:29,300
Me and Bert used to roam all over
these hills when we were kids.

1001
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,800
Blackberrying.

1002
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,700
There won't be blackberries
or a blade of grass here much longer.

1003
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,600
What did you do that for?

1004
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:48,100
I don't know, just felt like it, I suppose.

1005
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,000
Maybe one of those houses will be for us.

1006
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,500
I know.

1007
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,700
You shouldn't throw things like that.

1008
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
It won't be the last one I'll throw.

1009
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,500
Come on duck, let's go down.
