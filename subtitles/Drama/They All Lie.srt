1
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:35,475
Hi, it's Marla.

2
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,792
I changed my mind. I
can't do this right now.

3
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:41,194
You're here?

4
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:43,398
At the club?

5
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,058
No. I can't meet you.

6
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,461
I have to get back to my daughter.

7
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,078
Mom?

8
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:01,198
Mom.

9
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:08,411
Mom.

10
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:13,802
Mom! Where are you?

11
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,280
You don't trust me.

12
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:52,477
It's such a control
thing. Admit it. Admit it.

13
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,622
You're reluctant to leave me in charge.

14
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,233
Rubbish. Then why haven't you gone yet?

15
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:00,093
What? Why are you
trying to get rid of me?

16
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:02,284
You haven't had a vacation
in 6 years, Cal. Come on.

17
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,616
You are trying to miss
your flight. I am not.

18
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:07,242
I am not. I am trying to find

19
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:08,578
The Anderson file. The Anderson file.

20
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:10,185
I've got it, all right?

21
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,013
I can take care of it. Come on.

22
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,603
Stop stalling.

23
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,540
Where are you going? Honestly, Cal.

24
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:18,142
The cab is outside waiting for
you. Grab your jacket and let's go.

25
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:19,571
You deserve this.

26
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,622
- Emily's waiting for you. Come on.
- Don't push me. Don't push me.

27
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:23,772
Come on, let's go. Here.

28
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:25,881
Here. Oh, give me your cell phone.

29
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,233
You don't need to check in while you're
gone. It's just gonna stress you out. Come on.

30
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,167
No kicking and screaming?

31
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:34,050
I have absolute faith in you.

32
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,737
And my staff.

33
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:39,980
Here I go, then.

34
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:43,179
Have a good time.

35
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,692
Are you really working?

36
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:05,661
We've only been here 2 days.

37
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,309
You really need to
learn how to relax, dad.

38
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:11,981
People who can't relax die younger.
I learned that in health class.

39
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,809
Don't worry about me, love, will you?

40
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:16,212
- What are you looking at, anyway?
- Nothing.

41
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,146
You're spying on the office?

42
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,002
Look, I'm my own boss.
That's a 24/7 job.

43
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,094
Someday, when I'm a stressed-out
workaholic, I'll have you to thank.

44
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,676
When did you become
such a know-it-all?

45
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:29,243
We had an agreement that
if I behave maturely,

46
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:32,711
you would treat me like an adult. So,
as an adult, I'm telling you to relax

47
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,785
- and stop it with the creepy snooping.
- Hey.

48
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,020
If you don't, I'll just go
pick up boys by the pool.

49
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:39,930
All right, deal.

50
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,590
Oh, I'll have one of those, too, thanks.

51
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,508
Make it a virgin.

52
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:47,981
Dr. Cal Lightman?

53
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:52,160
My name's Lou Nemeroff. I'm
with the American embassy.

54
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:55,453
There's an urgent matter
that we need your help with.

55
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,895
An American woman, Marla Seeger,

56
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,285
disappeared 2 days ago
from the Oceano hotel.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,090
It's just down the beach.

58
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,724
She was last seen at the hotel
bar. This is local news footage.

59
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,912
La mujer americana... muy borracha.

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,814
This is the bartender who last saw
her. He says that she was drunk,

61
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:21,351
coming on to several men, and that
she eventually left with one of them.

62
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,093
Ahora, lo tenemos
razon para creer que...

63
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:26,332
The local police, they
aren't doing anything.

64
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,723
They believe that she left voluntarily.

65
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:31,984
She's a really good mom.
I just want to find her.

66
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,289
Mom, if you're watching this,

67
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:37,117
please come back.

68
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,578
And that's her
12-year-old daughter.

69
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,644
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

70
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,024
What's the state
department doing about this?

71
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,188
Their official policy is to leave
it in the hands of local authorities.

72
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,817
Oh, so nothing.

73
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,579
They're doing nothing.

74
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,312
Which makes me wonder why you're here.

75
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:58,809
Your boss doesn't know about this
little field trip of yours, does he?

76
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:00,959
I can't ignore what's
going on in Mexico.

77
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,162
Which is what?

78
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:04,950
More than 200 americans have gone
missing in the last few years,

79
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,311
mostly collateral damage
from the drug cartels,

80
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:11,491
but unless it's some pretty blond teenager,
nobody even wants to talk about it.

81
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:15,745
All I need to know is if somebody on
this video is trying to hide something.

82
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah, the detective in charge of
the case and, um, the bartender.

83
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:23,280
Dr. Lightman, can you
help us find Marla Seeger?

84
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,923
- Dad.
- What?

85
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,446
Come on.

86
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:33,914
Some people at the hotel, they
said that they saw your mom crying.

87
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,555
Why was she sad?

88
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,044
I don't know.

89
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:41,661
Everyone's saying she was a bad mother,
but she always took good care of me.

90
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:44,015
Yeah, I'll bet she did.

91
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,634
You think you can find her?

92
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,982
Oh, absolutely. He's
definitely gonna find your mom.

93
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:53,783
I don't know.

94
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,683
I don't know, love.

95
00:05:56,498 --> 00:06:00,342
You ever think that
grownups are full of crap?

96
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:03,353
Yeah. Lots of times.

97
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:05,920
Usually it's 'cause
we've made a mistake,

98
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,744
done something wrong, but we don't want

99
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,843
to talk about it, we
don't want to admit it.

100
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:13,198
Which makes us hypocrites.

101
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:17,522
I think you've got a secret.

102
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:20,686
And you're too scared to talk about it.

103
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,630
Mom always picks awful boyfriends, so I
signed her up for an online dating service.

104
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,341
This is a guy you found for her?

105
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:46,885
He said he traveled a lot and
I told him we were coming here.

106
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,608
Well, what did he say?

107
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:50,916
He said he'd meet me.

108
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,852
I wasn't aware of this.

109
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,837
J-Rod25.

110
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:57,884
My mom was supposed to have
dinner with him last night.

111
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:01,077
What if he did something to my mom?

112
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,481
We rushed over here right
away. Did we hear right?

113
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,696
3 patients have been
infected by tainted blood?

114
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,934
The first patient died this
morning at cottage hospital,

115
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,594
and the second is in critical
condition at St. Mary's.

116
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,902
This is Gary Spar, the third patient to
receive a blood transfusion during surgery.

117
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,669
It should have been a routine
operation, but he never woke up.

118
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:23,892
I need you to seal off that O.R.
and gather and test everything.

119
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,837
So 3 different patients
at 3 different hospitals?

120
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:29,972
It's no longer a coincidence. We
shut down the D.C. central blood bank.

121
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:33,325
Go help pat rule out any
other possible contaminants.

122
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,818
We're in a real quandary.
We need to protect people,

123
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:39,352
but if there's no blood available for
trauma cases and other emergencies,

124
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:40,940
patients may die anyway.

125
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:42,452
Do you have any idea
what's in the blood?

126
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:46,366
Oh, worst case scenario, it's a
biological or a chemical agent.

127
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,420
The fbI has been alerted in
case this is bioterrorism.

128
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:51,493
I know. I'm on my way
to the hospital CEO,

129
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,975
- right now.
- What can we do to help?

130
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,671
The people who have
access to those blood units

131
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:58,794
all claim no involvement or knowledge.

132
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,974
I need to know who we can trust.

133
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,013
Should we get Lightman back here?

134
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,900
I can take care of this.

135
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:07,056
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. What have you got?

136
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:10,209
Well, the tainted blood units all came
from the overnight shift at the blood banks.

137
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:11,979
There were 2 techs on duty.

138
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:14,569
We're taking them down to the Lightman
group right now for questioning.

139
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:16,456
Dr. Cho, I haven't forgotten about you.

140
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:18,893
As soon as I have a minute, we'll talk.

141
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,729
That little boy has sickle cell anemia.

142
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:24,413
If he doesn't have a blood
transfusion in the next 24 hours,

143
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:25,784
he could have a stroke.

144
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,307
What about getting the
blood from outside areas?

145
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:28,889
There's a real shortage.
We're working on it,

146
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:31,082
but it's gonna take
time that we don't have.

147
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:34,398
Oh, Jack, thank God you're
here. Do you know Dr. Foster?

148
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,823
Gillian, this is a lovely surprise.

149
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:40,198
- What are you doing here?
- The CDC contacted the Rader firm

150
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,882
to help assist you since
Dr. Lightman isn't here.

151
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,347
Where is Cal?

152
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:45,577
He's on vacation.

153
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,859
And hell didn't freeze over?

154
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,859
Well, now it's a shame he's gone.

155
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:52,539
I was hoping he and I
could bury the hatchet.

156
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,052
- Is there a problem?
- Lightman and I are...

157
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,032
friendly rivals, so to speak.

158
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,659
It won't be a problem.

159
00:08:58,694 --> 00:08:59,962
Will it?

160
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,893
No. Not at all.

161
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:07,527
Oh, hey, hey.

162
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,479
The 2 techs from the
blood bank are here.

163
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,670
So tell me, what's the deal
with Lightman and Rader?

164
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,815
What, they don't get along or something?

165
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,065
Cal despises him.

166
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,393
He thinks all he cares
about is money and publicity.

167
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:20,448
Well, for once I'm
with Lightman on this.

168
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,962
Something tells me
not to trust that guy.

169
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,640
Hey. Hi.

170
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,597
You're the detective in charge
of the Seeger case, right?

171
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:31,851
Yes.

172
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:34,886
Hey. I'm Emily Lightman.
This is Dr. Cal Lightman.

173
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,468
He's a deception expert

174
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,262
and he works along with the
police in the United States.

175
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:39,929
In the United States, yeah.

176
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:42,141
- This is Mexico.
- No, I knew that.

177
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:43,489
I knew it.

178
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:46,711
Um, now, I saw some news footage,

179
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:51,294
and I think that the bartender at Marla
Seeger's hotel is giving false information

180
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,802
About her disappearance. Dr. Lightman,

181
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:55,302
there is no case here.

182
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,248
Ok? We spoke to several
resort employees.

183
00:09:57,283 --> 00:10:00,330
They said she seemed unstable,
more than likely a drug user.

184
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,513
Based on what?

185
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:03,564
We found several used
needles in her hotel room.

186
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,721
She probably found a fellow
drug user, left with him.

187
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,958
She will be back when the drugs run out.

188
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:11,755
Ok. I still think you should
have another go at the bartender.

189
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:15,963
And I think that you and your daughter
should have a very lovely time here. Ok?

190
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,424
Por favor, lleve a este gente afuera.

191
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,875
No, what about the guy that Tyler
that said her mom was gonna meet?

192
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,606
- You spoke to Tyler?
- Yeah.

193
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,611
There are many people here
who would not like the fact

194
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,658
that you have shown interest in
this matter. Do you understand me?

195
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:35,693
So I'm gonna give you
one piece of advice.

196
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,049
Stay out of this.

197
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,222
Mojito, por favor.

198
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,864
And a margarita.

199
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,494
A coke.

200
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,345
Coke for the senorita.

201
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,151
Enjoying your vacation, senor? Yeah.

202
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:59,135
Well, no, I was until that woman turned
up missing. What's her name again?

203
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,929
Ah... Marla Seeger.

204
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,124
That's it, yeah.

205
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,456
Hey, you're the guy on the tv, right?

206
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:06,438
You saw her that night?

207
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,326
What do you think happened to her?

208
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:10,706
She was dancing with many different men.

209
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:13,654
She was looking for a good
time. She left with one of them.

210
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,670
They were sleeping on
the beach or getting high.

211
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:18,167
What did he look like,
the guy she left with?

212
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:21,706
Don't let this trouble get in your
head, senor. Everything is fine.

213
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:31,637
You're an awful liar, Miguel.

214
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,150
Now you're terrified. What is it?

215
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,628
- You work for the police?
- Miguel.

216
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:47,576
Vete a la casa, ahora.

217
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:53,392
I'm so sorry. We are closing
this bar while we restock.

218
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:56,957
- Is there a problem?
- No.

219
00:11:56,992 --> 00:12:00,045
If you're here on vacation,
please tell us whatever we can do

220
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,908
to make your stay more enjoyable.

221
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:04,885
If, however, you're here
conducting an investigation,

222
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,656
You're not welcome here.

223
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,054
Yeah, Torres, it's me.
I need you down here.

224
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:15,438
Wait, for what?

225
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:17,488
Uh, a woman's gone missing.

226
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:19,564
Yeah. I'll tell you all about
it when you get down here.

227
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,463
Just bring something
pretty to wear, all right?

228
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:22,648
Yeah.

229
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,206
Dude, you're gonna find her.

230
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:27,242
For you, I will move heaven and earth.

231
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:31,340
Hey. Lightman just called. He needs
me to fly down to Zulia right now.

232
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,656
He's on a case? Yeah. A woman's missing.

233
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,227
I gotta go.

234
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,126
Uhh. He's on vacation.

235
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,853
Ok. Just give me one sec.

236
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,537
So, how is it working for Cal?

237
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:45,027
Been so long, I can't remember.

238
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:47,805
I work with Cal. I'm an
equity partner, you know.

239
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,548
Good for you. That means Cal's
been working on his control issues.

240
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,377
Jack... I meant that as a compliment.

241
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:56,375
Seriously, he was my mentor. I have nothing
but respect and admiration for the man.

242
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,895
Obviously, he doesn't
feel the same about me.

243
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,310
Cal says he taught you
just enough to be dangerous.

244
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,314
He's the better scientist, no doubt.

245
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,760
But I'm not going to apologize for having
ambition and a better business sense.

246
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:09,429
If we're gonna work together,
I have some ground rules.

247
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,216
First, I'm the boss around here.

248
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:14,546
Second, don't try using
me to get back at Cal.

249
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,233
So long as you...

250
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,278
Admit that there's just the
tiniest moment happening right now.

251
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,849
Will you admit that?

252
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,308
Hey, Romeo and Juliet, you want
to get this show on the road?

253
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:27,862
People could be dying right now.

254
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,291
You can leave. Thank you for coming.

255
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,737
Agent reynolds, could you escort him out
and bring miss bynes to a more private room?

256
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,965
Sure. Will you come with me, please?

257
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:42,118
People hiding something never want
to draw attention to themselves.

258
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,596
That was awesome.

259
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:46,199
The old routine's a little
rusty, but she still works.

260
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:49,493
- I meant what I said about the ground rules.
- And I meant what I said.

261
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,806
Shall we go find out
what Miss Vines is hiding?

262
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:54,849
Nice work.

263
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,885
It was a regular night at the
blood bank... nothing unusual.

264
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,577
Your boss was about to fire
you for being late too often.

265
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,846
You knew.

266
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,980
Was this retaliation?

267
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,161
She's breathing faster.
Foster's getting somewhere.

268
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:15,622
You have no idea how good she is.

269
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:20,467
Lightman doesn't know. He has a hard time
seeing the true potential of his employees.

270
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,520
What was that?

271
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:28,087
Little flash of anger at
the infallible Cal Lightman?

272
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:33,359
You run this entire lab. But I'll bet Lightman's
never showed you an ounce of appreciation.

273
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:36,571
So, you and Lightman...

274
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,150
- We had a falling-out.
- What, over a case?

275
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,920
Water under the bridge now.

276
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:45,481
You know, I never knew my own worth until
I got out from under Lightman's shadow.

277
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,696
Someday, you'll do that same.

278
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,733
It's been hard for me. My husband
left us. I'm alone with the kids.

279
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,416
Voice pitch is higher.

280
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,564
What's that look there? Shame?

281
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:58,189
I just went through a divorce myself.

282
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,381
I can barely get out of bed.

283
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,136
I can't think straight,
I can't do my job right...

284
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,500
People are dying.

285
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:12,806
You feel guilty, but you're gonna feel worse
if you keep secrets and another person dies.

286
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:20,606
On my last shift, I didn't run the
full testing protocol on the blood.

287
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:23,775
So, you have to test on any
blood for different diseases.

288
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,574
I left early. My daughter needed me.

289
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:29,328
There are so many other
safeguards. I didn't think.

290
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:30,922
I just...

291
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:37,218
I think we have our
culprit. No, we don't.

292
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,863
Someone else just died after
a transfusion at Euclid Park.

293
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,846
And this patient banked his own blood.

294
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:45,684
Central blood bank isn't responsible.

295
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,016
So, you're setting me up on a blind
date with a potential murderer?

296
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,822
Yeah. Why? He's not your type?

297
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,815
I'll keep an eye on you. You'll be fine.

298
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:57,546
- What are the police doing?
- Nothing.

299
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,103
So, we're doing this on our own. Yeah.

300
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:03,215
You know, you pulled me off
a really big case back home.

301
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,961
The CDC brought in the
Rader firm to work with us...

302
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,638
Jack Rader? Yeah, he's at the office

303
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,642
Working with Foster.
Why? What's the problem?

304
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:11,345
Not sure. Not sure. Get in.

305
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:13,467
Want to see the sights?

306
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:14,862
Yeah.

307
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,786
Who you with? You, uh, with the hotel?

308
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:21,790
Police?

309
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,273
Drug cartel?

310
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:30,840
Who's that guy?

311
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,701
He's with the police or drug cartel.

312
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:41,098
Dont go anywhere.

313
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,762
Miguel?

314
00:16:58,144 --> 00:16:59,772
How did you find me here?

315
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:01,507
I bribed a waitress at the hotel.

316
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:05,060
You picked the wrong
part of town to visit.

317
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:07,205
So, you think I should
call the cops, then?

318
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,553
Eh?

319
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:11,684
Oh, are you scared of being seen
with me by the police, are you?

320
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:14,157
Turistas estupidos.

321
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:15,693
Eso fue un "s?"

322
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:19,492
Dinos la verdad sobre
Marla Seeger, y nos iremos.

323
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,939
The police told us to say the american
lady was looking for a good time,

324
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,910
that it was her own fault. Why?

325
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,184
Zulia depends on tourists.

326
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,704
Something bad happens, you
all disappear, the town dies.

327
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:36,608
After the lady from Miami disappeared, we
were told not to talk to anyone about...

328
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,395
What lady from Miami?

329
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,234
Do you want me to call the cops, or...

330
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,258
She came here 4 months ago.

331
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:51,134
She was found dead.

332
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,560
The police kept it out of the news.

333
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:56,536
We should get out of here. I'm gonna
tell the cabby that we're ready to go.

334
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:57,814
Ok.

335
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:06,179
Hey,

336
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:07,802
Did you, uh,

337
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,049
did you really see
Marla Seeger at the bar?

338
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:13,136
I saw her with one man.

339
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,575
I'm not sure if she
left with him or not.

340
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,239
Was it this guy?

341
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:22,797
That's him. I'm positive.

342
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,145
Now go.

343
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,751
Cab's gone.

344
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,298
What?

345
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,749
The cab... it's gone.

346
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,465
Uh, here, hold that.

347
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,430
Um...

348
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,389
I'll give $200

349
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,504
To the person that gives
us a ride back to our hotel.

350
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:51,623
Now, where's your car?

351
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:54,320
Quiso decir quinientos...

352
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:56,935
Dos ahora, tres despues de que llegamos.

353
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,597
We're lucky they didn't kill us
and dump our bodies in a ditch.

354
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:04,081
That wasn't luck.

355
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:07,158
The driver was happy to make
some honest money for a change.

356
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:08,774
You read that?

357
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:11,518
Yeah. Speaking of big and flashy...

358
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:14,367
I need you to find
out what Rader's up to.

359
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:15,623
You want me to spy for you?

360
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:17,861
No, I don't want you to spy for me.

361
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:21,014
I just want you to poke about
a bit. I'll do my own spying.

362
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,961
All right. Well, it's just my opinion, but
I think that might be a little overkill.

363
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,563
Your opinion? I don't need your
opinion. I didn't ask for it.

364
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,288
Just do it. All right? All right.

365
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:39,841
Wait here.

366
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:46,380
Oi! Oi! That's my daughter!

367
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,166
Hey, she started... That's my daughter.

368
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,101
She started talking to me.
You're having a conversation

369
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,835
with my teenage daughter!

370
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,699
She started talking to me.

371
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:55,575
What?

372
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,427
All right. Ok. I'm leaving.

373
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:01,167
Dad, that was the guy
that Tyler's been emailing.

374
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:04,016
I know it was. And you shouldn't have
been talking to him, Emily. Bloody hell.

375
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,593
- You never said I shouldn't talk to him.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

376
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:09,261
Tell you not to do every
potentially life-threatening thing?

377
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,134
No. I figured if I kept him talking...

378
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,682
This is the last thing I need, Emily.

379
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,601
You know, I've got a con
man back in my office!

380
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:19,260
And I've got you behaving
like Nancy bloody Drew!

381
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,229
I was just... I was just trying to help.

382
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,848
Where are you going?

383
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:31,663
Don't.

384
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,134
Hi.

385
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:05,100
I'm Lola.

386
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:07,167
Jerry Conway.

387
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:08,448
Please.

388
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,851
You're a very confident woman, Lola.

389
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:16,168
I mean that in the most flattering way.

390
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:18,831
Well. Then color me flattered.

391
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,038
So, how long you been a masseuse?

392
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:26,200
Uh, just a couple of years.

393
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,700
Really?

394
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:40,592
No, seriously. The last guy I
dated was a complete nut job.

395
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:42,514
Oh, I've been there. Oh. Really?

396
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,212
Ok. Well...

397
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,283
You tell me about your last
psycho, I'll tell you about mine.

398
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,780
Least interesting
story does a body shot.

399
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:51,256
You're on.

400
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:55,768
I met this weird chick,
Marla, a couple nights ago.

401
00:21:56,365 --> 00:22:00,365
Yes. The hospitals trade blood with each
other, but euclid park's not at fault.

402
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,949
I've been here 10 years. Yager's been
here 9. We've never had a problem.

403
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:06,354
We're not the source
of the tainted blood.

404
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:08,696
How can you be sure?

405
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:14,387
I mean, I can't imagine how.
There's been no change in procedure.

406
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,083
There's been no change in procedure.

407
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,197
Lightman?

408
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,843
Ok. All right.

409
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:51,090
Dr. Foster, here's the
blue file that you needed.

410
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,672
Sorry for the delay.

411
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,522
- The blue file?
- Yeah.

412
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,750
Thank you.

413
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,928
Do you know what this is, Mr. Dunst?

414
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:03,592
This is a file all about you...

415
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:07,307
Background check, interviews
with coworkers, family, friends.

416
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:12,067
My team compiled it. You know, we can
scour this to discover what you're hiding,

417
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,299
but why don't you save us the time?

418
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,106
Tomkins, the new driver
in the lab, is a felon.

419
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:31,561
He told Yager he left the
conviction off his job application.

420
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:33,794
And I should have reported it, but...

421
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:36,262
maybe you should talk to him.

422
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,898
Lola...

423
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,960
Hey. All right.

424
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,298
He's married, goes online to meet
women while he's on business trips.

425
00:23:58,331 --> 00:24:01,384
He's a schmuck, but he had nothing
to do with Marla's disappearance.

426
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,814
Are you sure? Positive.

427
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,631
They met. She left after like a minute.

428
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,727
Uh, he says that she was crying and
talking to some couple in the lobby.

429
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,258
He seems truthful.

430
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:13,208
I can't believe you told him I like
role-playing and dirty limericks,

431
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,422
you...

432
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,844
don't knock it till you've tried it.

433
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:20,068
Hang on.

434
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:23,547
You following me?

435
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,246
You have a lovely friend...

436
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:30,320
and daughter.

437
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:33,402
Is that a threat? 'Cause you really
shouldn't be confusing on that.

438
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:35,899
Not at all, Dr. Lightman.

439
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:43,597
Hey.

440
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:47,148
You sent someone to follow me,
and they threatened my daughter.

441
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:49,526
I didn't hire him. Some people here do.

442
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:52,057
Yeah, well, so do the drug cartels.

443
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:54,367
I warned you not to get involved.

444
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:57,490
All right. 4 months ago,
another woman went missing,

445
00:24:57,524 --> 00:25:00,765
Just like Marla Seeger,
but this one turned up dead.

446
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,956
Ok, listen. I insist that
you stop interfering. Ok?

447
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:08,577
All right, the night Marla Seeger
disappeared, she met a man named jerry conway.

448
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:11,600
Then she met a couple outside
the bar. Did you know that?

449
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,555
There is no case here.

450
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,578
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a young
woman who killed her own mother. Ok?

451
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:19,830
Hey. Su madre la estaba abusando.

452
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:22,591
No tenea otra opcion. Usted
lo habaa hecho lo mismo.

453
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,622
Por favor, quieto.

454
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:27,164
Quieto. Ok?

455
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:32,021
I think you should talk to this boy.
He's using his anger to hide something.

456
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:34,968
She's protecting him,
so just talk to the boy.

457
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:36,315
All right?

458
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:42,061
Lleala a la segunda
sala, por favor. Y tu?

459
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:44,768
Te sientas, por favor. Sientate.

460
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,978
How many of your people are
involved in this cover-Up?

461
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,723
There is no cover-up. Yeah, there is.

462
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:53,450
You may not be a part of it, but
you know one exists, don't you?

463
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:57,248
Ok. Ok.

464
00:25:57,797 --> 00:26:01,622
The couple that met Marla Seeger
say that she seemed unstable.

465
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,504
You talked to them?

466
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,621
Yes. Well, who are they?

467
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:09,120
Dan and Stacy Felder.
But it's a dead end.

468
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,438
You know, there is a case here.

469
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:14,028
Actually, there's 2. But you
already knew that, didn't you?

470
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,546
You're lucky you survived this accident.

471
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,768
Why did you fail to mention your
criminal history on your application?

472
00:26:24,802 --> 00:26:29,105
I was 19 when I stole that car. If I
say I'm a felon, who's gonna hire me?

473
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,543
They should have done
a background check.

474
00:26:31,578 --> 00:26:34,186
You've been in health care for a while.

475
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:35,668
Do you enjoy it?

476
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:37,619
It's very rewarding.

477
00:26:41,456 --> 00:26:42,827
I missed my calling.

478
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,351
I should have been a paramedic.

479
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,319
I mean, the action, the glory...

480
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,669
I mean, this...

481
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,562
That's real
life-and-death stuff.

482
00:26:50,597 --> 00:26:52,310
It's not too late. Heh.

483
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:56,053
Yeah. I'm too old. I don't know
how we get to where we're going.

484
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,020
Are we even aware of our choices?

485
00:26:58,414 --> 00:26:59,762
What, are they just chatting?

486
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,578
We're just getting a baseline right now.

487
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:03,899
You know, let me ask you something.

488
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:07,821
Was your "aha" moment
when you stole that car?

489
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:11,059
I don't understand the question.

490
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:14,644
You stole that car and got into
an accident with a 23-year-old kid.

491
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:18,630
The police found you
cradling his mangled body.

492
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:20,962
I mean, did you get into
health care because you realized

493
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:23,887
You could be around blood and
guts and death all the time?

494
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:27,794
That you wouldn't have to cause an
accident to get sexually stimulated?

495
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,836
Uh-oh. Sicko alert.

496
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:35,856
Pupils dilated. He's aroused.

497
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:37,931
From talking about blood and guts?

498
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,747
Yeah. They've sussed that out.

499
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:43,368
What did you put in the
blood at Euclid Park hospital?

500
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:45,635
- Nothing.
- You want people to suffer

501
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:46,930
and die at your hand.

502
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,437
I swear I had nothing to
do with the tainted blood.

503
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:51,863
I never did anything at Euclid Park.

504
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,433
Speech pattern's back to baseline.

505
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,543
He's probably telling the truth.

506
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,929
So, we're back to square one,

507
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:05,434
again.

508
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:10,216
Why are you being so hard on yourself?

509
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:13,333
People are dying, and I can't stop thinking
about that little boy with sickle cell,

510
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:15,458
and I have nothing
for the CDC. Gillian...

511
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,297
You know, if Cal were here, he
would have solved this by now.

512
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:19,431
I should have just
made him come back. Hey.

513
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,048
We can do this. Ok?

514
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,121
Excuse me. You can't come in here. Jack.

515
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:25,920
Mckenzie! How did you get in here?

516
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:29,137
I'm a reporter who talked her
way into attica once, remember?

517
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:32,585
Scheduled surgeries are being canceled
all over D.C. with no explanation.

518
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,586
Something's going on at the CDC.

519
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:37,552
And when a little bird told me you
were partnering with the Lightman group,

520
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:39,163
my reporter antenna went off.

521
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,022
Heh heh. Mckenzie, darling,

522
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:43,685
you have uncanny timing.
Let me fill you in.

523
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:46,254
Can we do it on camera? Heh heh.

524
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:14,886
Oh, yeah. Thank you very much.
I'll tell him. All right. Thanks.

525
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:19,371
So, a woman named Ramona Posner came
here alone from Miami about 4 months ago.

526
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:22,546
10 days after she disappeared, she
was found dead in an alley downtown.

527
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:25,324
State department and local
police ruled it an accident.

528
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:28,421
Well, a cynic might call it a pattern.

529
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:30,254
Yeah. Oh, by the way,

530
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:32,413
Rader seems to be making quite
an impression at the office.

531
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:34,323
Is he, now? Mm-Hmm. According to Loker,

532
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:36,188
Foster seems a bit gaga over him.

533
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:37,698
Lovely.

534
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:38,974
Oh, my God. What?

535
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,616
Is that jealousy? No.

536
00:29:44,337 --> 00:29:46,047
Where are you going?

537
00:29:47,315 --> 00:29:51,853
I left my hat out by the pool. Don't
worry, I won't do anything childish.

538
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:57,833
Why don't you take your extraordinary
powers of observation down to the pool

539
00:29:57,868 --> 00:29:59,942
and use them to keep an eye on Emily?

540
00:30:05,532 --> 00:30:07,067
You're jealous.

541
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:12,083
Marla came up to us in the lobby.

542
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,813
She said, "I hope you
experience the great joy I have,"

543
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,794
and then she left. It was bizarre.

544
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:19,207
You work with the police, right?

545
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:21,024
I mean, didn't they
tell you this already?

546
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,754
Yeah, but I wanted to
hear this from you two.

547
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:27,885
Mrs Felder, do you have any idea
why she would approach you like that?

548
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,943
No.

549
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,580
Not true.

550
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,689
We're gonna be late for the airport.

551
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:35,955
Here.

552
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,794
No, I'll hold that.

553
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:39,739
No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

554
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:44,853
You know, you're never gonna
get that through customs.

555
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,221
Why not? Because I'm gonna call them.

556
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:48,822
I'm gonna tell them you
got a suspicious package.

557
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:52,067
That's the kind of pain in the ass
I can be if I don't get the truth.

558
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:58,431
Look, it was just a hunch.

559
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,490
There's a fertility treatment center
here that matches egg donors with couples.

560
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:06,170
We're from Canada and it's
illegal to purchase eggs there.

561
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:10,890
The donors stay anonymous, but they
can choose who they want to donate to.

562
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:12,850
These are our frozen embryos.

563
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:15,299
So you thought that Marla
Seeger was your egg donor.

564
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,694
Yeah, for a moment. But then we
realized that it couldn't be her.

565
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:21,230
She was nothing like the person
the broker described to us.

566
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:31,822
Hey.

567
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,626
Did you find my mom?

568
00:31:33,662 --> 00:31:35,022
No, love.

569
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:36,368
Not yet.

570
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:40,845
Well, that's lovely.

571
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,579
Welcome to the age when they need you
but think they're smarter than you.

572
00:31:43,614 --> 00:31:45,971
Well, she always was.

573
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,049
All right, I've got one for you.

574
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:54,150
Marla Seeger was a
waitress in a diner, right?

575
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:55,886
And, uh...

576
00:31:56,355 --> 00:32:00,280
Ramona posner was a teacher's aide.

577
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:04,621
How do two women like that
afford fabulous trips to Zulia?

578
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,022
How?

579
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,330
Well...

580
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:09,954
Marla Seeger...

581
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,855
came here as an egg donor.

582
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,197
She was giving herself
hormone injections.

583
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,190
Right. And the needles
that the cops found.

584
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,359
Hence the mood swings.

585
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:23,457
- Hi, can I help you?
- Cal Lightman?

586
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:25,088
Yeah, he's here.

587
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,388
Just the man I wanted to see.

588
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:30,230
You need to call in some
of those embassy resources.

589
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:34,955
Can't. Someone from the police department
called my boss. I've been reassigned.

590
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:39,230
And threatened.

591
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:48,159
Our egg donors have high IQs,
are from stable backgrounds.

592
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:50,563
They don't have drug, alcohol,
or mental health problems,

593
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:52,414
and many of them are star athletes.

594
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:54,647
How specific can we be
in how the donors look?

595
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,665
I have a couple here, they're
seeking someone at least 5'9",

596
00:32:57,699 --> 00:33:00,180
blond, blue-eyed, athletic,
and an Ivy league school.

597
00:33:00,215 --> 00:33:02,980
We found a match
yesterday. It's only 50,000

598
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,021
in the states, it would be double that.

599
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:06,672
We're in here.

600
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,240
How do you harvest the eggs, then?

601
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:13,018
Our reproductive
endocrinologist, Dr. Alvarez,

602
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:15,553
he's responsible for everything.

603
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:17,106
Right.

604
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:18,506
How much do you pay the donors?

605
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,606
The fee is generous. Plus
they get a free trip to Zulia.

606
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:23,635
But no one does it for the money.

607
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,786
They just want to help the
right couples have a child.

608
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:28,131
That's wonderful.

609
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,386
That's wonderful. Yeah, it's great.

610
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:33,668
We actually are looking for a donor
with blue eyes and light-brown hair.

611
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:35,625
And 5'6".

612
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,521
I think I can arrange that.

613
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:45,096
Thought you were gonna say that.

614
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:48,014
Oh, Dr. Alvarez, these are the garrs.

615
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:49,842
Pleased to meet you.

616
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,409
May I have a minute with you, please?

617
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:54,056
Can it wait?

618
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:57,358
Oh, no, no. We've
gotta shove off anyway.

619
00:33:57,392 --> 00:33:59,103
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- We've got to think about it.

620
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,047
Yes. I mean, it's a big decision.

621
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,273
Yeah.

622
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,816
I've got a question
for you, Dr. Alvarez.

623
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:07,420
Um, we've been told that
my wife's infertility

624
00:34:07,455 --> 00:34:11,759
Is due to an estrogen imbalance
caused by the coriolis effect.

625
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:13,403
Is that possible?

626
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:15,584
That could very well be true.

627
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:18,491
Did you see wynn when I described
Marla? Flared nostrils, quick breath?

628
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:19,568
Yeah, he's in this.

629
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:21,549
There's no way all those donors
fit the criteria he described.

630
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:23,635
Oh, wait. See, they don't have to.

631
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,951
They find donors like Marla
Seeger who are desperate for money.

632
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:29,531
They insist the donors remain anonymous.

633
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,462
Wynn can give the buyers
any description he wants.

634
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,868
- It's a con.
- Yeah, absolutely it's a con.

635
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:39,037
Isn't the coriolis effect something
about the earth's rotation?

636
00:34:39,073 --> 00:34:41,408
- Yeah, exactly.
- Alvarez agreed with your theory.

637
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:43,576
Yeah. That's because
Alvarez is not a doctor.

638
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:45,031
He's a fake.

639
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:49,631
I'm in charge of blood orders
here, and Yager coordinates trades.

640
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:51,079
For the other hospitals in DC.

641
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:55,065
So why did I have to
reinterview these two guys?

642
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:58,239
Because we've got nothing else.

643
00:34:58,274 --> 00:34:59,632
Well...

644
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,190
he's exhibiting extreme control.

645
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,878
I guess he could still
be hiding something.

646
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:06,935
No, voice pitch is
steady. Dunst isn't lying.

647
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,898
But why does Yager keep looking
behind him? And why is he anxious?

648
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,134
What'd I miss?

649
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:14,866
What happened to the reporter?

650
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,225
I took care of her.

651
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,440
That could mean so many things.

652
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:21,200
So the story won't be on the news?

653
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:23,375
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

654
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:28,298
What, did Cal brainwash you into thinking
I'm some kind of media whore without scruples?

655
00:35:28,332 --> 00:35:32,067
Come on, guys, tell me you got something,
'cause the tox screen's all negative so far.

656
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:35,138
And the CDC is getting all
kind of calls from reporters.

657
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:38,277
I can charm one reporter, I can't
control the entire fourth estate.

658
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:42,372
Uh, we had the 5-car
pile-up on the beltway...

659
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,067
Wait.

660
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:46,237
Something's different.

661
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:48,170
Oh, I had to change the battery,

662
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:49,599
so we took a little break.

663
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:53,653
But they're both more relaxed now,
and Yager's not looking behind him.

664
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,534
Go back to before the break.

665
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,406
He was looking at that.

666
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:08,057
They got rid of it.

667
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:10,367
Why didn't they want us to see it?

668
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:23,200
Dr. Foster. What can we do for you?

669
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:25,578
We need to take a look around.

670
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:28,044
How often do you give blood?

671
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,335
Every 6 weeks or so. I have a rare
blood type. What are you looking for?

672
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:33,329
- Found it.
- That's sensitive equipment.

673
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:34,645
What's it for?

674
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,662
Processing patient fluid samples.

675
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,643
Could you be any more vague?

676
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:43,367
It's positive for narcotics.

677
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,570
So you've been running
a drug lab down here.

678
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,516
Hola.

679
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:55,590
Hola. que tal? Hey.

680
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:58,148
Where's Marla Seeger?

681
00:36:58,814 --> 00:37:01,398
- I don't know who that is.
- Not true.

682
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:03,648
You're the couple from
the office today, no?

683
00:37:03,683 --> 00:37:06,744
Your partner wynn sold you out,
made a deal with the police.

684
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:09,063
He said the scam was your idea.

685
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,830
He never said that.

686
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:14,384
Dr. Alvarez is
responsible for everything.

687
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:19,520
- That's a lie.
- No, I can assure you it's perfectly true.

688
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:21,546
What happened to her?

689
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:26,130
She was one of our egg donors.

690
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:28,979
She wasn't doing well on
the hormone treatments.

691
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:32,950
She wanted to get the procedure over with.
But then she called to change her mind.

692
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:35,320
Wynn brought her in anyway.
This is all his doing.

693
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:37,100
What happened to Marla?

694
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:41,850
I started the egg extraction,
but there were complications

695
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,864
and I punctured something.

696
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,044
She started to bleed.

697
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,000
So where is she?

698
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:51,844
Wynn has an apartment.

699
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,485
She's dying.

700
00:38:02,078 --> 00:38:03,648
One more day, we would have lost her.

701
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:04,924
Yeah.

702
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:08,508
Listen, how did you know that
I wasn't part of the coverup?

703
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:13,751
When I accused you, you showed
genuine anger, not guilt.

704
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:20,043
Listen, about that man you
sent to threaten my daughter.

705
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:22,179
That wasn't me, that was my boss.

706
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,964
You sure this man was
part of the cartels?

707
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,951
If I was you, I'd keep him
away from the evidence locker.

708
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,558
I'll keep an eye on my boss, too.

709
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:43,718
Rader and Foster busted a drug lab.
He's saying she's brilliant and has...

710
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,931
All right, keep it to yourself, huh?

711
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:47,899
Uh, Lou from the embassy
asked me to stick around...

712
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,995
Lou from the embassy? That's Lou
from the embassy. That's nice.

713
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,278
Yeah, he asked me to stick
around for a couple extra days.

714
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,603
So I said yeah. Is that all right?

715
00:38:53,638 --> 00:38:56,514
And here I was thinking
we were happily married.

716
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,938
The two techs were making designer
fentanyl in the hospital lab.

717
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:02,246
They were using the blood
as a means of transport.

718
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:05,045
Yeah. Liquid fentanyl was
injected into the blood bags,

719
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,689
which would then be delivered to all the
heroin processing centers in the city.

720
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,529
A lab within a lab.

721
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,147
Pretty ingenious. Problem was,

722
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:14,454
the new guy tomkins picked
up the wrong bags one day.

723
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:17,689
And the fentanyl never triggered
any alarms in the patient tox screen

724
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:21,051
because it's a common
anesthetic used for surgery.

725
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:22,690
Sorry I'm late.

726
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:24,796
They filled you in? Well,

727
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:27,234
I guess we'll reopen
the central blood bank

728
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:30,852
and track down all the units
that left Euclid Park hospital.

729
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,808
Thanks to you.

730
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:40,120
By the way, you should both know that I taped
an interview with McKenzie Dodd about the case.

731
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:42,755
Should be airing in about an hour.

732
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:46,317
How could you do that?

733
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:48,965
The CDC hasn't had the press conference.

734
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,699
Oh, I forgot.

735
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:51,928
You love the spotlight.

736
00:39:51,963 --> 00:39:54,199
I promised an exlcusive to buy us time.

737
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,708
This was all about getting back at
Cal and the Lightman group, wasn't it?

738
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:57,916
Gillian...

739
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:01,311
You know me too well.

740
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:05,375
It was fun.

741
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:06,820
Bye, Jack.

742
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,976
Here's my card.

743
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:17,477
In case you plan on
making a life change.

744
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:23,204
Thanks, man.

745
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:26,669
Well, it's been a very tense time,
but the threat has been eliminated.

746
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:30,520
Dr. Cho credits you with helping a
little boy with sickle cell anemia.

747
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:33,108
I knew he was slick, but, man...

748
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:35,655
You were the first person that
the CDC turned to for help.

749
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,712
Could I just say that I owe a debt
of gratitude to Dr. Gillian Foster,

750
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:41,523
who really cracked this case.
This potential health disaster

751
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,746
wouldn't have been averted without her.

752
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:55,174
Mommy!

753
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:16,166
So you're saying that you can just treat
me like a child whenever you want to.

754
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:19,690
No, I'm not. I'm
saying that on occasion,

755
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:23,684
it's my right as a parent to be
suspicious and overprotective.

756
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:26,259
Ok. Then on occasion,
I reserve the right

757
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:29,517
to throw tantrums and
spend all your money.

758
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:31,823
Deal.

759
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:37,005
Now, if you're done forcing me to work,
can I have my holiday back, please?

760
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:43,151
How do you learn to live longer?

761
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:46,249
Well, there's meditation and yoga,

762
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:49,289
but for you, I'd definitely say do both.

763
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:52,333
Yoga's that thing you do in a lounge
chair with a mai-tai in your hand, right?

764
00:41:52,368 --> 00:41:54,312
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

765
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:02,539
Hey! Hey.

766
00:42:02,573 --> 00:42:05,000
"Don't hate me too much because
I'm filled with admiration."

767
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:06,581
Give it to me.

768
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:08,972
So who sent the flowers, then?

769
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:10,634
'Cause you know I'm the jealous type.

770
00:42:10,669 --> 00:42:11,923
Welcome home, Cal.

771
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:14,093
Rumor has it you never even
left town, but that can't be true

772
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:15,810
because you look like a different man.

773
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:17,438
I feel like a different man.

774
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:19,360
You know, a vacation's
a wonderful thing.

775
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:21,330
6 days of nothing.

776
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:23,388
Well, I heard you
were working on a case.

777
00:42:23,423 --> 00:42:25,448
Well, it barely qualifies as a case.

778
00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:27,978
I feel so relaxed that...

779
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,967
I don't even care that Rader was here.

780
00:42:32,056 --> 00:42:33,695
Then Torres told you.

781
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,277
Well...

782
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:39,410
So, uh, he sent you the flowers, then?

783
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:41,109
Yep.

784
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:44,943
Have you checked them for aphids?

785
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:48,140
No, no, I don't care.

786
00:42:48,175 --> 00:42:50,554
But did he see any of my research?

787
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:52,813
I kept him out of your library.

788
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:54,745
Oh. And is everyone still here?

789
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,036
He didn't poach anyone.

790
00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:58,882
And did he break into
the office supply closet?

791
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,199
He definitely didn't do
that. Except one thing...

792
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:03,873
the sprinkler system was
acting up a little bit.

793
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:06,104
That's odd.

794
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:09,982
What exactly happened
between you and Rader?

795
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:11,868
Oh, I'd tell you,

796
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:14,093
but you'd think I was lying.

797
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:17,432
Loker. My card.

798
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:20,366
Just in case you're thinking
of making a life change.
