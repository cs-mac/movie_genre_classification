1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,377
<i>This is "Radio Rebel",
live from the underground.</i>

2
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:14,246
<i>You don't know who I am...</i>

3
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,115
<i>But I know who you are...</i>

4
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,684
<i>Because I'm one of you.</i>

5
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:22,654
<i>I got a "minus" in participation...</i>

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,757
<i>But you can't give me
a "minus" for who I am!</i>

7
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,559
<i>So, since grades are being handed out,</i>

8
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,528
<i>I think I'll give all
of us at Lincoln Bay High</i>

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,131
<i>an "F", for labeling each other.</i>

10
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,365
<i>Jocks.</i>

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,700
<i>Outcasts.</i>

12
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:39,338
<i>Queen bees and their fellow pops.</i>

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,707
<i>And... new-born pops.</i>

14
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,444
<i>Guys, these are all labels,
not who we really are.</i>

15
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,413
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

16
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:50,682
<i>now those differences just divide us.</i>

17
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,384
<i>You deserve to embrace your awesomeness.</i>

18
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,553
<i>Stand up for who you are.</i>

19
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,488
<i>Reject the status quo.</i>

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,424
<i>I dare you.</i>

21
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,592
Okay. Last night. "Radio Rebel..."

22
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,294
...was awesome?

23
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,562
As usual!

24
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,231
"Reject the status quo"
is my new life motto.

25
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,167
She's so... inspiring.

26
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,369
So... herself.

27
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,504
I wish I could be more like her.

28
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,739
You should talk to your step-dad.

29
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,441
What? Why?

30
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,608
Uh, he runs Slam-FM,

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,710
the biggest radio station in Seattle.

32
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,579
Maybe he could give you an internship.

33
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,381
That'd be a confidence booster, right?

34
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:23,782
Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,085
He's been married to my
mom for, what, two months?

36
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,753
Probably thinks I'm a total step-freak.

37
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,390
I freak out when he asks
what kind of cereal I want.

38
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,594
I just wish I could talk to everyone

39
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,728
the way I talk to you...

40
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,131
I guess that's why you're my B.F.F.

41
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,333
B.F.F.T.L.E.W.E.

42
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,603
"Best friends for totally, like, ever,

43
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,205
without exception."

44
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,339
Catchy.

45
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,707
You need a relaxation technique.

46
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,442
When I'm memorizing lines for drama,

47
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,611
I imagine I'm breathing in the words.

48
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,546
Audrey? What does that even mean?

49
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,348
A- h-h-hem.

50
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,617
You need to Bree-ea-athe

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,719
your wo-o-o-ords.

52
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,523
How can you even breathe
at a time like this?

53
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,425
Problem, Barry?

54
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,659
Last night,

55
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,362
Radio Rebel revealed the biggest clue yet

56
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,363
about her identity.

57
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,665
She goes to our school!

58
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,300
She mentioned it at minute 14:30,

59
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,635
in Tuesday night's podcast.

60
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,870
Wow, obsess much, Larry?

61
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,372
Obsess? Please!

62
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,374
I- I would hardly describe myself

63
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,643
as "obsessive."

64
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,650
What?

65
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,620
It's flu season!

66
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,155
It's so exciting.

67
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,524
Someone on the radio
who's actually one of us.

68
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,359
She could be that girl.

69
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,194
Or... or her. Or...

70
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,262
Or her.

71
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,396
Or that girl that girl.

72
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,564
No. That girl's too tall.

73
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,600
Radio Rebel's voice sounds 5'6" to me.

74
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,169
And her hair is reddish.

75
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,470
Like Tara's.

76
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,938
No. She's nothing like Tara.

77
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,641
Hey! What's... that supposed to mean?

78
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,177
Oh. We... We love you,

79
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:01,313
but you're nothing like Radio Rebel...

80
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,848
Who's definitely a blonde.

81
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,849
And you know this how?

82
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,951
Radio Rebel is my soul mate.

83
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:09,688
For example, I also got a
"minus" in participation.

84
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,756
How can that be?

85
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:11,757
You never shut up!

86
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,394
Exactly.

87
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,671
Honestly, it's a relief that we broke up.

88
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,406
The whole long-distance relationship thing

89
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,640
was just lame.

90
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,841
Well, I'm glad you've moved on,

91
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,310
because you've already had

92
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,245
three formal asks to prom.

93
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,514
Alan Ackerman...

94
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,449
He's too short. Think of the pictures.

95
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,852
Okay. How about Jamie Wardle?

96
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,622
Have you ever noticed
how pointy his head is?

97
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,458
It's like a triangle.

98
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,993
How do we "reject the status quo"

99
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:51,530
when the status quo is... status quo?

100
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,532
Like Radio Rebel said...

101
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,767
Be ourselves.

102
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,470
Audrey!

103
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,605
So, next...

104
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,473
Erin Brooks is officially campaigning

105
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,941
for prom queen.

106
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,810
I just confirmed it on her fan page.

107
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,412
Whatever. No competition there.

108
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,548
Why don't I have a fan page?

109
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,650
I'll get right on it.

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,587
Hi, Stacy. How's it going?

111
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,490
This... is what I was talking about.

112
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,558
Everyone thinks

113
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,892
they can just talk to us

114
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,894
because of that eternally
lame "radio babble."

115
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,030
Methinks she protests too much.

116
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,599
Yeah, we thinks...

117
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,900
Wait! What do we thinks?

118
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,036
That maybe she is Radio Rebel.

119
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:35,507
Like I would ever encourage
people like you to talk to us.

120
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,410
Ah-hah! So you admit you listen to her.

121
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,047
This one's staring at me.

122
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,548
Make it stop.

123
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,784
Please don't stand so close to us.

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,920
You and I aren't any different.

125
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,589
Like Radio Rebel said...

126
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,890
no words.

127
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,592
You don't think we're different?

128
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,460
Watch and learn.

129
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,928
Principal Moreno!

130
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,998
Stacy!

131
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,502
Is everything all right over here?

132
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,770
Actually, no.

133
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,038
Audrey was trying

134
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,540
to get me to listen to
some podcast in class.

135
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,641
Of course, I said no.

136
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,610
What? No. I mean, I never...

137
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:12,844
you know...

138
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,414
That there is an anti-distraction policy.

139
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,815
Let me see your bag.

140
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,450
But I wasn't even listening to it!

141
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,319
Well, now you can't, can you?

142
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,388
You, too, young lady. Hand it over.

143
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,494
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention, Stacy.

144
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,067
Get it now?

145
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,337
Your little DJ hero doesn't
know what she's talking about.

146
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,740
Oh?

147
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,009
Does "her royal shyness"
want to say something?

148
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,110
I...

149
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,112
Huh?

150
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,580
Uh...

151
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,548
I thought not.

152
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,884
Bye, girls.

153
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,853
Greetings to our loyal fans.

154
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,722
This is Gabe and Gavin,
or as you know us...

155
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:57,823
the "Gees!"...

156
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:58,990
...coming at you to say thank you

157
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,726
for voting for us to play at your prom.

158
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,127
We'll make sure it totally rocks!

159
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,429
Well, well, well, look who it is.

160
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,765
Lincoln bay's own Internet sensation.

161
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,799
Hey, Stacy.

162
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,735
Gavin... and Gavin's camera.

163
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,136
I heard you guys are playing prom.

164
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,471
Pretty sweet.

165
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,740
Bye.

166
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,608
Dude...

167
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,743
You are in.

168
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,810
What do you mean?

169
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,978
Stacy and her college boyfriend

170
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,012
just called it quits.

171
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,647
Which means, as of right now,

172
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,483
she doesn't have a prom date.

173
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,851
I can't ask her to prom.

174
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,753
Didn't you see that?

175
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:30,389
"Hi, Gavin."

176
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,491
It's the band, man.

177
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,625
We're getting some heat,

178
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,960
a little attention from the ladies.

179
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,895
Your stock is on the
rise, and Stacy's noticing.

180
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,563
Well, what would I even say?

181
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,931
Listen to me. Okay? Focus.

182
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,600
Eye of the tiger.

183
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,634
Don't stop believing.

184
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,102
We are the champions.

185
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,804
Are you just quoting song titles?

186
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,806
This is your chance, man.

187
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:47,939
Seize the moment.

188
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,107
Our fan base is expanding...

189
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,809
to other schools, the city...

190
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,877
I still feel like

191
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,645
that awkward kid with a guitar

192
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,813
just hanging out in your garage.

193
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:55,881
Forget that nerd!

194
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:56,915
Now you're "Gavin."

195
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,517
Of the "Gees."

196
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,751
We're going all the way, baby!

197
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,853
Recording contracts, sold-out stadiums.

198
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,522
Gees for life?

199
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,658
Gees for life.

200
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,793
Ow!

201
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,995
All right, everybody.

202
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,997
Today, we are going to
be working on a project

203
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,167
with Mr. Saul's drama class.

204
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,869
Oh, here they are now. Come on in, people.

205
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,137
Please, pick a seat.

206
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,971
Quickly.

207
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,740
This is so exciting!

208
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,746
Gavin! This seat is free.

209
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,819
I will be pairing you all up,

210
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,788
and...

211
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,860
What is Gavin doing here?

212
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,995
Uh... he's in drama?

213
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,096
You know, you could talk to him.

214
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,033
Since, like, the first Harry Potter movie.

215
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,503
Ugh... No. No, he's...

216
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,871
He is a newborn pop.

217
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,539
Totally wrong social bracket.

218
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,975
The best thing for me to do
is just avoid him altogether.

219
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,878
Gavin's not elitist like that.

220
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,782
Ask yourself, what would Radio Rebel do?

221
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:11,623
You will be translating
a scene from Shakespeare...

222
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,958
Hey.

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,125
It's a good thing

224
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,894
we're in class together now.

225
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,963
Saves me from having to find you later.

226
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,265
Oh? And why would you have to find me?

227
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,734
'Cause I wanted to ask you something.

228
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,869
About prom?

229
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,004
I need a volunteer.

230
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,708
Who would like to write a scene suggestion

231
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,543
on the b...?

232
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,611
Board.

233
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,216
Ahem!

234
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:43,221
Oh! Did you wanna... pick a volunteer?

235
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,823
I got excited.

236
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,959
Drama is my life.

237
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,563
Okay! Who wants to write a suggestion?

238
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,966
Let's see hands, people!

239
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:59,104
Okay... hands, hands, ha...

240
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:02,307
Tara! How about you?

241
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,275
Come on up.

242
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,981
You can do it.

243
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,983
Just don't make eye-contact.

244
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,809
I was thinking maybe that we could...

245
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,946
Hello! Walk much?

246
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,247
Uh...

247
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,016
Oh!

248
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,956
Okay, people. Settle, settle.

249
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,023
I still need a volunteer.

250
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,893
Are you all right? Are you okay?

251
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,703
Hey. Delilah. Look at this.

252
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:05,837
Cami Q called me,

253
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,172
she told me I had to check out

254
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,373
this new podcast girl.

255
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,642
She's... she's really something special.

256
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,647
That's for my pedicure.

257
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,115
<i>That was the latest single</i>

258
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,251
<i>but who are you, exactly?</i>

259
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,654
<i>I think we're always juggling
a bunch of different "you's".</i>

260
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:26,024
<i>Like, when you're with your friends,</i>

261
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,027
<i>sometimes, you're the funny one,</i>

262
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,028
<i>or the loud one...</i>

263
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,097
No!
N- n-n-n-n-no!

264
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,733
<i>How about with someone you like?</i>

265
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,067
<i>Which "you" shows up then?</i>

266
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:42,069
<i>Which is probably why I never talk to him.</i>

267
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:46,311
<i>Or do you feel like you're
17 different people, too?</i>

268
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,879
Yes, I do!

269
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,280
I totally feel that way!

270
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,316
She's amazing, right?

271
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,020
Exactly what Slam-FM
needs... a fresh, new vibe...

272
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,688
to get us out of this ratings slump...

273
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,392
You need to ask Tara what she thinks!

274
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,661
It could be a bonding moment.

275
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,096
Yeah... I mean, I could... I could...

276
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,398
I could do that.

277
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,033
Be, like, kind of a bonding thing.

278
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,768
Step-daughter, step-father...

279
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,769
Mm-hmm!

280
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,671
Stop eating my "foot fruit."

281
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,040
I will, uh, I'll do that.

282
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,809
I'll talk to her, about it all.

283
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,044
You can do it!

284
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,779
It'll be a bonding thing.

285
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:21,913
Yeah!

286
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:22,981
Huh.

287
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,827
Hey!
- Rob?

288
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,063
What are you doing here?

289
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,931
I live here.

290
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,733
Okay.

291
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,034
Thanks for stopping by.

292
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,936
So! What do you think of Radio Rebel?

293
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,438
What? Why?

294
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,807
It's just I just want to get
your take on her, that's all.

295
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,842
She's great.

296
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,143
Bye now!

297
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,912
You know what? I... I
knew that you'd think so.

298
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,314
I really did. You know?

299
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,453
We have so much in common, you know?

300
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:04,456
Yeah, like, we're both super-busy.

301
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,324
So, I... look.

302
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,027
I know that this is a really
difficult transition for you,

303
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,096
and, with your dad working in Taiwan,

304
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,298
and your mom and I, and...

305
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,234
I just want you to know
that you have a friend here.

306
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,269
It's fine. I'm fine. Really.

307
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,775
So, this is good, right?

308
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,111
I mean, here we are, we're hanging out,

309
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:29,247
we're listening to Radio Rebel, and...

310
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,749
Together...

311
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,092
That's weird.

312
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,232
What happened? The music just stopped.

313
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,233
Did yours stop?

314
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,137
Where'd she go?

315
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,873
And that rounds off the final set

316
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,242
for my favorite local band.

317
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,845
Now, here is an extra long
track just for you guys.

318
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,947
I hope you dig it.

319
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,122
You're Radio Rebel?

320
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,057
That depends.

321
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,225
Am I in trouble?

322
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,028
No! No, of course not. I... I...

323
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,165
I don't know how you're doing that?

324
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,166
I mean, you're so shy.

325
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,034
I am.

326
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:26,337
But... she's not.

327
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,974
I don't know...

328
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,376
It just works.

329
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,844
I can't believe it.

330
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,245
I mean, I-I love it, I
just can't believe it!

331
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,215
We're gonna take Slam-FM
to the next level.

332
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,983
I'm... I'm sorry, "we"?

333
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,987
Yeah! I... you're gonna be
Slam-FM's next big thing.

334
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,890
You're hired. That's
for sure. You're hired.

335
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,431
Oh, I just happened to be eavesdropping!

336
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,599
I hope you don't mind.

337
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,267
O- m-g!

338
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,070
My baby is gonna take
slam to the next level!

339
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,211
What's the matter?

340
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,546
What if I mess it up?

341
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,316
Oh, honey.

342
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,318
You have to take risks.

343
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,353
Like, I always thought

344
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,622
chartreuse was a bad color for me,

345
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,225
and then I tried it, and
now it's my trademark.

346
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,228
How do you know something isn't fabu,

347
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,262
if you never try it, right?

348
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,236
<i>Look out. You're in the twelfth night group</i>

349
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,871
with Stacy and Gavin.

350
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,574
No, no, no. No, I can't.

351
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,243
Talk to him.

352
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,111
He's just a person.

353
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,114
Go on. Go. Do it.

354
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,920
Hey.

355
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,456
Cool shirt!

356
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,925
I love that band!

357
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,261
<i>"You first" rules.</i>

358
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,428
The Gees can only dream

359
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,530
of being that good some day.

360
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:03,668
The Gees are totally as good as you first.

361
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,436
Really?

362
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,007
Okay! Here's our scene.

363
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,375
Tara is viola.

364
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,277
Now, Tara this role does require

365
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,012
both walking and talking.

366
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,413
Think you can manage?

367
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,215
Just kidding, you know I love you.

368
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,117
Okay, and, Gavin, you're orsino.

369
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,118
Wait...

370
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,020
What about you?

371
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,154
Brower has me directing.

372
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,490
And we've got a lot of work to do.

373
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,459
If you like you first,

374
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,561
you should check out "red letter day."

375
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,963
You ever hear of them?

376
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,432
Uh-uh! No band talk right now, gav.

377
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,566
Sorry, but I don't want

378
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,602
anyone to think I'm favoring you

379
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,937
just 'cause I'm your prom date.

380
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,338
Speaking of,

381
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,308
we need to work on your prom king campaign.

382
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,278
Of course, he's taking Stacy to prom.

383
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,314
Look, at least you talked to him.

384
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,282
For you, that's major progress.

385
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,584
I barely got two words out.

386
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,286
Come to my house tonight.

387
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,454
We'll do yoga.

388
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,588
I'll teach you

389
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,157
the "extended hyena" pose I invented,

390
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,325
and we'll listen to Radio Rebel.

391
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,093
I can't.

392
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,728
What do you mean?

393
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,364
It's Radio Rebel's first show on Slam-FM.

394
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,732
Do you realize how epic that is?

395
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,534
I mean, she was popular before,

396
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,036
but now it's, like, the
whole world will be listening,

397
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,171
including us!

398
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,041
I have plans.

399
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,343
What plans?

400
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,677
Family plans.

401
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,180
You are the worst liar.

402
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,281
You sound just like you did

403
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,382
when you said you liked

404
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,984
that haircut I got at the mall.

405
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:26,985
It wasn't that bad.

406
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,386
It was mullet-adjacent.

407
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,754
Tell me what you're hiding,

408
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,389
or I'll start screaming in three seconds.

409
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,590
What?
- One...

410
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,025
Audrey, no-no-no!
- Two...

411
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,699
Well?

412
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,436
I'm sorry.

413
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,205
I can't tell you.

414
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,341
I thought I was your b. F.F.T.L.E.

415
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,243
"Without exception."

416
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:56,014
Then... Why don't you trust me?

417
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,524
Gavin. 3:00.

418
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,526
Your 3:00, or my 3:00?

419
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,262
We have the same 3:00.

420
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,333
Oh. He's coming over here. What do I do?

421
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,601
Oh! For the record,

422
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,037
this is why you don't ice your friends out.

423
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,439
Hey, Tara. What's up?

424
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,211
So, do you wanna run lines on the weekend?

425
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,748
Or we could mime the lines,

426
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,683
if you're not feeling particularly talky?

427
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,585
"Mime." "Talky..."

428
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,622
I'm gonna go.
M- me. N-now.

429
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,258
Um...

430
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,160
Okay...

431
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,795
Tara!

432
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,696
Free meals!

433
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,065
Score.

434
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,703
<i>Hey, Seattle!</i>

435
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,705
<i>You're listening to Slam-FM!</i>

436
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,676
I want Radio Rebel ads on
every major social network,

437
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,212
just blast the Internet...
updates every hour.

438
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,413
Want to blanket the market.

439
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,514
Good. Bye.

440
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,783
So, I was talking to your mom

441
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,718
about keeping Radio Rebel on the q. T.,

442
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,353
and I think it's a good idea.

443
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,656
You know? I don't want you
to talk to anybody about it.

444
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,158
Radio Rebel is the shot in the arm

445
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,393
that Slam-FM needs.

446
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,595
Since the last show that I produced

447
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,696
with snazzy dog crashed and burned,

448
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,198
there's a lot hinging on this.

449
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,265
Right? Including my job.

450
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,767
But, no pressure. Okay?

451
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,537
So, your show's gonna run
7:00 P.M., Monday to Friday,

452
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,239
since that was the time that you broadcast

453
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,574
from your room,

454
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:33,344
and you'll be taking over
from... DJ Fluffy Mac!

455
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,213
Who is moving to Sunday night.

456
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,216
All right, so let's show you the booth.

457
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,218
Tara?

458
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,421
Hey! Tara!

459
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,622
Remember me?

460
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,791
Cami q. We met at the slam Christmas party.

461
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,895
When rob told me you were Radio Rebel,

462
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,497
this was my face...

463
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,564
"Wha...?"

464
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,802
'Cause I thought you were
just this little shy thing,

465
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,539
but you are all kinds of amazing.

466
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,241
You...

467
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,443
Are fierce!

468
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,311
I just can't wait to
see what you got goin'...

469
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,449
Tara?

470
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,655
Are you okay?

471
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,924
I can't speak to Gavin without freezing,

472
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,560
how am I supposed to
speak to all of Seattle?

473
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:25,396
It's no different than
recording in your bedroom.

474
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,497
Yes, it is!

475
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,765
In my bedroom,

476
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,367
I could pretend that nobody was listening,

477
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,735
but, right know, I know
that everybody is listening,

478
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,270
and rob's putting all this pressure on it,

479
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,804
and my mom wants it to
be my "chartreuse moment",

480
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,173
and I don't even like chartreuse,

481
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,507
I don't even know what chartreuse is.

482
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,376
Tara?

483
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,680
Come out where I can see you.

484
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,553
Everybody gets nervous.

485
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,422
It's totally normal.

486
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,857
Just...

487
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,326
Consider me like your best friend

488
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,827
here at slam.

489
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,530
Catch your breath.

490
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,832
Then we'll go out together.

491
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,268
Okay?

492
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,309
All right.

493
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,583
This whole booth is all for me?

494
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,718
We call this "the live room",

495
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,321
'cause when that red light is on,

496
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,855
you're live.

497
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,757
If you wanna move around, use this headset,

498
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,459
so we don't miss anything.

499
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,895
There's your vocal-masking button.

500
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,930
You already know all about that.

501
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,333
Song selection's up to you.

502
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,839
All right?

503
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:46,010
There's, like... 20.000 songs here.

504
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,613
You've got some time before you go on

505
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:49,747
if you wanna practice,

506
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,881
get comfortable?

507
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,019
Practice...

508
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,354
Great. Okay, um...

509
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,488
Maybe I should play a song,

510
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,623
just to make sure I know how to...

511
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,826
No.
No-no-no!

512
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,828
Bad practice, bad practice.

513
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,630
Don't worry about it.

514
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:06,764
You'll be fine.

515
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,833
I'm right next door, if you need me.

516
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,669
Just pretend you're in your bedroom.

517
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,638
You're on in 15.

518
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,607
14. 13.

519
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,043
12. 11.

520
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,479
Ten. Nine.

521
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,780
Eight. Seven.

522
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,383
Six. Five. Four.

523
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,053
Three...

524
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:32,590
<i>You're listening to Slam-FM!</i>

525
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,924
<i>This is the Radio Rebel show!</i>

526
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:38,296
This is Radio Rebel, live from Slam-FM.

527
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,899
Moving the show from my
bedroom to the slam studios

528
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,067
was a bit terrifying,

529
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,603
but life's all about change, right?

530
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:49,307
<i>Maybe some people just
wanna label you as one thing,</i>

531
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,941
<i>compartmentalize you, and walk away...</i>

532
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,411
<i>But we don't have to let that stop us</i>

533
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,079
<i>from becoming who we want to be...</i>

534
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,715
<i>Or, like that kid with
the remote-control car...</i>

535
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:01,419
<i>to invent the first all-green rocket ship.</i>

536
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,388
<i>Or the girl who gives everyone
carnations on Valentine's day,</i>

537
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,956
<i>just so no one feels left out...</i>

538
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,059
<i>Maybe she'll grow up to be president.</i>

539
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,028
<i>Guys, if we just drop the
labels and the cliques...</i>

540
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:17,568
<i>...We have
no idea what we're capable of.</i>

541
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,704
Okay, if you're with me on this,

542
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,372
wear red tomorrow.

543
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,774
It'll be like saying that,
despite our differences,

544
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,710
we're in this together.

545
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,679
This next song... Is from "red letter day."

546
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:42,993
Ahem!

547
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,729
Do you like my glasses?

548
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,564
But you have freakishly good vision.

549
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,099
Fashion shouldn't be functional.

550
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,868
Do you know why I picked red rims?

551
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,536
I assume you do

552
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,538
because of your red shirt.

553
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,806
I can't believe

554
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,874
all these people are wearing red

555
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,609
just because Radio Rebel said to.

556
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,877
How cool is that?

557
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,046
So you did listen to
Radio Rebel last night!

558
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,482
What happened to your mystery plans?

559
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,017
Can you guys tell us apart?

560
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,121
You guys are fraternal, not identical.

561
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,161
Hey...

562
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:20,965
We just ran a recording
of Radio Rebel's show

563
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,767
through a voice-analysis app.

564
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:23,901
We're closer than ever

565
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,636
to uncovering her true identity.

566
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,771
Picture it:

567
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,806
"Local twins crack Radio Rebel's I.D."

568
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:29,907
Soon, I'll be able

569
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,876
to profess my undying love.

570
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:32,910
We'll be famous.

571
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,678
I mean, we could get a reward.

572
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,480
Or at least our own reality TV show.

573
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,549
...where she and I could be married,

574
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,151
live on TV.

575
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,653
Tara? Since your step-dad runs slam,

576
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,188
maybe you could help us out.

577
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,924
Oh. I'm not allowed to go to Slam-FM

578
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,193
while, um, she's there.

579
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,695
To keep the mystery, uh, mysterious.

580
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,930
The truth is,

581
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,031
Tara doesn't have

582
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,933
time to do friend-related things.

583
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,670
Audrey?

584
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,872
Audrey. Audrey!

585
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,840
What?

586
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,478
Forget it. I'm leaving.

587
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm about to tell you
something so top-secret,

588
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,689
you have to promise never
to repeat it to anyone.

589
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,724
I won't tell anyone. I swear.

590
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,693
Hoo. You can say it.

591
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,129
Um...

592
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,764
Tara!

593
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,499
<i>You have to breathe your words.</i>

594
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:34,138
Come on, breathe the words.

595
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,239
Breathe in!

596
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,841
Ahem.

597
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,877
I'm... Radio Rebel.

598
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,245
Oh!

599
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,546
I don't believe you.

600
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,114
If you're like me,

601
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,784
and believe music can change
the world one track at a time,

602
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:50,254
you're gonna love this track
by one of my new fave bands.

603
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,923
Wow.

604
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,259
I can't believe she's... you!

605
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,660
I mean... you're her!

606
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,829
I mean, you're the last person

607
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,831
I'd expect to be Radio Rebel, Tara.

608
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,933
It's been driving me
crazy, not telling you.

609
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,835
And, of course, I've
been wanting to hang out,

610
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,203
but I've been doing my show.

611
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,038
Here's the thing... you can't tell anyone,

612
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,540
not even tell Larry and Barry,

613
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,509
because slam wants to
keep it this big secret,

614
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,910
and so do I.

615
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,084
Remember...

616
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,553
<i>Twelfth night is all
about mistaken identity.</i>

617
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,822
Tara, your character has a
crush on Gavin's character.

618
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,824
But she's hiding from the law...

619
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:27,858
or whatever...

620
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,193
so, she's disguised as a guy,

621
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,962
and Gavin's character
doesn't know you like him.

622
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,165
So, you're in agony.

623
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,934
I need to see real pain.

624
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,069
Let's do the end again!

625
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,010
And... act!

626
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,280
My sister likes this guy.

627
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,815
And, by "my sister", I-I mean...

628
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,118
My sister, not me... at all...

629
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,186
'Cause... look at my pants.

630
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,789
See? I'm totally a dude.

631
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,726
Does this guy... like her, too?

632
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,267
That's the tragic part.

633
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,637
She hasn't told him how she feels, so...

634
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:19,109
She's not sure if he feels the same way.

635
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,216
What's she waiting for?

636
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,720
For him to make the first move.

637
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,090
But, tell me...

638
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,359
If she never confesses her love,

639
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,829
does that make her love any less real?

640
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,366
Okay!

641
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,868
Some of that worked...

642
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,604
And some of it didn't.

643
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,774
There is a fine line between
pain and constipation.

644
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,176
Let's take five.

645
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,385
Oh, you, uh, you dropped...

646
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:02,853
Oh, thanks.

647
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,989
Is that a demo?

648
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,256
For the Gees?

649
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,726
Yeah, you know, trying
out a few new things.

650
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,127
Actually,

651
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,962
I'd love to try out some
more new stuff, to be honest.

652
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,330
Like, I've got another song...
- We're back!

653
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,033
Let's go! Come on! Get up, get up.

654
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:19,837
Come on. Go, go, go, go. Get in positions.

655
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,141
Oh!

656
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,044
Let's try it with Tara
wa-a-a-ay over here.

657
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,145
Yeah! Mm-hmm.

658
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,813
Perfect! Perfect.

659
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,415
Uh, I love it!

660
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,384
Okay. Hold on.

661
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,319
Tara? Did you want to say something?

662
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,320
She's fine.

663
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,421
Action.

664
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:41,291
Tara? You listen to Radio Rebel, right?

665
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,762
You were wearing red
yesterday, so I figured.

666
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,831
Rebel's right.

667
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,434
Life's about taking risks.

668
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,302
Making changes.

669
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,338
So...

670
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,673
Go ahead.

671
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,374
Say what you feel.

672
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,913
Well, it's just, this scene...

673
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,982
It's about...

674
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,917
Us falling for each other.

675
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,919
Even though we don't know it yet,

676
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,055
and, I...

677
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,990
And blocking like this feels weird, right?

678
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:13,991
Right! Exactly.

679
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,325
Yeah, I mean...

680
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,827
The audience is supposed to get

681
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,329
what we're feeling from
what we're not saying.

682
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:22,366
It only works if we're...

683
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,801
Closer.

684
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,436
Yeah.

685
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,338
Yeah. I like that better, too.

686
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,207
Okay.

687
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,076
We clearly need extra rehearsal.

688
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,477
My place. Tonight at 7:00.

689
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,212
Oh...

690
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,381
I can't tonight. There's...

691
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,084
Wednesday's mandatory family dinner...

692
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:42,720
With my... family...

693
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:43,854
Dinner.

694
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,489
Fine. Whatever.

695
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:46,957
Lunch. Tomorrow.

696
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:50,828
Everybody's a director now.

697
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,730
Good job.

698
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,367
Okay.

699
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:15,285
You people at Lincoln bay high

700
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,387
killed it with the red yesterday.

701
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,390
I noticed one of you
wearing these red specs

702
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,860
that were the epitome of cool.

703
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:26,497
But can we talk about what's
not cool, for a second?

704
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:29,333
How the school keeps
confiscating our stuff.

705
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,869
<i>I mean, I've lost two sets of headphones</i>

706
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,203
<i>and an mp3 player,</i>

707
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,874
<i>although I did notice that some of us</i>

708
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,976
<i>seem to be exempt</i>

709
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,445
<i>from this little "stuff
snatching" epidemic.</i>

710
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,213
<i>Funny how that works, huh?</i>

711
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,282
<i>Guys, it's not just our playlists</i>

712
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,385
and players we're being
deprived of, you know?

713
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,355
Music is the soundtrack to our lives.

714
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,158
It's where we've been,
and where we're going,

715
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,260
and everywhere in between.

716
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,861
Our music is who we are.

717
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:01,031
Are we gonna let someone
just snatch that away from us?

718
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:05,803
Or are we... gonna change the game?

719
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,304
Here's a new song

720
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,539
about, uh...

721
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,341
Trying things you never thought you could.

722
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,111
Like, I've been trying to do
a bunch of new things lately,

723
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,880
and this song severely inspires me.

724
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,482
So... check it out.

725
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,819
Vibe it, really, really dig on it,

726
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,054
and, then... remember that feeling.

727
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,456
Tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.,

728
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,826
stop what you're doing, get up, and dance.

729
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,828
Just express yourself! Let yourself out.

730
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,130
This is "turn it all around" by the Gees.

731
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,481
You're all going to get into
so much trouble for this!

732
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,852
Radio Rebel doesn't tell me when to dance!

733
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:00,490
Time to take your own advice!

734
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,282
<i>This is a place of learning,</i>

735
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:28,118
<i>anyone listening to
Radio Rebel during school</i>

736
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,520
<i>will be suspended.</i>

737
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:34,258
<i>And, Radio Rebel, I advise
you to turn yourself in now,</i>

738
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,027
<i>or your future will be radio silence.</i>

739
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,563
Nice!

740
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,231
Hey, Tara.

741
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,568
Can I talk to you?

742
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,970
Uh...

743
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,307
Hmm!

744
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,942
Yeah...

745
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,477
It's about our song.

746
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,412
We have a... we have a song?

747
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,948
The one Radio Rebel played last night.

748
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,949
Oh.

749
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:03,220
I couldn't believe that
she likes our music.

750
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:05,022
Then I wondered...

751
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,690
How'd she get our demo?

752
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,960
Got anything you wanna confess?

753
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,130
It's you, isn't it?

754
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:14,431
It's me? It's me?

755
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,465
You're the one.

756
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,334
Which one, of the one of...

757
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,702
You're the one

758
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,505
who gave the cd to your stepdad,

759
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,140
to give to Radio Rebel!

760
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,608
Yes!

761
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,276
Thank you!

762
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,545
Yes, yes. That's the one. I'm the one.

763
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,247
I'm the one with the...

764
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:33,050
I like it, it's a great song.

765
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,151
Thanks!

766
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,319
But...

767
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,287
It doesn't really feel like my voice.

768
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,223
It's like... people are hearing me,

769
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,025
<i>but they're not hearing me.</i>

770
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,096
That sounded crazy, didn't it?

771
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,298
No, no. Not at all.

772
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,467
I totally get you.

773
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,270
Uh...

774
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,338
Well...

775
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,073
Thanks again.

776
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,140
Oh...

777
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,009
Radio Rebel is amazing.

778
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,645
She's really...

779
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,281
She gets caught in my head, you know?

780
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,049
It's like...

781
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,618
I'd be able to recognize her on the street,

782
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,488
just from how well I
know her from her show.

783
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,157
That'd be, um, something.

784
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,392
Yeah.

785
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,430
See you later, Tara.

786
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,134
Bye, Gavin.

787
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:42,052
<i>You're listening to Slam-FM!</i>

788
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:46,256
That's her! I know it, I can tell!

789
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,425
Radio Rebel is an old guy?

790
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:49,493
With a beard?

791
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,595
Ever hear of disguise, Barry?

792
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:59,069
<i>Seattle's hottest DJ...</i>

793
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,704
<i>the Radio Rebel show!</i>

794
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,042
Did you see the posters?

795
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,781
Did you see the posters?

796
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,050
Hard to miss. They're everywhere!

797
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,218
My mom just called me and
said she saw me on the bus.

798
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,520
I was like, "no, I'm at slam."

799
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,555
She was like, "no, no,
no, you're on the bus!

800
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,057
Of the side of it!"

801
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,059
They're spending money
on marketing for you,

802
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,428
which means the ratings must be up.

803
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,463
You're famous.

804
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:27,597
No. I'm not.

805
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,299
No, Radio Rebel is.

806
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,468
Even Gavin has a thing for her.

807
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,636
That's good.

808
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:34,271
We like Gavin. Right?

809
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:35,539
Yes, we do.

810
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,706
And it was hard enough

811
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,275
when I just had Stacy to deal with,

812
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,577
now I'm competing with
myself for his attention...

813
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,579
And I appear to be losing.

814
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:47,117
Baby, you've got fan clubs
at every school in Seattle.

815
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,585
I mean, look at all the petitions!

816
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,489
"We want a dance break every day."

817
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:55,192
"We want more Radio Rebel."

818
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,860
"Don't take our music away."

819
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:01,465
Wait... I have a really good idea.

820
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,301
Okay. This is what we're gonna do.

821
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,747
What is going on?

822
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,217
Well, Moreno can't complain about us

823
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,318
disrupting class time,

824
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,253
because it's lunch.

825
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,888
This was your idea?

826
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,858
Ooh! It's brill!

827
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,500
Hello, Lincoln bay!

828
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,503
This is cami q coming at you live!

829
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,138
Y'all feelin' good today?

830
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,644
Listen up, I've got a special message

831
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,915
from our good friend... Radio Rebel!

832
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:55,352
<i>This is Radio Rebel</i>

833
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:58,355
<i>coming at you with a
little lunchtime surprise.</i>

834
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,656
That girl invaded our airwaves,

835
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,393
<i>now, a lot of you guys
have im'ed and texted me</i>

836
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,263
<i>about the powers-that-be
taking away our music,</i>

837
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:09,199
<i>part of ourselves is being taken away.</i>

838
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,902
<i>That's not gonna make us better students,</i>

839
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,937
<i>and you can't punish someone</i>

840
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,505
<i>for relaxing during their down time.</i>

841
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,940
<i>Right, principal Moreno?</i>

842
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,543
<i>You stole our music,
and I'm giving it back.</i>

843
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,878
<i>Text in requests! Lunchtime is our time.</i>

844
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,626
You're on school property!

845
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,963
Actually, beyond this
point is city property.

846
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,966
Did you want to see my permit?

847
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,311
Move!

848
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:56,580
Move! Move!

849
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:59,416
This "radio hor-Rebel" has got to go.

850
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,251
It's kind of a fun dance!

851
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,352
No, it's not.

852
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,553
Stop that.

853
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,223
Go vote for me for prom queen again.

854
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:07,324
Go!

855
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,828
Oh!

856
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:29,746
Can I have your attention, please?

857
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,882
I want you all to know

858
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:36,486
that this lunchtime fiasco was a...

859
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:39,556
Fiasco!

860
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,658
It is time for a certain DJ's

861
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,995
reign of Rebellion to come to an end.

862
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,999
Anyone with any information

863
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,701
regarding the identity of this Radio Rebel

864
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,671
is to report it to me immediately,

865
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:58,575
or risk facing disciplinary
actions themselves.

866
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:01,578
Now, get to class.

867
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:06,349
I just want to say that I
could not agree with you more.

868
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:09,052
I, for one, thought that
display at lunch was disgusting.

869
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,788
"Radio dribble" should pay
for pulling a stunt like that.

870
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,923
Oh, don't worry, Stacy.

871
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,059
Disruptions like today are temporary,

872
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,595
but I can enforce disciplinary measures

873
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,664
that can last forever!

874
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,399
Like diamonds?

875
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,533
And rice cakes?

876
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,435
No words.

877
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,470
You mean...

878
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,072
You can expel Radio Rebel?

879
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:32,942
Well, her actions were in
direct defiance of my policies,

880
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,478
so there will be consequences.

881
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,950
All I can think about now is rice cakes.

882
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,115
Sorry, guys, I was thinking.

883
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,785
What are you doing?
- Sorry.

884
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,354
I think we can do better than this.

885
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,622
You know, actually say
something with our music,

886
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,025
something meaningful, relatable. I was...

887
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:26,396
um, one, you don't stop in
the middle of a song, man.

888
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:29,632
Okay? And, two, our fans
don't want a message,

889
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,000
they want to party.

890
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,869
You want meaningful, go write a poem.

891
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,604
Stick with what's working, alright?

892
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:35,872
The top.

893
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,408
Since when do our fans
determine what we play?

894
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,144
It's the price of fame, my friend.

895
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,679
One! Two! Three...

896
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,482
Now that we've got a following,

897
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,951
I think we can finally
afford to take some risks,

898
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:50,086
and express ourselves creatively...

899
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,756
we're giving 'em what they want, alright?

900
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,824
No more, no less.

901
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,828
Okay?

902
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,164
Okay.

903
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,832
Gees for life?

904
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:06,035
Sure. Gees for life.

905
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,604
Attaboy.

906
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,105
All right! From the top, boys.

907
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:15,145
<i>If you don't go to Lincoln bay high,</i>

908
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,913
<i>you missed out on a rock-star day.</i>

909
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,882
<i>I've never seen so many people dancing.</i>

910
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,984
<i>So my listeners at hoover
high were so inspired</i>

911
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,119
<i>by what went down at Lincoln bay,</i>

912
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,755
<i>they had a full-on
flash-mob at lunch today.</i>

913
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,192
<i>You guys totally need to post
a video on my web page stat.</i>

914
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,795
<i>Yeah, I heard the mathletes
and the water-polo team</i>

915
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:35,031
<i>just formed a pops/non-pops alliance club.</i>

916
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,534
<i>You guys are my heroes!</i>

917
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:43,536
<i>He said this show inspired
him to stand up to his boss</i>

918
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,542
<i>and get the raise he deserved.</i>

919
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:46,943
See what I mean?

920
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,546
It's never too late to
make a difference, guys.

921
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,824
Tara!

922
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:02,058
I have news!

923
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,494
But we can't talk here.

924
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,865
Excuse me? Could you give us a minute?

925
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,034
But this is my office.

926
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:22,545
Guess who got nominated for prom queen?

927
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:23,813
Stacy?

928
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,114
You did!

929
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,784
Well, not you. Radio Rebel!

930
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,686
This is horrible.

931
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,820
The whole point of Radio Rebel

932
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,255
is that she's anonymous, remember?

933
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,890
What's gonna happen if she wins?

934
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,258
Who's gonna go up there
and accept the crown?

935
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,060
I could get expelled.

936
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,995
I have to put a stop to this.

937
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:39,996
Are you crazy?

938
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,264
You can't quit now.

939
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:43,700
Not now, Mr. margowsky!

940
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,236
But I need the broom.

941
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,140
Audrey...

942
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,510
I can't do this anymore.

943
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:54,611
You can.
- I can't.

944
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:55,712
<i>You can.
- I can't.</i>

945
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:56,613
You can!

946
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,147
Not now!

947
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,817
I need the dust pan, too.

948
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,719
Here.

949
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,923
You're a hero to people,

950
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:09,158
and that's why they nominated you.

951
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,761
You can't turn your back on them now.

952
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,731
This is your time to shine.

953
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:15,933
What if I don't want to shine?

954
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:19,736
What if shining really isn't my thing?

955
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:22,539
As your b. F.F.T.L.E.W.E.,

956
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:26,576
I'm legally obligated to
make sure you do the show.

957
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,312
Even if I have to drag you there.

958
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:34,951
Hey, Tara!

959
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,052
We've got another demo on the way

960
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,186
for Radio Rebel.

961
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,188
Oh, I'm sure she's stoked to hear it.

962
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,725
Yo, Gavin. We love you, man.

963
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,862
Clever. Make friends with the girl

964
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:46,930
whose dad runs slam.

965
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,598
I like the way you think, bro.

966
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,666
Her name's Tara.

967
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:50,867
Who cares?

968
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:51,935
She's actually really nice.

969
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,603
Whoa, wait.

970
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:56,072
You're not, like, into
her, or anything, are you?

971
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,874
'Cause that would not be good for business.

972
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,809
What do you mean?

973
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,945
We have fans now.

974
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:02,979
Dedicated followers.

975
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,147
Those are the kind of people

976
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:05,782
that you should be spending time with.

977
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:06,816
You don't even know her.

978
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:07,951
Okay.

979
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,686
I don't need to, and neither do you.

980
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,821
Think of the band, man!

981
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,356
Think like a rock star!

982
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,196
Why did we have to park so far away?

983
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,198
Because we can't risk

984
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,367
anyone recognizing your car, or us.

985
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,736
Now wig me.

986
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,251
Oh...

987
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,988
This cardboard is inflaming my eczema.

988
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,255
Do you have any aloe vera?

989
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:48,658
Will you concentrate?

990
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,862
Why do you always get the cool stuff?

991
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,864
Shh-shh. Focus!

992
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:10,013
This location is compromised.

993
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,348
Let's move.

994
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,854
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

995
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,288
Buh-buh-buh-buh!

996
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,890
Binoculars!

997
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:22,959
Focus, Larry! Come on!

998
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:25,061
Droppin' stuff...

999
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:26,062
Got 'em!

1000
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:27,897
Okay. Go!

1001
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,166
Get 'em. Blend in. Blend in.

1002
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,902
So, this... is where the magic happens.

1003
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,072
This is so cool!

1004
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:39,809
Is this the famous Audrey Sharma?

1005
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,945
Nice to meet you!

1006
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,383
Could you girls excuse us for a moment?

1007
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,359
Look, if this about Audrey being here,

1008
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,927
she's the only person I told,

1009
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,462
and I totally trust her.

1010
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:01,898
No, this is not about
Audrey. This is about you.

1011
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,200
Principal Moreno called.

1012
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,903
The lunchtime dance
party, that was a mistake.

1013
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:10,239
She wants to expel Radio Rebel

1014
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,208
as soon as she finds out who she is.

1015
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,278
Well, as long as she doesn't know it's me,

1016
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,113
you shouldn't have a problem.

1017
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:19,182
I can't take that chance, though, can I?

1018
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,717
What do you mean?

1019
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,721
I may run Slam-FM, but
I'm your stepfather first.

1020
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:28,725
It's unfortunate, but
this has gone too far.

1021
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:30,893
Yes, it has.

1022
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,095
Too far to stop now.

1023
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:33,863
Look, this is bigger

1024
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:35,131
than slam, or Moreno, or even me.

1025
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:38,434
I can't turn my back on
the thousands of people

1026
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,837
who finally feel like they have a voice.

1027
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,139
And I'm not going back
to the shy, invisible girl

1028
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:45,975
who's afraid to even speak.

1029
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:48,177
Look, I know that it's risky,

1030
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:52,315
but I'm not going to back down.

1031
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,884
You know, I think that's the most

1032
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:57,920
that I've ever heard Tara say at one time.

1033
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,992
You're on in two minutes.

1034
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,865
Good luck, kid.

1035
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,071
A lot of you want to know who I am.

1036
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:18,474
Come on, come on to mama.

1037
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:22,378
Maybe it'd be easier if
you could see my face.

1038
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,080
But that's the thing...

1039
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,916
<i>'Cause it's not about me.</i>

1040
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,551
<i>It's about you!</i>

1041
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,286
<i>You don't need to know my name.</i>

1042
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,289
<i>You wanna know who I am?</i>

1043
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,325
I'm somebody who's tired of being afraid.

1044
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:39,796
I know how it can hold you back,

1045
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,431
so, say it out loud.

1046
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:45,201
Just say what you're afraid of.

1047
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:47,904
Call in.

1048
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:50,139
I... dare you.

1049
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:57,180
I guess everyone's too afraid
to say what they're afraid of.

1050
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:58,181
Maybe this song'll inspire you.

1051
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:02,051
Lines 1 through 20!

1052
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:07,924
You're on with Radio Rebel.

1053
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:09,192
One time,

1054
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,893
I accidentally swallowed
a tiny piece of tinfoil,

1055
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,529
so now I'm afraid if I stand
too close to the microwave,

1056
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:17,600
I'm afraid of getting cut
from the football team.

1057
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:20,536
I'm afraid Larry might be losing it!

1058
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:26,309
I'm afraid I'll always be a single integer.

1059
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:28,477
I'm afraid of power outages.

1060
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:32,014
I'm afraid to do my own thing.

1061
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,586
I was, too.

1062
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,955
Was?

1063
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,957
So, what changed?

1064
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,426
I guess I...

1065
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:45,361
Started doing this show,

1066
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,596
and I realized...

1067
00:47:46,598 --> 00:47:50,366
<i>You're not as alone as you feel.</i>

1068
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,535
If you can remember that,

1069
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,370
it might be a easier to take a risk.

1070
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,173
<i>Do your own thing.</i>

1071
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:58,975
Yeah.

1072
00:47:58,977 --> 00:48:00,543
Thanks.

1073
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,114
We'll take more calls in a minute.

1074
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:06,482
In the meantime,

1075
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:09,252
you guys are gonna
seriously dig this next song.

1076
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,994
Hey! Where are you going?

1077
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:20,396
Just... somewhere...

1078
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,366
To do... something.

1079
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,403
I'm afraid of hyenas!

1080
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,382
I'm afraid to show people the real me!

1081
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,989
Congratulations!

1082
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:48,224
What?

1083
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:49,558
Your prom queen nomination!

1084
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,993
It's on the school website.

1085
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:52,295
I am so excited.

1086
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,663
But what about principal Moreno?

1087
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:57,533
Mom, if Radio Rebel wins,
and I confess my identity,

1088
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:58,701
I could get expelled.

1089
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:02,071
I don't care about principal Moreno.

1090
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:04,173
Honey, people nominated you

1091
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:05,274
for prom queen

1092
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,276
because you inspire them.

1093
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,246
You're standing up for your beliefs,

1094
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,114
and that's all I care about.

1095
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,251
I don't think I'm going to prom.

1096
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,619
Let me rephrase that...

1097
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:20,156
all I care about is you
standing up for your beliefs

1098
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,457
<i>and prom!</i>

1099
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,093
You have to go! It's prom!

1100
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,194
Y...

1101
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:26,228
nuh! No!

1102
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,596
Let me fin...
- You have to!

1103
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:30,433
<i>Uh! Yeah. Okay? You're going to prom.</i>

1104
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:33,569
You're going
to be excellent! Ooh!

1105
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,273
<i>This is your principal.</i>

1106
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:38,741
<i>There's been some controversy</i>

1107
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:41,377
<i>about the identity of Radio Rebel,</i>

1108
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,479
<i>and there is nothing more distracting</i>

1109
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,047
<i>than controversy.</i>

1110
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:48,551
Now, I gave her the chance
to do the right thing

1111
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,519
and turn herself in, but...

1112
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:52,488
<i>She chose to hide,</i>

1113
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,425
<i>avoiding the consequences
of her insubordination.</i>

1114
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,361
<i>Well, she can't hide forever,</i>

1115
00:49:58,363 --> 00:49:59,528
<i>which is why,</i>

1116
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,397
<i>until Radio Rebel's identity</i>

1117
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:03,165
is revealed,

1118
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,301
I'm canceling the prom.

1119
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,208
<i>For everyone!</i>

1120
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,244
She can't do this!

1121
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,679
She can do whatever she wants.

1122
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,314
She's, like, the principal.

1123
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:19,448
Now do you think

1124
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,250
there's favoritism at Lincoln bay?

1125
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:25,321
Not Moreno... "Radio feeble!"

1126
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:26,589
She's destroying everything!

1127
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,524
Why should we have our prom taken away

1128
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,159
just so she can make a point?

1129
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,327
This is bad.

1130
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,796
This is really, really bad.

1131
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:38,267
Save our prom! Save our prom!

1132
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,169
Save our prom!

1133
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,439
Save our prom! Save
our prom! Save our prom!

1134
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:45,708
Prom is a rite of passage.

1135
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,411
If Radio Rebel is really
all about the people,

1136
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:52,381
then she'll reveal her identity
and give us our prom back!

1137
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:56,685
How are we gonna get in there?

1138
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:12,501
Who do you blame for your
prom getting canceled?

1139
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,306
Oh! Look, everybody! It's Radio Rebel.

1140
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,380
Go, go, go!
Go-go-go-go!

1141
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:27,450
Show us who you are, Radio Rebel!

1142
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,318
Who is it? I can't see!

1143
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:35,191
Are we live?

1144
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,227
Hi, out there in radio land.

1145
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:41,764
A lot's happened since
we last hung out, huh?

1146
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,432
Let me know what you guys think.

1147
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,335
Call me, text me, scrawl on my wall.

1148
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,871
Don't be shy.

1149
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:52,241
Do you know how many dreams you've crushed

1150
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,409
by canceling prom?

1151
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:54,610
I agree with the last caller.

1152
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,245
I'd just gotten a date, and now it's over?

1153
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,215
This is the last time I'm
listening to you. Ever!

1154
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:01,350
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1155
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:03,519
You disappointed everyone!

1156
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,221
Do you even care about anyone but yourself?

1157
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:07,323
Do you know how many dreams you've crushed?

1158
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:11,227
<i>Dream crusher! Dream crusher!</i>

<i>Do you know how many dreams you've crushed?</i>

1160
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:14,763
<i>You're a dream crusher!</i>

1161
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:16,232
<i>You ruined everything!</i>

1162
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:19,735
Okay...

1163
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:23,339
You guys are being
honest about how you feel.

1164
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:26,876
You're on, line two.

1165
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:28,878
I've always liked you, Radio Rebel.

1166
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,379
<i>Your playlists truly rock, but...</i>

1167
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:33,916
Go ahead. Let it out.

1168
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:35,918
<i>It's just...</i>

1169
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,753
There's a girl

1170
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,855
I was hoping to impress that night.

1171
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,261
Sorry about that.

1172
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,930
Yeah. Me too.

1173
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,802
Wow.

1174
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:57,206
Guess you guys are... pretty upset.

1175
00:52:57,208 --> 00:53:02,478
Well, uh, I'll just play some music.

1176
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,880
This next song's for you, guys.

1177
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:07,516
Thanks for being honest with me.

1178
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,952
I'm sorry I let you down.

1179
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,461
They're just angry.

1180
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:20,963
They'll, uh, they'll come around.

1181
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,866
It doesn't take away

1182
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,701
from all the good things
you've done as Radio Rebel.

1183
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,436
Did you hear them?

1184
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:28,537
They hate me.

1185
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,907
I ruined their prom.

1186
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,710
I feel horrible.

1187
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:37,746
You didn't ruin it, that principal did.

1188
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,348
I knew she was angry,

1189
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,750
but I didn't know she was
gonna do something like this.

1190
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:44,987
Man, that Moreno's such
a backwards-thinker.

1191
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:48,657
"Backwards..."

1192
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,459
That's brilliant!

1193
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:51,594
What?

1194
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:52,561
Backwards!

1195
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,864
<i>"Backwards. "</i>

1196
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:01,904
I thought everyone would be gone by now.

1197
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,611
This calls for a professional.

1198
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:11,914
Somebody order the "meaty subtacular?"

1199
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,550
Hello?

1200
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:17,620
Hi.

1201
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:18,621
Could you do us a favor?

1202
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,622
Sure.

1203
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:22,491
You want extra marinara?

1204
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:23,659
Aw! That would be awesome!

1205
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:24,960
Audrey.

1206
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,629
And... focusing. I am the hyena!

1207
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,665
You see those girls out there?

1208
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,433
We need to get out of here

1209
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,901
without any of them seeing us.

1210
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:35,671
You can count on me.

1211
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,006
I'm just sad

1212
00:54:37,008 --> 00:54:38,941
the world'll be deprived
of me in my prom dress.

1213
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,343
It's a strapless number,
it's oh-so-chic, it's...

1214
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:43,279
A Turkey on rye?

1215
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,914
Hello, Seattle!

1216
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,650
Care to comment on Radio Rebel?

1217
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:48,851
Yes, I would!

1218
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,920
You're listening to DJ dancing-sandwich!

1219
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,822
That turntable's spinning
in a funky groove.

1220
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,658
That sandwich can dance!

1221
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,394
Dance, dancing-sandwich!

1222
00:54:58,396 --> 00:54:59,762
Whoo-ooh-Whoo!

1223
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,835
When I hear her, I've got to move!

1224
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,070
I got the groove!

1225
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,076
Would you get back down?

1226
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:15,744
You're blowing our cover, Larry!

1227
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:16,945
I can't do it, man.

1228
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:18,781
I think I felt a human hand.

1229
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,915
That was my hand, Larry!

1230
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,083
[Whines in

Got you!

1251
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,480
It's just ridiculous. "Morp?"

1252
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:25,681
Who ever heard of a morp?

1253
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:27,082
That's the whole point, I think.

1254
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,485
To do something totally different.

1255
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,686
It could be great.

1256
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:31,887
You know, Gavin,

1257
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,522
I thought you would've been more upset

1258
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:34,690
about prom being canceled,

1259
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:36,392
considering we were going together.

1260
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,060
Well, yeah, but...

1261
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,796
We can still go to morp, right?

1262
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,164
It's not the same!

1263
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,633
I mean, no limos, no
dresses? What is the point?

1264
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,135
To come as you are.

1265
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:48,637
What about prom king and queen?

1266
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,706
People were nominated,
somebody has to be crowned!

1267
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,541
It's, like, law!

1268
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,610
Why don't you call Radio
Rebel and tell her that?

1269
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:57,780
I'm sure she'd love to hear
from her number-one fan.

1270
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:01,917
We need to rehearse.

1271
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,652
I'm not going to fail this assignment

1272
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,521
because you two have zero work ethic.

1273
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:11,894
I think we're in trouble.

1274
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:16,198
So, I've been
getting a billion questions

1275
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,800
about the morp, which rules,

1276
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,134
'cause you all seem stoked to go...

1277
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,470
Which is the whole point, right?

1278
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:23,939
A party where everyone feels like royalty?

1279
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,008
But, then again...

1280
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,811
Maybe we should crown
a morp king and queen?

1281
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,680
I mean, after all, people were nominated.

1282
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,549
Look, if that's what you guys want,

1283
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:34,650
that's what we'll do.

1284
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,585
Morp is all yours.

1285
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:39,655
<i>For your favorite morp king and queen.</i>

1286
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,657
<i>Make your voices heard...</i>

1287
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:44,560
<i>Especially my number-one fan.</i>

1288
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,701
Hi. Is Tara home?

1289
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:55,137
Uh, sorry, sweetie, she's not here.

1290
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,071
Hmm.

1291
00:57:56,073 --> 00:57:58,707
I'm in her English class,

1292
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:00,609
we're supposed to study tonight.

1293
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,478
Do you know where she is?

1294
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,679
Afraid not.

1295
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,180
I'm just here

1296
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:07,583
trying this new experimental
cuticle-rejuvenation technique.

1297
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:08,517
Do you wanna try?

1298
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,852
No. Thanks.

1299
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:12,020
Uh, do you know when Tara might be back?

1300
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:13,989
Sorry, sweetie. I don't.

1301
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,491
I'll tell her you stopped by.

1302
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,693
Tah-tah.

1303
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,233
I am so parched!

1304
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:26,535
What I wouldn't give
for a smoothie right now.

1305
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:27,636
How about you, Gavin?

1306
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:28,670
Are you ready for a break?

1307
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:29,738
Sure.

1308
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,139
Tara, do you want anything?

1309
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,275
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

1310
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,883
So... Tara.

1311
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:43,285
I'm having a party at my place tonight...

1312
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,754
And, in the spirit of Radio Rebel,

1313
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:47,823
I'm inviting everyone...

1314
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:50,926
Even civilians like yourself.

1315
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:53,028
Uh, gee...

1316
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,230
Thanks, but I have plans.

1317
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:56,064
Really?

1318
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:59,034
Same plans as last night?

1319
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,802
I went by your house.

1320
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:02,838
I could've sworn you said Wednesday

1321
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,040
was your "mandatory family dinner night",

1322
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,776
but your mom had no idea where you were.

1323
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:09,645
Strange, huh?

1324
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:12,948
I- I was, uh... library.

1325
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,616
You were, "uh... library?"

1326
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:15,784
Sure you were.

1327
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:17,252
There's no way that you were, say,

1328
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,988
DJing a radio show at that time?

1329
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,591
No. Why would you think that?

1330
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:25,127
Radio Rebel mentioned her
"number-one fan" last night.

1331
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,795
That's what you called me yesterday.

1332
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,330
Must be a coincid...

1333
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:29,698
Save it!

1334
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,334
I'm watching you, Tara.

1335
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,938
If you think that I'm Radio Rebel,

1336
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,839
why don't you just tell principal Moreno?

1337
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,675
She already thinks you're perfect.

1338
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:41,243
Because I need proof...

1339
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,011
And, tonight, I will get it.

1340
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:45,614
If you don't show up at my party tonight,

1341
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:46,815
we'll both know why.

1342
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,350
Why do you even care?

1343
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:49,351
I'll tell you why.

1344
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:53,088
People are going to elect her "morp queen"

1345
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,090
because they want to find out who she is.

1346
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,625
But if they already know,

1347
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:59,828
they'll vote for the girl
who truly deserves it...

1348
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,029
Me!

1349
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:03,231
This little DJ act is coming to an end.

1350
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,600
Soon.

1351
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:07,803
You are my hero!

1352
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:08,937
What do you think, Gavin?

1353
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,973
Should we take it from the top?

1354
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,975
Yeah.

1355
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,843
The thing about your character...

1356
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,952
Hoo! A party during
Radio Rebel's broadcast?

1357
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,220
This is brilliant.

1358
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,255
Tonight, the mystery ends.

1359
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:29,625
Whoever doesn't show up...

1360
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,892
Hey.

1361
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:33,228
Hey. Where were you just now?

1362
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,231
You're sure you weren't
setting up a broadcast station

1363
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,166
from a remote satellite?

1364
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:41,269
You're accusing me of being Radio Rebel?

1365
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,706
I've been helping you
search for her all this time,

1366
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,074
I'm a guy!

1367
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,243
Ho, ho! A perfect cover, Larry.

1368
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:50,412
If that is your real name.

1369
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:55,884
Who are you?

1370
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:56,985
I don't know you.

1371
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,320
Oh. We're biology partners.

1372
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,856
I've gone to school with
you since the first grade.

1373
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:02,190
I didn't ask for your life story,

1374
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,159
but thanks for coming. Have fun.

1375
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,796
One minute till 7:00!

1376
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:09,765
Hmm! And who isn't here?

1377
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:10,899
Exactly!

1378
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:12,300
Hi!

1379
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:15,871
Here I am.

1380
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:17,305
Hmph. So I see.

1381
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:19,408
But I'm still watching you!

1382
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,778
Go downstairs and watch her.

1383
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,116
Faster!

1384
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,085
<i>Coming to
you, only on Slam-FM,</i>

1385
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:32,154
<i>Seattle's hottest DJ...</i>

1386
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:34,990
<i>It's Radio Rebel!</i>

1387
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,460
<i>This is Radio Rebel,</i>

1388
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:40,896
coming at you live from Slam-FM.

1389
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,064
Tonight is all about you.

1390
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:44,032
Lines are open. You know the number.

1391
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,801
I'm calling in to the show!

1392
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:47,002
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

1393
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:49,438
How are you here and there?

1394
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,940
<i>You're on with Radio Rebel!</i>

1395
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,442
Do you know you're a hypocrite?

1396
01:01:53,444 --> 01:01:54,810
<i>Hi. What's your name, caller?</i>

1397
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:55,977
Save it!

1398
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:57,345
You say you're all about the people,

1399
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:58,814
but morp is all about you.

1400
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:01,149
Now you get to lobby for "morp queen" votes

1401
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:02,751
on the radio every night. Not fair!

1402
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:05,387
The other morp queen nominees
should get equal airtime.

1403
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,288
Meaning me.

1404
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,191
Play... play track 15.

1405
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:11,159
<i>I totally hear you.</i>

1406
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:12,160
You "hear me?"

1407
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:13,395
I don't think you do.

1408
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:16,131
<i>Say what you wanna say.</i>

1409
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,834
I think you're using
subliminal brainwashing

1410
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:20,235
to get people to vote for you.

1411
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,437
So I'm gonna take this
opportunity to ask the school

1412
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:24,940
to vote for me, Stacy, for morp queen.

1413
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,742
Play 40 next.

1414
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,111
<i>Hi! What's your name, caller?</i>

1415
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,879
You already asked me that.

1416
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:31,947
I said play 40!

1417
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,949
You said 14.

1418
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:37,986
Play 33.

1419
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,287
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

1420
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:40,422
I'm not done with you!

1421
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:42,891
Sorry, we can't all be winners,

1422
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:43,992
and I'm gonna win,

1423
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:45,360
despite the fact that I don't

1424
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:47,295
have an entire radio
station campaigning for me,

1425
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:49,197
which really makes me the underdog.

1426
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,136
Pick up, pick up...

1427
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:55,337
It's Tara!

1428
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:56,872
Patch me into the show!

1429
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:01,143
Why so quiet?

1430
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:02,410
Does the truth hurt?

1431
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,945
Do you want to know the truth?

1432
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:06,782
<i>Stop hogging the bathroom!</i>

1433
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:08,016
What was that?

1434
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:08,884
Um...

1435
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,820
I knocked over my chair.

1436
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,890
'Cause I wanted to get close to the mic

1437
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,424
so you could hear me clearly.

1438
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,993
Oh, I can hear you clearly!

1439
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:22,430
I can hear you very clearly.

1440
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:26,168
I can heard you so clearly, Radio Rebel,

1441
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,402
that we could be in the same building!

1442
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:29,437
Same building? What, are you crazy?

1443
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:32,007
Are you here at slam, Stacy?

1444
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,308
I don't see you.

1445
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,577
Or maybe you're hiding somewhere?

1446
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:41,249
I'm just a little be
worried about you, Stacy.

1447
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,185
I'm afraid that if I beat
you out for morp queen,

1448
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:46,121
your fragile ego won't be able to survive.

1449
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:50,559
Can you hand me my jacket?

1450
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:51,593
What was that?

1451
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:53,295
I'm sorry. What?

1452
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:54,229
Who was that?

1453
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:55,897
That was my sound guy.

1454
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:59,234
We just got a brand-new demo
in today called "my jacket."

1455
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:00,335
We could play it for you.

1456
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,003
I have a better idea.

1457
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,072
Why don't you come forward
and stop hiding like a coward?

1458
01:04:05,976 --> 01:04:07,375
Would a coward be afraid

1459
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,244
to go up against you for morp queen?

1460
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:10,412
'Cause I'm not.

1461
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:12,347
I'll see you there, and you'll see

1462
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,982
that I'm not afraid of anything.

1463
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:15,884
Thanks for calling!

1464
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,625
What are you doing in my bedroom?

1465
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:26,161
I was trying to find the bathroom.

1466
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:27,362
Your house is...

1467
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,197
what are you really doing in here?

1468
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,400
Looking at your photos.

1469
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:35,971
I remember you used to dress like that

1470
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:37,939
every day in second grade.

1471
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:42,210
I also remember being really jealous.

1472
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:44,913
Of what? Everyone making fun of me?

1473
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:48,516
No, how confident you were being yourself.

1474
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,886
I didn't know people made fun of you.

1475
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,256
It doesn't feel so good, does it?

1476
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:56,157
I don't need a lesson in manners from you.

1477
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:57,559
Now, get out of my room!

1478
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:18,113
That was amazing.

1479
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:20,649
She was freaked out!

1480
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,386
And Gavin just smiled at you.

1481
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:28,156
I think it was more of a general smile.

1482
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:30,692
It seemed pretty specific to me.

1483
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,227
Hey!

1484
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,229
We cannot wait for this!

1485
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:37,399
We're the Gees, and this is "we so fly!"

1486
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:59,321
I can't believe

1487
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:01,456
there's so many non-pops in my backyard.

1488
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,724
It feels like they're multiplying.

1489
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:05,593
Like cockroaches... and hangers.

1490
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,540
Are you kidding me?

1491
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:20,375
I didn't do anything.

1492
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:21,977
You bumped into me.

1493
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,346
You come to my house and
you spill your drink on me?

1494
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:25,747
This cost a fortune!

1495
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,483
It was an accident, Stacy.

1496
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,353
Audrey would never do
something like that on purpose,

1497
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:32,620
unlike some people.

1498
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:34,389
Do you know what your problem is?

1499
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,623
You know what?

1500
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,425
I don't care what you think my problem is.

1501
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,761
Keep it to yourself.

1502
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,733
I need a new outfit!

1503
01:06:44,735 --> 01:06:46,134
Kim! Let's go!

1504
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:48,036
We're going!

1505
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:50,171
Thanks for that.

1506
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,143
I love how Radio Rebel is
rubbing off on you, too.

1507
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:26,641
She's playing us. I know it.

1508
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:29,044
Now you just need to prove it.

1509
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:36,084
Okay... you can do it.

1510
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:38,086
Just go over there.

1511
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:39,220
Hey.

1512
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,824
You guys put on a great show.

1513
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,225
Thanks.

1514
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,460
But it's all Gabe.

1515
01:07:45,462 --> 01:07:46,828
He's a good frontman.

1516
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,797
It's not all Gabe.

1517
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,698
Trust me.

1518
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,701
You know, ever since the band took off,

1519
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,805
people assume I'm this confident guy...

1520
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:59,207
But...

1521
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:01,209
I get nervous before gigs.

1522
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,844
Like, really nervous.

1523
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:04,112
Yeah?

1524
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,313
Yeah.

1525
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,250
We're not so different, I guess...

1526
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,685
Is what I'm trying to say.

1527
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:16,124
So... how do you do it?

1528
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:21,396
I try to remember I'm
not as alone as I feel.

1529
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:23,865
Radio Rebel taught me that.

1530
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,870
She's a clever one.

1531
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:31,306
Yeah. She is.

1532
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:32,507
Slacker!

1533
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:35,276
Come help load the van.

1534
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:39,114
You should...

1535
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:41,883
See you.

1536
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:42,884
Bye.

1537
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:54,429
Pizza delivery incoming!

1538
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:57,632
There's pizza for cami q!

1539
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,768
Where is studio four?

1540
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,172
Anybody here?

1541
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:06,474
Cami q?

1542
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,625
I'm sorry, I kind of lost
my cool in there a bit.

1543
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:25,793
Hey, don't worry. I mean, you'll get it.

1544
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:28,930
Hey, I'm gonna
make you a DJ in no time...

1545
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:31,733
"DJ mama Rebel."

1546
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:34,335
Oh, I like the sound of that!

1547
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:39,841
I was afraid we biffed the call.

1548
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,677
We nearly did a couple of times.

1549
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,313
You gotta hand it to her.

1550
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:46,614
I mean, Tara was right.

1551
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:49,584
You really can be in two places at once.

1552
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,719
I'm just so glad she asked me to help.

1553
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:54,489
I sometimes think that maybe

1554
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:56,491
she's a little embarrassed
by her crazy mom.

1555
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:57,492
Are you kidding?

1556
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:58,726
She adores you.

1557
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,629
I mean, she talks about you all the time.

1558
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:04,866
She does?

1559
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,935
Oh!

1560
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:09,370
Mascara overflow! Excuse me.

1561
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,240
Oof! Ack!

1562
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,711
Hi! Did you order

1563
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,780
the "super-duper
cheesey-pleasey vegetarian

1564
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,648
beef-o-rama,
hold the drama?"

1565
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:21,783
Great choice!

1566
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,885
I can't get enough of this sauce.

1567
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:24,886
Not you?

1568
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,321
Okay! Sorry!

1569
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,456
Bye.

1570
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,594
Stacy! Stacy, I got it! I got...

1571
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,864
I think we're ready.

1572
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:38,866
Please remember your goals.

1573
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,969
Get your "actor" energy up!

1574
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:43,371
Tara! Thank goodness, I found you.

1575
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:44,606
There have been some last-minute

1576
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:45,740
changes to the scene.

1577
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,375
Don't worry, you can handle it.

1578
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:48,509
But does Gavin know?

1579
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:49,777
Gavin is the least of your worries.

1580
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:51,346
Wait! This is the janitor's closet.

1581
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,749
What? Stacy!

1582
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,017
Stacy! Let me out!

1583
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:57,485
Enjoy your "f."

1584
01:10:57,487 --> 01:10:59,387
Romeo? Where are you?

1585
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:03,291
I mean, seriously, it's freezing out here.

1586
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:05,760
Why can't you just stop being a montague?

1587
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,495
The capulets are way cooler.

1588
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:08,830
Everybody says.

1589
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:11,733
My father isn't really a bad guy.

1590
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:14,002
He just watches too many movies.

1591
01:11:14,004 --> 01:11:16,938
Let me out!

1592
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,009
Romeo, this whole feuding
thing is really annoying...

1593
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:24,579
Dude, ready to rock out
with the drama dorks?

1594
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:25,747
That's funny.

1595
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:26,948
Have you guys seen Tara? She's late.

1596
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,651
Move on, already! Pay attention to Stacy.

1597
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,686
You're turning into a real jerk,

1598
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:32,987
you know that, don't you?

1599
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:34,656
Me?
- Yeah.

1600
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:35,823
You're the one

1601
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,525
who needs to get his priorities straight.

1602
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:38,593
Or what?

1603
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:39,927
You gonna kick me out of the band?

1604
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:42,297
Is that what you want?

1605
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:45,400
Is for you to drop the
stupid rock-star act

1606
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:46,701
for five minutes,

1607
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:49,070
and just try... try!..
To be a normal person.

1608
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:51,072
Okay. I am the frontman of this band.

1609
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:54,075
This "rock-star act" is
what put us on the map.

1610
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:56,444
If you don't wanna be a part of that,

1611
01:11:56,446 --> 01:11:58,780
then that's fine with us.

1612
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:01,049
What happened to "Gees for life"?

1613
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:03,818
Hmm. Yeah. Ask yourself that.

1614
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,954
Enjoy your solo career, Gavin.

1615
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,723
Thank you very much.

1616
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:10,692
Next up is Audrey.

1617
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,098
Just bre-ee-eathe your words.

1618
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,433
Okay. Go.

1619
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:19,901
Ahem-ahem.

1620
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:26,574
Alas... poor spork.

1621
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:28,009
I used him, Harry...

1622
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:31,479
For he was a wondrous
and versatile utensil.

1623
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:33,715
<i>A fork and a spoon.</i>

1624
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:34,749
Come on! Pick up the
phone. Pick up the phone.

1625
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:35,750
Pick up the phone.

1626
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:37,852
Oh! Spork!

1627
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,688
Stacy! Have you seen Tara?

1628
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,856
No.

1629
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,459
Seriously? Oh!

1630
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:46,561
I have no idea where she is.

1631
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,596
I can't believe she'd do this to us.

1632
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:49,997
So unpro.

1633
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:52,066
We have to tell Mrs. brower
we can't do our scene.

1634
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:54,736
Stacy Debane is not a quitter,

1635
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:56,037
and I'm not gonna fail this assignment

1636
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,906
just because Tara's a no-show.

1637
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,876
Ladies and gentlemen,

1638
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,611
I'd like to make an announcement.

1639
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:07,482
Stacy Debane will be performing
in place of Tara Adams,

1640
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:10,151
who, apparently, couldn't
be bothered to show up.

1641
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,955
Someone, let me out!

1642
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:17,091
Looks like it's just you and I.

1643
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,129
Thank you!

1644
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:22,563
Oh!

1645
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,837
See? Look at my pants. I'm a dude.

1646
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,178
What's she waiting for?

1647
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:41,849
I'm waiting for you to make a move.

1648
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:45,920
But, since you aren't going to,

1649
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,523
I'll make a move myself.

1650
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,900
Bravo! Bravo!

1651
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:04,005
Okay, everybody.

1652
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:06,073
Listen, thank you very much
for all of your hard work.

1653
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:09,777
I appreciate it very much, especially...

1654
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,013
Oh, no. Look.

1655
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,683
He is so disappointed in you.

1656
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:18,586
And who can blame him?

1657
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,558
Okay, "radio drivel."

1658
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,093
You were bad enough when you didn't talk.

1659
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:30,164
But trying to destroy me
on your stupid radio show?

1660
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,500
Did you really think
you'd get away with that?

1661
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:34,702
Look. You're wrong. I'm not her. If I...

1662
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:36,537
save it! You're not her?

1663
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,106
Then explain this...

1664
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:40,875
<i>I was afraid we biffed the call.</i>

1665
01:14:40,877 --> 01:14:44,645
<i>You really can be in two places at once.</i>

1666
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,581
That doesn't prove anything.

1667
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:47,849
No? Then you won't mind

1668
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:49,484
if I email it to the whole school...

1669
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:51,519
And Moreno?

1670
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:53,621
What do you want?

1671
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:54,789
Morp queen.

1672
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,757
You're gonna make sure I win...

1673
01:14:56,759 --> 01:14:58,626
Or Radio Rebel is.

1674
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:01,529
Tell everyone on your show to vote for me.

1675
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:04,198
And if you say anything about
this little private moment,

1676
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,801
I'll tell everyone who you really are.

1677
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,708
<i>Okay... I had a bad day.</i>

1678
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:16,677
Kind of shook me up.

1679
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,746
It made me wonder...

1680
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:21,949
Am I doing the right thing?

1681
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:25,586
I mean, is it... is it
worth it if I get expelled?

1682
01:15:25,588 --> 01:15:28,923
Or if it messes things
up with the guy I like?

1683
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:31,158
I don't know.

1684
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,896
<i>What I do know is that there
will be people out there</i>

1685
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:36,898
<i>who try and take things away from us,</i>

1686
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,733
<i>things bigger than prom...</i>

1687
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:43,804
<i>And we can just sit
back and watch it happen,</i>

1688
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:47,041
<i>or we can stand up for ourselves.</i>

1689
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:50,011
I mean, we all deserve to
dance to our own playlists,

1690
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:51,779
no matter what Moreno

1691
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,981
or anyone else has to say about it.

1692
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,183
Oh. One more thing.

1693
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:57,885
Um...

1694
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,320
<i>I know a lot of you guys</i>

1695
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:01,789
<i>want to vote me queen to find out who I am.</i>

1696
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,758
<i>I don't need that crown.</i>

1697
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,993
<i>But... Stacy Debane?</i>

1698
01:16:05,995 --> 01:16:07,995
<i>She kind of really does.</i>

1699
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:10,097
<i>Just keep that in mind when you vote.</i>

1700
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:23,210
There you are! I've been
dying to show you this bow-tie

1701
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:24,979
I found for you to wear to the morp.

1702
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,681
It perfectly matches my
dress. How cute is that?

1703
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:27,682
Stacy.

1704
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:28,716
What?

1705
01:16:28,718 --> 01:16:30,351
I know what you did to Tara.

1706
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:32,687
What are you talking about?

1707
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:33,921
The closet.

1708
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,624
Don't bother denying it. I have a witness.

1709
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,095
What did Tara ever do to you?

1710
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,964
You don't know her, Gavin.

1711
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:44,765
She's not who you think she is. She's...

1712
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:48,269
no, Stacy. You're not
who I thought you were.

1713
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,238
I can't go to morp with you. I'm sorry.

1714
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,174
But we're gonna be king and queen!

1715
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:54,909
I don't wanna be king.

1716
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,078
I never did.

1717
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,268
Where's Tara?

1718
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,638
Where's Radio Rebel?

1719
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,906
Oh! My true love shall be revealed.

1720
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:27,174
How do I look?

1721
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:28,643
Uh, a little green.

1722
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,645
Could be the lighting...
Or something worse.

1723
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:34,315
We're standing in a
microbial hotspot right now.

1724
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:36,117
Whoa.

1725
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:43,858
Hey.
- Hey.

1726
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,393
You look amazing.

1727
01:17:45,395 --> 01:17:46,761
Why, thank you!

1728
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:48,996
Have you seen Gavin?

1729
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,297
I- I really should talk to him.

1730
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,399
Wait! What are you gonna say?
- I don't know.

1731
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:52,833
You mean you haven't...?
- Not yet.

1732
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,001
You know you need to.
- I know!

1733
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,036
Are we missing something?

1734
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:56,837
<i>Conference. Now.</i>

1735
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,790
I don't know what to do.

1736
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:16,991
I'm freaking out.

1737
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:18,793
Just... breathe.

1738
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:28,703
Okay.

1739
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:30,304
Okay.

1740
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:32,406
Okay.

1741
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:39,480
You're beautiful.

1742
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:42,817
You're a queen, no matter what happens.

1743
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,502
Good evening, Seattle!

1744
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,971
You ready to find out
who your morp queen is?

1745
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:08,042
<i>It's time to see who's been crowned</i>

1746
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:09,510
<i>from Lincoln bay high.</i>

1747
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:11,946
<i>Yeah!</i>

1748
01:19:11,948 --> 01:19:14,048
<i>We had two nominations</i>

1749
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,149
for morp king,

1750
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:16,517
but one dropped out.

1751
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:22,223
<i>So that leaves...</i>

1752
01:19:22,225 --> 01:19:24,525
Gabe leviolet!

1753
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,404
<i>I'd like to invite</i>

1754
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:40,441
your morp court princesses
to join me onstage.

1755
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:41,275
Whoo!

1756
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,409
Don't be nervous.

1757
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:43,410
That's, like, the worst thing to say

1758
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:44,879
to a nervous person, Kim.

1759
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:46,046
I know. You're welcome.

1760
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,114
<i>Let's hear it</i>

1761
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,215
for Stacy Debane!

1762
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,095
And... Radio Rebel!

1763
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:20,214
<i>Radio Rebel?</i>

1764
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:22,550
Are you out there?

1765
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,325
Well, I guess we'll continue.

1766
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,861
<i>Your morp queen is...</i>

1767
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:43,838
Radio Rebel!

1768
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,886
We love you, Radio Rebel!

1769
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:02,423
Since she isn't here to accept her crown,

1770
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:04,024
maybe it should go to the person

1771
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,093
with the second-most votes?

1772
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:11,265
<i>Most of you don't know me.</i>

1773
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:14,368
<i>I'm the girl who sits in the back of class,</i>

1774
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,937
<i>who never raises her hand,</i>

1775
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:19,473
<i>who's so afraid of saying the wrong thing,</i>

1776
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:21,508
<i>she says nothing instead.</i>

1777
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,444
<i>The old me would've frozen</i>

1778
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:25,079
<i>in front of a crowd like this...</i>

1779
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:29,116
<i>...but something happened.</i>

1780
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:32,519
<i>Suddenly, the real stuff we
were dealing with at school</i>

1781
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:35,556
<i>became more important than my fears.</i>

1782
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:39,193
<i>Look, I wasn't sure I
was gonna do this tonight,</i>

1783
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:41,896
<i>but I need to be true to myself...</i>

1784
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:45,666
<i>So, here goes...</i>

1785
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:53,674
I'm Radio Rebel.

1786
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:22,603
Thank you for an enlightening evening.

1787
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:26,540
And now that I know who Radio Rebel is...

1788
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:32,179
...she is definitely getting expelled.

1789
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,984
Enjoy your morp, Tara!

1790
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:39,053
Oh! And don't bother
coming to school on Monday.

1791
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,959
I'm Radio Rebel!

1792
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,028
No! I'm Radio Rebel.

1793
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:52,466
No! I'm Radio Rebel. Whoo! I'm Radio Rebel!

1794
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,269
No, I'm Radio Rebel!

1795
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:56,403
I'm Radio Rebel!

1796
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:04,044
You can't expel everyone, can you?

1797
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:10,084
I'm Radio Rebel!

1798
01:23:10,086 --> 01:23:11,318
I'm Radio Rebel!

1799
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,754
I'm Radio Rebel! I'm Radio Rebel!

1800
01:23:13,756 --> 01:23:17,224
I'm Radio Rebel! I'm Radio Rebel!

1801
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:18,492
I'm Radio Rebel!

1802
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:22,329
I'm Radio Rebel! I'm Radio Rebel!

1803
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,497
I'm Radio Rebel!

1804
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:31,772
I believe this... belongs to you.

1805
01:23:34,377 --> 01:23:38,245
I mean, I guess since
we're all Radio Rebel,

1806
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:40,514
this crown belongs to all of us.

1807
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:43,317
So, congratulations, kings and queens.

1808
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,393
But there is one person
who has been dreaming

1809
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:55,229
about this crown for her entire life.

1810
01:23:55,231 --> 01:23:57,331
Although, I'm not quite sure

1811
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,800
if I heard her say she's Radio Rebel...?

1812
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:08,108
I'm Radio Rebel.

1813
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,244
<i>I'm so Radio Rebel!</i>

1814
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:12,713
Well, then...

1815
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,725
Why are you being so nice to me,

1816
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,294
when I've always been
nothing but mean to you?

1817
01:24:27,296 --> 01:24:30,230
Look at you right now, Stacy.

1818
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,465
That dress?

1819
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:33,700
The crown?

1820
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:37,137
You are 100% you right now,

1821
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:41,442
and that's all Radio Rebel
could ask of anyone...

1822
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:42,743
You are yourself,

1823
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:45,179
and you've never been more beautiful.

1824
01:24:56,724 --> 01:25:01,195
Everyone! Please give it up
for Lincoln bay's very own...

1825
01:25:01,197 --> 01:25:02,796
Gavin Morgan!

1826
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,877
There's a girl I've liked for a while now.

1827
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:19,446
She's the kind of girl who's not afraid

1828
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:22,316
to ask a dancing sandwich for some help.

1829
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:24,218
She inspired this song.

1830
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,653
This song's for her.

1831
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,322
Hi.

1832
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:11,658
Hey.

1833
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,727
I don't know what's more amazing...

1834
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:14,928
That song, or...

1835
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,264
The fact that you're Turkey on rye?

1836
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:23,570
Why didn't you tell
anyone I was Radio Rebel?

1837
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:27,307
You wanted to keep it a secret.

1838
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:29,776
I respected that.

1839
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:33,013
Thank you.

1840
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:35,449
You know, you really know how to dance...

1841
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:36,550
For a sandwich.

1842
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:38,252
Oh.

1843
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,624
Will you go to morp with me?

1844
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:47,394
Yes.

1845
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,897
So...

1846
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:53,567
Should I call you "Tara"

1847
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:55,836
or "Radio Rebel?"

1848
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:58,772
You can call me either.

1849
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,375
They're both me.
