{50499}{50590}- As far as I could tell, he already had it.|- Hey, come on.
{50593}{50685}- How about that? He sure did.|- Come on. We're on a state highway.
{50688}{50750}Would you relax, boy?
{50997}{51066}Hey, is that a cop car?
{51827}{51860}(mouths)
{53220}{53287}Don't you go lookin' at him, now, Bertha.
{53290}{53388}God damn, Bertha.|Couldn't you buy a car that'd run?
{53391}{53448}- Buy?|- Ah...
{53451}{53553}- This thing's busted.|- Oh, great. Now we're auto thieves, right?
{53556}{53701}Let's skip what we are and think about|what we're gonna do. We're in Arkansas.
{53704}{53780}- Where you going now, Bertha?|- The thing's busted.
{53783}{53899}- What you gonna do?|- We'll catch the 5.10. Come on, help.
{53923}{53980}- How far is it?|- Down the road.
{53983}{54032}What do you mean?
{54055}{54138}I ain't cut out for this kind of life.
{54372}{54444}- Son of a bitch.|- Who you callin' a son of a bitch?
{54809}{54870}Come on.
{55164}{55203}Hey!
{55268}{55330}- Hi.|- What happened? We get robbed?
{55354}{55421}Why? You got something to rob?
{55932}{56037}Now, four goes into twelve.|It goes three times...
{56063}{56093}And...
{56096}{56195}- (Rake) Put all the ones here.|- Well, it goes three times.
{56198}{56269}(Rake) So that's... uh...
{56272}{56328}Von) That's three thousand apiece, guys.
{56331}{56409}(Rake) And now put|the hundreds in this one.
{56435}{56522}Now the fifties. That's fifty.|That's the ones.
{56525}{56625}Right, you just get the twenties.|You see, each pile is sorted out.
{56628}{56700}- Why do I get the twenties?|- That's the system.
{56703}{56807}- Why do I get them?|- Take any one. There's twenties.
{56810}{56931}There's the twenties, fifties, hundreds,|ones. Put the ones... That's not twenty.
{56996}{57048}Hey, let's go.
{57051}{57136}- You got this thing cut loose?|- Sure enough.
{57139}{57188}Come on.
{57233}{57362}- You know how to run this thing?|- All aboard! Roll the train!
{57537}{57573}(horn)
{57667}{57736}(conversation drowned out by train)
{58475}{58534}Wait a minute there, boy. God damn.
{58537}{58633}This is the first time|the 5.10 has been on time in 40 years.
{58636}{58687}First time it's been run by a union man.
{58690}{58782}You done all right with the engine,|but where's the rest of the train?
{58785}{58869}God damn, old man.|How do you think we got here on time?
{58904}{58953}Come on, baby.
{59103}{59147}(sniggering)
{59255}{59313}- (Bertha) What's so funny?|- (Rake) Listen.
{59316}{59434}"The notorious labour radical|and Bolshevik spy, Big Bill Shelly,
{59437}{59509}along with certain of|his desperate confederates,
{59512}{59627}broke out of Shelby County Penal Farm,|assaulting a guard."
{59630}{59692}What's so funny about that?
{59695}{59792}I was laughing at the spy part.|You don't look like no spy to me.
{59795}{59895}- I always thought they wore glasses.|- (Bertha) What else does it say?
{59898}{60024}"Assaulting a guard|and stealing a locomotive as he did so."
{60087}{60265}"ln addition to Shelly, the break-out|freed... one... Rake Brown,
{60268}{60360}a cardsharp and a pretty...|a petty confidence man,
{60363}{60434}well known to authorities in this area."
{60437}{60555}"Brown is not considered dangerous,|as he's known to be a coward,
{60629}{60688}and lacks the nerve to carry arms."
{60715}{60806}- I carry arms.|- But you don't use 'em.
{60809}{60868}That's not the point.
{61009}{61112}"Along with Brown and Shelly, authorities|claim a woman, Bertha Tomkins..."
{61115}{61215}- Thompson.|- Thompson. Bertha Thompson...
{61218}{61296}"..known to be a common whore|and woman of the streets,
{61299}{61377}also is im... implicated in the escape."
{61380}{61429}"The Thompson woman is being sought
{61432}{61548}for her alleged involvement|in the shooting of a prominent attorney."
{61551}{61645}"lt is reported that all other escapees|have been returned to custody,
{61648}{61707}except for a Negro."
{61710}{61785}That's probably you, Von.
{61804}{61922}- I never reckoned on all this.|- What's this about an attorney shooting?
{61925}{61979}- That was just a gambling man.|- Shut up.
{61982}{62084}An accident. And the other stuff's a lie.
{62162}{62273}Why... we're just criminals.
{62276}{62356}- I guess that's one way of looking at it.|- Shut up.
{62359}{62503}- Let's stop all this and head for California.|- No. I ain't no criminal. I'm a union man.
{62506}{62556}Yeah...
{62559}{62592}Yeah.
{62595}{62670}I'm going to take my $3,000|to the union hall.
{62673}{62729}- What?|- Yep.
{62752}{62801}- Hey, what about us?|- Bill!
{62826}{62899}- You go, that's all our asses.|- You can't go to town.
{62994}{63090}- You go with $3,000, that's all our asses.|- What do you care? It's my share.
{63093}{63169}They're gonna come back and get us.|Don't you understand?
{63172}{63289}Why don't you do it some other time? You|expect us to be here when you get back?
{63292}{63386}- We're not gonna be here. Right, Bertha?|- I'll be here.
{63877}{63990}I'll be damned. Shelly. They told me you|was dead. They said the sheriff's boys...
{63993}{64093}You can't believe anything a cop tells you.|Even something good.
{64096}{64172}Listen, did anyone know|you were coming up this way?
{64175}{64260}Hell, no. Just my police escort.|Didn't you hear the sirens?
{64263}{64348}Don't come all smart with me.|They got a price on your head.
{64351}{64403}You and them nuts you busted out with.
{64406}{64501}Whores and niggers. My God,|ain't that a nice image for unionism?
{64504}{64625}Well, here. I reckon|this'll clean up the image some, huh?
{64748}{64834}It's marked. You know it's marked.|They mark it nowadays.
{64837}{64899}Tiny little mark. They can tell every bill.
{64902}{65068}Joe, try not to be no dumber than you was|born to be. It's OK. Hell, it's money.
{65071}{65137}You're hotter than a deep-bowled stove.
{65140}{65236}Do us a favour, stay away from here.|The union has got to preserve...
{65239}{65322}- You don't need my money, you mean?|- I didn't say that.
{65325}{65381}It's appreciated. It's appreciated.
{65384}{65435}Look, hitting a scab is one thing.
{65438}{65548}But robbing the damn mail,|that's something else, ain't it?
{65551}{65617}Yeah, I guess it is.
{65688}{65777}Just see that stuff|gets in the strike fund, you hear?
{65780}{65873}- All you socialist bastards are just alike.|- In the strike fund!
{65876}{65913}Anything goes.
{66169}{66243}What are you doing with that dog?
{66246}{66328}What's it look like I'm doing? I'm feedin' it.
{66331}{66377}Oh.
{66416}{66465}I had a dog in New York once.
{66468}{66522}- Yeah?|- Yeah.
{66525}{66583}What'd you do? Lose him in a crap game?
{66586}{66685}No, as a matter of fact|I didn't lose him in a crap game.
{66699}{66758}He started a union.
{66888}{66947}Bill?
{66950}{67007}What?
{67010}{67070}It's gonna be all right.
{67073}{67154}Sure. Union don't want me.
{67157}{67269}Railroad goes on starvin' kids,|bustin' heads, makin' money.
{67295}{67345}And I'm here.
{67348}{67504}Bill, to get back at the Reader, you|don't need no union. Ain't that so, Rake?
{67507}{67598}You don't need no union|to go for more Reader payrolls.
{67601}{67675}Yeah. Payrolls... ticket offices...
{67772}{67828}What else we gonna do?
{68258}{68360}Put an extra $10 in them pay envelopes.|Just keep calm, and keep working.
{68363}{68437}Don't you do anything funny now.
{69325}{69397}You wanna just put something|on the tray, ma'am?
{69400}{69472}Yes, ma'am, that's fine.|That's fine, thank you.
{69475}{69544}And you, sir, you got|something here for me?
{69547}{69646}Thank you. Oh, my goodness!|Oh, that's...! Thank you.
{69649}{69721}Y'all sure was nice to this old nigger.|What you got?
{69724}{69848}That's a nice-looking watch you got on|there. Uh-huh. Yes, ma'am, all that's good.
{69851}{69947}All that. Yes, yes.|Thank you. You ain't got nothin' for me?
{69950}{70035}My goodness. How 'bout you?|You got something for this ol' nigger?
{70038}{70125}Thank you, I'm doing real well here.|Thank you, that's very kind.
{70128}{70161}(train whistle)
{70164}{70272}- What? Some what? Some with what?|- I said I think there's something wrong...
{70275}{70341}Waah! Hey!
{70344}{70433}Woohoo! Give me these.
{70436}{70520}Well, let's don't stop now.|Let's just keep going, huh?
{70783}{70847}You take care of the others, Rake.
{70994}{71058}Get over there. Watch it, now.
{71094}{71166}- OK, now, drop that.|- Move over.
{71243}{71309}Put 'em down.
{71367}{71426}I'll just take those, boys.
{71606}{71670}Y'all get on the floor, fast.
{71715}{71774}I said hit the ground.
{72472}{72541}All right, sit down.
{72796}{72845}Stand up.
{72857}{72906}Stand up.
{73020}{73076}Sit down.
{73100}{73150}Fast.
{73181}{73249}Now up.
{73270}{73354}- Fast. Fast.|- Come on, Bertha, get on with it.
{73357}{73416}Stand up. Up. Up. Down.
{73442}{73473}Up. Get up.
{73476}{73529}Down, down, down. Up.
{73532}{73595}Down, up, down.
{73598}{73641}Down. Come on, now.
{73644}{73699}Sit down.
{73721}{73760}Sit.
{73936}{73985}Well, how many?
{74019}{74121}Well, they've got four bosses,|but they got plenty of others.
{74155}{74213}What about that commie Shelly?
{74216}{74309}He used to plague me|with wildcat strikes. What about him?
{74312}{74395}- He gets his orders from abroad.|- Oh, of course.
{74398}{74460}We got more than|a security problem here.
{74463}{74526}We know how to handle him|when we get him, don't we?
{74529}{74588}And it'll be the exception, won't it?
{74591}{74741}Cos in the words of the Lord "l shall|vomit forth that which is lukewarm."
{74803}{74871}We know what to do.
{74874}{74973}Of course. What about the other one,|Brown? What about him?
{74976}{75026}He'd, uh... He'd crook ya.
{75052}{75111}You mean he'd try.
{75149}{75254}Fellas, the way things are,|this railroad's losing money every day.
{75257}{75313}I'm losing money every day.
{75316}{75415}You add Bill Shelly to that|and I got myself a situation.
{75439}{75533}- Ain't there another man with him?|- Nah, just a nigger.
{75536}{75559}Oh.
{75562}{75673}Well, what about her? What can you|tell me about this here Boxcar Bertha?
{75682}{75741}- (man) Aw.|- (woman giggles)
{75765}{75830}(man laughs)
{75833}{75882}(both laugh)
{76554}{76625}What's the matter, honey? You tired?
{76628}{76745}How could I be tired? I ain't done|an honest day's work in months.
{76748}{76822}I think it's honest work.
{76825}{76959}You think it's better to pick up a pay|envelope each week, working for them?
{76962}{77102}- I don't think that's more honest.|- That's being a slave, and you know it.
{77105}{77190}I'm just not used to|this kind of life, that's all.
{77223}{77285}I'd do anything you want.
{77311}{77382}You wanna quit, we'll quit. We'll go away.
{77385}{77455}I ain't a quitter.
{77458}{77563}If you want to leave,|there are no chains on you, honey.
{77609}{77677}- You're dumb.|- How do you mean?
{77680}{77734}I ain't leaving.
{78082}{78131}(Bertha giggles)
{78954}{79004}(gunshot)
{79032}{79095}Stay down.
{79098}{79159}- You see anything?|- No.
{79185}{79239}God damn.
{79242}{79301}It's Rake and Von.
{79458}{79507}Damn.
{79711}{79753}(laughs)
{79940}{79996}- Trouble?|- No, ain't no trouble.
{79999}{80120}What the hell you firing your gun for, with|the sheriff breathing down our necks?
{80123}{80207}You got to tell us you got|a new pair of shoes or something?
{80210}{80259}- Yeah, I got new shoes.|- Great.
{80262}{80348}What else am I going|to do with the dough?
{80351}{80438}- Anyway, that ain't why I'm shooting.|- Well, what, then?
{80441}{80514}We got ourselves|a little piece of fortune comin'.
{80517}{80604}There's a big party|Sartoris is throwing for all his buddies.
{80607}{80681}- So he's having a party? So what?|- So what?
{80703}{80801}So everybody from the railroad|will be there. Von, what do you say?
{80804}{80914}It sounds good. I want to see the look on|their faces when we take them goodies.
{80917}{81013}What we have here is a trap.|That's what it is, it's a trap.
{81036}{81165}I'm tellin' ya, it's a good thing. The only|thing is we don't want to go in shooting.
{81168}{81234}So we gotta come up with something.
{81237}{81324}- I ain't a criminal, you know.|- It makes me the criminal, right?
{81327}{81406}Aw, Rake, no, I didn't mean that.|All I mean is...
{81409}{81555}Listen, if we're going to hit Sartoris, we|gotta hit him so he doesn't get up again.
{81558}{81673}Damn, you just go for anything.|This ain't no easy war you're figuring on.
{81676}{81786}Honey, I never thought it was going|to be easy. I never said that, did l?
{81789}{81907}You're right, though. Bertha, you just|stay here. We'll go on ahead without ya.
{81910}{81971}Like hell I will.
{82476}{82530}- Where are you going?|- Trying to get out.
{82533}{82639}- I go first. Ladies first, remember?|- All right, get out.
{82642}{82706}Von) Get out the car, Bertha. Come on.
{82792}{82841}Hurry up, Rake.
{82880}{82929}- Do I look all right?|- You look great.
{82932}{83013}But I just saw a guy wearing tails|and I'm wearing a tux.
{83016}{83081}- Oh, Rake, you're so silly.|- What's so silly?
{83084}{83187}I'll be the only one in there in a tux.|I'll look like an idiot.
{83362}{83418}Invitations, please.
{83421}{83459}Oh, invitations...
{83462}{83519}- You must have them.|- I don't have it.
{83522}{83627}- I think I left it on my desk after...|- Henry, you have it.
{83630}{83756}- I do believe I does have them tickets.|- I think we got them.
{83759}{83798}- Here they is.|- That ain't it.
{83801}{83865}- Look again.|- That's it, that's it.
{83868}{83892}Yeah.
{83895}{83976}- Come on, Bertha.|- Gimme that gun.
{83979}{84031}Now, be careful now.
{84034}{84117}Yes, the Reader Railroad's|seen a great deal in its day.
{84120}{84246}Wars, strikes, and now,|the indignity of it all,
{84249}{84381}gangs of communists, whores,|pardon me, ma'am, and niggers.
{84384}{84461}Nevertheless, at this very moment,|my agents are...
{84464}{84563}Out cold and tied up in the kitchen.|Up against the wall, ma'am.
{84566}{84678}How's that feel for you? That's too tight?|Huh? That too tight for you? Uh-huh.
{84681}{84719}That's good.
{84851}{84955}Folks, may I have your attention? Folks?
{84988}{85040}Sh!
{85043}{85125}The lady would like to say something.|Go ahead, kid.
{85128}{85168}Thank you.
{85171}{85299}I'd just like to say that this is a hold-up.|We've come for your money and jewels.
{85302}{85379}So if you'd line up,|Bill, Rake and Von won't shoot you.
{85382}{85481}Von) Come on, move over there.|Come on, move it over there.
{85610}{85659}Come on, hurry.
{85782}{85828}Hey, you.
{85831}{85912}You there, with what|you think is a cuspidor.
{85938}{86004}"Lay not up for yourselves|treasure on earth."
{86007}{86077}"Where thieves break through and steal."
{86080}{86165}- I see you sorta know your Bible.|- What do you mean, sorta?
{86168}{86206}You forgot something.
{86209}{86296}The passage goes "Lay not up|for yourselves treasures on earth,
{86299}{86401}where moth and rust doth corrupt, and|where thieves break through and steal."
{86404}{86456}"But lay yourselves up|treasures in heaven."
{86459}{86527}- This here's my Bible.|- Mm.
{86572}{86670}- (Shelly) That's real pretty, honey.|- Can't stick it in.
{86687}{86736}- Hey, Von.|- Mm-hm?
{87036}{87095}Here, pick that up.
{87117}{87200}Just put it in here, sir. Pick that up.
{87203}{87267}- Put it in here, son.|- Pick that up.
{87283}{87332}Pick it up.
{87469}{87523}Not my tiara.
{87526}{87580}Aw, it ain't so special.
{87583}{87645}I got even better ones at home.
{87672}{87741}Come on, Bertha, let's get going.
{87744}{87828}- Oh, ma deah Bill...|- Cut it out, now.
{87831}{87891}You're Bill Shelly.
{87894}{87963}I had a sort of respect for you.
{87966}{88058}I thought you were|some sort of crazy Bolshevik.
{88061}{88141}But hell, you're just a common crook.
{88144}{88198}You just don't understand.
{88201}{88296}Here, I don't want your watch.|I don't want to steal your watch.
{88299}{88368}I just want to smash your railroad.
{88437}{88486}Let's git.
{88512}{88566}OK, just stay where you are.
{88569}{88660}Just stay where you are. That's it.
{88669}{88728}(train whistle)
{88731}{88868}I'm taking this to Washington. We'll see|what the FBl has to say about all this.
{88871}{88933}Thank you, boy.
{88936}{89051}Now, I expect if J Edgar|don't do something mighty fast,
{89054}{89122}I just might have to have a talk with FDR.
{89125}{89174}Yes, sir.
{89207}{89248}That's a joke, son.
{89585}{89663}- Hi.|- Son of a bitch, you're coming with us.
{89666}{89747}A couple of your buddies|are going to pay $100,000 for you.
{89750}{89841}Von) Mm-hm.|Now, how you gonna like that?
{89920}{89967}Sure enough.
