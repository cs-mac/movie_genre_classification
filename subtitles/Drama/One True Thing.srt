1
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,618
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

2
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,456
Let go! Let go! Stop!

3
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,046
Damn. Richard Ellespeare died.

4
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:16,177
- He was a professor of mine at Harvard.
- No!

5
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,549
- He was a novelist, humanitarian.
- Hey, hey, back there.

6
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,975
- Published eight novels, including the best seller...
- Stop it! Quit it!

7
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:25,304
Hope's Way, for which
he won the Pulitzer Prize.

8
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:30,647
- What kind of man was this?
- A man who pursues excellence and nothing less.

9
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,479
- Dad?
- Yes?

10
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:35,027
I have to go to the bathroom.

11
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:39,535
Can't you hold it
till we get there?

12
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,621
Mmm, yes. I guess...

13
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:44,991
I can practice
mind over matter.

14
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:48,247
Atta girl.

15
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:53,509
Oh, look at
the baby cows, Ellie!

16
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:57,377
Oh, my God!
Look at them.

17
00:02:57,473 --> 00:03:00,593
I'm reading, Mom.
And baby cows are calves.

18
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:03,685
I was never close
to my mother growing up.

19
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:10,189
Is that something Mr. Best
is going to use against me?

20
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,354
Ellen, the D.A.'s not going
to use anything against you.

21
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:17,818
Okay. Because...
Well, I-I agreed to do this because...

22
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,036
Mrs. Best, his wife,
was a friend of my mother's.

23
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:24,617
Do I need an attorney?

24
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,545
Nobody in this office
is accusing you of anything.

25
00:03:29,548 --> 00:03:32,715
We're well aware that
this kind of thing happens...

26
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,011
all the time
with terminal patients.

27
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:38,725
It's... It's a small town.
People talk.

28
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,139
The D.A. Wants to be able to say
that he looked into it...

29
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:44,063
and he can put it to bed.

30
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:47,148
What can I say?
It's an election year.

31
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,401
Anyway, were you aware that an autopsy
was being performed on your mother's body?

32
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:54,899
Yes, uh-huh, at her request.

33
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:58,574
Uh, actually to find out
the source of the disease.

34
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,910
Primarily for my benefit.

35
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:04,741
Mm-hmm.
Where are you living now?

36
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:09,420
In New York. I've been there
since I finished Harvard.

37
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,976
This living in the suburbs
is going to kill me.

38
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,236
Hey, Tweedy, the Bearstone Ladies
predict a stock market crash next month.

39
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,033
- Finish the captions on the junk shot, Casey.
- They're antiques.

40
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:36,075
- I've got a 110 pulse. I've got to check this again.
- Tweedy.

41
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,326
This story is too good.

42
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:41,498
Senator Sullivan, youngest guy
ever to be elected to the Senate.

43
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,537
His father was a drug dealer,
he overcomes that... excuse me...

44
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:47,297
is on his way to big things,
possibly the presidency...

45
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,129
- until he crashes his car into a tree, kills everyone inside...
- That was actually final draft?

46
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,128
While he's on cocaine.

47
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,129
I mean, this is not just good.
This is great.

48
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:57,845
Shakespearean. Sins of the father
revisited on the son...

49
00:04:57,934 --> 00:04:59,843
- etcetera, etcetera.
- We've got no interview. He's not talking.

50
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:01,845
- I can get him to talk. I promise you.
- He's checking into rehab.

51
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,931
Some people in town
are describing you as...

52
00:05:03,982 --> 00:05:06,652
cold and insensitive.

53
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:09,522
Um...

54
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:12,151
Ambition is Ellen Gulden's religion.

55
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,820
- She's condescending. She's remote, whatever.
- I can get him to talk.

56
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,996
Well, I was ambitious.

57
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,366
I still am.

58
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,245
My father taught me to work very hard
at everything I do, and I always have.

59
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,587
I'm not tired.

60
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:34,840
- So you were living a pretty
normal life in New York? - Uh-huh.

61
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,841
- Apartment?
- Uh-huh.

62
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:40,018
- Roommate?
- No. No roommate.

63
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:42,012
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend.

64
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,681
- Honey, please let me explain.
- Jordan, just get out of here.

65
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:48,687
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- Come on. I got...

66
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,689
I'm standing out here. I got wine,
candles. I got the whole kit.

67
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:53,107
Just go away, Jordan.

68
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,360
EI, can I just talk to you for five
minutes, please? I'll explain everything.

69
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,368
- Go away!
- We were together...

70
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,370
since senior year in college.

71
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:01,954
This one was the last time, okay?

72
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:05,627
Well, not together.
We, uh... We took breaks.

73
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:07,753
You know, a lot of breaks.

74
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:11,875
That's mean. That's not funny.

75
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,257
- He just needed some space.
- Space named Linda.

76
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,722
I'm sorry. Was that her name?
Lori? I don't remember.

77
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,892
- Oh, you're so mean.
- Is that not her name?

78
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,897
- That... You're so mean.
- Don't get me wrong.

79
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,397
I like him.

80
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,564
Of course, it was, um,
Jules, my best girlfriend...

81
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:37,156
who, uh, came home with me
to celebrate my father's birthday.

82
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:40,580
Jordan, um, as usual,
had something he had to do.

83
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,491
Oh, this ought to be good.

84
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:45,544
"Come as your favorite literary
character." I don't know why...

85
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,674
my mom can't just throw
a normal birthday party.

86
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,837
Ellie, it's going to be perfectly fine.

87
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,886
Thank you. Thanks.

88
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:00,688
- Hey!
- Whoo-hoo!

89
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:02,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,443
- Oh, good hat. Uh-huh. - Really
good hat. Really good everything.

91
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:07,442
Thanks. What'd you guys
come dressed as?

92
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,605
The Sylvia Plath twins?

93
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:11,863
- Brian, you know I can't do costumes.
- Why?

94
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:14,573
- It's just so... Mom.
- Human?

95
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,993
- So what have you guys been up to?
- God!

96
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:19,120
- Ooh. Mm-hmm.
- It's writing and deadlines.

97
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,124
Take me away.

98
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:23,125
- Okay.
- Oh, wait!

99
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:25,959
Somebody just finished summer school,
didn't he? Congratulations!

100
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:28,676
- Actually, I didn't finish.
- That's great!

101
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,333
What?

102
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,002
I, Brian Gulden...

103
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:38,809
son of Mr. American Literature and the
romantics, failed American Literature.

104
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:42,724
You're serious?

105
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:46,980
- Yeah.
- Well, way to go.

106
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:51,200
- How did you do that?
- I blew the test, Ellen.

107
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:54,486
Brian.

108
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,280
Did you tell Dad?

109
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,409
No.

110
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:04,287
Just 'cause I'm failing
doesn't make me a moron.

111
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,333
Yoo-hoo! Hi!

112
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,383
- There she is.
- Hi, Mom.

113
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:10,675
Your dad's not here.
The coast is clear. Gimme! Gimme!

114
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:13,005
Gimme!
Hi, Jules.

115
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:15,554
Hi.

116
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:18,051
- Hi. You too.
- Good to see you.

117
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,055
- Let me get your...
- Oh, no, no, no. I got it.

118
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:22,187
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Oh, thank you.

119
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:26,361
- Wow.
- Thank you.

120
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:29,863
You got a cab? I would have sent
Brian to come and pick you up.

121
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,901
- You should have told me.
- Oh, that's okay.

122
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,904
Come in. Come in,
come in, come in.

123
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:37,246
- God, this must have taken you days.
- Oh, well, yes.

124
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,242
- Jules, you look wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.

125
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:42,372
- I just cut my hair.
- Oh. It looks gorgeous.

126
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:45,133
- And your hair looks great too.
- Oh, thank you.

127
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:48,466
Oh, this... It's yarn.
Look. Guess who I am.

128
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,463
Hmm? Oh!

129
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:54,388
Oh, wait! Clue.

130
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:57,886
- Oh... If I only had a brain
- A heart

131
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:00,387
A brain
and whatever else

132
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:03,188
Oh, well.
You're right, as usual.

133
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:08,028
- So, let me see. Who are you?
- Uh...

134
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:12,865
- Don't tell me. Let me guess. - Actually,
you know what? We-We kind of forgot.

135
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,238
But is was only because
we were trying to hurry...

136
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,369
'cause, of course, we wanted
to be here on time, so...

137
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,745
- God, that cake looks so good. So, we're just us.
- Oh.

138
00:09:21,797 --> 00:09:25,331
That's okay.
That's okay, Ellie. That's...

139
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,584
Ooh!
But I have an idea.

140
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,929
I do have a Thanksgiving
costume upstairs.

141
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:33,256
- That's okay.
- I could whip something up for you. It's a turkey!

142
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:35,592
- No, really. It's okay. It's all right.
- It's really...

143
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:37,893
- Can I help you with anything?
- Oh, yes, thanks.

144
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:42,150
- You could take those dishes, put them in the buffet. Umm...
- Sure.

145
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:45,105
And Ellie... Ellie?

146
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:49,782
You can... keep-keep, uh,
slicing the bread...

147
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,823
- with this knife, okay?
- Thank you.

148
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:56,329
I read your piece
on Geraldine Ferraro.

149
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,326
My brilliant daughter.

150
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:01,336
I was so... proud of you.

151
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:04,257
It's no big deal.
It's just a little follow-up piece.

152
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,755
Back and forth.
Saw on it.

153
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:10,338
- Do you think that Dad read it?
- Oh, I'm sure he did.

154
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:14,644
You know your dad.
But he doesn't talk shop with me.

155
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:18,470
Fuck.

156
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,931
Nope. It's okay. It's okay.
It's not even bleeding.

157
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,977
- It's fine. It's really fine.
- Wrap it up.

158
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,691
- Okay. Thank you.
- Brown paper. There's something in it that stops the bleeding.

159
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:29,032
- Did you know that? -
Really? - Okay, thanks.

160
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:32,321
- Oh! Oh, dear.
- Sorry.

161
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:35,040
- No, I'll get it.
- That's all right. Don't throw the pieces out...

162
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:37,615
- because I'm going to use it in my mosaic table I'm making.
- Don't worry.

163
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:41,039
- We got it.
- Keep your finger up and wrapped in the bag.

164
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:44,168
Hello?
There's no place like home.

165
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,631
- Thank God.
- Are we the first ones here?

166
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,215
- Ellen! Oh, it's good to see you.
- Oh, yeah.

167
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:52,217
- You're lookin' tired.
- Ellen.

168
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:56,520
- Now, who are you supposed to be? Who?
- Oh, I'm Lizzie Borden.

169
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:58,971
You know, Lizzie Borden:
"Took an axe...

170
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:02,357
gave her mother 40 whacks."

171
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:04,894
Oh, Mrs. Best, can you
hold the door? Oh, thanks.

172
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:07,825
- Help! Ellen, I just saw Dad. He just turned the corner.
- Oh! Hey!

173
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,991
Jules! Jules!
Come help. Come help.

174
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,705
Okay.

175
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:16,123
- So, um, Snow White, explain. What was that?
- Oh.

176
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,872
Mrs. Best, the D.A.'s wife,
she's in my mom's cult.

177
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:22,879
The Minnies, yeah.

178
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,882
They're named after
some local do-gooder...

179
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:28,047
who used to decorate Christmas trees
in the town square.

180
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,712
- And, um, they're a cult?
- Woman's group.

181
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:33,596
- Right. Right.
- You know, bake sales, tag sales, all of that.

182
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,596
- Come on. You be nice.
- Do-good stuff.

183
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:37,597
- No. Hi.
- You must be Ellen. I'm Harold Simpkey.

184
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:39,601
- I teach music over...
- Harold, could you, um...

185
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:42,480
He's here!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

186
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,777
Hurry up! Here he is.

187
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:46,774
Everybody, get-get-get down!

188
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:51,862
Shh! Ralph, move your... Shh!

189
00:11:57,669 --> 00:11:59,580
Quiet!

190
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:04,799
Kate?

191
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,263
Kate?

192
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,719
- Kate?
- Surprise!

193
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,308
Happy birthday!

194
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:27,408
No. Look at all of you.

195
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,410
Kate.

196
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,912
How did you pull this off?
Bravo!

197
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,794
Come on, Dad, speech.

198
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,791
Speech! Speech!

199
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,799
I'm quite out of breath with walking
home. It's only in going uphill...

200
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:51,467
that you realize
you're headed downhill.

201
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:58,724
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you all for coming.

202
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:01,985
I'm really...
I'm really very touched.

203
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,521
I'm very touched.

204
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:11,823
So, I guess this is the...

205
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,625
last class of the semester.

206
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,796
Thank you for taking this journey
with me. It's been a lot of fun.

207
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,337
And have a great summer.

208
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,698
There it is.

209
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:55,248
The National Book Award.

210
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:02,709
Oh, wow. He knows Oliver Most.

211
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,086
Yeah, they went to Harvard together.

212
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,219
Come see this. Come here.

213
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:11,727
It's his novel, Comeback Inn.

214
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:14,268
He's been working on it for years.

215
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:19,566
Took Milton ten
to finish my favorite poem.

216
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:22,566
Oh, here's his collected essays.

217
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:24,607
I read this first chapter.

218
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,610
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

219
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:29,989
And?

220
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,572
- It's great.
- Uh-huh.

221
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:40,007
So, uh, what-what'd he say
about your article?

222
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,303
Oh, I don't believe it.

223
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,928
You didn't ask him, did you?

224
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:51,934
Ellie. Tsk.

225
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,977
- That's what they called me.
- Did they now?

226
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,976
You know,
having the dubious distinction...

227
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:00,603
of having been called "Big Al"
when you were this diminutive...

228
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:04,743
package is a challenge
to confidence...

229
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,242
but you have obviously
survived it, have you not?

230
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:10,989
- Yes.
- So here you have in front of you a living example...

231
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:14,286
of-of everything
you're trying to achieve.

232
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,166
I would just say get an ice breaker
and break out of it.

233
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,166
- I'm havin' a lot of trouble.
- Listen...

234
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,173
a writer calls his friend, he says,
"I've just finished writing a story.

235
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:25,670
"It's not very good.
In fact, it's terrible.

236
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:28,303
The worst part of it is
it's the best I can do."

237
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:33,975
The writer is John Steinbeck.
The book is Grapes of Wrath!

238
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:38,352
- Hi! Hi.
- Hey! Hi.

239
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:43,444
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

240
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:46,328
I'm afraid with 55
staring at me in the face...

241
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,659
I'm developing inflammation
of the sentence structure...

242
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:52,325
and a definite hardening
of the paragraphs, but...

243
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,120
- How are you?
- Oh, no. How are you?

244
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:58,664
You knew all about
this little thing, didn't you?

245
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:01,042
- Huh?
- No, actually, I didn't.

246
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,010
Hmm.

247
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:07,807
Well, did you get a chance
to look at my latest piece?

248
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:11,470
Yes. Yes, of course.

249
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:14,476
The Minnies seem to get
their literature from Disney.

250
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:17,196
I know.

251
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:19,194
- Hey!
- Oh, my God, they're everywhere.

252
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:24,067
Enemy forces at 2:00.
Danger, Will Robertson. Danger.

253
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:27,577
- It's Robinson. Robinson.
- Oh, Robinson.

254
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:30,869
Safe.

255
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:32,876
Safe for the moment.

256
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:38,372
That was better. That was better.
Now I'll show you...

257
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:40,376
About your article...

258
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,509
- Hmm.
- I don't want to interfere, you know.

259
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:45,390
- You are doing just fine.
- Oh, no. Come on.

260
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:48,553
Come on. You know your criticism,
it helps me so much.

261
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:50,561
I really appreciate it.

262
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,934
All right.

263
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:56,937
Writer to writer.

264
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:04,067
- Less is more.
- Hmm.

265
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,616
Your approach is a little
overemotional at times.

266
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,575
It needs to be more succinct. The word
choice needs to be more muscular.

267
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:15,584
Ellen, you've got a great talent,
but it's not enough.

268
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:17,584
You have to reach, goddamn it.

269
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,753
When I was 20 years old
working at the New Yorker...

270
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:22,259
I would spend a whole day
working on one sentence.

271
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:25,307
I mean, Lord knows I could...

272
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:32,346
Wait a minute.
It's your best work to date. It's...

273
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:39,688
It's not your fault. It's like
the problem is that editor, damn it.

274
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:42,987
- What is his name? Uh, Tw... Twimpy?
- Tweedy.

275
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,987
Yeah.

276
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,369
- George? Well, see ya.
- He's a fool as far as...

277
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,367
- Hey.
- Yeah? We're hiding.

278
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:53,328
I know. Come inside. It's time to
blow out the candles and make a wish!

279
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:56,044
Oh, I wish we were... alone.

280
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:59,633
Well, we're not yet. So hurry up.
Come on. Everybody's waiting.

281
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:07,512
Man, that's solid.

282
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:10,605
Brian, how's Harvard treating ya?

283
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,184
Can't complain.
We beat Oxford in the Prentice Cup.

284
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:18,821
I was referring
to your courses.

285
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:21,031
Summer school was all right?

286
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:23,610
Uh, fine.

287
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:27,197
Yeah? You didn't have
any more problems, did ya?

288
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,200
Nope.
Everything's fine, Dad.

289
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:31,535
I'd be glad to help
by talking to your professors.

290
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:34,880
- I'd be glad to look at your...
- I said everything's fine.

291
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:39,632
Well, good.

292
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:43,883
Good.

293
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,523
- He's had a few, huh?
- It's his birthday.

294
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:57,022
Good night!
Good night, Mary!

295
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:59,107
- Good night, guys.
- Good night... What's his name?

296
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,367
Hewitt.

297
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:07,078
Hewitt. That's...

298
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,086
Don't do anything.
I'll do it in the morning, honey.

299
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:17,331
Well, thank you,
thank you one and all for a...

300
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,343
a beautiful birthday.

301
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:22,555
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Dad.

302
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:25,891
Happy birthday, darling.

303
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:29,182
- Good night. Uh-huh.
- Good night?

304
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:31,937
You're not going to bed.
You're not going to sleep, anyway.

305
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:35,111
- Oh, God.
- I have to get up early, you know.

306
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:37,106
I have Dr. Cohn in the morning.

307
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:41,113
Shh!

308
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:43,741
Oh, do you like Bette Midler?

309
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,743
Oh! You.

310
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:50,746
Come on. Come on.

311
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,915
Just one.

312
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,627
I don't care about that.

313
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:07,619
I knew my mother was going
to the doctor, but, uh...

314
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,252
I didn't really know
what for.

315
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,710
So you didn't ask.

316
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,171
No.

317
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:21,839
What poem begins,
"'Twas the night before Christmas"?

318
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:25,013
Uh, it's not called,
"'Twas the night before Christmas."

319
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:27,774
It's called, uh... I can recite
the whole thing. Does that count?

320
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,980
Anybody need any coffee?

321
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:32,696
- We just need the title. No, thank you.
- No? Okay.

322
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:35,573
- I'm gonna go through the whole thing.
- Don't let him cheat!

323
00:21:35,657 --> 00:21:38,031
Please!

324
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:43,198
Oh, my God.
"A Visit from St. Nick."

325
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,370
Oh, man! Don't I get the point?

326
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,376
Hey!

327
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,631
- Where's Mom?
- They're going to keep her overnight.

328
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:05,725
She's going to have to have surgery.

329
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:10,061
Surgery?

330
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,693
Yes, they're...
They're going to try to take it out.

331
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:21,077
It's cancer?

332
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:35,043
- Are they sure?
- I'm going back out there to spend the night.

333
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,597
Is she going to die?

334
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:43,641
No, she's not going to die.

335
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:49,104
After the operation, she may need
radiation or chemotherapy.

336
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:51,857
The doctor said that
that can be very debilitating...

337
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:55,446
in which case she would need somebody
to take care of her during the day.

338
00:22:57,537 --> 00:22:59,446
Actually, l...

339
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:03,784
I want you to-to move home...

340
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:07,079
to take care of her.

341
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:09,418
Move home?

342
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:14,127
- Brian is at school.
- Dad, what about my job?

343
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,304
Well, you can
freelance from here.

344
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:20,303
She's going to need help
during the day.

345
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:22,350
Well...

346
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:24,976
Maybe you could take sabbatical.
I mean, it's been four years since...

347
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:27,354
- you took one for the novel.
- A sabbatical is out of the question.

348
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:30,527
I have a department to run,
and I have to make a living.

349
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:33,863
As you well know, the advance
on my novel was spent years ago...

350
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,859
on yours and Brian's education.

351
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:41,159
Dad, I have to do my interviews
and my research in New York.

352
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:43,823
You know my job.
I cannot just drop everything.

353
00:23:43,877 --> 00:23:47,080
I may never catch up again.
It could ruin my career.

354
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:49,628
- We can get a nurse and I will come home every weekend.
- A nurse?

355
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:53,625
We're not getting a nurse. Your mother
didn't get a nurse when you had chicken pox.

356
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,677
A nurse. You know she won't tolerate
having strangers in this house.

357
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:01,344
- But, Dad...
- Your mother needs you, Ellen. Jesus Christ!

358
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:04,355
You've got a Harvard education,
but where is your heart?

359
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:13,566
Excuse me.

360
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,622
- Honey? Hi.
- Hey.

361
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:25,576
- So sorry I'm late. Sorry. Hey, Jules.
- Hi. Bye.

362
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:28,707
- Okay. Hi. Mmm, kiss.
- Hi.

363
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:33,212
You okay?

364
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:35,380
Here, give me your bag.

365
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,883
- What's the matter? She's what?
- My mom is sick.

366
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,811
Ellen, a sick mother means
three weeks off...

367
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,140
and a very nice arrangement
of flowers sent by the staff.

368
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,903
Yeah, still holding.
You're doing great here.

369
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,145
If you leave there's no guarantee. All
I could offer you is some freelance work.

370
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:55,066
Okay, but I'm still going to finish
the Sullivan piece from home.

371
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,784
How are you going to do that?

372
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:02,123
- Actually, Casey said that he has a way into Sullivan too.
- No.

373
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,246
This is my piece.
I can do it.

374
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,419
Okay. I know what this is about.

375
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,417
You want an upgrade.

376
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,918
Well, you got it.
I don't know what it is yet...

377
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:14,052
but it's yours.

378
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,931
You really think that
someone would come in here...

379
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,270
and say that their mother
has cancer for a promotion?

380
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,642
Ellen, this is New York.

381
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,128
Ellen Gulden.

382
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,248
Hello, sweetheart. It's Dad.

383
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,257
Hi, Dad.

384
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:53,134
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

385
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:58,264
- Listen, I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

386
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:01,266
Don't forget
to make an extra set of keys...

387
00:26:01,314 --> 00:26:03,805
- in case you need to get in.
- I know. I know. You know what I need to do?

388
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,816
- I've got to disconnect the phone.
- Yes, by Wednesday.

389
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,818
- By Wednesday.
- Okay. I'll call then.

390
00:26:07,863 --> 00:26:10,817
- When is she moving in? Saturday?
- Thursday.

391
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:13,867
- Okay. What are you gonna do?
- Call you when I get there.

392
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:17,653
- You always forget, then I worry.
- I won't forget. I promise.

393
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:22,159
Thanks. Okay.

394
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:26,835
Sweetie, I'm all nervous.

395
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:30,092
I've never asked anybody
to live with me.

396
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:32,669
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

397
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:38,039
Ellie?

398
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,491
- You're home!
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,293
I was just... I was remembering when
I moved these plates from Princeton.

400
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:51,597
- Oh, yeah.
- Remember? And Brian was practicing juggling.

401
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,716
- So, how are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

402
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:55,724
- Good.
- I just have to take it easy.

403
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,095
My oncologist, who is...
you'll love this...

404
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:01,183
a woman,
says no upholstering...

405
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,647
no furniture refinishing.

406
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:06,107
Oh, no. What are you gonna do?

407
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:09,446
Can you stay
the whole weekend?

408
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:15,198
Uh, didn't Dad...
Oh, he didn't...

409
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,287
Well, um,
I'm home for a while.

410
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:22,000
I took some time off from work.

411
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:25,956
Home where? Here?
Well, what about your job...

412
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,960
and your little apartment
and everything?

413
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:30,461
Well, I'm gonna work
from here, so...

414
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:32,595
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- Oh, no.

415
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:34,598
- Tweedy said that it's fine.
- Oh, no, no, no.

416
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:36,601
Not to play nursemaid to me.

417
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:39,017
- Oh, no. That's not...
- Oh, I don't need...

418
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:41,680
Man, you'll hate me.
I'll just make you some dinner.

419
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:43,685
No, I want to stay.

420
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:46,021
At least until you feel better.

421
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:48,784
I mean, it's the right thing.

422
00:28:50,577 --> 00:28:52,783
For who?

423
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,952
- Whose idea was this?
- Mine.

424
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:58,659
Dad, and...
Well, it was both of ours.

425
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:02,797
He shouldn't have asked you to do this,
honey, because he knows you.

426
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,959
- He knows this will never work.
- No. Now, I told Dad...

427
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,418
that I want to do this
and I'm going to.

428
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,672
So, that's final.
Okay?

429
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:17,179
Okay. Okay.

430
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,641
Okay. Oh, my girl.

431
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,228
I'm gonna make you
some cinnamon toast.

432
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:27,813
And I'll get you
a cup of tea too.

433
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,823
Okay.

434
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:47,251
I'm glad you're home. Thanks.

435
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:49,338
She didn't know I was coming.

436
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,011
Well, you know how
your mother is.

437
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,015
If she'd known...

438
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,386
she probably would've redecorated
your entire bedroom.

439
00:29:58,524 --> 00:30:00,897
What's that smell?

440
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:04,604
Um, that is
an old writer's trick.

441
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,576
Schiller believed that
his body sabotaged...

442
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:12,111
the attention of his mind
while he was writing.

443
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:14,114
So, he engaged his body...

444
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:18,418
with a simple stimulant, apples...

445
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:20,495
to free his mind.

446
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:24,717
So far, all it's done for me is
make me hungry for apple pie á la mode.

447
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:28,088
So, what have you been
working on recently?

448
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:30,131
My interview with James Sullivan.

449
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:33,889
- Senator Sullivan?
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:37,187
That's impressive.
That's a big story.

451
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:40,393
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you.

452
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:43,017
Random House has been asking me
who I'd like to write...

453
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:48,190
the introduction to Volume Two
of my Collected Essays.

454
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:51,285
It's coming out in the spring.

455
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:53,288
Feel free to say no,
but if you had the time...

456
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:55,574
how would you feel
about writing the introduction?

457
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:59,411
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:04,802
- I would love to.
- Great. Great.

459
00:31:04,844 --> 00:31:09,802
They envision some biographical sketch
or interview perhaps.

460
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:12,803
- I'll help you write the questions, if you want.
- Okay.

461
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:15,474
Here's some literary criticism...

462
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:17,479
in case you haven't
seen any of that recently.

463
00:31:17,523 --> 00:31:20,395
And two, three examples of my work
in case you don't carry that...

464
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:22,644
around in your bags
with you wherever you go.

465
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:24,648
And, wait.

466
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:30,952
Wow.

467
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:34,412
Could you wash these for me?
No starch.

468
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,410
And this pocket
needs to be stitched.

469
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,999
Thanks for taking care of this.

470
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:49,141
Ellie!
Tell Dad dinner's on the table.

471
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:52,184
Sweetie, later on tonight,
I'm gonna run you a vanilla bath.

472
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,262
That'll help you
go to sleep. Okay?

473
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:09,072
- Morning.
- Good morning.

474
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:11,370
Good morning
Mary sunshine

475
00:32:11,457 --> 00:32:14,375
Did you wake so soon

476
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,545
- Remember when we used to sing you that?
- Nope.

477
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:21,206
I see the decorating season
has officially begun.

478
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:25,091
- Our quarterback is suiting up.
- Mmm.

479
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:27,089
Oh, George.
You love it when...

480
00:32:27,182 --> 00:32:29,969
the Minnies decorate
the Christmas trees.

481
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,891
You just pretend to be Scrooge.

482
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:36,685
- Mm-mm-mm. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

483
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,937
Good day. Don't forget you have
a staff meeting at 3:00.

484
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:42,188
- Oh, yeah. I'll see you gals tonight.
- Okay.

485
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,579
Mmm. I wish I had redone
this kitchen years ago...

486
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:55,915
when I had the money to do it.

487
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:57,918
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just...

488
00:32:57,963 --> 00:33:00,087
I'm a little tired.

489
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:03,176
I have my big
Minnie luncheon today.

490
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:06,880
Just the thought of
all those Minnies is tiring.

491
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:10,135
- I can make the lunch.
- You could make the lunch?

492
00:33:10,227 --> 00:33:12,137
Yeah, I'll call out
for Chinese...

493
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,100
- or make some tuna fish sandwiches.
- No, no.

494
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,108
This is the steering committee lunch
where we plan the Christmas trees.

495
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,945
It's very important.
I'm gonna make chicken paillard...

496
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:23,603
zucchini soup,
and my heavenly chocolate cake.

497
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,609
Well, that's what
I'll make then.

498
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:29,651
You can make chicken paillard
and zucchini soup and chocolate cake?

499
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:34,789
Yeah. Just show me how.
It can't be that hard.

500
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:38,437
Crap.

501
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,484
Oh, shit! Mom!

502
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,489
Can you come here, quick?

503
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:46,492
No, I saw it on Donahue.

504
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:50,287
This woman said a UFO landed
and took away her husband.

505
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:54,420
- A UFO?
- And the UFO's name was probably Jennifer or Sophia.

506
00:34:54,505 --> 00:34:56,414
Yeah, but she saw something,
you know...

507
00:34:56,506 --> 00:35:00,505
and I think there are things in this world
that are mysterious and unexplainable.

508
00:35:00,553 --> 00:35:03,423
Yeah, like remember
when they had one calorie Tab.

509
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:05,970
I was always wondering why the need
for that one calorie at all.

510
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:09,474
Oh, there you are.

511
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:12,682
Ellie made the lunch.

512
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:15,686
Since Ellie made the lunch,
let's make her an honorary Minnie.

513
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:18,736
Oh, yes, honey.

514
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:21,739
- Come on in and sit down.
- I'm going to the library. I have work to do.

515
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:24,743
- Oh, come on.
- Let's make Ellie an honorary Minnie.

516
00:35:24,787 --> 00:35:27,194
Come on in. Come on.
Bring the cake when you come.

517
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:30,912
- A cake.
- She did all this by herself.

518
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:32,910
- She made a cake?
- That is dear.

519
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,120
- And I slept on the couch all morning.
- That's really nice...

520
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:38,251
but I really have
to finish my article.

521
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,596
And I couldn't be a Minnie.
There's really nothing Minnie about me.

522
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,720
- Oh, don't be silly.
- I don't even like Christmas.

523
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:47,436
Oh, Ellie. Ellie can help Kate
with her Christmas tree.

524
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:50,099
Welcome to the Minnies.

525
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,807
Now moving on
to other Minnie matters.

526
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,107
It was... It was awful.

527
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,113
It was awful.

528
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,994
- Mmm.
- I guess that that world...

529
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:08,621
it, um...
it just felt small to me.

530
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:14,165
And, uh, and sometimes I felt
like I was going crazy.

531
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:19,297
But since my mom was
so good at decorating...

532
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,628
and doing those creative things
around the house...

533
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,969
I suggested that she do
something with her talent...

534
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,805
like, uh,
like decorate professionally.

535
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,811
Start her own business.

536
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:34,022
- You're kidding.
- No, it would be fun.

537
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,186
Ellie, this is the Minnies'
busiest season. You know that.

538
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,521
We have the Halloween festival
for the kids.

539
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:41,451
We have Thanksgiving,
a benefit for the older people...

540
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:44,612
and then we have to decorate all
the Christmas trees in the town square.

541
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,700
Okay.

542
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,959
Well...

543
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:56,959
- Why-Why... You gonna
make coffee now? - Uh-huh.

544
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,131
How are you gonna get
to sleep tonight if...

545
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:01,135
It really doesn't affect me.

546
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:06,385
Mm-hmm.

547
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:12,351
We could do, um...

548
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,643
a project.

549
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:17,020
- A project?
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:19,023
You and me.
Something we could do together.

551
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:21,025
- Together.
- Yeah, something different...

552
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:24,533
that you would like, like...

553
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,707
- a book club.
- A book club?

554
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,707
Why do you keep repeating
everything I say as if it's...

555
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:31,792
- the most remarkable thing that you ever heard?
- I'm sorry. Okay.

556
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:35,877
- No, a book club. That's good. Who else should we have?
- No one.

557
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:38,595
- No one?
- There you go again.

558
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:43,891
- Okay. A book club.
- Mm-hmm.

559
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:48,061
- I hate what Jane Austen does in this book too.
- What? What?

560
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:50,898
Well, she...

561
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:53,777
The way she makes Jane,
the sweet...

562
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:57,231
and domestic one,
the good one.

563
00:37:57,281 --> 00:37:59,951
She makes her second fiddle
to Elizabeth...

564
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:02,360
the one who's
the outspoken and smart one.

565
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,082
They do it at the college too...
women professors.

566
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:08,616
They say, "Oh, you keep house.
That's terribly interesting."

567
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,035
- Yeah, but I don't see...
- There's another book that does that.

568
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:16,212
Little Women. Yes, the writer's
sister, um, she puts her...

569
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,585
in opposition to the other one
that has babies.

570
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:21,135
- But, what...
- Meg.

571
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:23,300
So, you wanted to get back
to New York?

572
00:38:23,392 --> 00:38:26,596
- Right.
- You felt like you were wasting your time?

573
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:29,564
Sort of. She seemed okay.

574
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:32,146
- Your anger and resentment were building up.
- Yes.

575
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:36,102
Well, I mean...

576
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:39,483
No, um...

577
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:42,945
The one thing that
I never wanted to do...

578
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:47,950
was to live my mother's life,
and there I was doing it.

579
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:50,160
Oh, this is my favorite!

580
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:54,466
No! Not Bette Midler, Mom. Please.

581
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:56,466
Oh, you like this one.

582
00:38:56,511 --> 00:38:58,468
It's just every time
we get in the car...

583
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:00,469
I'm gonna get me
some of them

584
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:04,809
Cause you got
to have friends

585
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:08,720
Ba, ba, ba, ba
ba, ba, ba, ba

586
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:11,520
Friends

587
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:16,023
- Harmonize with me!
- But you're doing so nicely on your own.

588
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:18,785
Friends

589
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:21,661
I'm talking about friends

590
00:39:21,746 --> 00:39:24,283
- Mom, when are we gonna
turn around and head home?

591
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:29,374
I told you. We have to go get yarn,
sweetheart. Remember?

592
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:36,462
- Thank you, Kate.
- Okay, sweetheart. Come sit up with me.

593
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:38,469
I'll see you next week,
if I'm spared.

594
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:42,808
Thank you again.
I love your mother!

595
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:47,561
Bye!

596
00:39:54,656 --> 00:39:57,858
Oh.

597
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:01,491
Well, I think
she had fun though, don't you?

598
00:40:01,537 --> 00:40:03,614
No idea.

599
00:40:03,707 --> 00:40:05,617
Honey, give me a pill, will ya?
In the...

600
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:08,462
Yeah. Look, we've been driving
around for hours...

601
00:40:08,546 --> 00:40:12,590
- There's a thermos down there too.
- Wasting time.

602
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:15,926
You don't feel well
and I need to meet Dad.

603
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:18,051
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:27,436
- You know where we are?
- Canada.

605
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:31,307
We just dropped Clarice off
at her mother's house.

606
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:35,152
That's because she's been living there
for four months...

607
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,731
since her husband left her,
and she hit rock bottom.

608
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:45,117
And she stays inside all day
with the shades drawn.

609
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,119
Every day.

610
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,536
So, one of us
comes up once a week...

611
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:51,546
and takes her out
to have some fun, you know.

612
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:54,082
Have some laughs.

613
00:40:54,136 --> 00:40:57,136
And that's what we did today.

614
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,922
I hope.

615
00:41:21,872 --> 00:41:23,949
You could always do work study.

616
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,951
Right, and do what?

617
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:29,959
You can work in the library.
That's easy.

618
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:35,338
He's not here.

619
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,338
So, who's he doing now?

620
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:40,053
Probably Celine, his new T.A.

621
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:43,393
You mean "T and A."

622
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:45,388
I'd do him.

623
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:47,390
Not me.
He's way too critical.

624
00:41:47,483 --> 00:41:49,392
I mean, can you imagine?

625
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:52,357
"You have real talent,
but you must reach, goddamn it."

626
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:16,469
- Hello?
- Hi, Kate.

627
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:18,841
- Uh, George wanted me to give you a call.
- Harold.

628
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,843
- Yeah, hi.
- Oh, hi.

629
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:24,637
Yes. Ellie, is that you?
I have it.

630
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:26,647
Sorry.

631
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:57,515
So, when you worked
with James Sullivan...

632
00:42:57,557 --> 00:43:01,425
- would you say that he was driven?
- Oh, absolutely.

633
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,471
Uh-huh.
How about voracious?

634
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:08,484
What about
his drug use back then?

635
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:10,479
- Did you find it?
- I'm coming... now.

636
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:12,647
Thank you very much.
You've been really helpful.

637
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:15,611
- What?
- Coming. Could you come now, please?

638
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:17,612
What?

639
00:43:17,704 --> 00:43:22,081
- What is it?
- I've given her two, um, Percocets about an hour ago...

640
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:24,076
but they don't seem
to be taking an effect.

641
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:26,458
- L... I can't give her any more.
- No, absolutely not.

642
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:30,295
- What's going on? - Well, I
can't find the-the heating pad.

643
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:33,504
I need it.
I need the heating pad.

644
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:35,635
- We didn't find it.
- You want the heating pad? Okay.

645
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:37,633
She's in horrible pain.
She hasn't slept all night long.

646
00:43:37,726 --> 00:43:40,431
- You woke Ellie up. I told you not to wake her.
- I'm sorry.

647
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:43,225
I think l... Oh, I hung it...

648
00:43:43,273 --> 00:43:46,440
Ellen, please.

649
00:43:46,484 --> 00:43:50,150
Here, here, here. Here we go.
Now I just have to plug it in.

650
00:43:50,238 --> 00:43:54,153
- Has she got it?
- Turn it on. Yeah.

651
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:03,918
Yeah, she got it.
It's good.

652
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:07,627
- You can go now. You can go to work.
- You think?

653
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:09,958
- Yeah. Go to class now. It's okay.
- All right.

654
00:44:10,051 --> 00:44:14,345
- What else now? What else?
- I'll wait for Dr. Cohn to call.

655
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,267
And, um, I'll cancel the reservation
at the Porchlight tonight, Kate.

656
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:18,934
Yeah, that's good.

657
00:44:18,977 --> 00:44:21,302
- Shit! Jesus.
- Go.

658
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:25,975
Go.

659
00:44:26,068 --> 00:44:29,937
- The pill didn't work yet, baby.
- Just wait a little longer.

660
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:33,025
Is it getting warm?

661
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:36,202
Yeah, somewhat.

662
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,196
Yeah.

663
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,497
I'm giving her Dilaudid
for her pain.

664
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:46,505
It may make her a little groggy.

665
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,883
And she shouldn't drive.
Her speech may be a little slurred.

666
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:53,342
Even though you may see some
transient periods of improvement...

667
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:56,059
she still shouldn't drive
while she's on this medication.

668
00:44:56,142 --> 00:44:58,051
Okay.

669
00:44:58,144 --> 00:45:00,350
I want to send a nurse
to monitor her vital signs.

670
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,851
In fact, this afternoon.

671
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:06,061
No, we don't need a nurse.
I can handle this.

672
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:08,359
I insist. Your mother's
in a great deal of pain.

673
00:45:08,447 --> 00:45:10,653
She needs someone
she can be open with about it.

674
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:13,653
Well, she can be open with me.

675
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:15,991
Can she?

676
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:22,248
- Still beating?
- Loud and clear.

677
00:45:22,337 --> 00:45:24,543
Now, what can I do
to help you, Mrs. Gulden?

678
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:28,586
Tell me about your pain.
Is it constant?

679
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:31,250
Mm-hmm. Pretty much, yes.

680
00:45:31,347 --> 00:45:35,723
But, um, this medication's
really helping me now.

681
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:41,349
Okay. Are you having trouble
bathing and dressing?

682
00:45:41,398 --> 00:45:43,437
Well, sometimes I have
a little trouble...

683
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:45,980
getting in and out of the tub.

684
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,740
You didn't tell me that.

685
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:50,732
Why didn't you tell me that?

686
00:45:50,824 --> 00:45:55,072
Oh, Ellie. There's so many things
for you to worry about.

687
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:57,612
Well, let's go upstairs.

688
00:45:57,707 --> 00:46:00,578
I can show you some easy ways
to get in and out of the tub.

689
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:02,577
Okay.

690
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,591
Mm-hmm.

691
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,089
Are you having problems
with anything else?

692
00:46:14,182 --> 00:46:17,434
Uh-uh. No.
Everything's, uh...

693
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:20,313
Sometimes bending down.

694
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,770
You know, it's hard.
Hard to get my trousers on sometimes.

695
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,065
- Mm-hmm.
- And, um...

696
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:29,573
But my bed is nice and high, so I have
no trouble getting in and out of there.

697
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:51,753
- All right. Kate, I have a surprise.
- Hi.

698
00:46:51,806 --> 00:46:55,306
You have to close your eyes.

699
00:46:55,351 --> 00:46:59,396
- Oh.
- And keep them closed. Please, no cheating.

700
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,644
- Ellen, you too.
- What are you doing?

701
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:29,840
- What have you...
- No, no. Don't open your eyes just yet.

702
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:37,144
- Ready? Open.
- It's so...

703
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,227
Oh, it's so...

704
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,351
If you can't go to the
Porchlight, the Porchlight comes to you.

705
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:49,820
It's...

706
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,572
fabulous.

707
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:05,122
Oh, my.

708
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:13,297
I don't believe it.

709
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:15,302
Here.

710
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:20,605
Mmm. Oh.

711
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:22,351
It's so beautiful.

712
00:48:30,912 --> 00:48:35,123
And after dinner,
I've rented your favorite movie.

713
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:00,600
You awake?

714
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:04,144
- Go back to bed.
- I can't go to sleep.

715
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:06,230
Go back to bed.

716
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:08,240
Whatcha got in the box?

717
00:49:08,284 --> 00:49:12,412
Nothing. Go back to bed.

718
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:15,906
I guess she doesn't need her pill.

719
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,997
No. She's looking a lot better now.

720
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:21,421
She's gonna be just fine.

721
00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:27,968
- Dad?
- Yeah.

722
00:49:28,055 --> 00:49:29,964
I was just thinking
that maybe...

723
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:33,925
you could cut back on your classes,
help out a little.

724
00:49:33,978 --> 00:49:35,935
Ellie, I'd like to...

725
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,435
but this is the busiest time
of the semester for me.

726
00:49:38,482 --> 00:49:42,528
I've got midterms, which means
I've got evening tutorials.

727
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:46,658
Didn't you see her this morning?
She's getting worse.

728
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:52,121
No, she's not.
Don't you ever say that again.

729
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:56,115
- But, Dad...
- Ellen.

730
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,253
Look, I have essays to grade.

731
00:50:07,347 --> 00:50:09,968
And I've got a deadline.

732
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:11,974
Dad, if I don't finish
this article...

733
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:13,976
I'm never going
to get my job back.

734
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,970
- Don't you realize that?
- Ellen, enough. Midterms.

735
00:50:27,909 --> 00:50:31,908
I can see why people would think
that I didn't care.

736
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:35,580
But I just didn't know
what to do.

737
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:41,457
My mom would have a couple of bad days,
and then she'd be fine.

738
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:47,879
And, uh, she was still doing
the things she'd always done. So...

739
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:50,719
I was just wondering
if you could tell me...

740
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:53,514
when he's gonna be released
from rehab.

741
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:56,563
I'm just trying to be a friend,
which I'm sure that he needs right now.

742
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:58,565
Is a friend of yours
in trouble?

743
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:02,393
I'm-I'm sorry.
Can you hold on just a second?

744
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:04,570
It's a work thing.

745
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:06,738
Oh, I thought
you said a friend.

746
00:51:06,826 --> 00:51:09,863
Anyhow, the reason why I'm asking
is because I'm sure that he's gonna...

747
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:14,410
- Are you... Are you gonna get ready soon, because...
- I'm sorry.

748
00:51:14,501 --> 00:51:16,827
Um, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

749
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,329
It's kind of important.

750
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,587
Okay. So anyhow, I need
to know because I think...

751
00:51:23,677 --> 00:51:25,586
You don't have to come
if you don't want to, you know.

752
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:28,846
- You really don't have to come. It's fine.
- I'm sorry. Just a second.

753
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:33,975
You do know that this is
exactly what the Moonies do?

754
00:51:34,064 --> 00:51:37,433
They take your shoes,
your clothing, your identity.

755
00:51:37,484 --> 00:51:41,102
You sure the Minnies aren't
just an offshoot of the Moonies?

756
00:51:41,154 --> 00:51:44,606
Well, at least you're
wearing your favorite color.

757
00:51:44,658 --> 00:51:46,615
Next goblin, please.

758
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,902
Come on.

759
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:52,821
Look!
Two more Madonnas.

760
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:57,545
- Hey, Kate.
- There's Clarice.

761
00:51:57,631 --> 00:52:00,548
Go back to work.
Go back.

762
00:52:06,806 --> 00:52:10,258
- Louise, give me a pie. I got to go first.
- Oh, no.

763
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,980
You stand over there.
Stand over there. Stand over...

764
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:27,611
Shh. Kate, don't make me laugh.

765
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,036
- Home? Good.
- Yes, darling.

766
00:52:36,129 --> 00:52:38,751
- Hang in there.
- Let me see. No. Maybe I'll...

767
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,676
Oh, my God! Evelyn.

768
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:51,724
- You know, I really should get home.
- Okay.

769
00:52:51,813 --> 00:52:53,722
We'll go... pretty soon.

770
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:56,271
I just want to go around one more time.

771
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,482
Okay.
One more time.

772
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,650
- But only once.
- One more.

773
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:13,533
Okay.
One more time.

774
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:16,034
Okay.

775
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:23,548
- Whew.
- Whew, look at the little leaves.

776
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:26,212
Like they're in a big hurry
to get somewhere.

777
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:30,512
Those Minnies go all out.

778
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:33,267
- Yep, they do.
- They go all out.

779
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:35,563
Very creative women, huh?

780
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:39,144
- Yes. What?
- More is more.

781
00:53:39,237 --> 00:53:41,562
- You know, your dad always
says less is more. - Mm-hmm.

782
00:53:41,656 --> 00:53:43,982
To me, more is more.

783
00:53:44,076 --> 00:53:46,828
Oh, I love walking in Langhorne.

784
00:53:46,914 --> 00:53:51,741
My gosh, look at what Evelyn Best
has done here.

785
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:55,458
Uh-huh.

786
00:53:56,673 --> 00:53:58,750
It's a beautiful night.

787
00:54:00,844 --> 00:54:03,549
Are you okay?

788
00:54:03,597 --> 00:54:06,052
- Mom?
- Uh-huh. You hear that?

789
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:09,932
- What? Hear what?
- That.

790
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,304
What?

791
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:15,933
Why, I guess it's the rumble
of the furnaces or something.

792
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:20,232
You know, Langhorne kind of,
I don't know, hums.

793
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,860
It's... Even in the summertime
you can hear...

794
00:54:24,953 --> 00:54:27,704
Maybe it's the air conditioners...

795
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:30,624
crickets, or the bees.

796
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:32,618
Hmm.

797
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:37,049
No, I think it's something more.
You hear it?

798
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:41,634
No.

799
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,004
You can feel it.

800
00:54:46,935 --> 00:54:50,019
Trick-or-treaters. Oh, my gosh.

801
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:52,595
They're gonna beat us home.
You go get your dad up at the college.

802
00:54:52,649 --> 00:54:54,605
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Are you sure?

803
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,403
Yeah, I know he's doesn't
want to miss this fun.

804
00:54:57,488 --> 00:54:59,693
Trick-or-treat.
Trick-or-treat.

805
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:06,195
Dad.

806
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:33,244
- Hi.
- Hi.

807
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:35,415
Well, you missed
all the trick-or-treaters.

808
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:37,915
They were so cute.

809
00:56:38,011 --> 00:56:39,920
Remember when Brian
dressed up like a dice?

810
00:56:42,389 --> 00:56:44,299
And he tipped over
and you wouldn't help him up...

811
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:46,764
because you were so busy
laughing at his little legs...

812
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:49,482
scrambling around in the air
like a bug.

813
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:55,937
- Did you find your dad?
- His secretary said he had a late class.

814
00:56:58,824 --> 00:57:02,276
Oh. That's too bad.

815
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:07,911
You okay, Ellie?

816
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,743
- Uh-huh. Great.
- Good.

817
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:14,502
I love this movie.

818
00:57:15,593 --> 00:57:17,585
Do you think
about politics much?

819
00:57:17,636 --> 00:57:22,049
And if so, what do you think
about politics?

820
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:06,094
You know how some of these
meetings can go. Some of the faculty...

821
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:08,975
- Uh-huh. - You know, one of
the students had a little...

822
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:12,856
- Oh.
- So he, uh, he just wanted me to call.

823
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:16,023
- Okay.
- He thought you... Yeah, he thought you shouldn't...

824
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:18,528
He didn't want you to worry.

825
00:58:18,617 --> 00:58:21,867
- All right. Thank you, Harold.
- It's just...

826
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:25,744
Yeah, it's just another one
of those meetings.

827
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:30,578
Ellen?

828
00:58:31,672 --> 00:58:34,840
- Ellen?
- Hmm?

829
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:39,713
I was asking about your father.
You haven't really mentioned him.

830
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,389
- Was he not around that much?
- No, he was around.

831
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:47,226
Um, he was busy with his classes...

832
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:51,359
but-but he managed
to spend time at home.

833
00:58:51,944 --> 00:58:53,687
I looked at my American Express
bill one January...

834
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,109
and went into ring failure.

835
00:58:56,198 --> 00:58:59,818
I was so opposed to name tags that once
when a women slapped a gummed label...

836
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,367
over my left bosom that said,
"Hello, my name is Erma..."

837
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:05,747
I leaned over and said,
"Now what shall we name the other one?"

838
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,627
What are you reading?

839
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,666
Aunt Erma's Cope Book:

840
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,674
How To Get From Monday
To Friday In Twelve Days.

841
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,669
- Hey, guys?
- Up here.

842
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:20,842
- Shall I put it away?
- You'd better or else he'll call the thought police.

843
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,507
And they'll come in in tweed jackets...

844
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:26,807
and pummel us with rolled up
New York Times.

845
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:29,603
Whoa! Is this dissension
in the ranks?

846
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:32,320
Should I do my reading
from this tonight?

847
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:36,947
No. No readings this Thanksgiving.
Nobody even likes the readings.

848
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:40,617
- It's just gonna be us.
- And Jordan.

849
00:59:40,704 --> 00:59:43,278
Wait a minute. You're gonna buck
26 years of tradition?

850
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:46,867
You're gonna take away Frost and Whitman
and all those other exciting dead guys?

851
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:49,083
- Are you feeling all right?
- Shut up.

852
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:52,962
You are not going to believe
who is downstairs with Harold.

853
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:55,257
Oliver Most...

854
00:59:55,303 --> 00:59:57,628
poet laureate, in our house.

855
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:04,471
- What is that book?
- Oh, it's mine.

856
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:08,899
Ellen, could you put up, like, some
hors d'oeuvres or something for them?

857
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:10,977
Are they staying?

858
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,979
Yeah.

859
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:18,900
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh. Great.

860
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:24,159
- Dad?
- Yeah.

861
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:28,960
It was just supposed
to be Jordan and us, just family.

862
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:33,216
Well, I mean...

863
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:37,763
They have no place else to go. Oliver is
down from Harvard for a book-signing tour.

864
01:00:37,848 --> 01:00:41,715
He's all by himself. Come on. You know
your mother loves Oliver Most's work.

865
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,637
You promised.

866
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:46,475
Well, I can't very well
disinvite them now, can I?

867
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,859
And we could all use a little
holiday cheer around here now.

868
01:00:51,946 --> 01:00:55,564
Couldn't we?

869
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:06,042
Get up!

870
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:09,876
- Okay. Thank you.
- Oh, Ellen. You did this?

871
01:01:09,964 --> 01:01:13,584
- Oh, Ellie.
- You don't have to be concerned with things like that.

872
01:01:13,678 --> 01:01:16,050
- There's plenty of time.
- I have to pay my father when I get back.

873
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:19,139
- I don't know if I feel good about it.
- Would you like some wine?

874
01:01:19,226 --> 01:01:21,633
Well, you know,
there is plenty of time.

875
01:01:21,728 --> 01:01:25,726
A writer writes something.
He calls his friend. He says...

876
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:29,398
"I'm finished writing a little
something, and it's not very good.

877
01:01:29,444 --> 01:01:33,691
In fact, it's terrible. The worse part
about it is it's the best thing I can do."

878
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:37,656
And that was Steinbeck,
Grapes of Wrath.

879
01:01:37,745 --> 01:01:40,581
Your father tells me you write
literary reviews from time to time.

880
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:44,876
- Mm-hmm. That's right. - That's
interesting. Like father, like daughter.

881
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:48,371
Tell me, have you ever had the
opportunity to review any of my work?

882
01:01:48,423 --> 01:01:50,381
Um...

883
01:01:53,762 --> 01:01:57,131
- I want to say grace now.
- Oh, good.

884
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,518
Uh, no, George,
I want to say my own grace.

885
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:05,807
Of course.

886
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:17,118
Thank you for the world so sweet.

887
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:21,071
Thank you for the food we eat.

888
01:02:21,123 --> 01:02:24,410
Thank you for the birds that sing.

889
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:28,079
Thank you, God, for everything.

890
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:33,837
And thank you, Ellie, for making
such a beautiful Thanksgiving dinner.

891
01:02:33,929 --> 01:02:36,386
Sure.

892
01:02:36,474 --> 01:02:40,851
- Bravo.
- To Chef Boyardee.

893
01:02:40,937 --> 01:02:45,100
- Shut up. That's terrible.
- Well...

894
01:02:45,149 --> 01:02:47,106
to our great surprise and delight...

895
01:02:47,151 --> 01:02:50,687
tonight has become a night to go down
in our family's history books.

896
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:54,363
We have the honor to have
with us Oliver Most, who...

897
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:57,025
whose work means so much to me...

898
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,867
and who was the first to encourage me
with Comeback Inn.

899
01:03:01,959 --> 01:03:05,624
He's agreed after dinner
to read to us from his new book...

900
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:07,628
for which l...

901
01:03:07,673 --> 01:03:09,713
I'm very grateful.

902
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,588
Well, George, I'm happy to oblige...

903
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:16,842
but you're gonna have
to remind me.

904
01:03:16,933 --> 01:03:19,720
What in the hell is Comeback Inn?

905
01:03:19,811 --> 01:03:24,023
It sounds as if I've encouraged you
to invest in some sort of...

906
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:28,854
uh, roadside motel.

907
01:03:28,946 --> 01:03:31,188
Honey, would you pass
the vegetables around?

908
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:33,903
Yeah. You want
some carrots, sweetheart?

909
01:03:33,992 --> 01:03:36,069
That's my novel.

910
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:42,198
- My novel.
- Yeah.

911
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:45,667
Well, Jesus, George.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

912
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:50,341
As Thurber says,
"With 60 staring me in the face...

913
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:54,384
"I've developed inflammation
of the sentence structure...

914
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:59,052
- a definite hardening of the paragraph."
- Everything looks beautiful.

915
01:04:03,357 --> 01:04:05,730
Up in my blue room

916
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,280
Fools rush in
and not to bed

917
01:04:13,368 --> 01:04:16,240
I am the rich
of the real dead head

918
01:04:21,168 --> 01:04:24,169
Sure am gonna love you
one more time

919
01:04:24,254 --> 01:04:27,209
Little bit of whiskey
Little bit of my mind

920
01:04:29,468 --> 01:04:33,715
Well, you don't know
the things I see in here

921
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:36,089
Hey, did you see my dad tonight?

922
01:04:36,183 --> 01:04:38,307
He just kills me.

923
01:04:38,394 --> 01:04:40,932
You know, he doesn't say one word
to me about dinner...

924
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,555
and then he just goes off
to his study.

925
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:46,775
Like we're servants there
to serve him or something.

926
01:04:48,948 --> 01:04:52,317
Hello? Another round.

927
01:04:52,409 --> 01:04:55,530
- What are you, Janice Joplin? Take it easy on the sauce, okay?
- No. No.

928
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:58,705
- I have not been out in two months.
- I know.

929
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,700
- I deserve another drink.
- I know.

930
01:05:00,793 --> 01:05:02,620
I deserve another drink...

931
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:05,333
especially since it's been
like that since the beginning.

932
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:07,664
Do you know
he doesn't do anything?

933
01:05:07,758 --> 01:05:11,128
He really doesn't. He doesn't
do anything. I do everything.

934
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:13,594
- I do. I do everything.
- I realize that.

935
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:16,311
But I think in situations like this,
you have to...

936
01:05:16,352 --> 01:05:18,309
be sympathetic with people.

937
01:05:18,354 --> 01:05:21,355
I mean, everybody has to deal with
bad stuff in their own way, you know.

938
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,397
What?

939
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:31,943
Whenever you guys say that people
deal with stuff in their own way...

940
01:05:31,993 --> 01:05:34,364
it means that you don't
deal with it at all.

941
01:05:34,454 --> 01:05:36,945
We deal with it.
We make the meals...

942
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:41,826
and we clean up the messes
and we listen while you guys...

943
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:46,333
talk about how you're gonna
deal with stuff in your own way.

944
01:05:46,383 --> 01:05:50,631
Well, what way is that, Jordan?
Hmm? What way is that?

945
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,637
What way?

946
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:55,220
See? No way.

947
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:57,717
- And what the fuck are you looking at?
- Hey, hey.

948
01:05:57,811 --> 01:05:59,720
- Huh?
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

949
01:05:59,814 --> 01:06:02,686
- No, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
- What's the matter with you?

950
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:05,267
Well, you know what
I think is rude?

951
01:06:05,363 --> 01:06:07,319
- I think it's rude...
- Hey, stop it. I'm trying to talk.

952
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:10,151
- When Little Miss Delta-Delta-Delta
over here... - Stop it. Stop it!

953
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,655
- Is trying to pick up on my boyfriend...
- Stop it. Stop it.

954
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,029
- In front of my face.
- Why don't you just lay off of her?

955
01:06:15,122 --> 01:06:17,162
- Your sister's losing her mind.
- Do you think I look invisible?

956
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,413
I am not losing my mind!

957
01:06:19,502 --> 01:06:22,917
I am not losing my mind!
I am just tired, Jordan.

958
01:06:23,005 --> 01:06:26,042
- I am tired. I am tired.
- Ellen, let's go.

959
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:28,092
Being my mother is very tiring.

960
01:06:28,178 --> 01:06:30,504
Oh, come on. There's nobody more
different than your mother than you.

961
01:06:30,555 --> 01:06:33,129
- Come on. Let's go.
- That is the stupidest thing that you have ever said.

962
01:06:33,225 --> 01:06:35,596
- Okay. Great.
- That's the stupidest thing you've ever said.

963
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:55,281
Oh, God.

964
01:06:56,666 --> 01:07:00,746
- Ellie.
- Yeah.

965
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:07,217
- You all right?
- Yeah, I just have a headache.

966
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,297
- What happened to Jordan? I heard Brian go upstairs...
- Yeah, yeah.

967
01:07:10,389 --> 01:07:13,424
He has to go to work tomorrow,
so he just took the train back.

968
01:07:13,517 --> 01:07:16,222
Hmm. You sure you're all right?

969
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,939
How do you do this...

970
01:07:19,023 --> 01:07:22,143
every day, all day in this house...

971
01:07:22,236 --> 01:07:25,735
and no one notices?

972
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,774
Doesn't that drive you crazy?

973
01:07:30,118 --> 01:07:33,570
But this is my family, Ellie.

974
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:36,077
These are the people I love.

975
01:07:38,294 --> 01:07:41,579
Maybe it's time for you to start
thinking about going back to New York.

976
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:44,584
Maybe you should go back
to the city...

977
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:49,342
to your work and your writing and
all those things that you like to do.

978
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:53,808
That's what's important, sweetie.

979
01:07:56,813 --> 01:07:59,304
You know, we can get somebody
to help out around here. That's not...

980
01:08:03,237 --> 01:08:07,614
But you did a great job tonight.
You should be proud of yourself.

981
01:08:07,658 --> 01:08:09,614
Night-night, sweetheart.

982
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:15,501
Good night.

983
01:08:38,524 --> 01:08:40,601
Hello.

984
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:42,686
Mr. Tweedy, hi.

985
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:46,195
A press conference? Where?

986
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:51,118
The next train
is not till 5:00. Shit.

987
01:08:51,204 --> 01:08:53,244
- Then Casey...
- No, don't send Casey. I'll be there.

988
01:09:06,221 --> 01:09:08,178
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

989
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:20,686
Excuse me. No.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

990
01:09:20,735 --> 01:09:23,061
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

991
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:47,218
Too late is unacceptable.
You said you'd get the story.

992
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:49,256
And I will.
I'll find him.

993
01:09:49,306 --> 01:09:51,597
Look, I've got a contact at Sullivan's
office. He's getting on a plane at 9:00.

994
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:54,223
No, no, no. I've worked
on this thing for three months.

995
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,892
- He's staying at the Plaza Athene. I can check it out.
- Anyone can figure that out.

996
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,941
No, I will meet him there. I'll meet
him at the Plaza Athene before he leaves.

997
01:10:00,027 --> 01:10:02,150
This is my story,
goddamn it!

998
01:10:02,237 --> 01:10:04,528
This is my story.

999
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:18,754
Good night, sir.

1000
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,137
Taxi!

1001
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:47,490
Hey, don't I know you?

1002
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:50,364
- I don't think so.
- Yes, we went to Harvard together.

1003
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,698
Ellen Gulden.
You were a couple of years ahead of me.

1004
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:57,501
I wrote for the women's magazine,
Peeved Eves.

1005
01:10:57,547 --> 01:11:01,794
I remember Peeved Eves.

1006
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:05,508
- Well, it's nice to see you.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to see you too.

1007
01:11:05,597 --> 01:11:09,215
Got to get to J.F. K in time
for the last commuter shuttle.

1008
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:12,429
It's my daughter's
birthday today.

1009
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,807
If you're going to J.F. K,
I can give you a lift.

1010
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:21,812
I moved to Seattle a couple of months
ago to get away from all the cameras...

1011
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:25,529
my ex-wife and my ex-kids.

1012
01:11:25,617 --> 01:11:29,283
Yeah, you know, I think I saw something
about that on television.

1013
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:33,286
- How horrible.
- You know what's strange?

1014
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:35,783
- One minute you're in school and the
next minute you look up... - Mm-hmm.

1015
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:37,788
And your life's all turned around
and screwed up.

1016
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,542
- Yes, I know. Yeah.
- You try and you try to get ahead.

1017
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:45,341
Somewhere in it all you just...

1018
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:48,059
You lose yourself.

1019
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:50,051
- And you never know when
it's gonna come. - Mm-hmm.

1020
01:11:50,143 --> 01:11:54,272
Comes out of nowhere.
Bang. It's just...

1021
01:11:54,357 --> 01:11:56,765
- Your life is a disaster.
- Yep.

1022
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:58,935
Oh, I just hope I can make it up
to my wife and kids.

1023
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:01,067
You know, that's all that counts.
That's all that counts.

1024
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:03,064
Yeah, you're right.

1025
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:07,570
They're the ones who love you.
That's what counts.

1026
01:12:16,214 --> 01:12:19,583
I'm reading, Mom.
And baby cows are calves.

1027
01:12:23,262 --> 01:12:25,967
You're right.

1028
01:12:47,705 --> 01:12:50,112
G.A. Tweedy here.
Leave a message after the noise.

1029
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:53,411
Mr. Tweedy, it's Ellen.

1030
01:12:53,462 --> 01:12:55,418
Uh...

1031
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:59,794
Listen, I waited
for Sullivan...

1032
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:03,793
outside of his hotel,
and, uh...

1033
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:07,631
Well, he never showed.

1034
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,816
Damn.

1035
01:13:15,108 --> 01:13:18,145
Here we go.

1036
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:26,783
They're several reasons why I asked you
here today, one of which...

1037
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:29,368
- Hi, John. Peter.
- George.

1038
01:13:31,252 --> 01:13:35,165
One of which is to ask you...

1039
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,504
why you were
so hostile with me...

1040
01:13:40,594 --> 01:13:42,504
at Thanksgiving.

1041
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:47,093
I know this is not
the best situation for any of us.

1042
01:13:47,184 --> 01:13:51,347
But I'm trying, Ellen.
I'm trying to be patient.

1043
01:13:58,864 --> 01:14:03,360
I have some questions
that I'd like to discuss with you.

1044
01:14:03,451 --> 01:14:06,868
- I don't think I want to talk about the interview.
- I do.

1045
01:14:10,334 --> 01:14:12,243
Okay, Ellen.

1046
01:14:12,336 --> 01:14:16,203
How come Mom waited so long?

1047
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:19,335
Why didn't she go
to the doctor sooner?

1048
01:14:19,385 --> 01:14:24,048
- What are you talking about?
- Was it because you didn't want your world disrupted?

1049
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:28,090
Because you needed her
to keep your life running smoothly?

1050
01:14:28,186 --> 01:14:30,096
Like you need me now?

1051
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:32,431
- What the hell are you doing?
- Because she can't do it all?

1052
01:14:32,525 --> 01:14:37,316
Well, do you have any idea
what it takes to keep your life...

1053
01:14:37,404 --> 01:14:40,156
- running so smoothly?
- Ellen, have you lost your mind?

1054
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,657
- Maybe.
- Keep your voice down.

1055
01:14:43,744 --> 01:14:46,365
- This is inappropriate.
- It is appropriate!

1056
01:14:46,414 --> 01:14:50,494
Everything at our house has changed,
but you don't know about it.

1057
01:14:50,585 --> 01:14:54,169
Because you're behaving
as though life goes on as usual.

1058
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:57,874
Well, life as we know it is done!
This is real life!

1059
01:14:57,927 --> 01:15:00,678
Fuck fiction!

1060
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,671
Less is not more!

1061
01:15:05,309 --> 01:15:08,014
You have taken sabbaticals
for the great American novel.

1062
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,013
Why not one for Mom?

1063
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:13,937
Why won't you participate
in the most important thing...

1064
01:15:13,984 --> 01:15:16,606
that has happened in your life?

1065
01:15:16,696 --> 01:15:19,366
She needs you.

1066
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:23,114
Why is it always more important
for you to hear...

1067
01:15:23,203 --> 01:15:26,120
what some writer has to say
than me?

1068
01:15:27,915 --> 01:15:29,993
And Brian?

1069
01:15:32,964 --> 01:15:35,169
Hey.

1070
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:44,138
Hey, what other tricks do you use
besides your fucking apples...

1071
01:15:44,225 --> 01:15:48,058
to get your writing juices
flowing, Dad?

1072
01:15:48,146 --> 01:15:50,222
Cheating on Mom, is that one?

1073
01:15:50,315 --> 01:15:54,265
I will hire a full-time nurse.
You are going back to New York.

1074
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,691
What other tricks?

1075
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:04,280
Several people have mentioned...

1076
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:08,115
a heated argument that you had
with your father...

1077
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:11,417
outside the campus cafe.

1078
01:16:11,505 --> 01:16:15,965
It was shortly
after Thanksgiving.

1079
01:16:16,008 --> 01:16:17,966
Do you recall the incident?

1080
01:16:19,346 --> 01:16:23,046
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I remember.

1081
01:16:26,937 --> 01:16:31,315
It was a stressful time...

1082
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:35,404
and there was a lot to do
and it was hard.

1083
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:37,980
So, there was no problem
between you and your father?

1084
01:16:38,032 --> 01:16:40,570
No.

1085
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:43,282
Or your father
and your mother?

1086
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:46,538
My mother and my father?

1087
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:49,910
Of course not.
It was a busy time.

1088
01:16:50,003 --> 01:16:52,790
I mean, I was
a full-fledged Minnie.

1089
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,709
I remember we were making
the, uh, ornaments...

1090
01:16:57,803 --> 01:16:59,878
the craft ornaments
with the feathers and the sequins...

1091
01:16:59,973 --> 01:17:03,306
for my mother's
Christmas tree in the square.

1092
01:17:03,392 --> 01:17:05,884
And, uh, I would climb
up the ladder...

1093
01:17:05,979 --> 01:17:08,649
and she would tell me
where to put them.

1094
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:11,057
So, it was fun.

1095
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:14,978
It was a lot of fun.

1096
01:17:21,161 --> 01:17:24,246
Yeah, it's really not that bad.

1097
01:17:24,331 --> 01:17:26,324
Yeah, it's okay.

1098
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:29,951
You know, I always used to try
to get you to go see Santa.

1099
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:33,083
For years and years.
And then when you were 8 years old...

1100
01:17:33,175 --> 01:17:37,836
you got in line and you went to
the very front, pulled his beard off...

1101
01:17:37,928 --> 01:17:40,930
- Pulled his beard off.
- And yelled, "Fraud!"

1102
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:45,179
Your dad was so proud of you.

1103
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,559
Well, guess what?

1104
01:17:50,942 --> 01:17:54,988
- I'm getting in the line. Yes.
- Oh, now you want to.

1105
01:18:00,036 --> 01:18:03,701
- Uh-huh.
- Good girl. Go on. Be good.

1106
01:18:07,002 --> 01:18:10,584
- Ellen Gulden.
- Hello.

1107
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:12,588
- Hi.
- I know what you want:

1108
01:18:12,632 --> 01:18:15,751
A new computer
and Diane Sawyer's job.

1109
01:18:15,802 --> 01:18:20,300
I'm here, okay?
Okay, here we go.

1110
01:18:24,478 --> 01:18:27,479
Nothing for me, Mayor.

1111
01:18:27,565 --> 01:18:31,813
Santa.

1112
01:18:31,861 --> 01:18:35,645
I guess maybe it is for me.

1113
01:18:37,158 --> 01:18:40,492
I really... l...

1114
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,035
Mom!

1115
01:18:48,129 --> 01:18:50,620
Mom!

1116
01:18:50,672 --> 01:18:53,590
Excuse me, is there
a phone that I can use?

1117
01:18:53,676 --> 01:18:55,586
Sure.

1118
01:18:55,678 --> 01:18:58,004
This line right here.
Press nine to get out.

1119
01:19:02,226 --> 01:19:06,520
Answer the phone, Dad.

1120
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:00,570
Ellen?

1121
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:06,661
Mom's in the hospital.

1122
01:20:06,753 --> 01:20:12,258
The cancer has progressed
much more quickly than we had expected.

1123
01:20:12,343 --> 01:20:15,593
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
to stop the chemotherapy.

1124
01:20:21,352 --> 01:20:25,599
Uh, you know what? Um, I'm not
ready to stop the chemotherapy.

1125
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:28,062
I'm afraid there's
no more we can do.

1126
01:20:28,108 --> 01:20:31,526
We all need now to focus...

1127
01:20:31,614 --> 01:20:34,070
on helping her through
this next part.

1128
01:20:34,116 --> 01:20:36,073
I'm putting her on morphine.

1129
01:20:36,118 --> 01:20:39,902
You'll need to give her
one tablet twice a day for the pain.

1130
01:20:39,955 --> 01:20:43,491
They shouldn't be chewed or crushed
because they might become toxic.

1131
01:20:45,462 --> 01:20:50,040
I am sorry.
I'll get you the prescription.

1132
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:07,639
So, what do you think of the wheels?

1133
01:21:07,735 --> 01:21:10,024
Oh, they look wonderful.

1134
01:21:10,113 --> 01:21:12,485
- You like 'em?
- Oh, gosh, it's like what we used to do...

1135
01:21:12,573 --> 01:21:15,658
- to the bikes when you were kids.
- Uh-huh.

1136
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:17,652
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, Brian.

1137
01:21:17,744 --> 01:21:19,654
You do.

1138
01:21:19,748 --> 01:21:22,452
- No coat?
- No, I don't need one. I'm layered, honey.

1139
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,418
I just wanna show off
my new sweater.

1140
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,374
Oh, I love Christmas!

1141
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:30,837
I love it.

1142
01:21:30,925 --> 01:21:33,252
- Hey!
- Hey, folks! Merry Christmas.

1143
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:35,421
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi!

1144
01:21:37,474 --> 01:21:41,721
- Oh, everybody's out tonight.
- Are we late?

1145
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:45,396
They should shovel that, you know. They
should shovel that more carefully than that.

1146
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,522
- Well, honey, you should do it. Hey!
- Hey, you guys!

1147
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,603
- Merry Christmas.
- Hello.

1148
01:21:49,695 --> 01:21:52,780
June Fortier.

1149
01:21:55,326 --> 01:21:57,367
Get up here, you.

1150
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,531
Clarice Mitchell.

1151
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:05,164
- There she is.
- Oh, great!

1152
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,204
- Hi, Kate. How are you?
- Hi, Ellen. How are you?

1153
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:10,797
- Hi, Brian, George. Kate.
- Melissa Jamison.

1154
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,877
Well, you just look wonderful.
You look wonderful.

1155
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:15,051
- Well, thanks. Don't go get mushy on me.
- I just love the sweater.

1156
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:18,343
- Oh, thanks.
- Evelyn Best.

1157
01:22:23,566 --> 01:22:26,235
Kate Gulden.

1158
01:22:47,758 --> 01:22:49,382
And Ellen Gulden.

1159
01:22:49,426 --> 01:22:51,834
We see you, Ellen.
You can't hide. Come on.

1160
01:22:51,928 --> 01:22:54,633
- We need all the Minnies up here.
- Come on, now.

1161
01:23:01,647 --> 01:23:05,181
And now for the moment
we have all been waiting for.

1162
01:23:05,276 --> 01:23:07,517
Happy holidays, Langhorne!

1163
01:23:14,077 --> 01:23:18,905
Silent night

1164
01:23:18,956 --> 01:23:23,952
Holy night

1165
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:28,672
All is calm

1166
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:33,966
All is bright

1167
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:38,933
Round yon virgin

1168
01:23:38,979 --> 01:23:43,806
Mother and child

1169
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,981
Holy infant

1170
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:53,410
So tender and mild

1171
01:23:53,494 --> 01:23:56,696
Sleep in

1172
01:23:56,788 --> 01:23:59,660
Heavenly

1173
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:04,205
Peace

1174
01:24:04,297 --> 01:24:06,835
Sleep in

1175
01:24:06,883 --> 01:24:11,842
Heavenly peace

1176
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:19,345
Silent night

1177
01:24:19,437 --> 01:24:24,349
Holy night

1178
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:29,651
Shepherds quake

1179
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:34,196
At the sight

1180
01:24:34,288 --> 01:24:39,328
Glories stream

1181
01:24:39,376 --> 01:24:44,749
From heaven afar

1182
01:24:44,839 --> 01:24:48,672
Heavenly hosts

1183
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:54,639
Sing alleluia

1184
01:24:54,726 --> 01:24:59,223
Christ the Savior

1185
01:24:59,314 --> 01:25:04,818
Is born

1186
01:25:04,903 --> 01:25:09,232
Christ the Savior

1187
01:25:09,281 --> 01:25:13,327
Is born

1188
01:25:22,756 --> 01:25:24,878
Having trouble juggling everything.

1189
01:25:24,924 --> 01:25:27,213
Gee, I haven't dropped one yet.

1190
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,922
I couldn't help it. It was a reflex.

1191
01:25:36,019 --> 01:25:38,344
Oh, here...

1192
01:25:38,438 --> 01:25:40,763
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, my God!

1193
01:25:40,815 --> 01:25:43,602
- Whoa!
- Hi.

1194
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:48,944
- Nice hat.
- Oh, thank you.

1195
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:51,524
- You didn't tell your mom?
- How could I tell her?

1196
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:53,826
She's never known
about my dad's little flings.

1197
01:25:53,913 --> 01:25:57,959
God, he's still doing it, you know?
He's got this friend...

1198
01:25:58,043 --> 01:26:01,956
this fucking Harold guy,
who calls and makes excuses for him.

1199
01:26:02,047 --> 01:26:05,131
And this woman, she dropped him off
right in front of the house.

1200
01:26:05,175 --> 01:26:08,923
- God!
- Oh, God. Why won't he answer?

1201
01:26:08,969 --> 01:26:12,422
This is the third time
I've tried to call him today.

1202
01:26:12,474 --> 01:26:14,432
The red and gold one is ours.

1203
01:26:15,853 --> 01:26:19,720
- Oh. Hey, it's beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

1204
01:26:19,816 --> 01:26:23,101
My mom says with a tree that size,
the key is "gaudy."

1205
01:26:23,153 --> 01:26:27,281
- More is more.
- What are you doing? Ellen, don't call him again.

1206
01:26:27,324 --> 01:26:29,648
I don't want him to worry.

1207
01:26:29,743 --> 01:26:32,494
He's still really upset about
Thanksgiving and I think that...

1208
01:26:32,536 --> 01:26:34,993
he was afraid to come
and visit me for the holidays.

1209
01:26:35,081 --> 01:26:37,619
- Oh, please!
- No, I'm serious.

1210
01:26:37,667 --> 01:26:41,417
- I was really, really hard on him.
- Ellen!

1211
01:26:41,505 --> 01:26:46,418
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Jordan there?

1212
01:26:46,511 --> 01:26:49,631
Yeah, he's paying for the Chinese food.
Do you wanna hold on?

1213
01:26:49,681 --> 01:26:52,598
No, that's okay.

1214
01:26:55,019 --> 01:26:58,852
Some girl answered and said
that he was paying...

1215
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,024
the Chinese delivery guy.

1216
01:27:02,068 --> 01:27:04,476
Okay, uh, Chinese food at home.

1217
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:08,029
- It's New Year's.
- Shit!

1218
01:27:08,075 --> 01:27:11,908
- Shit!
- Shit! Don't call him again.

1219
01:27:11,996 --> 01:27:14,997
EI!

1220
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:18,291
Come on, Jordan,
just pick up the phone.

1221
01:27:18,377 --> 01:27:20,286
- Answer.
- Hi. This is...

1222
01:27:20,379 --> 01:27:23,546
- Oh, puts the answering machine on.
- Okay, good, then hang up.

1223
01:27:23,634 --> 01:27:28,212
Hi, Jordan. It's me. Just calling...

1224
01:27:28,262 --> 01:27:31,299
to say happy New Year's
and to tell you that...

1225
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:34,394
I've really been thinking
about what you said...

1226
01:27:34,437 --> 01:27:36,725
about how we needed to talk
about our plans.

1227
01:27:36,773 --> 01:27:40,106
And yeah, we do need to talk.

1228
01:27:40,193 --> 01:27:43,193
I just...

1229
01:27:43,237 --> 01:27:46,108
I- I wanna talk.

1230
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:48,072
And, uh...

1231
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:54,036
if you get a chance,
uh, call me.

1232
01:27:54,082 --> 01:27:57,366
Okay?

1233
01:27:57,418 --> 01:28:02,296
And I really hope that
you have a happy New Year.

1234
01:28:02,383 --> 01:28:04,589
Okay.

1235
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:10,839
Sorry.

1236
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:21,604
Is everybody ready?

1237
01:28:21,652 --> 01:28:25,948
Uh, would you... Kate? Darling?

1238
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:27,942
- Here we go.
- With what?

1239
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:30,193
- It's almost time for the big moment.
- New Year's resolutions.

1240
01:28:30,287 --> 01:28:32,659
- Okay.
- Another great Gulden family tradition.

1241
01:28:32,748 --> 01:28:35,453
Can't dwell on the negative.
Gotta talk about all the great things...

1242
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:38,116
- that we're gonna accomplish next year.
- Ellen.

1243
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:41,379
- Please.
- Wouldn't it be a lot easier if we could just admit...

1244
01:28:41,465 --> 01:28:44,501
to our failures,
the things that we fucked up on.

1245
01:28:44,594 --> 01:28:47,264
- Ellen, would you not use that word in the house, please?
- Sorry.

1246
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:49,049
Used the "F" word.

1247
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:52,557
Failure isn't allowed
in the Gulden house.

1248
01:28:52,644 --> 01:28:54,970
You know, maybe-maybe
we should break tradition this year.

1249
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:58,064
And since I've got a hell of
a good list of failures, I'll start.

1250
01:28:58,149 --> 01:29:01,104
- I think it's not a good idea. - No, no.
Come on. Come on. - I don't think so either.

1251
01:29:01,154 --> 01:29:03,312
- I'd like to. Yeah, I'd like to.
- You'd like to.

1252
01:29:03,406 --> 01:29:05,896
Uh, lost my desk
at the magazine.

1253
01:29:05,992 --> 01:29:08,908
Uh, really fucked up
the Sullivan interview.

1254
01:29:08,994 --> 01:29:12,945
- I'm not gonna get that job back. And by the look of things...
- The Sullivan interview?

1255
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:15,371
- Have, uh, really ruined...
- What are you talking about? Why didn't you say something?

1256
01:29:15,459 --> 01:29:18,497
My relationship
with my boyfriend, so...

1257
01:29:18,588 --> 01:29:22,253
- There we go. Happy New Year.
- I failed my English class last semester...

1258
01:29:22,342 --> 01:29:26,886
I'm on academic probation,
and I got kicked off the tennis team.

1259
01:29:26,972 --> 01:29:28,881
- Happy New Year.
- Jesus Christ, Brian.

1260
01:29:28,974 --> 01:29:31,761
- I could get a tutor. I could help you.
- What's this?

1261
01:29:31,852 --> 01:29:34,343
Mom, I got a job at
the Cambridge Racquet Club.

1262
01:29:34,396 --> 01:29:36,520
- Oh.
- And I don't wanna go back to school.

1263
01:29:36,607 --> 01:29:40,556
You got a job? That's great.

1264
01:29:40,653 --> 01:29:43,061
- Isn't it?
- Ten, nine, eight, seven...

1265
01:29:43,155 --> 01:29:46,774
- You like it?
- Yeah, I love it.

1266
01:29:46,868 --> 01:29:48,945
- That's wonderful. That's what you should do then.
- Six, five, four, three...

1267
01:29:49,037 --> 01:29:53,332
- Good God, you only live once.
- Two, one... and we're into 1988!

1268
01:30:01,967 --> 01:30:05,716
The holidays seemed to take
a lot out of my mother.

1269
01:30:05,805 --> 01:30:09,968
It was right after New Year's when
her health really started to decline.

1270
01:30:10,058 --> 01:30:12,812
And this guy in my class
was going on and on...

1271
01:30:12,897 --> 01:30:15,897
about how selfish
she was and how...

1272
01:30:15,982 --> 01:30:18,189
of course, she would leave.

1273
01:30:18,235 --> 01:30:21,105
So my professor, who's a woman, said...

1274
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:23,522
"Anna Karenina would have left
her husband for her lover...

1275
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:25,863
"but would never
have left her son.

1276
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:29,824
And had Tolstoy been a woman,
he would've understood that."

1277
01:30:29,913 --> 01:30:34,077
- What do you think of that?
- I haven't been reading Anna Karenina.

1278
01:30:34,126 --> 01:30:36,832
No more whipping. That's enough.
Just drain the cherries.

1279
01:30:36,921 --> 01:30:39,591
You have two hours
till Brian leaves.

1280
01:30:39,633 --> 01:30:43,251
You know I wanna have his pie
ready for him when he goes.

1281
01:30:43,303 --> 01:30:45,260
I think the crust
is probably ready too.

1282
01:30:45,305 --> 01:30:48,259
- You better check that.
- It should probably bake a little longer, but I can...

1283
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:51,055
I can't read anything anyway.

1284
01:30:51,103 --> 01:30:53,179
My eyesight's gone
like an old lady. Let me see.

1285
01:30:55,941 --> 01:30:59,774
- Uh, I don't think...
- Let me see. Let me...

1286
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:03,445
Goddamn it!
I hate this stupid chair.

1287
01:31:03,533 --> 01:31:05,989
I hate it. I hate it.
I wish I could...

1288
01:31:06,078 --> 01:31:10,620
just roll it down the street right
through Evelyn Best's front window.

1289
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:12,623
She pet me like a cat at Christmas.
Did you see that?

1290
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:16,160
Don't-Don't do that. Just leave it.
Get-Get another pie plate.

1291
01:31:16,255 --> 01:31:19,041
There's another one
over in the left-hand cubby.

1292
01:31:19,133 --> 01:31:21,209
Have time to make another.

1293
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:23,459
- Left, left-hand cubby.
- No, actually.

1294
01:31:23,553 --> 01:31:28,844
I put them in here. And you know, Mom,
there's handicap access everywhere.

1295
01:31:28,935 --> 01:31:30,844
I am not handicapped!

1296
01:31:30,937 --> 01:31:33,688
- Oh, God, I'm not!
- What are you doing?

1297
01:31:33,773 --> 01:31:36,146
- I am not an invalid!
- Stop that!

1298
01:31:36,193 --> 01:31:39,396
I am not! I am not!
It's my house, you know.

1299
01:31:39,487 --> 01:31:42,654
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm still a mother.

1300
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:46,994
Still a mother here.

1301
01:31:48,998 --> 01:31:51,915
Mom, I know that.

1302
01:32:13,232 --> 01:32:16,067
- Hello.
- Ellen, I'm going to be working late tonight.

1303
01:32:16,151 --> 01:32:19,401
- Sorry I didn't make it home for supper.
- Mm-hmm.

1304
01:32:19,487 --> 01:32:21,396
I'll get there as soon as I can.

1305
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:24,658
Yeah, I'm sure you will, Dad.

1306
01:32:24,703 --> 01:32:28,238
- Who was that?
- It was your husband.

1307
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:32,198
Seems he's working late again.

1308
01:32:32,252 --> 01:32:36,415
Well, it's a tough job
running that whole department.

1309
01:32:36,506 --> 01:32:41,215
- Not that tough.
- Whatever you're doing, stop and come here.

1310
01:32:42,262 --> 01:32:44,717
Right now!

1311
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,687
- Yeah?
- What has happened...

1312
01:32:52,732 --> 01:32:56,231
- between you and your father?
- What do you mean?

1313
01:32:56,318 --> 01:32:58,940
You've been so angry at him
ever since you came home.

1314
01:33:01,282 --> 01:33:04,154
I don't know. I mean,
there's some stuff that...

1315
01:33:04,244 --> 01:33:06,485
I mean, it doesn't have
anything to do with you.

1316
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:09,035
- Pretty soon he's all you'll have, you know.
- Please, Mom, stop.

1317
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:11,074
No.
You stop.

1318
01:33:11,126 --> 01:33:13,084
He's gonna need you.
You're gonna need each other.

1319
01:33:13,128 --> 01:33:16,830
My God, you used to be so close.
What... The two of you are so alike.

1320
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:20,625
- Please don't say that.
- Why?

1321
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:23,092
Because he's not perfect?
Because he's not the man...

1322
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:26,182
you thought he was?

1323
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:31,938
No, l... No, I can't...
I can't talk about this with you.

1324
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,858
- Come back here. Come on. I want you to sit down here.
- I can't.

1325
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:37,269
I want...
I want to talk to you. You sit there.

1326
01:33:44,328 --> 01:33:46,367
Now you listen to me because
I'm only going to say this once...

1327
01:33:46,456 --> 01:33:51,082
and I probably
shouldn't say it at all.

1328
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:54,662
There is nothing that you know
about your father that I don't know.

1329
01:33:54,756 --> 01:33:58,255
Nothing.

1330
01:33:58,301 --> 01:34:00,792
And understand better.

1331
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:03,805
Okay?

1332
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:07,259
You make concessions
when you're married a long time...

1333
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:11,260
that you don't believe you'll make
when you're beginning.

1334
01:34:11,315 --> 01:34:14,151
When you're young, you say,
"Oh, I'll never tolerate...

1335
01:34:14,194 --> 01:34:16,519
this or that or the other thing."

1336
01:34:16,613 --> 01:34:18,521
But time goes by, darling.

1337
01:34:18,614 --> 01:34:21,319
And when you've slept together
a thousand nights...

1338
01:34:21,367 --> 01:34:24,866
and you've smelled like spit-up
from the babies when they're sick...

1339
01:34:24,954 --> 01:34:27,790
and you've seen your body
droop and get soft...

1340
01:34:27,832 --> 01:34:31,782
and some nights you just think, "Oh, God,
I'm not gonna put up with it another minute."

1341
01:34:31,836 --> 01:34:34,374
But you wake up
in the next morning...

1342
01:34:34,463 --> 01:34:36,504
and the kitchen smells
like coffee...

1343
01:34:36,592 --> 01:34:39,214
and the kids have their hair brushed
all by themselves...

1344
01:34:39,303 --> 01:34:41,510
and you look at your husband,
and no...

1345
01:34:41,597 --> 01:34:46,473
he's not the person
you thought he was.

1346
01:34:46,519 --> 01:34:48,428
But he's your life.

1347
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:53,860
And the kids and the house and everything
that you do is built around him.

1348
01:34:53,943 --> 01:34:55,983
And that's your life.
That's your history too.

1349
01:34:56,029 --> 01:35:00,026
And if you take him out, that's like
cutting his face out of all the pictures.

1350
01:35:00,116 --> 01:35:05,492
It just makes a big hole
and it ruins everything.

1351
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:07,497
You can be hard, Ellen.

1352
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,411
And you can be very judgmental.

1353
01:35:11,504 --> 01:35:14,707
And with those two things alone you're
gonna make such a mess out of your life...

1354
01:35:14,758 --> 01:35:18,293
you wouldn't believe, and I wanna be able
to tell you these things in ten years.

1355
01:35:18,386 --> 01:35:22,300
And when I think how most of what you
learned so far came from your dad...

1356
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:25,806
- it just hurts my heart to think how little...
- No. No.

1357
01:35:25,894 --> 01:35:28,220
- I have gotten done.
- Mom, don't, um...

1358
01:35:28,272 --> 01:35:30,312
- Yes, yes.
- Just, let's not talk about that. Can we...

1359
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:33,234
I wanna talk. You let me talk.
Now, look. Let me talk.

1360
01:35:33,318 --> 01:35:36,236
You're dad won't let me talk
because he says I'll upset myself.

1361
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,896
And you won't let me talk.
"Oh, Mom, please don't talk."

1362
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:41,488
Brian's the only one that let's me talk.
He's never here.

1363
01:35:41,578 --> 01:35:43,486
I wanna talk before I die.

1364
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:45,821
I do. I wanna be able
to say the things...

1365
01:35:45,915 --> 01:35:49,248
- I wanna say the deep thoughts... without you shushing me...
- Okay. Okay. What?

1366
01:35:49,335 --> 01:35:53,416
- Because what I say hurts you.
- Oh, Mom.

1367
01:35:53,465 --> 01:35:55,838
Tired of being shushed.

1368
01:35:55,926 --> 01:35:59,093
What do you wanna say?

1369
01:36:01,097 --> 01:36:05,226
I already said everything
I wanna say.

1370
01:36:05,269 --> 01:36:07,760
Except I'm sad.

1371
01:36:12,276 --> 01:36:16,606
- Why?
- I'm sad that I won't be able to plan your wedding.

1372
01:36:16,697 --> 01:36:18,737
So promise me that you won't have
a ring bearer...

1373
01:36:18,783 --> 01:36:21,453
or a flower girl, because those kids
always just misbehave...

1374
01:36:21,536 --> 01:36:25,404
and then they distract
from the bride.

1375
01:36:25,457 --> 01:36:27,784
And don't invite too many people.

1376
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:33,590
- Well, you know, I might not even get married, so...
- Whatever.

1377
01:36:35,175 --> 01:36:39,553
If I knew that you would be happy,
I would close my eyes now.

1378
01:36:39,639 --> 01:36:42,094
I would.

1379
01:36:42,142 --> 01:36:44,714
It's so much easier
to be happy, my love.

1380
01:36:44,811 --> 01:36:47,895
It's so much easier
to choose to love...

1381
01:36:47,981 --> 01:36:51,148
the things that you have.

1382
01:36:51,235 --> 01:36:53,228
And you have so much...

1383
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:56,405
instead of always yearning
for what you're missing...

1384
01:36:56,490 --> 01:37:01,199
or what it is that
you're imagining you're missing.

1385
01:37:01,286 --> 01:37:05,071
It is so much more peaceful.

1386
01:37:09,628 --> 01:37:13,627
Thank you. That's very nice.
You're-You're too kind. Stay that way.

1387
01:37:13,675 --> 01:37:18,254
You know what it is?
I found out today it takes six months...

1388
01:37:22,351 --> 01:37:24,639
What time is it?

1389
01:37:26,689 --> 01:37:31,018
I can't see the clock.
What time is it?

1390
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:35,322
- It's 11:35. Uh-uh.
- Did Harold call yet?

1391
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:41,032
Ellie, I need you to go get your father
and bring him home.

1392
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,368
Where?

1393
01:38:03,561 --> 01:38:07,642
Can I get another beer?

1394
01:38:07,732 --> 01:38:10,058
Okay. Yeah.

1395
01:38:33,843 --> 01:38:36,761
Dad?

1396
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:46,352
Tsk. Who's that?

1397
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:57,066
Tsk. You weren't supposed
to see this.

1398
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:02,529
You shouldn't have, uh...

1399
01:39:07,796 --> 01:39:10,002
I, uh... l...

1400
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:17,388
He didn't, uh... I mean,
he didn't even remember my book.

1401
01:39:18,641 --> 01:39:21,642
Didn't even remember it.

1402
01:39:21,727 --> 01:39:25,476
The narcissistic
son-of-a-bitch.

1403
01:39:25,564 --> 01:39:28,139
Thinks just 'cause he teaches
at Harvard, right?

1404
01:39:31,655 --> 01:39:35,154
He didn't even remember it.

1405
01:39:36,826 --> 01:39:41,987
- Let's go home. Mom's waiting.
- Ellen...

1406
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:45,332
the first time
I saw your mother...

1407
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:52,003
she was so filled with light.

1408
01:39:55,931 --> 01:39:58,302
She lit up everything
around her.

1409
01:40:03,104 --> 01:40:06,271
Even me.

1410
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:15,363
I just can't imagine
the light going out.

1411
01:40:21,207 --> 01:40:24,244
I can't imagine it.

1412
01:40:26,212 --> 01:40:30,922
- I think it's time to go home. Come on.
- Let me get...

1413
01:40:34,388 --> 01:40:36,594
Okay. Yeah.

1414
01:40:39,392 --> 01:40:41,635
Okay.

1415
01:40:56,077 --> 01:40:59,031
Harold?

1416
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:02,864
Ellen. L-l-
I was gonna bring him, but...

1417
01:41:02,917 --> 01:41:05,409
I was just gonna call.

1418
01:41:05,463 --> 01:41:08,416
Here. Let me. Let me.

1419
01:41:34,409 --> 01:41:39,119
Ice-cream monster.

1420
01:41:39,165 --> 01:41:42,119
- The ice-cream monster!
- The ice-cream monster!

1421
01:41:42,168 --> 01:41:44,659
Good day.

1422
01:42:25,546 --> 01:42:28,797
Your brother was back
at his new job in Cambridge...

1423
01:42:28,843 --> 01:42:33,256
and your father was back
full time at the college.

1424
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:35,257
Right.

1425
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:39,393
So, you were responsible
for giving her her medicine?

1426
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:41,887
Yeah.

1427
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:55,150
Teresa! Teresa!

1428
01:42:57,039 --> 01:42:59,495
Teresa!

1429
01:43:06,174 --> 01:43:10,551
Mom! The nurse isn't here.
It's me. Are you okay?

1430
01:43:10,595 --> 01:43:13,086
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Well, do you need me to get you...

1431
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:15,552
I said I'm fine.

1432
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:31,231
I need you to help me.

1433
01:43:31,326 --> 01:43:34,077
I can't get up.

1434
01:43:34,119 --> 01:43:36,326
Oh, God!

1435
01:43:36,414 --> 01:43:40,032
Okay.

1436
01:43:40,084 --> 01:43:43,002
Okay, come on.

1437
01:43:43,087 --> 01:43:45,958
Put your arm around me.
Up. Ready?

1438
01:43:46,049 --> 01:43:48,338
Ready?

1439
01:43:48,427 --> 01:43:51,594
Okay, lift. Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around me.

1440
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:53,928
Good.

1441
01:43:56,268 --> 01:44:00,597
Good. Okay, good.
Here we go. Here we go.

1442
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:02,682
Okay.

1443
01:44:02,774 --> 01:44:04,850
Okay.

1444
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:10,649
Okay.

1445
01:44:10,741 --> 01:44:12,651
I need a pill, Ellie.

1446
01:44:12,744 --> 01:44:17,407
It's not time yet. Can you wait?

1447
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:21,242
No.

1448
01:44:21,295 --> 01:44:24,711
No. Please.

1449
01:44:31,806 --> 01:44:36,847
Oh, I don't wanna live like this.

1450
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,522
Here.

1451
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:53,490
It'll be better tomorrow.

1452
01:44:57,250 --> 01:45:01,330
No, I won't. This is not living.
This isn't living.

1453
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:09,345
Why can't...
this be over, baby?

1454
01:45:09,388 --> 01:45:13,467
Please help me.
You help me.

1455
01:45:13,517 --> 01:45:18,060
You're my girl. You help me, please.
Ellie, promise me...

1456
01:45:18,148 --> 01:45:20,982
you'll help me.

1457
01:45:21,025 --> 01:45:25,983
Please. Please. Please.

1458
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:29,863
We all made this
for you, honey.

1459
01:45:29,951 --> 01:45:32,620
See, it's got our names
all over it, embroidered.

1460
01:45:32,703 --> 01:45:36,868
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- I hope you like it.

1461
01:45:36,959 --> 01:45:40,659
What's that smell? It's that
Indian summer potpourri, isn't it?

1462
01:45:40,712 --> 01:45:43,916
Mm-hmm.
It's your favorite.

1463
01:45:44,008 --> 01:45:46,878
Who's making
a racket out there?

1464
01:45:46,969 --> 01:45:50,136
She brought the baby.

1465
01:45:50,222 --> 01:45:54,054
You girls do good work,
you know?

1466
01:45:54,144 --> 01:45:56,716
Are you available next Tuesday?

1467
01:45:56,813 --> 01:45:59,896
- Oh, here he is.
- He says, "I want Kate."

1468
01:45:59,982 --> 01:46:02,142
- Where's Kate? There she is.
- Oh, I thought I never...

1469
01:46:02,235 --> 01:46:05,735
- Oh, hello, little man. Oh, my gosh.
- Can you sit down for me?

1470
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:09,909
Oh, gosh.
Who's that cute baby?

1471
01:46:13,914 --> 01:46:17,745
Ellen, l...

1472
01:46:17,792 --> 01:46:21,328
I'm so sorry.
I know it must be very hard...

1473
01:46:21,422 --> 01:46:25,289
for you seeing her like this.

1474
01:46:25,384 --> 01:46:27,757
It's okay.

1475
01:46:27,846 --> 01:46:31,465
It'll be over soon.

1476
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:36,055
I have a bib too.

1477
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,403
I do remember telling Mrs. Best...

1478
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:48,700
that it would all be over soon.

1479
01:48:48,745 --> 01:48:50,867
But everyone knew that.

1480
01:48:53,916 --> 01:48:56,622
Ellen...

1481
01:48:56,712 --> 01:49:00,045
did your mother ever ask you
to help her out of her pain?

1482
01:49:00,132 --> 01:49:03,750
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I gave her
her medication every day.

1483
01:49:03,844 --> 01:49:05,753
No.

1484
01:49:07,306 --> 01:49:10,473
Did your mother ever ask you...

1485
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,470
to help her take her life?

1486
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:21,776
If she did, Ellen, I can say with
some assurance no one in this office...

1487
01:49:21,864 --> 01:49:24,484
I did not help my mother
take her life.

1488
01:49:29,287 --> 01:49:31,198
Where was your father
on that last night?

1489
01:49:32,709 --> 01:49:35,709
He had a class.

1490
01:49:35,796 --> 01:49:38,712
He didn't come home
until she was already sleeping.

1491
01:49:45,889 --> 01:49:48,427
- George.
- Yeah.

1492
01:49:48,475 --> 01:49:51,013
- You came home so early.
- They cancelled my class.

1493
01:49:51,102 --> 01:49:55,480
Oh.

1494
01:50:01,364 --> 01:50:05,029
Hi, you pretty girl.

1495
01:50:05,117 --> 01:50:07,026
Did you miss me?

1496
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:10,489
Oh, no.

1497
01:50:14,461 --> 01:50:18,505
I want to talk to George now.

1498
01:50:55,129 --> 01:50:58,249
Did you feed her?

1499
01:50:58,341 --> 01:51:02,173
No one should have
to live like that.

1500
01:51:02,219 --> 01:51:04,177
No one.

1501
01:51:04,222 --> 01:51:06,891
Mom said that.

1502
01:51:11,187 --> 01:51:13,345
She was right.

1503
01:51:49,312 --> 01:51:51,268
Hey.

1504
01:51:54,275 --> 01:51:58,652
I finished the table.

1505
01:52:15,172 --> 01:52:19,418
Love you, Ellie.

1506
01:52:21,805 --> 01:52:23,762
I love you.

1507
01:52:28,143 --> 01:52:30,101
I knew that.

1508
01:52:32,147 --> 01:52:35,814
I always knew that.

1509
01:54:20,178 --> 01:54:23,632
Take care, sweetie.

1510
01:54:32,275 --> 01:54:35,063
EI?

1511
01:54:35,113 --> 01:54:37,685
- Hey.
- Hi.

1512
01:54:41,619 --> 01:54:43,527
Hi.

1513
01:54:45,122 --> 01:54:47,032
I'm so sorry.

1514
01:54:49,461 --> 01:54:53,043
I don't know what else to say.

1515
01:54:53,131 --> 01:54:55,041
I'm so sorry.

1516
01:55:00,263 --> 01:55:02,423
How are you?

1517
01:55:02,474 --> 01:55:06,519
Yeah. You okay?

1518
01:55:06,603 --> 01:55:09,557
Never knew I could
miss someone so much.

1519
01:55:09,648 --> 01:55:11,558
Oh, God.

1520
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:14,356
I know.
I missed you too.

1521
01:55:20,243 --> 01:55:22,949
I know this isn't really
a good time to talk, but...

1522
01:55:22,996 --> 01:55:25,238
you know, when you're ready,
we should...

1523
01:55:25,332 --> 01:55:27,906
we should figure out what we're
going to do this year, you know.

1524
01:55:28,001 --> 01:55:31,334
- Don't you think?
- You know, Jordan, a lot has happened...

1525
01:55:31,379 --> 01:55:33,337
that you just don't understand.

1526
01:55:33,381 --> 01:55:36,881
And I'm sorry, but I don't think
you can understand.

1527
01:55:36,969 --> 01:55:38,878
What? What are you
talking about?

1528
01:55:38,971 --> 01:55:41,889
- Thank you for coming.
- EI?

1529
01:56:56,261 --> 01:56:58,586
Ellen...

1530
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:03,468
your mother died
of an overdose of morphine.

1531
01:57:03,561 --> 01:57:05,886
Can you think of any possible
explanation for that?

1532
01:57:10,610 --> 01:57:14,442
Do you think your father might have
some idea how it might have happened?

1533
01:57:14,531 --> 01:57:17,697
I really don't know
how he could.

1534
01:57:17,784 --> 01:57:20,453
Like I said, he didn't come home
until she was sleeping.

1535
01:57:23,082 --> 01:57:24,991
Have you discussed any of this
with your father?

1536
01:57:25,083 --> 01:57:26,993
No.

1537
01:57:27,086 --> 01:57:30,621
Well, only because I went back
to New York right after the funeral.

1538
01:57:30,673 --> 01:57:32,749
And I really haven't talked
to him since then.

1539
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:36,135
I've been really busy.
New job.

1540
01:57:37,222 --> 01:57:39,214
- You're writing again?
- Mm-hmm.

1541
01:57:39,307 --> 01:57:42,059
Feature writer for the Voice.

1542
01:57:42,143 --> 01:57:45,808
Hmph.
Congratulations.

1543
01:57:45,897 --> 01:57:47,807
Thanks.

1544
01:57:50,944 --> 01:57:52,854
I may want to speak to your father.

1545
01:57:56,659 --> 01:57:58,865
Anyway...

1546
01:57:58,953 --> 01:58:01,076
thank you.

1547
01:58:01,164 --> 01:58:03,073
Sure.

1548
01:58:09,505 --> 01:58:11,416
I'm sorry for your loss.

1549
01:58:11,508 --> 01:58:13,417
Thank you.

1550
01:58:56,263 --> 01:58:58,754
How long have you been here?

1551
01:58:58,849 --> 01:59:02,895
Not long.

1552
01:59:02,937 --> 01:59:07,350
I can smell the lilacs
and the hollyhocks under the soil.

1553
01:59:10,737 --> 01:59:14,403
Your mother used to say
she could do the same thing.

1554
01:59:17,411 --> 01:59:19,368
How'd it go today?

1555
01:59:19,413 --> 01:59:21,951
All right, I guess.

1556
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,081
He's gonna want
to talk to you too.

1557
01:59:27,713 --> 01:59:30,668
Ellen, I just want you to know
how much I admire your courage.

1558
01:59:32,051 --> 01:59:36,760
And I wish I'd done it.

1559
01:59:36,807 --> 01:59:39,345
What?

1560
01:59:39,435 --> 01:59:41,474
I wish I had.

1561
01:59:45,274 --> 01:59:47,231
I would've.

1562
01:59:50,613 --> 01:59:52,570
Couldn't.

1563
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:03,206
Dad, I didn't do it.

1564
02:00:03,293 --> 02:00:07,161
I didn't do it.
I thought that...

1565
02:00:07,256 --> 02:00:10,672
All this time,
I thought that it was you.

1566
02:00:16,807 --> 02:00:20,307
- Oh, my God.
- No.

1567
02:00:20,394 --> 02:00:23,016
- It's impossible.
- Oh, my God.

1568
02:00:23,105 --> 02:00:25,431
She was too helpless.
She was too frail.

1569
02:00:34,701 --> 02:00:36,660
The pills.

1570
02:00:36,704 --> 02:00:38,910
How could sh...? Jesus.

1571
02:00:45,796 --> 02:00:49,664
Ellen, l...

1572
02:00:49,718 --> 02:00:51,840
I love your mother.

1573
02:01:02,314 --> 02:01:05,813
I don't suppose
I'm ever going to stop loving her.

1574
02:01:11,031 --> 02:01:14,531
But because she can do anything...

1575
02:01:14,577 --> 02:01:17,151
run the house, run our lives...

1576
02:01:17,204 --> 02:01:20,573
keep everything
so beautiful and so warm...

1577
02:01:27,674 --> 02:01:30,878
I only thought
of what she meant to me.

1578
02:01:30,969 --> 02:01:36,046
My... muse.

1579
02:01:36,099 --> 02:01:39,303
My... lovely wife.

1580
02:01:42,439 --> 02:01:44,764
My one true thing.

1581
02:01:48,612 --> 02:01:51,698
Of course she did it.

1582
02:01:51,742 --> 02:01:53,735
Who else would've had
the strength?

1583
02:02:23,024 --> 02:02:25,896
No, you have to go
deeper than that.

1584
02:02:25,944 --> 02:02:30,357
You have to go four inches.

1585
02:02:30,449 --> 02:02:34,149
- Four?
- Yeah.

1586
02:02:34,244 --> 02:02:37,779
Yeah, so that they don't rot in the snow,
or so that the animals don't get them.

1587
02:02:37,874 --> 02:02:39,783
Uh-huh.

1588
02:02:39,875 --> 02:02:44,205
And then four inches apart
so that the roots don't tangle...

1589
02:02:44,297 --> 02:02:46,966
and they'll just
look prettier.

1590
02:02:50,638 --> 02:02:53,009
What are these plants?

1591
02:02:53,099 --> 02:02:55,007
Daffodils.

1592
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:58,350
- These are daffodils?
- Yeah.
