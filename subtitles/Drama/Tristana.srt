1
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,454
It had to be him.

2
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,181
We're sick of you.

3
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,350
Next time, I'll rip your ears off.

4
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,435
For all the use they are...

5
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,437
Come on.

6
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,699
You're always causing trouble.

7
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,453
Saturno isn't a bad boy.
A bit confused, but smart.

8
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,622
He has strange ideas at times.

9
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,792
He's just like my late husband,

10
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,628
may he burn in hell.
If you'll forgive me.

11
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,631
This young lady is
Don Lope Garrido's ward.

12
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,217
She hasn't left the house
for two weeks.

13
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,469
I brought her with me
to get some fresh air.

14
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,346
My pleasure, miss.

15
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,889
Excuse me.

16
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,533
It's for my mother.
She died recently.

17
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,799
Your son is too old now
to stay on in this school.

18
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,218
Yes, it's time he earned his living.

19
00:02:56,886 --> 00:03:00,055
He's capable enough,
but he's always skiving.

20
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,141
He's easily distracted and very lazy.

21
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,810
But if he matures with the years,

22
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,979
he could be a good craftsman.

23
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,858
Don Lope has found
a place for him in a workshop.

24
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,484
He's a fine gentleman.

25
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,862
There are few like him now.

26
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,702
Where is God's grace going?

27
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,580
- To find a sweetheart.
- He's right here, dear.

28
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:25,873
So old?

29
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,336
Not that old!
Don't bury me yet!

30
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,130
Ma'am.

31
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,271
Come on, get out of here.

32
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,533
You're not taking all this, are you?

33
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,827
As you wish.

34
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,413
This junk is of no interest.

35
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,334
I don't want it in my house.
I've got enough. Saturna!

36
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,379
Sell all this to a second-hand dealer.

37
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,048
Except for the clothes
that are passable.

38
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,841
And don't haggle, I know you.

39
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,511
- Take what he offers.
- I'll do that, sir.

40
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:29,436
- If there's anything you'd like...
- Yes, this crucifix.

41
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,981
My mother died with it in her hands.

42
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,235
Very well,
but keep it in your room.

43
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:40,322
With time, I'll put certain
superstitions out of your head.

44
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,242
Naturally,
if you'd like anything else...

45
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,495
- No.
- With this and the piano, that's all.

46
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,540
The piano?
We sold it months ago.

47
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,133
The scores are still here.
I'd like to keep them.

48
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,677
- Perhaps one day...
- Very well.

49
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,930
Your mother was a very good woman.

50
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,684
No one better,
but no one sillier either.

51
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,729
You never enjoyed
your father's wealth.

52
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,482
You were very young
when he started to lose it all.

53
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,323
Leave that saucepan.

54
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,867
I said I didn't want any rubbish.

55
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:29,204
You know nothing about cooking, sir.
I can use this.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,791
You, get ready.
We're leaving now.

57
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,543
- So soon?
- Yes.

58
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,005
What do you think she said
a while ago?

59
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,300
That she'd like to stay on here.

60
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,222
Look, I can't maintain two houses
and you can't live on your own.

61
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,267
Your mother asked me
to look after you.

62
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,603
Where would you be better off
than with me?

63
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,731
Who would dare offend you
if you're with me?

64
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,900
Come along.

65
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,213
Stop thief!

66
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,466
Catch him!

67
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,981
- Did you see a boy run past?
- With a handbag?

68
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,192
- Yes.
- He went that way.

69
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,328
Come.

70
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,997
Why did you send him the wrong way?

71
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,000
Because we must protect the weak.

72
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,420
The police represent strength.

73
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,132
Men like me always defend the weak,
whoever they are,

74
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,883
whatever their situation.

75
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,095
Never forget that, little one.

76
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,613
She's so beautiful!
And so elegant!

77
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,495
She was an upper class lady,
married to a marquis.

78
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:37,040
But Don Lope
got in the middle and...

79
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,418
- What did he do?
- Challenged her husband.

80
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,961
It was a real scandal.

81
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,588
It was even in the papers.

82
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,423
No one is better than Don Lope,

83
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,885
but where there's a skirt,
he has horns and a tail.

84
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,443
Get up, Tristana.

85
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,820
You're not a servant here.

86
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,448
You're the mistress,
Saturna is here to serve you.

87
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,742
Saturna, clean this up.

88
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,998
I'm very tired, I walked a lot.

89
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,583
My feet are aching.

90
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,587
- Shall I bring your slippers?
- Thank you, you're an angel.

91
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,639
I know I keep you
at home all the time,

92
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:38,227
but I can't bring you to the cafe,
or let you go out walking.

93
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,188
And your mourning
is a nuisance for everyone.

94
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,607
Whenever you wish,
I'll take you to the theater.

95
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,442
It's up to you.

96
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,361
Thank you, Tristana.

97
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,240
Shall I tell you something?
You're my beloved daughter.

98
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,742
I only ask you
to love me like a father.

99
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,410
You're a good man.

100
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,996
Heavens, a visitor. I'd forgotten.

101
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:03,335
- You're receiving them like that?
- It doesn't matter, I know them.

102
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,466
Come in.

103
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,386
- Good evening, Lope.
- Good evening.

104
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,686
- Please, sit down.
- This won't take long.

105
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,855
Well, gentlemen,
when is the duel?

106
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,525
Tomorrow. At 7:00.

107
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,111
- Where?
- In the woods.

108
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,447
- Who'll take me?
- Someone will come for you.

109
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,950
- And the weapons?
- Swords.

110
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,785
And in what conditions?

111
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,288
Both parties have decided

112
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,583
that it will be to first blood.

113
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,710
Is that possible?

114
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,212
- To first blood?
- Yes.

115
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:51,425
Do you think I'll agree
to be judge of such a farce?

116
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,802
I don't like circuses!

117
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,180
I don't think honor is saved
by a scratch on the skin.

118
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,434
So much for those good-for-nothings
and their conscience.

119
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,019
Gentlemen,

120
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,730
don't call on me again
for matters of honor

121
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,523
that have so little worth.

122
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,992
Stop!

123
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,785
Take that!

124
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,749
The first one to arrive is an idiot!

125
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,175
Come in, miss.

126
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,845
I know that Saturno's mother
serves in your house.

127
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,974
- That smells good.
- It's fried bread.

128
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,935
- Like to taste it, miss?
- I've always liked it.

129
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,772
- I'll have a little bit.
- Get a plate.

130
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,116
It's a pauper's dish,
you must excuse me.

131
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,952
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have added chorizo.

132
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,206
- Maybe a fried egg?
- No, I'll have lunch at home.

133
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,504
I've never been in the bell tower.

134
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,340
But as Saturno is your son's friend,

135
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,468
I wanted to come with them
to hear the bells.

136
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,846
They wouldn't even hear
a cannon firing in 1942.

137
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,395
There's a lovely view outside!

138
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,730
You're very lucky.

139
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,150
You must feel very important up here,

140
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,819
like you ruled the world.

141
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,780
No, you get used to it
and don't even notice.

142
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,491
And as for being important...
Not at all.

143
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,327
We used to be important
but not now.

144
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,995
Why not?

145
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,541
In those days
when there was a lot of religion,

146
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,752
people timed things by the bells
and they obeyed them.

147
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,004
There was the dying knell,

148
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,924
the death knell, the fire warning,

149
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,843
the victory bells,

150
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,513
the call to mass
and the peel for devotions.

151
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,140
People listened,

152
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,143
they went to visit the dying,
to bury the dead

153
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,896
or to get their firearms
if there was an alert.

154
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,232
Times have changed.

155
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,902
People are chasing after money,
they don't listen.

156
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,822
They even complain
when we ring the bell for mass

157
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,450
because they say we wake them.

158
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,287
- Would you like some more?
- Yes, I'd love some.

159
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,664
This is the bellringer's fried bread.

160
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,083
- And the serving scoop?
- That too.

161
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,056
Come on.

162
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,183
Come on!

163
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,272
Idiot!

164
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,778
Scoundrel!

165
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,102
Saturna!

166
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,905
What's wrong, miss?
Why did you shout?

167
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:28,326
I had a horrible dream!
It was dreadful! The bell!

168
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,328
Now, now, calm down.

169
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,539
It's all over.

170
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,420
What's wrong, my dear?

171
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:39,546
Are you ill?

172
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,298
A nightmare, sir.

173
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,299
Poor thing.

174
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,428
Fix one of your remedies for her.
A cup of lime tea or something.

175
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,679
Go, go.

176
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,933
Calm down, it's over.

177
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,395
You were shouting
as if you'd seen the devil.

178
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,274
I remember you as a little girl
screaming when you saw me...

179
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,151
Exactly like now.

180
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,779
It's over now, go to sleep.

181
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:09,159
Even if you have nightmares,
it's good to dream.

182
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,746
The dead don't dream.

183
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,124
Good night, my dear.

184
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,456
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Don Lope.

185
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:57,749
Thank you.

186
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,626
The usual.

187
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,969
Why did you stop talking
when you saw me?

188
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,013
Please, carry on tearing me to bits.

189
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,225
What an idea!
None of us would dare.

190
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:19,938
When you're not here, Don Zenón,
we certainly dare to make fun of you.

191
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,274
And of you, too, when you're absent.

192
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,652
So why would you pardon me?

193
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:32,033
It seems like a lack of respect
not to have fun at your expense.

194
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,995
The truth is,
we're running out of subjects.

195
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,623
- We've talked of everything but you.
- Thank you.

196
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,919
To be honest, we were discussing
your refusal to judge a duel.

197
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,005
Is that true, or just a rumor?

198
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,424
It's true.

199
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,552
It's true that there are
no longer men of my kind.

200
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,303
Of our kind.

201
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,473
One thing has not changed
between yesterday and today.

202
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,891
The taste for ladies.

203
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,061
I totally agree, but today
there is so much effeminacy.

204
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:04,649
I'm always surprised that you,
so meticulous about honor,

205
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,486
you are so tolerant
when it comes to sins of love.

206
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,366
Don't worry,
the question is very timely.

207
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,454
When it comes to women and love,
I've never seen any sin.

208
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,582
- If only that were true.
- Chance would be a fine thing.

209
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,876
What a theory!
And the Ten Commandments?

210
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,671
I respect all of them,
except those to do with sex...

211
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,842
because I'm sure they were added
to the truly divine ones by Moses

212
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,303
for political reasons
that don't affect me.

213
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,848
- This Don Lope...
- So any girl we meet with...

214
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,808
Stop there, my friend.

215
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,935
There are distinctions.

216
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,522
When we meet with a woman,
if she is consenting,

217
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,524
and if we can make her consent,

218
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,610
then the encounter should be pleasant.

219
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,820
But there are two exceptions:

220
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,697
the wife of a friend,

221
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:57,452
and that strange flower, so rare,
that is born from perfect innocence.

222
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,917
Come out, bonehead!

223
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,585
Saturno!

224
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,049
I said, come out of there!

225
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,803
Come out now!

226
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,264
Why shout if he can't hear you?

227
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,643
He can't hear me?
I'll teach him to lock himself in!

228
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,311
He's been in there for an hour.

229
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,688
Open up or I'll kill you!

230
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,694
Don't hit him!

231
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,905
I understand, and so does he.

232
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,743
Go on, it's clear your uncle
doesn't like you to be late.

233
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,830
After working all day,
he wants to go to bed early.

234
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,125
And he's doing me a favor
boarding this one.

235
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,586
What are you doing here?

236
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,925
All right, now get out.

237
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,100
Hello.

238
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,394
Supper!

239
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,584
"The original sin
of Spanish republicanism

240
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,921
"has always been its attempt
to cure with nothing but speeches

241
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,257
"the gangrene of the institutions..."

242
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,509
Please, that's stupid!

243
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,309
Well, what a change!

244
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,228
A boiled egg! As usual.

245
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,440
- What aren't you eating?
- I'm not hungry.

246
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,900
That's not true.

247
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,402
There was only one left.

248
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,905
- Here, eat it.
- No, really.

249
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,157
I said, eat it! Obey me.

250
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,410
- Why don't you buy more food?
- With what?

251
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,829
You won't let me buy on credit.

252
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,916
The income isn't enough
to get through the month.

253
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,294
Well, we'll have to sort this out.

254
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,339
Filthy lucre...

255
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,592
Like it or not,
we are its slaves, my dear.

256
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,177
It only ceases to be filthy

257
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,972
when it's for those who have
the misfortune to need it,

258
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,016
whoever they are.

259
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:29,729
If I may say so, sir,
"whoever they are" depends.

260
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,940
This chard is disgusting.

261
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,401
When you don't have money
or appetite, you get in a bad mood,

262
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,237
and then nothing is right.

263
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,613
Pass the wine.

264
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,406
What's wrong?

265
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,163
- What's wrong with her?
- What do you think?

266
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,831
She's thinking of her mother.

267
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,626
Or she needs fresh air,
she's been shut away for weeks.

268
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,837
- Doesn't she go to mass?
- That's a lot of fun!

269
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,007
She probably goes to breathe
rather than out of devotion.

270
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,594
You should let me go out with her
to take the sun.

271
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,765
If you want an honest woman,
break her leg and keep her home.

272
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,850
Have you anything to say?

273
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,488
You always wear the same dress.
Have you nothing else to put on?

274
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,739
No, sir.

275
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,537
This can't go on.
It's getting on my nerves.

276
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,164
From tomorrow, no more mourning.

277
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,001
I'll see to renewing your wardrobe.

278
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,295
Mourning is a savage custom,

279
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,464
like painting your face
or tattooing your body.

280
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,101
It's pure Meneses silver.

281
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,270
This is worthless.

282
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,357
This is good, it's hallmarked.
They're two fine pieces.

283
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,734
But it's hard to sell them here.

284
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,860
How much?

285
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,237
I'd give you 2,000 pesetas.

286
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,331
You say that it's authentic,

287
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,542
and the papers
seem to confirm that, but...

288
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,419
the painting isn't signed.

289
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,464
I'd offer anyone else
3,000 pesetas, but...

290
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,258
No more "buts."
I neither want nor accept favors.

291
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,386
- Give me 5,000 pesetas.
- But with the esteem I have...

292
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,638
Don't change esteem into merchandise.

293
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,308
Give me 5,000 pesetas for the lot.

294
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,687
I'll draw up the inventory
of what I'm taking.

295
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,481
Make yourself at home.

296
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,994
You could have got
a lot more from him.

297
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,246
It's a crime to sell them so cheaply.

298
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,290
I loathe arguing about money.

299
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,210
Sir, don't be like that.

300
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,296
Go back to your pans.

301
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:07,720
- If I'd known, I myself could have...
- I don't do business with friends.

302
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,305
Worse for you.

303
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,350
I hate the commercial spirit.

304
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:16,354
This hawker or a millionaire
industrialist, they're all the same.

305
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,857
Bloodsuckers!
Let's see what this bandit is up to.

306
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,819
- Lope, we can still talk...
- Please!

307
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,637
Look at that couple.

308
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,849
Don't you get the sickly scent
of conjugal happiness?

309
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,100
I don't understand.

310
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,271
Did you see that bovine look
of resignation? That boredom?

311
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,064
Farewell, love.

312
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,567
Never get married, Tristana.

313
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,405
- One can be free and honorable.
- Exactly. Passion must be free.

314
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,906
It's a law of nature.

315
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,034
No chains or signatures or blessings!

316
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,000
Which of these pillars
do you like most?

317
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,794
Now I'm the one
who doesn't understand you.

318
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,173
- Which one do you prefer?
- None or any one.

319
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,966
They're all the same.

320
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:31,179
They're never all the same.
There's always a difference.

321
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:35,183
Between two grapes, two loaves
or two snowflakes, I always choose.

322
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,227
There's always one I like more.

323
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,567
I prefer this one.

324
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,195
Then take it home with you.

325
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,489
And let's change the subject.

326
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,072
Well?

327
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:35,576
I was thinking about
going to buy your slippers.

328
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:39,163
What do you mean?
Come along, let's go.

329
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,003
Sometimes I think
that you like me a little.

330
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,505
At other times, no.

331
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,925
At times I even have the unpleasant
feeling that I disgust you a bit.

332
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:54,220
Disgust me?
No, just the opposite.

333
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,931
- So you don't think badly of me?
- No.

334
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,101
You might even love me a little?

335
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,227
Yes.

336
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,445
Give me a kiss.

337
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,199
No, not like that.

338
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,258
- Saturna!
- Yes, sir?

339
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,891
Weren't you going to your brother's?

340
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,311
Yes, I've finished
grinding the coffee.

341
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,271
- I'm going now.
- Hurry up.

342
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,480
Yes, sir.

343
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,411
- Do you need anything else, sir?
- No, nothing.

344
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,330
The later you come back, the better.

345
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,414
Yes, sir.

346
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,416
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

347
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,530
- Have you finished?
- No, not yet.

348
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,782
Leave that.

349
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,622
- What if she comes back?
- She won't, not until supper time.

350
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,291
Anyway, it's time she got used to it.

351
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,774
What are you doing here?

352
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:18,823
Out.

353
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,010
Where have you been, you scoundrel?

354
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:25,723
I've told you to keep out of things
that have nothing to do with you.

355
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,935
Say hello to Don Lope
and the young lady, and then go away.

356
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,524
Sir, Saturno has come
to see how you are.

357
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,151
Hello, you rascal.

358
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,154
Yes, yes, go on, sit down.

359
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,407
I can't stand it anymore.
Tomorrow, I'm going out.

360
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,243
That's too soon. Be patient.

361
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,039
I hate being inactive
and you seeing me like this.

362
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,627
You have to get sick some time.
Especially at your age.

363
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,421
What does age have to do with a cold!

364
00:29:57,588 --> 00:30:01,008
I'd like to see a strapping youth
with this cold...

365
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,761
And stop fussing!
I can do it.

366
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,808
And leave me in peace!

367
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,226
As you wish.

368
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:14,730
As I wish, and as you wish.

369
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,775
I don't want to impose my wishes.

370
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:22,780
We're happy because neither you nor I
have lost our sense of freedom.

371
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:28,327
Right now, you could tell me
that you're tired of me,

372
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,579
you could leave,
and I'd say nothing.

373
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,457
Surely you wouldn't let me get
to the corner.

374
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,750
Perhaps.

375
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,294
Sir, the bed is warm.

376
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,798
The limits of your freedom, Tristana,

377
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,591
are set out by you

378
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:46,095
in accordance with decency
and your esteem for me.

379
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,983
You're so good, my dear.
How could I not adore you?

380
00:30:59,149 --> 00:30:59,859
Leave me be.

381
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,319
Shall I serve your lunch, miss?

382
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,863
Yes, go on.

383
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,871
Afterwards,
I'll bring you some broth, sir.

384
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,300
It's very tasty, miss.

385
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,014
It's a pleasure to see
how Don Lope cares for you.

386
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,434
- I wish he'd love me less.
- Poor man.

387
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,862
Are you still there, boy?

388
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,789
Well? A lot of people
getting beaten out there?

389
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,125
A lot of beating?

390
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:07,051
Poor workers.
Cheated and then beaten.

391
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,137
Work is a curse, Saturno.

392
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,391
Down with work
that you have to do to survive.

393
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:18,270
That work isn't honorable,
as some say.

394
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:22,816
All it does is fatten
the exploiting swine.

395
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,612
However, what you do for pleasure

396
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,405
ennobles man.

397
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,368
If only we could all work like that.

398
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,372
Look at me,
I'd rather be hanged than work!

399
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,168
So, I live poorly
but I live without working.

400
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,797
That's some advice
you're giving the boy!

401
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,299
Just as well he's deaf, or else...

402
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,302
Be careful you don't get beaten.

403
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,304
Take him away now.

404
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,737
- You ate like a horse.
- And so did you.

405
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,781
- The partridges were delicious.
- Excellent.

406
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,617
- Good day to you!
- My dear notary.

407
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,244
- And the family?
- Very well.

408
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,997
- After you. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

409
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,550
- Where would you like to go today?
- I don't care.

410
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,136
One day, Don Lope will discover
that we go out, and...

411
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,805
And what?
We hardly ever see him.

412
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:21,060
Let him find out.
I can't stand him anymore.

413
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,979
I'll get into trouble
for going with you.

414
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,648
Every day he gets older
and more ridiculous.

415
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,498
I haven't mentioned the bell in ages.
I dreamed about it last night.

416
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:46,085
Dreams can be very tactless.
Don Lope's head as a clapper!

417
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:50,005
If I could only get away
and never see him again...

418
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,018
- Saturna, tell me.
- What is it?

419
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:07,481
Look at those two streets?
Which of them do you prefer?

420
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,193
- Whichever, I don't know.
- I prefer this one. Come on.

421
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:16,115
To tell the truth,
I preferred the other street.

422
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,120
No, not that way.

423
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,831
Where did he go?

424
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,835
He's already bitten a child.
He's got rabies!

425
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,003
I think it's the barber's dog.

426
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,298
Yes, and he's gone into a house.

427
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,843
- Shall we go and see?
- You go if you wish,

428
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,720
I don't like dogs,
much less rabid ones.

429
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,890
I told the barber ages ago,

430
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,934
but he wouldn't listen.

431
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,899
There's a rabid dog, and I...

432
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,735
Make yourself at home.

433
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,071
Sit down.

434
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,829
- Is he Catalonian?
- Yes.

435
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,958
- I had him come from Barcelona.
- I see.

436
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,056
- He's down there.
- Leave this to me.

437
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,567
If I may, I'll tell you something.

438
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,402
After this model,

439
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,906
I'd like to do a good portrait of you.

440
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,576
You have a very interesting face.

441
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,161
Where do you live?

442
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,749
- That dog won't bite anyone else.
- Thank heavens you were here.

443
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,751
I'd have got him the first time,

444
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,878
but I moved so that
the bullet wouldn't ricochet.

445
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,714
- Well, good afternoon.
- Goodbye.

446
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,938
- You think I'm lying?
- No...

447
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,481
- And I never joke.
- Goodbye.

448
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,691
Wait!

449
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,698
It's settled.

450
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,710
What will he think of me?
I said yes to everything.

451
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,170
I couldn't take my eyes off him.

452
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,299
He'll think I'm a fool or an idiot.

453
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,302
And he'd be right.
I even told him where I live.

454
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,346
He insisted that he wanted to see me
and I said yes.

455
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,764
I'm so embarrassed!

456
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,143
I couldn't help myself.

457
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,395
But I don't regret it.

458
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,898
If the old man finds out,
it'll be terrible.

459
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,218
Saturna!

460
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,595
Yes, sir.

461
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,099
Didn't you hear me?

462
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,019
- Iron this tie for me.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,981
Why are you making this bed?

464
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,942
Miss Tristana wants
to sleep here on her own.

465
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,906
- Why?
- I don't know, sir.

466
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,341
Get dressed, we're going out.

467
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,094
- Both of us?
- Who else?

468
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:51,139
It's more decent to go out with me
than to go alone.

469
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,516
Why?

470
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,643
Get dressed.

471
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,112
Wafers!

472
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,657
Wafers!

473
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,348
If I laugh for joy,
will you think I'm mad?

474
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,685
You're up to something shady.

475
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:41,398
Your absences stink of meetings
with some layabout or other.

476
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,066
I'm free, aren't I?

477
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,944
I'm not accountable
to anyone but myself.

478
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,404
I'm following your advice.

479
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,866
If I catch you doing anything wrong,
I think I'll kill you.

480
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,660
I prefer a tragedy
to looking ridiculous in my decline.

481
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,495
There are no secrets for me.

482
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,124
With my experience in these things,
no one can fool me.

483
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,334
- Impossible!
- Lope, please!

484
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,505
You've been warned.

485
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,717
Don't forget I still have
two obligations to you.

486
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,886
I'm your father and your husband.

487
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,305
One or other, as it suits me.

488
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,323
- Clown.
- Idiot.

489
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,415
I need 10,000 pesetas.

490
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,168
Lend them to me
and I swear I'll pay you back.

491
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,921
You know I don't feed heretics.

492
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,216
Keep your money,
you pious old fool.

493
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:53,929
Patrito, God punished me
by giving me a brother like that.

494
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,474
Fortunately,
you've got the upper hand.

495
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,935
Yes, but only while I live.

496
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:03,313
It's men who make the laws, daughter.

497
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,858
Good afternoon, Don Dimas.

498
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,861
Hello. I called you
so you'd take your son away.

499
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,864
- Has he done anything wrong?
- He doesn't do his work.

500
00:42:55,031 --> 00:43:00,328
- With his problem...
- You can be deaf and disciplined.

501
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,622
He should be here now.

502
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,749
Where's the dummy?

503
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,210
He's always out in the yard.

504
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,603
I bet he's been in there
for over an hour.

505
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,110
Come out!

506
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:35,196
Come out of there,
you good-for-nothing!

507
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,088
Aren't you ashamed?

508
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,799
Everyone is working, and you...

509
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,805
I'm taking you
to work with your uncle.

510
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,515
On the building site.

511
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,517
That'll show you.

512
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:05,935
Move it!

513
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,398
I'm sorry, Don Dimas.

514
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,984
- Thank you for everything.
- Don't mention it.

515
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,701
- Goodbye, miss.
- Thank you.

516
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,663
Saturna,

517
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,334
- I'm going to see him.
- Don't stay too long.

518
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,919
Go back home.

519
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:32,712
He's having a siesta today.

520
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,382
What shall I say if he wakes up
before you come back?

521
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,884
That I stayed in the street.

522
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,226
Leave me alone!

523
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,365
Wait for me if you want.

524
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,973
I thought you weren't coming, my dear.

525
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,766
I had things to do.

526
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,227
I can't stay long today.

527
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:34,149
You'll leave when I say so.
I want to finish your portrait soon.

528
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,484
He stayed at home today.

529
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:40,238
I've made coffee,
and I've got some cakes you'll like.

530
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,949
It's ridiculous that you're scared
of your guardian.

531
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,993
You should introduce me.

532
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,454
Don't light it,
I don't want anything.

533
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,083
When will you introduce me
to your guardian?

534
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,420
He's not my guardian.

535
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,380
He's more than that.

536
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,424
What?

537
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,176
He's my husband.

538
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:04,137
I wanted to tell you
all this ages ago.

539
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,640
I'm not married to my husband,
I mean, my guardian.

540
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,476
I mean, that man.

541
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,145
You can't imagine how I've suffered.

542
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,022
Now you know everything.

543
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,482
Forgive me.

544
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,860
I know I'm dishonored.

545
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,362
But I'm free to love you.

546
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:22,655
What do you think?

547
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,866
Or can't you forgive me?

548
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,952
How do you prefer me?

549
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:31,080
An unfaithful married woman
or free?

550
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,250
Do you still love me? Speak.

551
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,504
Say something, please.

552
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:41,424
I'm only deceiving him,
he has no rights over me.

553
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,551
He deserves it.

554
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:47,806
At times I hate him
for all the harm he's done to me.

555
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,225
And at other times, I confess,

556
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,935
I was fond of him...

557
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,229
like a father.
You must understand.

558
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,857
If he'd loved me as a daughter,
things would be different.

559
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:01,903
He has a good side. But for the rest,
I'm ashamed to think of it.

560
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,531
His moods change in a moment.

561
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:07,033
And when it comes to women...

562
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:12,163
Believe me,
I hate him with all my heart.

563
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,876
You respected me,
thinking I was innocent.

564
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,130
Disgusting old man!

565
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,133
How could you do that?

566
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,803
I've told you everything.

567
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,347
He took me in
when I was very young.

568
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,724
A child, do you understand?

569
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:39,190
Go away.

570
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,359
Get out.

571
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:12,390
Tristana...

572
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:31,511
Where have you come from,
alone and so late?

573
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,973
First of all, it's not late,
and I wasn't alone.

574
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,434
- You're so pretty. Did you run back?
- Yes.

575
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,188
Very well.
I'm going to get tidied up.

576
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,649
Please, clean the ribbon on my hat.

577
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,986
I've got a very important visit
this afternoon.

578
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:15,638
You were lucky!
He didn't scold you.

579
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:19,058
He certainly wanted to,
but he didn't dare.

580
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,478
What a sight.
He's like a different man.

581
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:25,773
The cock loses his feathers
and doesn't crow anymore.

582
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,651
Don't let bitterness eat you away.

583
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,194
Poor man.

584
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,532
If he'd treated me like a daughter,
I'd have loved him.

585
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:37,535
Especially today, Saturna.

586
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,103
Tristana!

587
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:20,495
We'll talk later. You can't just
come and go as you please.

588
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:22,663
I'm in a hurry now.

589
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,667
I left my slippers in the bathroom.

590
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,711
Take them into my bedroom.

591
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,305
When he gets dressed up,
he's brave again.

592
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,140
His feathers grow back.

593
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,059
These are disgusting.

594
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,656
If he asks for them,
what should I tell him?

595
00:51:56,823 --> 00:52:00,409
Tell him to buy new ones
or go barefoot. I don't care.

596
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:16,217
I don't want to leave on my own.
Come with me.

597
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,219
Can't you wait?

598
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,099
I only came for two months
and look how long I've stayed.

599
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:26,686
I'm telling you again,
leave that house and come with me.

600
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,021
Let me think about it.

601
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,607
It's not as easy as you think.

602
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,361
Then decide.
We have to sort this out.

603
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,202
Be patient, my love.

604
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,665
Do you think I don't loathe
my life as a slave?

605
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,419
I want to be free, to work.

606
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:54,839
I wasn't a bad pianist,
but when my mother died...

607
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,635
If I practiced a little,
I could give classes.

608
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,305
And you could paint.

609
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,350
It would be wonderful.

610
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:16,319
I didn't study much,
but I think I could do great things.

611
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,906
However, I'm no good at little things.

612
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:41,802
You do those things at home.

613
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,681
What did you say?

614
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,808
Don't you see there are ladies here?

615
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,145
- That's all we need.
- What are you talking about?

616
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,481
I don't have to put up
with these things!

617
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,650
You're insolent.

618
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,693
We can go to the police station.

619
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,072
That's right.
They'll teach you some decency.

620
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,659
Horacio, don't make a scene.
Let's go home.

621
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,212
She comes back later every day,

622
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:21,300
and you have to help me
with certain personal things.

623
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:26,472
You must know why she goes out
so much and why she's so rebellious.

624
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,558
I'm not asking
out of unhealthy curiosity.

625
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:30,893
I'm doing it for her.

626
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,813
She's still too young
to look after herself.

627
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,524
If you love her,
you should tell me

628
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,276
so I can root out the problem.

629
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,612
I don't know anything.
You should ask her.

630
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,330
Don Lope wants to see you.

631
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,339
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

632
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,729
Tristana, I'm an old dog

633
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,357
and I know that when
a young woman goes out every day,

634
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,359
it's because she's found a bone.

635
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,945
I don't know what kind of bone it is,

636
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,989
but don't deny it.

637
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,533
So you want me to lie?

638
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:31,329
You defend yourself badly
and I'm standing my ground.

639
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:34,540
I suppose that until now
they've been innocent games,

640
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,625
for if it were something else,

641
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:40,671
I can tell you
that no one makes a fool of me.

642
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:44,967
Speaking as your father,
I demand you explain yourself.

643
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,428
Your mother entrusted you to me,

644
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:50,639
and I will defend you
and protect your honor.

645
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,516
You speak of honor? You?

646
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,602
It's your fault that I've lost it!

647
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:57,104
If my mother saw
what you'd made of me!

648
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,316
Who knows if, alone in this world,
in other hands,

649
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,276
your fate would have been worse.

650
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:06,781
- Hypocrite.
- You know you're not like the others.

651
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:09,575
Let me do with you
what I've done with no other woman.

652
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:13,412
Look at you like a loved one,
someone of my own blood.

653
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:16,624
- Don't you believe me?
- Not a word.

654
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,043
I'm sick of always hearing
the same thing.

655
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,546
Maybe I was bad to you,
but now I want to be good.

656
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,382
You must listen to me.

657
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:27,301
I don't want to act like
a jealous husband at home

658
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,595
whose stupidity I know so well.

659
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,515
I don't forbid you to go out,
but I don't like it.

660
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:33,641
There you are.

661
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,070
They're delicious, miss.

662
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:48,864
Try them.

663
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,041
He's calling me.

664
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,880
What can that young man want?

665
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:13,097
- What do you want?
- Come in, my dear.

666
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:16,559
Come over here, little one.
Come closer.

667
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:20,646
I can't go to sleep
knowing you're upset by what we said.

668
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,773
Forgive me if I offended you.

669
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,526
Come and tell me about your loves.

670
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,278
There's nothing to tell.

671
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,655
Very well, I'll find out.

672
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:33,284
Even if you're bad to me,
I've a lot to thank you for.

673
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:36,203
You've loved me in my old age,
given me your youth

674
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,205
and I behaved badly.

675
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,000
But I can't accept that I'm old.

676
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:45,754
Very well. I don't insist
when I'm rejected.

677
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,216
Keep your youthful charm
for some of those good-for-nothings!

678
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:52,887
But I could easily lose my temper
and crush you like an ant...

679
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:56,515
All the better! You don't scare me!
Kill me when you want!

680
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:00,603
You're very courageous.
I might have known.

681
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:10,988
Go see him tomorrow. Tell him
to wait for me in the studio, alone.

682
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:15,075
I'll go, even if he kills me.
At least then he'll have a reason.

683
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:25,794
- Well, gentlemen, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

684
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,664
Are you a journalist now?

685
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,666
That's all you needed.

686
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,376
No, I don't want one.

687
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,294
Here.

688
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,272
What time do we leave?

689
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,065
At 3:30.

690
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,901
I'll check the bags in the morning.

691
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:34,863
- Is your studio bigger than this?
- Twice as big.

692
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,825
You can see the whole city
from the terrace,

693
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:39,660
and the sunset from the bed.

694
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,662
It's perfect for a couple.

695
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:45,583
- For lovers.
- I want you to be my wife.

696
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,460
I'll live with you
for as long as you love me.

697
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,880
If you ever get tired of me,
we'll each go our own way.

698
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,009
You remind me of that scoundrel.
You talk like him.

699
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:59,096
The worst thing is,
he's right about many things.

700
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,856
There's a gentleman downstairs
to see Don Horacio.

701
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,775
- Downstairs, where?
- He's in the street.

702
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,902
How do you know he wants to see him?

703
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,071
Because he told me!

704
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,909
It's him. Don't go down.
I'll speak to him.

705
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:23,120
This is my business.

706
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,372
Stay here, wait for me.

707
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,000
- Horacio...
- I said, wait for me.

708
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,864
You want to see me?

709
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:01,909
Tell Tristana
she's to come back immediately.

710
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:05,412
Then you and I will resolve
this matter like gentlemen.

711
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,667
You're going to stop walking
up and down and go away.

712
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,543
I'm her guardian.

713
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,879
Guardian...

714
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:16,965
She told me what kind
of old pervert you are.

715
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:21,512
Tomorrow you will be visited
by two friends.

716
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,393
Come here, Pepe.

717
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:35,067
- Don't you see he's an old man?
- Keep out of this.

718
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:38,070
- Shall we take you home?
- No, thank you.

719
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:40,155
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

720
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:47,871
Thank you.

721
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,086
Really, it's nothing.

722
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:58,006
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Good night.

723
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:19,987
Goodbye.

724
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,576
- Write to me.
- Yes.

725
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:26,910
Don't forget.

726
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:31,206
Safe journey.

727
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,391
She's gone.

728
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:52,519
She'll be back, I'm sure of it.

729
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:41,568
Listen, Lope...

730
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:44,863
I was coming to see you.

731
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,534
I know how you feel, but as a friend
I had to give you my condolences.

732
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,537
Thank you,
but you know we loathed each other.

733
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:54,540
Yes, Lope, but she was your sister.

734
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,548
Do you think I would go to my sister's
burial, that parade of cassocks?

735
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,633
I remember my childhood.

736
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:08,679
She'll have died grieving,
I was still alive and sinning.

737
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,264
Do you believe she was thinking

738
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,767
of something other than
making her peace with God?

739
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:16,478
Yes, of more earthly things.

740
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:19,523
If parents could take certain things
to paradise,

741
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,985
- ...children would get nothing.
- What are you saying?

742
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:25,445
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

743
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,782
After all the hardship
you can live comfortably.

744
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,118
Yes, the dead in the grave,
the living...

745
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:34,454
- But, Lope...
- Come on, Cosme, I'll be late.

746
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,748
What I wanted to say was...

747
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,419
Remember that I had to sell it all?

748
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,297
I bought it back from the same Jew.

749
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:46,550
Tristana...

750
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:48,969
Tristful Ana...

751
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:53,599
Well, I won't drink any more tonight.

752
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,642
A drop, and that's it.

753
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,273
Here, drink some, woman...

754
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:03,817
You don't want to?

755
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,819
It's your loss.

756
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,251
Sir, I have to tell you something.

757
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:24,212
I've kept it to myself for two days.

758
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,173
But as you're going to find out,

759
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,050
the sooner the better.

760
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,260
Miss Tristana...

761
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:31,970
is here.

762
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:37,434
- Tristana?
- Yes, sir.

763
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:41,730
- Why is she here?
- You should ask Don Horacio.

764
01:05:41,897 --> 01:05:45,901
- She came with him?
- Yes, he wants to talk to you.

765
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:47,569
I've got nothing to say.

766
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:50,072
If they want anything, she can come.

767
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,368
I wish she could.
She's ill. It's very serious, sir.

768
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:56,495
You haven't seen her for two years.

769
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:58,747
The poor girl's changed a lot.

770
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:11,802
Let's go.

771
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:45,210
First of all, please excuse
my behavior at our last meeting.

772
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:55,637
I'm willing to satisfy you,
however and wherever you wish.

773
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:57,556
That doesn't interest me now.

774
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:59,057
Please, sit down.

775
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:04,813
I've asked Tristana many times
to marry me,

776
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,815
but she's always refused.

777
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:08,942
I'm not rich,
but she's never lacked anything.

778
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,944
We've been very happy.

779
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:13,905
But now she's very ill.

780
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,367
- It may be incurable.
- What does she have?

781
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,578
A tumor in her leg.

782
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,122
The pain started a few weeks ago.

783
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,750
She's suffering terribly.

784
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,043
Has a doctor seen her?

785
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,759
Here's the diagnosis.

786
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:40,182
I don't understand this babble.
Why did you bring her here?

787
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:43,810
She was determined to come.
She drove me crazy, insisting.

788
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,063
She thinks she's going to die.

789
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,108
She still thinks of you as a father.

790
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:53,820
- She wants to die in your house.
- And if I don't take her in?

791
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:55,280
I'll take her away.

792
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,532
I'm not trying to abandon her.

793
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,912
If I open my doors to Tristana,

794
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:03,747
what will you do?

795
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,542
I'll stay in the city
to see what happens.

796
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,630
I wouldn't have the bad taste
to impose my presence on you.

797
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:16,259
Tell her I'll come to get her tomorrow
with Saturna.

798
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,485
- What happened?
- She won't get away from me now.

799
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:35,904
If she comes into my house
she'll never leave it.

800
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:37,114
Come on.

801
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,164
Under the lamp.

802
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,960
A little more, that's fine.

803
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:52,462
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

804
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,136
- Well?
- I've almost finished.

805
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:15,443
This heat will ease the pain.

806
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,029
It's incurable.

807
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:21,032
- It hurts so much.
- Come now.

808
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,702
No one has ever died
from a sore knee.

809
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,539
How are you, my beauty?

810
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,040
Better, aren't you?

811
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,793
Saturno has come to see you.

812
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,963
Dr. Miquis says
that you're much better now,

813
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,923
and that pain
is a sign of improvement.

814
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,466
Saturno, go away.

815
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,635
Come on, cheer up.

816
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:45,682
You'll see, in a few days
you'll be up and even dancing.

817
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:49,769
I know what I've got.
No more dancing, or even walking.

818
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:51,605
You have to fight.

819
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:54,065
I'm confident. You should be too.

820
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,569
The piano you longed for
is in the sitting room.

821
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:01,406
We'll see if that progress
you boasted of was real.

822
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:04,451
I can never play again.

823
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:07,370
But you don't play the piano
with your leg!

824
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:11,666
- Come on, brighten up!
- With this pain...

825
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,377
I told you, that's a good sign.

826
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,880
It means the illness is reacting.

827
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,678
- How is my favorite patient?
- Worse than ever, doctor.

828
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:28,391
Leave me alone with her.

829
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:41,112
- How are your spirits, Tristana?
- I had a temperature last night.

830
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,906
I'm very ill, aren't I?

831
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,866
Tell me the truth.

832
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:48,078
I've told you before
that this is a common case.

833
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,914
It's painful, but that will soon pass.

834
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,208
A few days ago, I wanted to live.

835
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,877
Now I'd rather die.

836
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,511
She's in a very bad way.

837
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:07,806
If you'd let me put on a poultice,

838
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,558
- she'd be feeling better.
- Don't talk rubbish.

839
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:19,943
My dear Don Lope,

840
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,654
we are faced with what I'd feared.

841
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:24,447
Tristana is very ill.

842
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,367
- We have to speak clearly.
- Go ahead.

843
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:30,078
She is suffering
from blood poisoning.

844
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,038
We have to operate...

845
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:34,582
to amputate her leg.

846
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,377
The poor girl.

847
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,880
She'll be horribly mutilated.

848
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,342
- When?
- We can't wait another day.

849
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:48,096
What science is this
when the only cure is amputation?

850
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,475
Go and keep her company.

851
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:58,773
Find some other way.
Cut off both my legs if you want!

852
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:01,735
Forgive me.

853
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,696
I'm mad
and I don't know what I'm saying.

854
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,115
Do whatever you think best.

855
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,910
My friend Luis Alonso,
a surgeon, will help me.

856
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,997
Have this note
sent to his home immediately.

857
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,917
I think that, with the amputation,
we may save her.

858
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,128
What? You may save her?

859
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:23,965
- Is it not certain?
- Science isn't infallible.

860
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:27,010
It would help if she had
other sources of health.

861
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:31,306
I know from experience
how a clear conscience can help.

862
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:35,310
So find a priest this afternoon
to hear her confession.

863
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:36,936
Priests in my house?

864
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:38,313
Never!

865
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,359
I appreciate the advice,
but I can't accept it.

866
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:47,030
I know Jesus was
the first socialist, etc. So what?

867
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:50,450
The true priests are those of us
who defend the innocent,

868
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:54,496
the enemies of injustice,
hypocrisy and filthy lucre.

869
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,122
I'm going to see the patient.

870
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:28,029
Thank you.

871
01:13:38,206 --> 01:13:39,249
Excuse me.

872
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:42,210
Good morning.

873
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:44,254
Don't think this is a coincidence.

874
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:47,507
I know you come here often,
I wanted to speak to you.

875
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,467
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

876
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:54,180
No, I won't have anything, thank you.

877
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,934
Are you going to stay here long?

878
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,603
I can't go until I know about Tristana...

879
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,649
Yes, sir. You know about her leg.

880
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,693
It's a pity, isn't it?

881
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:10,113
All that charm,
and she's crippled forever.

882
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,990
You understand my grief.

883
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:15,660
I look at her with the purest,
disinterested love.

884
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,955
That's why I want
to make her life pleasant.

885
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:20,540
Anyway...

886
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,084
her fickle spirit needs you.

887
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,628
You think I'm a toy?

888
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,173
I can't share an old man's criterion.

889
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:31,134
And Tristana's feelings
aren't as fickle as you think.

890
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,053
You're too young
to understand certain things.

891
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,932
- But we won't get angry over that.
- What do you want from me?

892
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,518
That you go and see her.

893
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,605
I'm not a monster, feelings change.

894
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,441
I've realized
that she's missing something.

895
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:50,195
You, undoubtedly.
Go and see her every day.

896
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:53,198
- It's embarrassing for me.
- Go in the afternoons.

897
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:54,616
From 4:00 to 6:00.

898
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:58,036
- That's when I usually take a walk.
- Thank you.

899
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,914
Don't thank me.
I'm doing it for her.

900
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:28,983
Your marrons glacés arrived.
Would you like to take them?

901
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,778
No, not now,
I'll pick them up later.

902
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,071
As you wish.

903
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,477
When are you going back?

904
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,105
In a month, at the latest.

905
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:00,700
You want me to tell you something?

906
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:01,909
Yes.

907
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:06,372
If you'd loved me,
you wouldn't have brought me here.

908
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,292
I didn't bring you.
You insisted on coming.

909
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:12,337
- You thought you were dying.
- But I'm still alive!

910
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,131
This is the limit!
You're so unfair.

911
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:16,466
Perhaps.

912
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:21,387
Don Lope would never have brought me
to another man's house.

913
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:30,063
I can't believe this.
You've changed.

914
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:34,067
Obviously! You think I can
be the same with this?

915
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:41,407
Forgive me if I was harsh with you.

916
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,410
You should leave me alone.
Go away.

917
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:49,123
I sincerely hope
your exhibition is a success.

918
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,504
I have a lot to do.
I'll come back tomorrow.

919
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,381
As you wish.

920
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:03,680
Until tomorrow.

921
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:45,096
You should wear it all the time,
to get used to it.

922
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,681
It hurts me.

923
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,893
- Is he leaving?
- Tomorrow.

924
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,940
- When will he be back?
- I don't know. Perhaps never.

925
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:59,694
- Here, I know you like them.
- Marrons glacés? Thank you.

926
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,655
You get lovelier as the days pass.

927
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:05,783
- Don't make fun of me.
- You know I couldn't.

928
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,785
You think your lameness
is an obstacle

929
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:11,414
but you're more attractive now
for a lot of people.

930
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:14,292
I remember a woman in Paris
when I was young.

931
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,794
She walked on the boulevards
with her crutches.

932
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,172
There were always
several men following her.

933
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,090
It takes all kinds.

934
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:23,468
Your bath is ready, miss.

935
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,513
- Shall I give you a rubdown first?
- Rubdowns? A massage, woman!

936
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:23,569
Would you like a hot drink
before we go back home?

937
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:27,240
No, I don't want to talk.

938
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,375
Ma'am, Don Lope...

939
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:41,087
You're as vigorous as ever,
the cold doesn't affect you.

940
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:44,048
I won't ask you, ma'am,
because you couldn't look better.

941
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:48,094
You're very kind.
Say thank you, Lope.

942
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:52,640
- Thank you, captain.
- We would like to pay you a visit

943
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:55,268
to thank you for your donation

944
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,436
to our orphans' fund.

945
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:02,567
But I'll take this happy opportunity
to express my gratitude personally.

946
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:04,151
We must help others.

947
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:06,529
We were doing our duty, sir.

948
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,490
There are many rich people,
but unfortunately

949
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:12,410
that kind of donation is very rare.

950
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:17,707
- Goodbye Don Lope, ma'am.
- My respects, captain.

951
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,378
Let's go.

952
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:37,560
If the olive grove were cared for,
it would be the best here.

953
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:39,937
Don't change the subject, dear sir.

954
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,817
I've told you everything
I had to say.

955
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:48,029
In your case,
the priest's mission has ended.

956
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:51,949
- What you need is...
- Don't talk to me about doctors.

957
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,452
I need something else.

958
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:57,830
I've told you lots of times,
get married.

959
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:02,460
How can I marry him
if I can't stand the sight of him?

960
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,840
You have to overcome
that unhealthy passion.

961
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:12,428
When he was really doing you harm,
you accepted it without a word.

962
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:16,182
And now, when he's behaving
so well with you...

963
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:19,060
What more can you ask for?

964
01:22:19,936 --> 01:22:22,438
The better he is, the less I love him.

965
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:26,734
- But that's irrational!
- Yes, I know that perfectly well.

966
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:31,030
Be careful. There's something
diabolical about that bitterness.

967
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,742
Of course, you're young and he's...

968
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:38,204
But as in your case, the aim
of marriage is not procreation,

969
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:42,041
but simply to sanctify
a sinful situation...

970
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:46,128
Well, you know what I mean.

971
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,466
Ask him to marry you
and you'll see how he agrees.

972
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:53,219
Don't you see that he's changed?

973
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:57,139
With old age, things become easier,
rough edges are smoothed,

974
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:58,808
you think differently.

975
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:01,435
He doesn't stop you
going to church now,

976
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,312
he even goes with you.

977
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,438
Get married, dear.

978
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:08,067
If you were ever fond of him,
you must still feel something.

979
01:23:08,234 --> 01:23:11,404
Don Ambrosio, if you've finished,
I can give you a lift.

980
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,114
I'd appreciate that.

981
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,450
I'm going to buy some fruit trees.
I'm taking the gardener.

982
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:18,703
- Do you want anything?
- Nothing.

983
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:28,004
Well, let's go.

984
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:48,370
In the name of Our Lord,
Jesus Christ, go in peace.

985
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,831
May He always be with you.

986
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:53,959
Congratulations, Tristana.

987
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,045
Likewise, Don Lope.

988
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:05,948
Lope, my dear...

989
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,202
- Good night.
- Where are you going?

990
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:11,412
To bed.

991
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,206
On a night like this,
you're leaving me on my own?

992
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:15,457
Really!

993
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:19,920
It's incredible that you still have
those illusions at your age.

994
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:34,768
Good night, sir.

995
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:54,830
10 plus 5, 15.

996
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:57,541
Plus 3, 18.

997
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:00,961
Plus 3, 21.

998
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:04,214
Plus 4, 25.

999
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,520
Wafers!

1000
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:26,153
- How is your health, Tristana?
- And your mother's?

1001
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,615
- Excellent.
- So is mine, thank you. Goodbye.

1002
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:30,741
Let's go.

1003
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:48,360
The brazier is an ideal temperature.

1004
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:52,322
It's cold outside!
My ears were frozen when I arrived.

1005
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,616
As I was saying,

1006
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:57,703
I rarely go to the discussions
at the cafe.

1007
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,830
There are only two of us of my age.

1008
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:01,415
You'll bury them all.

1009
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:03,459
You can still give us trouble.

1010
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,085
Don't you believe it.

1011
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:09,548
I have lots of aches and pains.
And this pump isn't...

1012
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:11,925
And there's the fistula.

1013
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:16,221
You're just worrying, Lope.
You're spoiled, that's the problem.

1014
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:21,143
Excuse me a moment.
I forgot my pills.

1015
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,110
He's finished...

1016
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:47,294
My memory's getting worse.
I always forget...

1017
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:49,087
The pill.

1018
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,257
Pass me the milk, please.
Thank you.

1019
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:53,759
What an aroma!

1020
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:55,219
With this exquisite product

1021
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:58,430
how can we not pity
those who settle for tea?

1022
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:00,265
I agree entirely.

1023
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:02,059
Saturna is a great cook.

1024
01:32:02,226 --> 01:32:04,311
It's so creamy and thick!

1025
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,146
Just right.

1026
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:09,358
We get nothing like this at home.

1027
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:13,195
I admit it, if Don Lope
wasn't so kind as to invite me...

1028
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:15,405
A little more sugar, please.

1029
01:32:16,073 --> 01:32:17,157
Thank you.

1030
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:21,453
If you can't enjoy it as much at home,
it's because you don't want to.

1031
01:32:22,246 --> 01:32:25,999
He's talking about a little income
that my parents left me.

1032
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:29,628
A little income?
I'd happily settle for half.

1033
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:33,048
So, Don Candido,
are your emoluments not enough?

1034
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:35,133
We earn less than a laborer.

1035
01:32:35,384 --> 01:32:38,512
And I'm maintaining a widowed sister
and her three children.

1036
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:47,980
That's enough, Don Lope will think
we come here for an ulterior motive.

1037
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:51,942
Our host knows it's not my custom
to ask for myself.

1038
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:53,694
I vouch for that.

1039
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:58,156
- Another cup?
- Just half full.

1040
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:11,211
After all, life isn't as dark
as many believe.

1041
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,506
It's snowing heavily.

1042
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,259
But we're warm in here.

1043
01:33:18,385 --> 01:33:19,595
Oh, my!

1044
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:46,663
Tristana!

1045
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,213
Tristana!

1046
01:34:19,446 --> 01:34:21,907
What is it?
Do you feel ill?

1047
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:25,577
Is it indigestion?

1048
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,039
You want some herb tea?

1049
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:34,294
No, Tristana, this is more serious.

1050
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:37,339
I've a pain here that's killing me.

1051
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:39,216
Call the doctor!

1052
01:34:39,925 --> 01:34:42,386
Do you really feel that bad?

1053
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,430
Call the doctor!

1054
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:12,290
Get me 240.

1055
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,711
It's me. Dr. Miquis?

1056
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:20,048
Listen, he's in great pain.

1057
01:35:20,549 --> 01:35:21,591
Very well.

1058
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:24,761
Come as soon as you can.

1059
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:49,703
Lope...

1060
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,788
Lope...

1061
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:55,917
Dr. Miquis is on his way.

1062
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,799
Don't you hear me, Lope?
Don't you hear me?

1063
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:31,406
