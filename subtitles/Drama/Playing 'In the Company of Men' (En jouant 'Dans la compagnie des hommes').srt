1
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:54,979
I said "You are gods,
sons of the Most High",

2
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,138
but you shall die like men
and fall like princes."

3
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,297
OF GODS AND MEN

4
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:52,073
<i>Lord, open my lips...</i>

5
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:58,493
<i>And my mouth will
proclaim your praise...</i>

6
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,040
Aspirin...

7
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:41,310
And cough syrup.

8
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,274
There's hot tea.

9
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,177
Help me, Papa.

10
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,637
- Brother Luc.
- Nouredine, labesse?

11
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,024
And you?

12
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:22,614
Saturday is Jamel's khtana.

13
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,907
Will there be a party?

14
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:26,678
Yes. You're all invited.

15
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:29,467
- Will you come?
- I'd love to.

16
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,214
See you later. Take care.

17
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,917
Yes, you too.

18
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,994
Little brat! You're here?

19
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:43,875
Not at school today?

20
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:06,038
Good.

21
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,670
It's almost dry.

22
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:11,348
Stop with the bandages.

23
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,226
Be sure to keep her
out of the sun.

24
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:17,225
That would be dangerous.
Forbidden.

25
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:20,264
Otherwise, all's well.

26
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,356
Little kiss.

27
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:29,385
What else?

28
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,472
I see.

29
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,836
It's serious.

30
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,306
Be right back.

31
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,290
Asleep, brother?

32
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,143
Here.

33
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,536
Guide us in the straight path

34
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:11,294
the path of those whom
Thou hast blessed

35
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,775
not those against whom
Thou art wrathful

36
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,274
nor those who are astray.

37
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:22,902
Amen.

38
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:27,869
The Messenger believes
in what was sent down to him

39
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:31,298
from his Lord, and the believers:

40
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:36,265
Each one believes in God,
His angels...

41
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,798
His Books and His Messengers.

42
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:44,225
We make no division
between any one of His Messengers.

43
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,697
They say: "We hear and obey."

44
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,542
"Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness."

45
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:54,539
"Unto Thee is the homecoming."

46
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:59,468
God charges no soul
save to its capacity.

47
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,263
It will be rewarded
for good it has done...

48
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,832
and punished for evil
it has done.

49
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:12,942
Lord, take us not to task
if we forget or make mistake.

50
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:16,954
Lord, charge us not with load...

51
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:21,121
such as Thou didst lay
upon those before us.

52
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:27,466
Lord, do not burden us beyond what
we have strength to bear.

53
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:32,291
And pardon us, and forgive us...

54
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:34,600
and have mercy on us.

55
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,323
Thou art our Protector.

56
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:41,633
And help us against people
of the unbelievers.

57
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:51,483
(Honey of Atlas.)

58
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:12,309
How do you know
when you're in love?

59
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:15,134
There's...

60
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:18,904
something inside you
that comes alive.

61
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,319
The presence of someone.

62
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:26,522
It's irrepressible and makes
your heart beat faster, usually.

63
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:33,160
It's an attraction, a desire...

64
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,128
It's very beautiful.

65
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:39,246
No use asking too many questions.

66
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:41,079
It just happens.

67
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:43,771
Things are as usual,
then suddenly...

68
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:47,186
happiness arrives,
or the hope of it.

69
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:48,902
It's lots of things.

70
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,914
But you're in turmoil.

71
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:53,385
Great turmoil.

72
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:55,720
Especially the first time.

73
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,395
Your father spoke to me
about Khaled.

74
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,395
My father speaks to much.

75
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:05,839
I don't want that.

76
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,773
I feel none of the things
you mentioned when I see Khaled.

77
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,410
That means it's not very serious.

78
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,908
My father wants it, not me.

79
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,194
That's another problem.

80
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,320
Ever been in love?

81
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,973
Several times, yes.

82
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:40,275
And then I encountered another love,
even greater.

83
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,821
And I answered that love.

84
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:47,609
It's been a while now.

85
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,306
Over 60 years.

86
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:56,931
Here, you have to put
your son's address.

87
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,875
He's no longer at home?

88
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:01,368
He lives far away now.

89
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:07,842
Here.

90
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,356
Abdallah...

91
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:17,834
Taroudi.

92
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:22,650
13th Etretat Street.

93
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:26,111
Le Havre.

94
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:35,705
And here they ask for two photos.

95
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,394
Do you have photos?

96
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:44,314
Listen, Tuesday we're
going to the market.

97
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,066
We can take you along.

98
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,012
And have photos taken.

99
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,084
Okay?

100
00:21:11,882 --> 00:21:13,968
My cousin from Mostaganem...

101
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:17,001
They killed her granddaughter.

102
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:19,394
This afternoon.

103
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,748
She's 18. Samira.

104
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,571
They stabbed her on the bus.

105
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,914
Right in the heart.

106
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,095
Those dogs.

107
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:32,217
They threw her out like a dog.

108
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,105
And for veil!

109
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:36,777
She didn't wear the hijab.

110
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:40,680
What's the problem with these
people? It's beyond me.

111
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:42,512
Is that normal?

112
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:45,747
God says in the Koran:

113
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,374
You kill your brother,
you go to hell.

114
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:53,548
They say they're religious.
They've never read the Koran.

115
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,882
In the Koran, its written down.

116
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,890
Does it make sense to you?

117
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:00,904
Look at what's happening in France.

118
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:03,136
Schoolgirls make an uproar...

119
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,713
about wearing a veil.

120
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:08,203
The world's gone mad, Christian.

121
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:09,740
True.

122
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:13,743
They're killing imams too.

123
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:16,297
Yesterday they killed an imam
in the street.

124
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:18,332
Where are we going?

125
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:22,085
I don't know who these people are.
Only God knows.

126
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,757
This is new. No one understands.

127
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:26,590
Who's killing who?

128
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:31,497
We'll pray for Samira
and her family.

129
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:33,261
May she go to Heaven.

130
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:13,709
It's not mine.

131
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:15,276
Whose then?

132
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:16,650
The haji's.

133
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:42,106
Get lost!

134
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,085
Kill him!

135
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:55,324
Beat it!

136
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,394
Are you stupid?

137
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:43,810
Christian!

138
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,107
- They killed the Croatians!
- What?

139
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,467
Our friends, the Croat workers.

140
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:54,535
Throats slashed, all of them.

141
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:22,294
You need military protection.

142
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,608
That is not an option.

143
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:28,345
How can you say that?
Those men were killed nearby!

144
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:30,212
The atrocities will continue.

145
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:34,371
The Wali's offer
deserves to be discussed.

146
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,694
There are families here.
Think of them.

147
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,953
I made my decision. I refuse.

148
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,642
Let's speak inside, alright?

149
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:56,505
We'll lock the gate at 7:30
and take no night calls.

150
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:58,644
Why do you think that's enough?

151
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,519
You don't know them.

152
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,169
Try to make him see reason.

153
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,180
Is your phone working?

154
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:20,755
Yes, we can't complain.

155
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:23,549
Call us before it's too late.

156
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:55,459
<i>Because He is with us
in this time of violence...</i>

157
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:00,059
<i>let us not dream
that He is everywhere...</i>

158
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,182
<i>other than where we die.</i>

159
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,292
<i>Let us make no haste.</i>

160
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:08,887
<i>Let us draw patience from him.</i>

161
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:14,526
<i>Let us turn to the Man of Sorrows.</i>

162
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:19,658
<i>Who beckons us from the cross...</i>

163
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:27,647
<i>Because he is with us
as on Easter morn...</i>

164
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:34,442
<i>Let us not forgot...
the blood he shed.</i>

166
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:36,621
<i>Let us break the bread...</i>

167
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:41,828
<i>Let us drink from
the chalice of passage...</i>

168
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:47,285
<i>Let us greet the one
who sacrificed himself</i>

169
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:52,533
<i>by loving us until the end.</i>

170
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,301
Through him, with him and in him...

171
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,274
you shall receive, Almighty Father...

172
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:36,932
in the unity of the Holy Spirit...

173
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,956
all glory and honor,
forever and ever.

174
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:45,857
How could you decide this
without consulting us?

175
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:48,496
All our lives are at stake.

176
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,114
What would you have done?

177
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:55,592
I'd have let everyone speak
and listened to each position.

178
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:57,840
To answer what, in the end?

179
00:28:58,254 --> 00:28:59,845
The answer doesn't matter.

180
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:04,864
The very principle of community
is compromised by your attitude.

181
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:11,198
Alright, then, who wants the army
present in the monastery?

182
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:16,460
You refuse to understand
what we're saying.

183
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:17,903
I do understand very well!

184
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:21,066
None of us chose to live here...

185
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:23,783
to be protected by
a corrupt government.

186
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:32,793
Christian...

187
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:36,491
we didn't elect you
to decide on your own.

188
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:45,155
And if they come to monastery?

189
00:29:46,472 --> 00:29:47,711
We lie down and die?

190
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:52,158
It's a risk.

191
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,217
We were called to live here.

192
00:29:57,721 --> 00:29:59,679
In this country, with these people...

193
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,486
who are also afraid.

194
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,843
We will live with this unknown, yes.

195
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:11,898
I didn't come here
to commit collective suicide.

196
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,312
Maybe we can try to figure out...

197
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:20,610
what each of us could do
if they came here.

198
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:24,275
What's there to do?

199
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:26,546
Look at the Croatians.

200
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,620
Play hide-and-seek.

201
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,034
Cough.

202
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:32,023
Once more.

203
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:43,755
You'll outlive us all.

204
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,716
Hello, haji.

205
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:50,910
Still got your head?

206
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:53,629
I don't care. They can have my head.

207
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,972
May I?

208
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,508
Sure. Be my guest.

209
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:40,970
The roads are blocked.

210
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,946
I won't go to Meznir today.

211
00:33:44,494 --> 00:33:45,952
Not after what happened.

212
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:27,863
We don't need anything.
I'll let you know.

213
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:33,136
Christmas is in a week.

214
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,173
You know it's important
for us to be here together.

215
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:41,789
Thanks again.

216
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:44,244
Talk to you soon.

217
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:55,885
Accepting our powerlessness
and our extreme poverty...

218
00:35:56,255 --> 00:36:00,332
is an invitation, an urgent appeal
to create with others...

219
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:02,789
relationships not based on power.

220
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,873
Recognizing my weaknesses,
I accept those of others.

221
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:09,916
I can bear them, make them mine...

222
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,760
in imitation of Christ.

223
00:36:12,162 --> 00:36:15,298
Such an attitude transform us
for our mission.

224
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,246
Weakness in itself is not a virtue..

225
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:22,040
But the expression
of a fundamental reality...

226
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:26,908
which must constantly
be refashioned by faith...

227
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:29,719
hope and love.

228
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:33,966
The apostle's weakness
is like Christ's...

229
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,944
rooted in the mystery of Easter...

230
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:38,964
and the strength of the spirit.

231
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,952
It is neither passivity

232
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:42,509
nor resignation.

233
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:44,406
It requires great courage...

234
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,129
and incites one
to defend justice and truth...

235
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:51,021
and to denounce the temptation...

236
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,446
of force and power.

237
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,650
End of article.

238
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:58,078
New article.

239
00:36:58,422 --> 00:36:59,818
By Carlo Carretto...

240
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:01,504
"The God Who is Coming."

241
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:03,800
Often throughout my life...

242
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:07,737
I've wondered how God
could act so strangely.

243
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:10,536
Why does he stay silent to long?

244
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,604
Why is faith so bitter?

245
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:19,262
<i>And nothing exists except love...</i>

246
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,341
<i>Except love which now begins...</i>

247
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:28,648
<i>By separating sand from water...</i>

248
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:33,113
<i>God has prepared earth like cradle...</i>

249
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,769
<i>For his coming from above...</i>

250
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:41,897
<i>This is the night...</i>

251
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:46,471
<i>Happy night in Palestine...</i>

252
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:50,493
<i>And nothing exists except Child...</i>

253
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:54,783
<i>Except the Child of life divine...</i>

254
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:11,788
What do you want?

255
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,091
- Are you the Pope?
- No.

256
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:18,483
Where's the Pope?

257
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:20,836
There's no Pope here.

258
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:22,769
Your leader, what's his name?

259
00:38:23,747 --> 00:38:24,821
His name!

260
00:38:25,982 --> 00:38:27,211
Brother Christian.

261
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:30,665
Christian!

262
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:00,504
Who are you? Christian?

263
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:17,982
Come on.

264
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,163
Here he is.

265
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,843
This is Christian.

266
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:28,647
What do you want?

267
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:31,419
This is a house of peace.

268
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:34,500
Are you Christian?

269
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:36,397
Yes.

270
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:40,435
No weapons allowed here.

271
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:44,805
If you wish to speak, you must
leave them outside monastery.

272
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:46,588
Please.

273
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,454
I never part with mine.

274
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:54,198
Then follow me. We'll talk outside.

275
00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:14,424
I need the doc.

276
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:21,461
He has to come with us.

277
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:23,385
Impossible.

278
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,963
I have 3 men wounded an hour away.

279
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:33,142
He can't leave here. He's sick.
He's old and asthmatic.

280
00:40:34,357 --> 00:40:37,096
Brother Luc
sees patients at the clinic.

281
00:40:38,345 --> 00:40:41,303
He tends to everyone
who needs his help.

282
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,640
Their identity is not an issue
and never will be.

283
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:46,350
That's all.

284
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,952
So you can give us medicine.

285
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,291
We're short on supplies.

286
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,505
We see 100 villagers a day.

287
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:57,670
Enough!

288
00:40:59,362 --> 00:41:00,796
You have no choice!

289
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:03,183
Yes.

290
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,967
I do.

291
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,276
We can't give what we don't have.

292
00:41:09,587 --> 00:41:12,997
Ask your brothers in the village.
We live modestly.

293
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:15,606
With products we grow.

294
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,598
You know Koran?

295
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:24,595
"Those nearest in love
to the believers..."

296
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:27,516
"are those
who say 'We are Christians'..."

297
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:31,681
"Among them are priests and monks."

298
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,479
Priests and monks...

299
00:41:35,178 --> 00:41:38,595
and they wax not proud.

300
00:41:40,273 --> 00:41:42,456
That's why
we're close to our neighbors.

301
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,183
Come on, let's go.

302
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:14,218
Tonight
is different from other nights.

303
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:22,537
Why?

304
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:23,581
It's Christmas.

305
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:27,642
We celebrate the birth
of the Prince of peace.

306
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,117
The Prince of peace?

307
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:35,284
<i>Sidna Aissa.</i>

308
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Jesus.

309
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,049
I'm sorry, then.

310
00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:57,420
I didn't know.

311
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:41,589
Christophe?

312
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,206
Michel?

313
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:52,434
Come out now.

314
00:43:54,188 --> 00:43:55,288
They're gone.

315
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,045
We're fine.

316
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:58,355
We made it.

317
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:25,671
Hold this down gently.

318
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:36,572
You can let go.

319
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,630
You'll be fine. Don't worry.

320
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:57,181
<i>This is the night...</i>

321
00:44:57,399 --> 00:45:02,164
<i>The immense night of origins...</i>

322
00:45:03,123 --> 00:45:07,545
<i>And nothing exists except love...</i>

323
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:12,482
<i>Except love which now begins...</i>

324
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:17,674
<i>By separating sand from water...</i>

325
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:23,118
<i>God has prepared the earth
like a cradle...</i>

326
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:29,429
<i>For his coming from above...</i>

327
00:45:31,774 --> 00:45:34,533
<i>This is the night...</i>

328
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:39,612
<i>The happy night of Palestine...</i>

329
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:45,407
<i>And nothing exists except the Child...</i>

330
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:51,816
<i>Except the Child of life divine...</i>

331
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:56,789
<i>By taking flesh of our flesh...</i>

332
00:45:56,825 --> 00:46:02,194
<i>God our desert did refresh...</i>

333
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:08,118
<i>And made a land of boundless spring...</i>

334
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:13,760
<i>This is the night...</i>

335
00:46:14,364 --> 00:46:19,635
<i>The long night in which we grope...</i>

336
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:25,154
<i>And nothing exists
except this place...</i>

337
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,223
<i>Except this place of ruined hope...</i>

338
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:36,196
<i>By stopping in our abode...</i>

339
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:41,398
<i>God, as with the bush, did forebode...</i>

340
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:47,430
<i>The world on which fire would fall...</i>

341
00:47:31,406 --> 00:47:32,561
Why...

342
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:35,376
why not give them medicine?

343
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,370
We have enough.

344
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:42,263
If you have medicine,
I'd like to know about it.

345
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,213
We can't start negotiating.

346
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:49,082
Every day they'll ask for more.

347
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,397
I agree with Luc.

348
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:55,758
Don't forget,
I was held at gunpoint.

349
00:47:58,327 --> 00:48:01,528
If we stay, our lives
would be at risk every day.

350
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:05,022
I became a monk to live.

351
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,539
Not to sit back
and have my throat slit.

352
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:10,732
You're right, Celestin.

353
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:13,512
We shouldn't be seeking martyrdom.

354
00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:17,578
Maybe we should leave.

355
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:22,273
Or at least
take refuge in a safer place.

356
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:25,574
I think that Celestin...

357
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:28,669
is asking a good question.

358
00:48:30,405 --> 00:48:34,014
They've come once. They'll be back
sooner than we think.

359
00:48:36,698 --> 00:48:39,726
The fact that
you refused all their demands...

360
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:42,819
could be taken
as a declaration of war.

361
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:46,405
Look what they did to Croatians.

362
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:51,116
If they'd wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

363
00:48:52,272 --> 00:48:55,532
Maybe Fayattia
isn't the only one who decides.

364
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,877
Maybe others
will come back tomorrow.

365
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:04,721
There's another solution.

366
00:49:07,174 --> 00:49:08,377
Leave for good.

367
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:14,911
We should each decide
according to his own conscience.

368
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:18,117
Go back to France...

369
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:22,524
or to another,
safer monastery in Africa.

370
00:49:24,078 --> 00:49:26,110
To leave is to run away.

371
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,873
And to leave village
to the terrorists.

372
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:32,314
We'd do it gradually...

373
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,658
so the villagers won't worry.

374
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,659
That won't change a thing.

375
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:41,531
The Good Shepherd doesn't
abandon his flock to the wolves.

376
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:49,664
We should each express our opinion
about leaving.

377
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:02,887
Jean-Pierre?

378
00:50:03,773 --> 00:50:05,017
We stay.

379
00:50:06,511 --> 00:50:08,830
Since when do we yield to arms?

380
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:11,835
Paul?

381
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,623
I think we should leave.

382
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,401
Gradually.

383
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:19,843
Celestin?

384
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,774
I'm ill. I want to leave.

385
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:26,023
Luc?

386
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:29,309
To leave is to die.

387
00:50:31,018 --> 00:50:32,398
I'm staying.

388
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:35,152
Michel?

389
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:41,098
I have no one else, anywhere.

390
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:43,460
I'll stay.

391
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:48,345
Amédée?

392
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,931
I don't know yet.

393
00:50:53,807 --> 00:50:55,866
We need to think...

394
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,878
and pray together.

395
00:51:05,124 --> 00:51:06,778
I think we should leave.

396
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:14,530
And you, Christian?

397
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:22,907
I agree with Amédée.
It's too early to decide.

398
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,265
Help will come from the Lord.

399
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:36,874
Who made heaven and earth.

400
00:53:32,186 --> 00:53:40,071
<i>We do not know your misery...</i>

401
00:53:40,629 --> 00:53:44,220
<i>Infinite Love...</i>

402
00:53:44,562 --> 00:53:48,175
<i>But you do have a heart...</i>

403
00:53:49,164 --> 00:53:55,482
<i>For you seek the prodigal son...</i>

404
00:53:55,814 --> 00:54:00,560
<i>And hold against your breast...</i>

405
00:54:00,562 --> 00:54:04,771
<i>This troublesome child...</i>

406
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:11,587
<i>Which is the world of mortals...</i>

407
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:23,389
<i>We do not see your face...</i>

408
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,311
<i>Infinite Love...</i>

409
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,976
<i>But you do have eyes...</i>

410
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:40,063
<i>For you weep through the oppressed...</i>

411
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:45,262
<i>And look upon us...</i>

412
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,114
<i>With a shining gaze...</i>

413
00:54:51,143 --> 00:54:57,435
<i>That reveals your forgiveness...</i>

414
00:56:34,187 --> 00:56:37,201
I fear for the fate of this country.

415
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:41,133
Yesterday two women teachers
were found murdered.

416
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:44,547
For telling teenagers
falling in love is normal...

417
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:46,539
that they're allowed to.

418
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:50,826
It's a 15-year-old girl
who tipped off the extremists.

419
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:53,147
We're as sad as you are.

420
00:56:54,727 --> 00:56:56,174
What do you know?

421
00:56:57,178 --> 00:56:58,541
This here is my country.

422
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:03,114
Besides being sad,
I'm tired of not seeing it grow up.

423
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:07,263
And despite what you think,
I blame French colonization.

424
00:57:07,953 --> 00:57:10,118
That organized plundering.

425
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:16,912
This is for you.

426
00:57:28,777 --> 00:57:30,745
Ministry of the Interior.

427
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,198
They mean business.

428
00:57:35,397 --> 00:57:36,882
They're giving you orders.

429
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:43,067
No one other than ourselves...

430
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:44,932
can decide that we must leave.

431
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:47,011
I'd have been surprised.

432
00:57:47,242 --> 00:57:48,883
Really surprised.

433
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:51,902
Your stubbornness
is getting dangerous.

434
00:57:55,868 --> 00:57:57,410
Look at all these people.

435
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:02,295
They're at home here.

436
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:06,622
They're terrorized.
They all wish they could leave.

437
00:58:06,623 --> 00:58:08,962
But they have no choice, no money.

438
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:15,469
It's not cowardly to want to leave.

439
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:17,415
It's about being free.

440
00:58:17,848 --> 00:58:20,035
Terror strikes Djelfa.

441
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:23,981
Sooner or later, it'll be you.

442
00:58:24,711 --> 00:58:27,498
No one can control
what's going on these days.

443
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,753
You'll end up
becoming just another pawn.

444
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,845
Your sacrifice
will eventually be exploited.

445
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:40,627
I've known you for years.

446
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,518
I have respect for you.

447
00:58:43,272 --> 00:58:45,544
And for what
your community has done.

448
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:48,787
But I would ask you
to go back to France.

449
00:59:10,972 --> 00:59:12,852
- Did your car break down?
- Yes, it broke down.

450
00:59:13,394 --> 00:59:15,729
Is any of you mechanic?

451
00:59:17,116 --> 00:59:20,607
If you know how to fix it,
be my guest.

452
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,495
Should I try?

453
00:59:29,542 --> 00:59:31,884
- Should I try?
- Is it in neutral?

454
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:37,306
You're in neutral? Go on, try.

455
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:40,488
All right, it's good. It's good.

456
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:25,420
Will the village need
the army to protect it?

457
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,112
Because...
they'll be back someday.

458
01:00:28,573 --> 01:00:30,468
Forget the army!

459
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:31,911
It's a disaster.

460
01:00:32,335 --> 01:00:33,936
The army won't come.

461
01:00:34,249 --> 01:00:36,336
The protection is you.

462
01:00:37,744 --> 01:00:40,680
This village
grew up with the monastery.

463
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,952
What was the name of
that priest, before?

464
01:00:45,878 --> 01:00:47,596
A while back, before the war.

465
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:49,276
Brother Bernard?

466
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:52,027
No, no, no. Another one. Old.

467
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:53,620
Brother Daniel.

468
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:55,583
That's him.

469
01:00:55,837 --> 01:00:56,837
Brother Daniel.

470
01:00:57,475 --> 01:00:59,762
He told my mother not to stay here.

471
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:03,245
To move to a city.
There was no more work here.

472
01:01:03,731 --> 01:01:07,675
She made him swear
to say nothing to my father.

473
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,875
Because my mother,
she feels good living here.

474
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:13,350
Comfortable.

475
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:21,293
We may be leaving.

476
01:01:22,594 --> 01:01:23,834
Why are you leaving?

477
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:32,622
We're like birds on a branch.

478
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:34,823
We don't know if we'll leave.

479
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:39,330
We're the birds.

480
01:01:39,615 --> 01:01:41,055
You're the branch.

481
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,505
If you go, we lose our footing.

482
01:01:55,636 --> 01:01:57,789
Forgive us our trespasses...

483
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:00,349
as we forgive those...

484
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,647
who trespass against us...

485
01:02:03,382 --> 01:02:05,872
and lead us not into temptation...

486
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,044
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

487
01:02:10,636 --> 01:02:13,198
<i>Let us bless the Lord...</i>

488
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,114
<i>We render thanks unto Him...</i>

489
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:29,380
So you want to leave?

490
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,413
I was thinking that.

491
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:42,385
I wonder what my life would be.

492
01:03:50,803 --> 01:03:52,493
Your family, in France?

493
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:54,375
They're worried?

494
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:57,867
I'm not sure they realize
what's going on here.

495
01:03:58,484 --> 01:04:00,276
I haven't said anything.

496
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,187
The last time I saw them,
it was strange.

497
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:10,177
What do you mean?

498
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:21,474
We celebrated my mom's 80th birthday
at the restaurant.

499
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:24,316
I saw everyone.

500
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:29,001
My sisters were there...

501
01:04:29,296 --> 01:04:31,592
nephews, nieces, my goddaughter.

502
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,743
Everyone was talking, telling stories.

503
01:04:35,116 --> 01:04:36,294
Taking pictures.

504
01:04:36,852 --> 01:04:38,731
They know that's not my thing.

505
01:04:40,816 --> 01:04:43,418
I was there, listening. I was happy.

506
01:04:45,573 --> 01:04:48,605
They put me next to my mom.

507
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:52,714
And at the same time...

508
01:04:55,288 --> 01:04:57,121
I was totally out of it.

509
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,453
I was thinking...

510
01:05:01,763 --> 01:05:03,968
if I stopped everything, if...

511
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:07,584
I could move back home.

512
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,030
Get back to work, plumbing.

513
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:13,940
Town council...

514
01:05:14,832 --> 01:05:16,963
fire department, chorus.

515
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:21,128
Then I thought:
No, that's not possible.

516
01:05:22,864 --> 01:05:24,778
My life's over here.

517
01:05:28,353 --> 01:05:30,139
Here. With you.

518
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:39,096
Christian's teaching today
was interesting.

519
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:42,283
Don't you think?

520
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:46,824
Did you understand anything?

521
01:05:49,674 --> 01:05:50,706
Fuck off!

522
01:05:56,228 --> 01:05:57,228
Okay.

523
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:00,924
Just tired. Not his fault.

524
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:06,361
"There was a time
when French toe-punt was crummy..."

525
01:07:06,362 --> 01:07:10,306
"and its Irish equivalent
a mere display of folklore."

526
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:19,151
"When these damned men didn't know
what to do with their ten digits..."

527
01:07:19,152 --> 01:07:23,764
"but were great at bending the rules
to piss everyone off."

528
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,163
Is that all?

529
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:32,575
"Even though we agree
with Mr. Briscou..."

530
01:07:32,576 --> 01:07:35,048
"that our amiable guests..."

531
01:07:35,725 --> 01:07:38,173
"never closed the game out..."

532
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:42,124
"we still wonder
whether they prefer, deep down..."

533
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:44,544
"the dervish-like scrums..."

534
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:47,177
"and bleak brawls of yesteryear."

535
01:07:50,092 --> 01:07:54,008
"Back when players still
cared about not being..."

536
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,106
"naughty old men."

537
01:07:58,956 --> 01:08:00,635
A little more.

538
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,458
Help me, help me.

539
01:10:12,117 --> 01:10:14,042
Don't abandon me.

540
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:17,379
Don't abandon me. Please.

541
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:19,351
Help me.

542
01:12:45,476 --> 01:12:49,459
Not very pretty. It got infected.

543
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:56,947
Tell him
I'll be giving him two shots.

544
01:12:59,716 --> 01:13:02,382
An antibiotic and a tetanus shot.

545
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:10,415
He is in pain. He needs medicine.

546
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,674
I will give him a tranquilizer.

547
01:13:14,051 --> 01:13:15,873
Let's clean this up.

548
01:13:28,082 --> 01:13:30,156
You'll be fine.

549
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:39,853
<i>Glory be to the Father,
and the Son and the Holy Spirit...</i>

550
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:43,624
<i>World without end...</i>

551
01:13:49,085 --> 01:13:56,560
<i>Save us, Lord...
Wilst we watch...</i>

553
01:13:57,581 --> 01:14:01,004
<i>Keep us, Lord...</i>

554
01:14:01,806 --> 01:14:04,957
<i>Whilst we sleep...</i>

555
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:12,167
<i>And we shall watch with Christ...</i>

556
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:18,329
<i>And we shall rest in peace...</i>

557
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:21,872
I'm worn out.

558
01:15:23,384 --> 01:15:24,949
Does Amédée help out?

559
01:15:25,237 --> 01:15:28,555
Fortunately. I don't know
how I'd manage otherwise.

560
01:15:31,186 --> 01:15:34,463
I've never had so many visits.

561
01:15:35,302 --> 01:15:37,954
I'm up to 150 a day.
Can you imagine?

562
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:41,724
People come from everywhere around.

563
01:15:42,369 --> 01:15:45,208
I'm dealing with new pathologies.

564
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:48,429
Lots of hypertension.
They're stressed.

565
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,960
Some are in state of shock.

566
01:15:51,222 --> 01:15:53,933
Not to mention
the effect on the kids.

567
01:15:57,969 --> 01:16:01,518
The villagers may talk
about these men we help.

568
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:03,148
Be careful.

569
01:16:04,254 --> 01:16:08,615
Throughout my career I've met
all sorts of different people.

570
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,818
Including Nazis.

571
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:14,192
And even... the devil.

573
01:16:22,398 --> 01:16:26,125
I'm not scared of terrorists,
even less of the army.

574
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,818
And I'm not scared of death.
I'm a free man.

575
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:46,083
Let the free man through!

576
01:17:15,536 --> 01:17:17,346
My men tied him to a truck...

577
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:18,957
dragged him through the city.

578
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:20,835
People jumped for joy.

579
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:22,583
Lucky for him he was dead.

580
01:17:22,966 --> 01:17:25,099
Why didn't you stop them?

581
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:27,029
Stop them?

582
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:32,043
Lots of people in the crowd
were victims of his atrocities.

583
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:33,142
Their families.

584
01:17:33,143 --> 01:17:34,465
Friends who died.

585
01:17:34,803 --> 01:17:36,041
Many innocent people.

586
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,346
Disgraceful.
No one should be treated this way.

587
01:17:39,687 --> 01:17:42,140
Want to know his favorite torture?

588
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,310
Fayattia and others like him
deserve no compassion.

589
01:17:46,968 --> 01:17:49,816
You're very indulgent
with the terrorists.

590
01:17:51,008 --> 01:17:52,322
Overindulgent.

591
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:57,061
Rumor has it
he was shielding the monastery.

592
01:17:57,686 --> 01:17:59,239
Did you ever treat them?

593
01:18:01,438 --> 01:18:02,782
Where did you find him?

594
01:18:05,295 --> 01:18:09,000
Two days ago,
the Wali's car was ambushed.

595
01:18:09,277 --> 01:18:10,668
Near Tikrit.

596
01:18:11,747 --> 01:18:13,378
The terrorists got away.

597
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,955
We found
a wounded man on the ground.

598
01:18:16,482 --> 01:18:18,719
His friends ditched him like a dog.

599
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:20,563
He talked about his mother.

600
01:18:20,873 --> 01:18:22,798
Said his name was Fayattia.

601
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,935
My men let him suffer.

602
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:27,989
He died
before we could make him our trophy.

603
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:31,799
How can you be sure it's him?

604
01:18:32,157 --> 01:18:34,567
Why do you think I asked you here?

605
01:18:55,632 --> 01:18:56,778
So?

606
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:03,691
It's him.

607
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,457
Get out. Go on.

608
01:19:34,139 --> 01:19:35,139
Outside.

609
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:50,982
I sleep badly.

610
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:55,726
The slightest noise wakes me.

611
01:19:57,197 --> 01:19:58,755
I think over my life.

612
01:20:01,874 --> 01:20:03,233
My choices.

613
01:20:07,918 --> 01:20:10,133
As a kid
I wanted to be a missionary.

614
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:16,450
Dying for my faith
shouldn't keep me up nights.

615
01:20:24,807 --> 01:20:26,142
Dying here...

616
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:28,607
here and now...

617
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,719
does it serve a purpose?

618
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:36,360
I don't know.

619
01:20:38,106 --> 01:20:39,773
I feel like I'm going mad.

620
01:20:42,226 --> 01:20:44,028
It's true that staying here...

621
01:20:45,809 --> 01:20:47,924
is as mad as becoming a monk.

622
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:55,216
Remember.

623
01:20:56,846 --> 01:20:59,001
You've already given your life.

624
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:03,109
You gave it by following Christ.

625
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:05,785
When you decided
to leave everything.

626
01:21:06,101 --> 01:21:07,543
Your life...

627
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:09,158
your family, your country.

628
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,314
The family you could have raised.

629
01:21:13,144 --> 01:21:14,887
I don't know if it's true anymore.

630
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:19,718
I pray.

631
01:21:22,454 --> 01:21:24,100
And I hear nothing.

632
01:21:29,168 --> 01:21:30,607
I don't get it.

633
01:21:32,552 --> 01:21:34,304
Why be martyrs?

634
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,290
For God?

635
01:21:37,164 --> 01:21:38,536
For be a heroes?

636
01:21:38,775 --> 01:21:40,434
To prove we're the best?

637
01:21:41,471 --> 01:21:44,486
We're martyrs out of love,
out of fidelity.

638
01:21:46,473 --> 01:21:47,800
If death...

639
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,815
overtake us, despite ourselves...

640
01:21:52,197 --> 01:21:53,686
because up to the end...

641
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:57,332
up to the end we'll try to avoid it...

642
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:01,314
our mission here
is to be brothers to all.

643
01:22:04,038 --> 01:22:05,680
Remember that love...

644
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:08,081
is eternal hope.

645
01:22:09,996 --> 01:22:12,660
Love endures everything.

646
01:22:19,294 --> 01:22:20,403
I'm sorry.

647
01:22:31,753 --> 01:22:35,224
<i>Like parched earth...</i>

648
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:39,841
<i>I stand before you, Lord...</i>

649
01:22:51,744 --> 01:22:54,454
<i>O Lord, hear my prayer...</i>

650
01:22:54,873 --> 01:22:58,039
<i>Listen to my cry for mercy...</i>

651
01:22:58,335 --> 01:23:00,963
<i>In your faithfulness, answer me...</i>

652
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:04,594
<i>Enter not into judgment
with your servant...</i>

653
01:23:05,163 --> 01:23:08,324
<i>For no man living
is righteous before You...</i>

654
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:12,904
<i>The enemy persecutes my soul...</i>

655
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:16,507
<i>He has smitten my life to the ground...</i>

656
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:20,587
<i>He has made me dwell in darkness...</i>

657
01:23:21,011 --> 01:23:24,244
<i>With those long dead...</i>

658
01:23:24,883 --> 01:23:28,240
<i>My spirit grows faint within me...</i>

659
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:32,960
<i>My heart within me, dismayed...</i>

660
01:23:33,626 --> 01:23:36,220
<i>Answer me quickly, O Lord...</i>

661
01:23:36,566 --> 01:23:39,459
<i>My spirit fails...</i>

662
01:23:39,832 --> 01:23:42,698
<i>Do not hide your face from me...</i>

663
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:46,816
<i>Lest I be like them
who fall into pit...</i>

664
01:23:47,892 --> 01:23:50,134
We've received
so many letters recently.

665
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:51,952
People are worried.

666
01:23:53,246 --> 01:23:55,179
I can't answer them all.

667
01:23:56,589 --> 01:24:01,261
There's that French journalist
who wants to meet us.

668
01:24:02,277 --> 01:24:04,016
I don't know what to tell her.

669
01:24:05,495 --> 01:24:09,647
We shouldn't expose ourselves
further by doing publicity.

670
01:24:11,082 --> 01:24:12,207
Of course, but...

671
01:24:14,072 --> 01:24:17,355
it's a way of making
people understand our choices.

672
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,263
To show that...

673
01:24:20,512 --> 01:24:22,348
amid all this drama,
for people here...

674
01:24:22,644 --> 01:24:24,741
still there's reason for hope.

675
01:24:25,556 --> 01:24:29,393
You know, hope
is not what interests journalists.

676
01:24:29,682 --> 01:24:31,029
It doesn't mobilize them.

677
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:32,363
Exactly.

678
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,751
Maybe we should mobilize them.

679
01:24:40,397 --> 01:24:42,720
I suggest we take a vote.

680
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:47,020
To see if we're all of one mind.

681
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:51,586
Who wants to leave?

682
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:58,033
I've already told you
my position on this matter...

683
01:24:59,131 --> 01:25:02,715
and my calling is to be here,
with everyone.

684
01:25:05,299 --> 01:25:07,048
I don't see myself leaving.

685
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:18,037
Leaving would lead nowhere.

686
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,752
I'm not ready to leave myself.

687
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:29,601
Last night I thought about leaving.

688
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,837
I'm not comfortable with it.

689
01:25:33,318 --> 01:25:34,746
Not at peace.

690
01:25:36,045 --> 01:25:39,625
Deciding to run of like that
makes no sense.

691
01:25:40,624 --> 01:25:43,932
We didn't come here
for our own personal interest.

692
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,496
I still think that our mission here
is not finished.

693
01:25:51,987 --> 01:25:52,987
I'm staying.

694
01:25:56,645 --> 01:25:59,282
I prayed all morning
while I was cooking.

695
01:26:00,177 --> 01:26:01,177
The disciple...

696
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:03,765
is not above his master.

697
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:10,303
This is no time for me to stray.

698
01:26:12,115 --> 01:26:14,553
Let God set the table here.

699
01:26:15,529 --> 01:26:16,746
For everyone.

700
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:19,712
Friends and enemies.

701
01:26:25,573 --> 01:26:26,946
And you, Christian?

702
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:36,068
Wildflowers don't move
to find the sun's rays.

703
01:26:37,515 --> 01:26:40,294
God makes them fecund...

704
01:26:40,831 --> 01:26:42,200
wherever they are.

705
01:26:45,957 --> 01:26:48,243
Who... prefers to stay?

707
01:28:27,945 --> 01:28:28,945
You.

708
01:28:32,597 --> 01:28:35,829
You envelop me,
hold me, surround me.

709
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,491
You embrace me.

710
01:28:40,043 --> 01:28:41,297
And I love you.

711
01:29:31,008 --> 01:29:33,159
- Where do you live?
- In town.

712
01:29:33,476 --> 01:29:35,273
- ID.
- I don't have on me.

713
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,777
- Where do you live?
- Just nearby.

714
01:29:38,002 --> 01:29:39,595
- ID.
- I don't have them.

715
01:29:39,894 --> 01:29:41,782
- Where do you live?
- The village.

716
01:29:44,217 --> 01:29:45,567
Stop this nonsense!

717
01:29:45,828 --> 01:29:48,866
These women and children
are here to be treated.

718
01:29:49,094 --> 01:29:51,113
This is not a police station!

719
01:29:51,593 --> 01:29:53,177
Enough!

720
01:29:57,558 --> 01:29:58,996
Unbelievable.

721
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:00,576
Sit down.

722
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,674
Follow me.

723
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:07,775
I recently read
this pensée of Pascal's:

724
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:11,515
"Men never do evil
so completely and cheerfully..."

725
01:31:12,374 --> 01:31:15,035
"as when they do it
from religious conviction."

726
01:31:16,052 --> 01:31:18,085
Here it is mayhem...

727
01:31:18,452 --> 01:31:19,823
and violence.

728
01:31:23,724 --> 01:31:27,004
We are in a high-risk situation...

729
01:31:27,985 --> 01:31:31,590
but we persist in our faith
and our confidence in God.

730
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:35,565
It is through poverty,
failure and death...

731
01:31:35,775 --> 01:31:37,563
that we advance towards him.

732
01:31:42,168 --> 01:31:44,125
Heavy devastating downpours...

733
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:47,223
have put no damper
on the spread of violence.

734
01:31:49,216 --> 01:31:51,504
Two opponents,
one clutching onto power...

735
01:31:51,985 --> 01:31:53,783
the other out to seize it.

736
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,172
They'll fight to the bitter end.

737
01:31:56,514 --> 01:31:58,746
I don't know
when or how it will end.

738
01:31:59,318 --> 01:32:01,534
In the meantime, I do my duty...

739
01:32:02,113 --> 01:32:04,071
Caring for the poor and the sick...

740
01:32:04,411 --> 01:32:08,643
awaiting the day I close my eyes.
Dear friend...

741
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:13,412
pray form me,
that my leaving this world...

742
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:17,143
will pass in peace and joy of Isus.

743
01:33:26,323 --> 01:33:28,181
<i>O Father...</i>

744
01:33:28,801 --> 01:33:31,291
<i>Of light...</i>

745
01:33:33,866 --> 01:33:38,513
<i>Eternal light...</i>

746
01:33:38,818 --> 01:33:45,041
<i>And source of all light...</i>

747
01:33:47,297 --> 01:33:53,195
<i>You illuminate us,
at the threshold of night...</i>

748
01:33:53,415 --> 01:33:59,526
<i>With the radiance of your face...</i>

749
01:34:01,939 --> 01:34:06,387
<i>The shadows, for you...</i>

750
01:34:06,656 --> 01:34:11,154
<i>Are not shadows...</i>

751
01:34:12,347 --> 01:34:15,614
<i>For you, night...</i>

752
01:34:15,889 --> 01:34:21,530
<i>Is as clear as day...</i>

753
01:34:25,172 --> 01:34:31,775
<i>May our prayers before you...</i>

754
01:34:31,983 --> 01:34:37,303
<i>Rise like incense...</i>

755
01:34:38,814 --> 01:34:46,210
<i>And our hands
like the evening offering...</i>

756
01:35:19,718 --> 01:35:21,084
Welcome, Bruno.

757
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:31,325
Celestin.

758
01:35:32,969 --> 01:35:34,274
Christophe.

759
01:35:42,132 --> 01:35:43,587
Hello, Luc.

760
01:35:46,055 --> 01:35:47,217
Jean-Pierre.

761
01:35:51,559 --> 01:35:52,565
Amédée.

762
01:36:26,913 --> 01:36:29,093
- Hosts.
- For me.

763
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:30,392
For us.

764
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:31,839
For us all.

765
01:36:33,326 --> 01:36:34,733
Medicine.

766
01:36:35,536 --> 01:36:36,655
For Luc.

767
01:36:39,367 --> 01:36:40,746
Lots of medicine.

768
01:36:43,033 --> 01:36:45,223
- You found it?
- I found your book.

769
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:46,907
Is it the right one?

770
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,100
"The Choosen".

771
01:36:49,589 --> 01:36:51,644
- And from me.
- Cheese!

772
01:36:55,004 --> 01:36:56,693
Any news of Brother Didier?

773
01:36:58,244 --> 01:37:00,447
Of course he said to say hello.

774
01:37:00,656 --> 01:37:03,274
And I have a letter for you.

775
01:37:04,775 --> 01:37:06,684
Thank you.
So how was your trip?

776
01:37:07,025 --> 01:37:08,130
How long was it?

777
01:37:08,379 --> 01:37:11,591
It took a while
to come from the diocese.

778
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:15,117
At least 3 hours.
There were 3 checkpoints!

779
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:19,350
Between the last two checkpoints...

780
01:37:19,519 --> 01:37:22,201
there was a bus
burning on the roadside.

781
01:37:22,376 --> 01:37:23,748
Smoke coming out of it.

782
01:37:24,121 --> 01:37:26,046
And we didn't know
if the checkpoints...

783
01:37:26,262 --> 01:37:28,086
were real or fake.

784
01:37:29,105 --> 01:37:30,746
On the way here...

785
01:37:31,742 --> 01:37:34,836
as we got closer,
there were fewer vehicles.

786
01:37:35,311 --> 01:37:36,546
Many soldiers?

787
01:37:37,671 --> 01:37:39,523
Yes, near the checkpoints.

788
01:37:43,865 --> 01:37:45,642
They were all very tense.

789
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:48,976
Out of the question
to speak to them.

790
01:37:49,885 --> 01:37:52,244
- How do we stand?
- However we want.

791
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,807
Short ones up front.

792
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:01,491
Squeeze in closer.

793
01:38:03,277 --> 01:38:04,277
Ready?

794
01:38:06,507 --> 01:38:07,750
Set.

795
01:38:09,147 --> 01:38:10,407
Let's take another.

796
01:38:12,622 --> 01:38:14,209
Smile a little.

797
01:38:46,398 --> 01:38:48,452
I've often thought of that time.

798
01:38:51,293 --> 01:38:52,606
That time...

799
01:38:54,036 --> 01:38:56,490
when Ali Fayattia and his men left.

800
01:39:01,457 --> 01:39:02,817
Once they were gone...

801
01:39:04,616 --> 01:39:07,614
all we had left to do was to live.

802
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:11,124
And the first thing we did...

803
01:39:11,561 --> 01:39:12,584
was...

804
01:39:14,646 --> 01:39:16,138
two hours later.

805
01:39:16,907 --> 01:39:20,641
We celebrated
the Christmas Vigil and Mass.

806
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:23,285
It's what we had to do.

807
01:39:24,485 --> 01:39:25,806
It's what we did.

808
01:39:27,207 --> 01:39:29,145
And we sang the Mass.

809
01:39:30,287 --> 01:39:34,770
We welcomed that child
who was born for us...

810
01:39:36,488 --> 01:39:38,697
absolutely helpless and...

811
01:39:40,632 --> 01:39:42,443
and already so threatened.

812
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:47,991
Afterward...

813
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:53,008
we found salvation
in undertaking our daily tasks.

814
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:56,074
The kitchen...

815
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,475
garden...

816
01:39:57,871 --> 01:39:59,957
the prayers, the bells.

817
01:40:00,293 --> 01:40:02,020
Day after day.

818
01:40:06,403 --> 01:40:09,021
We had to resist the violence.

819
01:40:12,058 --> 01:40:13,888
And day after day, I...

820
01:40:15,174 --> 01:40:17,566
I think each of us...

821
01:40:18,103 --> 01:40:19,502
discovered...

822
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,476
that to which Jesus Christ...

823
01:40:23,501 --> 01:40:24,581
beckons us.

824
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:27,173
It's...

825
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,767
to be born.

826
01:40:31,298 --> 01:40:32,949
Our identities as men...

827
01:40:33,396 --> 01:40:35,373
go from one birth to another.

828
01:40:36,307 --> 01:40:40,067
And from birth to birth,
we'll each end up...

829
01:40:40,574 --> 01:40:43,973
bringing to the world
the child of God that we are.

830
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:46,214
The Incarnation, for us...

831
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:49,343
is to allow
the filial reality of Jesus...

832
01:40:49,838 --> 01:40:52,174
to embody itself in our humanity.

833
01:40:55,205 --> 01:40:58,384
The misery of Incarnation remains...

834
01:40:59,786 --> 01:41:01,951
what we are going to live.

835
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:08,407
In this way what we've already
lived here takes root...

836
01:41:08,809 --> 01:41:09,887
as well as...

837
01:41:10,211 --> 01:41:11,841
what we're going to live...

838
01:41:12,653 --> 01:41:13,662
in the future.

839
01:41:14,864 --> 01:41:18,986
Whoever tries to save his life
shall lose it...

840
01:41:20,459 --> 01:41:23,411
and whoever shall lose it,
preserves it.

841
01:41:25,608 --> 01:41:26,814
I tell you...

842
01:41:27,225 --> 01:41:30,466
on that night,
two people shall be in one bed.

843
01:41:30,861 --> 01:41:34,652
One shall be taken, the other left.

844
01:41:35,188 --> 01:41:38,344
Two women shall
be grinding grain together.

845
01:41:38,769 --> 01:41:40,354
One shall be taken...

846
01:41:40,696 --> 01:41:42,404
the other left.

847
01:41:43,155 --> 01:41:45,097
The disciples asked him:

848
01:41:45,489 --> 01:41:47,139
"Where, Lord?"

849
01:41:48,055 --> 01:41:49,513
He answered:

850
01:41:50,098 --> 01:41:51,976
"Where there is a body..."

851
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:55,252
"there too
the vultures shall gather."

852
01:42:04,149 --> 01:42:06,358
The Gospel of the Lord.

853
01:42:06,614 --> 01:42:09,536
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

854
01:42:18,116 --> 01:42:19,609
The body of Christ.

855
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:28,528
The body of Christ.

856
01:42:59,494 --> 01:43:03,929
Lord, blessed art thou for this meal
which unites us as brothers...

857
01:43:04,684 --> 01:43:06,728
now and...

858
01:43:08,503 --> 01:43:10,691
World without end.

859
01:48:03,999 --> 01:48:05,459
Hurry up!

860
01:48:24,216 --> 01:48:25,216
Move!

861
01:48:28,761 --> 01:48:30,087
Hurry, faster!

862
01:48:34,959 --> 01:48:37,335
Hurry, get dressed.

863
01:48:37,797 --> 01:48:38,797
I just get here.

864
01:48:40,256 --> 01:48:41,256
I can't.

865
01:49:00,558 --> 01:49:02,042
I said don't push!

866
01:49:03,437 --> 01:49:07,385
Careful with that medicine.
It's for children, not you.

867
01:49:07,584 --> 01:49:09,326
It's very precious.

868
01:49:10,071 --> 01:49:12,546
Stop pushing me! That's enough!

869
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:13,957
Calm down!

870
01:51:41,356 --> 01:51:43,462
I am brother Paul.

871
01:51:43,764 --> 01:51:46,176
A monk at the Monastery de l'Atlas.

872
01:51:46,752 --> 01:51:49,018
And I'm in good health.

873
01:51:53,524 --> 01:51:55,804
I am Brother Celestin.

874
01:51:58,709 --> 01:52:00,606
I'm 63.

875
01:52:04,503 --> 01:52:07,091
A monk at the Monastery de l'Atlas.

876
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:11,383
I'm in good health.

877
01:52:14,538 --> 01:52:15,656
Your turn, Luc.

878
01:52:23,229 --> 01:52:26,828
My name is Brother Luc.

879
01:52:27,848 --> 01:52:29,727
From the Monastery de l'Atlas.

880
01:52:31,522 --> 01:52:35,846
I heard
what they're saying on the news.

881
01:52:36,849 --> 01:52:40,051
I've been taken hostage...

882
01:52:40,258 --> 01:52:43,735
with my colleagues by the Jama...

883
01:52:44,573 --> 01:52:45,649
What's it called?

884
01:52:45,905 --> 01:52:47,159
Islamiyya.

885
01:52:47,709 --> 01:52:50,114
Jama Islamiyya, that's it.

886
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:55,771
Your turn, Christian.

887
01:53:01,985 --> 01:53:04,145
In the early hours
of Friday morning...

888
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:09,833
the Mujaheddin read us the bayan
of the Jama Islamiyya Moussalaha...

889
01:53:11,613 --> 01:53:12,613
Signed by?

890
01:53:14,663 --> 01:53:17,157
Signed by Abu Abderrahamane Amine.

891
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,215
It says we're being held hostages...

892
01:53:20,498 --> 01:53:23,231
and demands
that the French government...

893
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:27,622
free hostages
belonging to their group...

894
01:53:28,087 --> 01:53:30,076
in exchange for our liberation.

895
01:53:31,330 --> 01:53:33,763
This exchange is non-negotiable.

896
01:53:36,859 --> 01:53:38,656
Did you hear?

897
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:03,041
Should it ever befall me...

898
01:54:03,413 --> 01:54:04,830
and it could happen today...

899
01:54:05,292 --> 01:54:10,012
to be a victim of the terrorism
swallowing up all foreigners here...

900
01:54:11,214 --> 01:54:13,221
I would like my community...

901
01:54:13,661 --> 01:54:14,790
my church...

902
01:54:15,271 --> 01:54:16,271
my family...

903
01:54:16,565 --> 01:54:20,570
to remember that my life was given
to God and to this country...

904
01:54:22,124 --> 01:54:24,653
That the Unique Master of all life...

905
01:54:24,936 --> 01:54:27,697
was no stranger
to this brutal departure.

906
01:54:28,899 --> 01:54:32,403
And that my death is same as
so many other violent ones...

907
01:54:33,169 --> 01:54:35,510
consigned to the apathy of oblivion.

908
01:54:36,617 --> 01:54:38,366
I've lived enough to know...

909
01:54:38,389 --> 01:54:41,369
I am complicit in the evil that,
alas...

910
01:54:41,917 --> 01:54:43,501
prevails over the world...

911
01:54:44,047 --> 01:54:46,606
and the evil
that will smite me blindly.

912
01:54:47,169 --> 01:54:49,518
I could never desire such a death.

913
01:54:50,304 --> 01:54:54,155
I could never feel gladdened
that these people I love...

914
01:54:54,559 --> 01:54:57,159
be accused randomly of my murder.

915
01:54:58,785 --> 01:55:01,702
I know the contempt
felt for people here...

916
01:55:02,086 --> 01:55:03,576
indiscriminately.

917
01:55:03,845 --> 01:55:07,444
And I know how Islam is distorted
by certain Islamism.

918
01:55:09,195 --> 01:55:12,086
This country, and Islam, for me...

919
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:13,726
are something different.

920
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:16,711
They're a body and a soul.

921
01:55:17,609 --> 01:55:19,643
My death, of course...

922
01:55:19,966 --> 01:55:23,204
will quickly vindicate
those who called me naive...

923
01:55:23,535 --> 01:55:24,819
or idealistic...

924
01:55:25,208 --> 01:55:27,626
but they must know
that I will be freed...

925
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:29,940
of a burning curiosity...

926
01:55:30,569 --> 01:55:34,638
and, God willing,
will immerse my gaze in the Father's...

927
01:55:35,556 --> 01:55:38,444
and contemplate with him
his children of Islam...

928
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,112
as he sees them.

929
01:55:41,382 --> 01:55:45,351
This thank-you
which encompasses my entire life...

930
01:55:46,354 --> 01:55:47,960
includes you, of course...

931
01:55:48,219 --> 01:55:50,720
friends of yesterday and today...

932
01:55:51,402 --> 01:55:54,051
and you too,
friend of the last minute...

933
01:55:54,743 --> 01:55:56,641
who knew not what you were doing.

934
01:55:57,127 --> 01:55:59,098
Yes, to you as well...

935
01:55:59,470 --> 01:56:01,067
I address this thank-you...

936
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,157
and this farewell...

937
01:56:03,498 --> 01:56:05,015
wish you envisaged.

938
01:56:05,437 --> 01:56:07,985
May we meet again...

939
01:56:08,433 --> 01:56:11,502
happy thieves in Paradise...

940
01:56:11,739 --> 01:56:15,151
if it pleases God...
the Father of us both.

942
01:56:15,702 --> 01:56:16,753
Amen.

943
01:56:17,277 --> 01:56:18,277
<i>Inchallah.</i>

944
01:59:11,456 --> 01:59:14,402
Christian, Luc, Christophe,
Celestin, Paul, Michel and Bruno...

945
01:59:14,403 --> 01:59:16,444
were killed on May 21, 1996.

946
01:59:17,229 --> 01:59:18,790
The identity of their murderers...

947
01:59:19,225 --> 01:59:21,356
and the circumstances
of their deaths...

948
01:59:21,689 --> 01:59:22,963
remain a mystery.

949
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:25,734
Amédée died on July 27, 2008.

950
01:59:25,888 --> 01:59:28,244
Jean-Pierre is still alive.
He is now 86.

951
