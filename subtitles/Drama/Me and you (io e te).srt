1
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,238
Well'?

2
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,679
Nothing.

3
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,957
So you took off, went away
and left him on his own'?

4
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,792
Yes.
It's normal.

5
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,231
Normal'?

6
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,759
He wouldn't have helped me either.

7
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,871
- But how did you feel aftemrards?
- Normal.

8
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,915
Can you explain
what "normal" means to you'?

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,913
Normal means normal.
So, nothing.

10
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,950
I know it's hard
to talk about certain things.

11
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,794
But with time
we'll be able to go deeper.

12
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,189
I think we're done for the day.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,073
See you next week.
Bye, Lorenzo.

14
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,998
See, I was right after all'?
Yes.

15
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,278
To open up,
he needed an outsider,

16
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,590
someone who's neither you or me.

17
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,632
Yes, I told you,
he decided all on his own.

18
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,550
It's such a relief.

19
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,796
I phoned you right away!

20
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,553
Lorenzo for a week on the snow!

21
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,631
If you think how it was
just a year ago...

22
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,110
If he feels he wants to be
with the others for a whole week,

23
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,192
that's a wonderful sign.

24
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,792
It's very important.

25
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,788
I could hardly wait to call you.

26
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,631
No! VVait.
I'll tell him myself later.

27
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,958
Alright.
Before we begin our lesson,

28
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,155
who hasn't given me the money yet'?

29
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,078
Tomorrow is the last day. Any hasn't
paid by tomorrow won't be coming.

30
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,791
I'm not joking.

31
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,198
Sign here.
Take this.

32
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,110
- Cuni, coming for ajoint'?
- Don't bother with him.

33
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,109
Lorenzo, what are you doing'?

34
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,159
I was trying to pick up a bean
with the straw.

35
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,112
Cut it out, eat properly.

36
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,508
I heard from your dad. He said
to buy you a snowboard.

37
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,797
- There are new ones out.
- Nitro'?

38
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,557
I don't know, we'll see,
I don't remember.

39
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,270
It has to be Nitro, or Gnu.
But I don't need one, mine's fine.

40
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,194
No, he's counting on it,
he wants to buy you something...

41
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,831
- Is he happy I'm going?
- Of course, he's very happy.

42
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,155
- What did he say'?
- That he was happy.

43
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,791
- What were his exact words'?
- I don't know, he was happy.

44
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,634
No, tell me,
what were his exact words'?

45
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,155
He was happy.

46
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,192
Mom, do you think
people seeing us here now,

47
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,356
could think we were a couple'?

48
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,433
How could they think a kid would be
with a woman of my age'?

49
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,511
Well, you look a lot younger.

50
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,958
No, they'd think I'm your mother.
We need to cut your hair.

51
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,632
Imagine that tomorrow a fatal virus
comes out of a laboratory

52
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,235
and kills the population.

53
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,551
But you and I find the antidote
and are saved.

54
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,710
And we're the only ones
left on Earth.

55
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,315
But humanity is doomed, unless we...

56
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,479
- Stop it.
- Come on, it would save humanity.

57
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,628
Stop this nonsense, eat up.

58
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,555
Why get mad I I mean an extreme
situation I It's to save mankind.

59
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,473
What are you thinking!

60
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,918
- You're worse than a six-year-old!
- Okay, sorry.

61
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,473
Tell me just one thing. If it were
a boy, what would you call him'?

62
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,509
- What did the psychiatrist say about
Lorenzo'? - He has a grandiose self.

63
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,992
- What's that mean'?
- That our son is so narcissistic.

64
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,629
He doesn't need anyone.

65
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,154
That's great news.

66
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,838
- I found them! - Good!
What would I do without you'?

67
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,118
You wouldn't find your shoes.

68
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,198
Where's this chameleon from'?

69
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,671
- What do you mean'?
- Where's it come from'?

70
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,830
- We get them from the dealer,
I don't know. - It's strange.

71
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,190
I think it's African,
Indian ones are bigger.

72
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,272
- Yes, maybe.
- No, I'm sure.

73
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,475
What do you feed it'?
Mealworm larvae.

74
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,718
It's a bit skinny. You should
give it a more varied diet,

75
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,239
- Like crickets or silkworms.
- Will you get me some'?

76
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,673
- Does it ever change color?
- Buy it and find out.

77
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,632
Is this for cats or dogs'?

78
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,839
- It's the same. - It can't be.
- Don't you have anything to do'?

79
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,635
- Are stick insects hard to breed?
- No!

80
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,439
Just a terrarium and some branches,
want some'?

81
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,433
- I'll give you a good price.
- No, thanks, they're not my thing.

82
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,111
And this'? How much is this'?

83
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,599
I was thinking about
that story you told me. I liked it.

84
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,792
- Which one'?
- The one about a pastry maker.

85
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,078
The pasty maker who tamed beetles.
It's a good one.

86
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,236
- Go see if the nurses are around.
- No, no one's around.

87
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,952
- Get my medicine from my purse,
hurry. - Here.

88
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,918
Grandma, I have to go, I'm going with
the school tomorrow to sky.

89
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,434
- How nice.
- See you in a week.

90
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,115
In a week I'll be at the cemetery.

91
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,913
Okay, I'll have my coffin put
on top of yours, like a bunk bed.

92
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,992
Good! That way we can chat.

93
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,915
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye.

94
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,271
Seven...

95
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,631
Seven...

96
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,999
Five... six... seven!

97
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,191
That's seven of everything.

98
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,951
- Hi, Lorenzo.
- Hi, Salvatore.

99
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,150
- Did you bring your cell phone'?
- Yes.

100
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,789
- And music?
- Yes.

101
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,154
- Your medicine bag'?
- Yes.

102
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,038
What'll you do once I'm gone'?

103
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,630
I'll go home and sleep a little,
I've got such a headache.

104
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:03,631
- And then'? - Then at 11:00 I'll
visit Grandma and then I have to work.

105
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,396
- Leave me here. - Eh'?
- Let me get out.

106
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,392
- Put you seatbelt back on.
- Please, Mom.

107
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,152
- Let me get out.
- Why?

108
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,277
Because I want to arrive by myself!

109
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,955
I don't understand.
I said let me get out!

110
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,312
Calm down, don't start
making a crazy scene. It's too early.

111
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,871
I want to go there alone!

112
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,748
Lorenzo! Stop that or I'll get mad!

113
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,276
Okay, I won't go,
that way you'll be happy.

114
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,229
Everyone's going on their own, I'll
be the only one turning up with mommy!

115
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,471
That's enough!

116
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,629
BIO-Hum.

117
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,878
- Good morning, Salvatore.
- Good morning, ma'am.

118
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,991
Hello? I can't hear a thing!
It's the doorman here, speak up!

119
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,473
I can't hear a thing, it's Salvatore.

120
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,356
Hello, Mom'?

121
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,436
Yes, everything's fine. I was having
a snowball fight with the others.

122
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,554
We'll have dinner at the hotel,
then tomorrow's the torchlight party.

123
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,637
The teacher's not here,
I can't put her on.

124
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,517
Why do you want to talk with her'?

125
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,870
No, come on, leave me alone.
They're calling me.

126
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,988
We'll talk tomorrow.
Bye. My God!

127
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,716
Look what I've got for you.

128
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,231
Look, here it is.

129
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,557
Sacrifice to the rubber raft god.

130
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,869
No, that bastard Emiliano
didn't come.

131
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,789
I waited two hours for him!

132
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,478
No, you're a dickhead too,
I'm sick of you all!

133
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,031
Is anyone here'?

134
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,432
VVho the fuck are you'?
Lorenzo! Why are you here'?

135
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,038
- Are you Olivia?
- Of course, why are you here'?

136
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,989
No reason, I was looking
for something and then fell asleep.

137
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,640
- VVho gave you the keys'? - That bitch
housekeeper of yours.

138
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,315
VVho wouldn't let me in because
who knows what your mother told her.

139
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,597
She said my stuffs in a box
here in the basement.

140
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,275
Where is it'? Help me find it.

141
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,510
It's got "Olivia" written on it.

142
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,109
Look where they put me!

143
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,117
Nice family I have!

144
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,830
- Shit, it was here.
- What are you looking for'?

145
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,117
Grandma gave me a gold bracelet.

146
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,550
That bitch, your mother took it.

147
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,551
Don't talk about my mom like that!

148
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,995
What does she care
about your bracelet'?

149
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,116
Your mom's interested
in a lot of stuff.

150
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,318
VVith the excuse that I'm a thief,
she's taken everything.

151
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,188
- Goddammit, it was here!
- Don't shout so loudly, please!

152
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,271
Got any money'?

153
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,151
What an asshole.

154
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,951
- Doesn't your dad give you money'?
- No. And he's your dad too.

155
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,151
Really? I'd almost forgotten.

156
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,028
I never see him.
Give it to me, it's for a taxi.

157
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,391
I don't have any.

158
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,716
Look my in the eyes.

159
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,149
- You've grown.
- So have you.

160
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,910
Yeah, I'm coming. I'll take
the subway, I'll be a while.

161
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,469
ERIN-HEP-

162
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,509
- Listen, sorry.
- What is it'?

163
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,636
Don't tell anyone you saw me here.

164
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,116
Not even the housekeeper.
Nobody must know.

165
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,192
You're even getting a moustache.

166
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,509
- Take this up.
- I can't, no one knows I'm here.

167
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,594
Whatever, do what the fuck you want.

168
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,399
"I'm Lestat, a vampire,
I'm immortal. More or less.

169
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,155
The light of day,
the constant heat of a fire

170
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,232
could destroy me,
or maybe not.

171
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,312
I'm 1,86 meters tall,
a considerable height for the 1780s,

172
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,314
when I was a young mortal.

173
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,595
I'm not bad-looking now.

174
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,752
I have thick
shoulder-length blond hair,

175
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,150
a bit curly, it looks white
in fluorescent light. "

176
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,709
Lorenzo'?

177
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,909
Fuck, you scared me!
What do you want'?

178
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,958
- Turn that damn flashlight off,
let me in. - No. - Let me in.

179
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,952
- Why'?
- I need somewhere to sleep.

180
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,555
- Lower your voice. - Will you let
me in'? - No! - Why'?

181
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,279
This is my place, I don't want you
to make any trouble, it's dangerous!

182
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,273
- Go somewhere else.
- Let me in.

183
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,117
I've got nowhere else to go. There's
no room for you, it's too small.

184
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,149
Let me in or I'll start shouting
and wake up the whole block!

185
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,152
Olly.

186
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,320
Olivia! Come on.
Hurry up!

187
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,909
Come on! They'll see us!

188
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,069
Move it.
Come on.

189
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,797
It's so hot in here.

190
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,317
We're near the boiler.
The heating pipes run through here.

191
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,830
Why are you in here'?

192
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,879
I was supposed to go on a
skiing trip, but didn't feel like it.

193
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,396
Couldn't you stay at home'?

194
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,914
No, if I didn't go
it would have been a total mess.

195
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,198
My mom would've been disappointed
and she'd have stressed me out.

196
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,158
It's best they all think
I'm in the mountains.

197
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,278
- How long will you stay here'?
- Till Saturday.

198
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,193
- Got any beer'? - No, there's fruit
juice over there. - There?

199
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,468
Look how organized you are!

200
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,830
All your snacks are in order, tidy.

201
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,394
You bought all this junk because
they don't let you eat it at home'?

202
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,549
The only thing missing
is a "Royal with cheese".

203
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,996
- Where were you going skiing?
- Borca di Cadore.

204
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,877
- Okay but what is it'?
- Don't move it, you'll upset them!

205
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,315
- What is it'?
- An ant nest.

206
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,513
You'd rather stay in a basement
watching ants

207
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,272
than go skiing'?

208
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,033
Yes, I'm better off by myself.

209
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,989
- You might be right about that.
- Whose stuff is this?

210
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,517
- Countess Nunziante's.
- Who the fuck's she'?

211
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,160
She lived in our apartment before us.

212
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,869
Dad bought the house and
let her stay there till she died.

213
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,748
He did it to help her,
she had no money left.

214
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,071
I see, a bare ownership deal.

215
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,436
- You know what that is'?
- No.

216
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,910
Imagine you're old, poor
and have no one left.

217
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,512
But you have a beautiful house.

218
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,718
You sell your house cheaply
but you still live there

219
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,429
and when you die, the house and
your things go to whoever bought it.

220
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,718
So to get the house,
he had to hope she'd die soon.

221
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,872
- Right.
- That's not nice.

222
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,474
No, it sucks.

223
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,513
Well, I'm going to get some sleep.

224
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,590
I traveled all day yesterday,
I'm dead tired.

225
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,556
- Where were you coming from'?
- From my house, Catania.

226
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,076
Does your mom still have
the shoe shop in Catania'?

227
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,156
Excuse me young man, is there
a restroom down here?

228
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,596
Of course.
Where did you go'?

229
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,356
- Dancing. - Where'?
- Somewhere outside Rome.

230
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,991
Oh, my God!

231
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,071
Water.

232
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,590
Anyway, I knew
about the bare ownership deal.

233
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,717
I couldn't tell you
but Dad and I killed the Countess.

234
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,995
By poisoned chocolate.

235
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,558
I'm cold.

236
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,359
I'm here to make sure
no one finds the body

237
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,072
and to wait for it to turn to dust.
Understand'? Do you understand'?

238
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,148
- What's wrong'?
- My bones hurt.

239
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,800
You're not going to give me the flu,
are you'?

240
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,348
When you go,
there's a pharmacy in the square.

241
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,477
You're going, right'? You promised.

242
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,279
Remember you promised you'd go!

243
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,791
Where are you'? Call me. Mom.
When will I see you'?

244
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,475
Not before, then'?

245
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,636
It's just that I have
nowhere to stay here.

246
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,030
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

247
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,072
What'?
No, I swear, I'm just a little tired.

248
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,389
I wrote to you, I'm clean.

249
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,236
Marco. Marco, listen,
I so want to see you.

250
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,310
Okay my love,
I'll wait for you to call me.

251
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,958
lamb!-

252
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,272
- No, you're leaving now.
- Spying on me, you little shit?

253
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,558
I'll do whatever I like.
This is my place.

254
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,949
Give me a break.

255
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,876
What do you want '? Look at yourself.

256
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,236
Standing there,
pointing your finger at me...

257
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,598
"No, you're leaving now!"

258
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,194
Did you learn that from Dad'?

259
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,513
Ordering people around'? No, there's
something wrong with you inside.

260
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,598
I'm not hurting anyone.
Leave me alone.

261
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,036
If you hide in a hole,
minding your own business

262
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,714
that doesn't mean
you're better than other people.

263
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,869
That's too easy.

264
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,791
<i>It's mommy.</i>

265
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,793
Hi.
I didn't have time to call you.

266
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,633
What do you think we're doing?
We're skiing!

267
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,112
No, I told you the teacher's
not here I You can't talk to her!

268
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,398
- I'm here, is that your mom, Cuni'?
- Yes.

269
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,631
Mrs. Cuni, how are you'?

270
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,428
No, it's Miss Stefanelli,
I teach Science to another class.

271
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,276
Everything is fine, yes.

272
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,432
He's given us a lesson,
your son's a little champion.

273
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,517
Of course, would you like my number'?

274
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,838
<i>Okay. 3- 4-8
55-36-789.</i>

275
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,869
Call me so I can save yours.

276
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,309
Do you want to speak to Lorenzo'?
I'll say goodbye for you.

277
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,755
Good bye.

278
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,717
I'll see you soon.

279
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,991
Wow, you really laid it on her!

280
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:43,589
Arianna Cuni.
Saved forever.

281
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,550
So you won't bug me again.

282
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,915
Or I'll show you
who Miss Stefanelli is,

283
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,551
she'll tell mom: "Go to the basement
and see your little champion. "

284
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,913
How gross.
I threw up all over myself.

285
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,595
Shit.
Help me.

286
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,713
- What's wrong'?
- Cold turkey.

287
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,715
- What'? - Didn't they tell you'?
- What'?

288
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,713
- That I'm a junkie, a shitty addict.
- No...

289
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,114
Of course, they're protecting you.
They don't tell you the bad stuff.

290
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:21,229
Please, leave me alone.
Forget about me.

291
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,309
Olivia'?

292
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,269
Olivia'?

293
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,600
Go away.
Go away.

294
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:33,312
Get out.
Close that fuckin' door!

295
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,718
"He would watch the scene
and learn. That intimacy... "

296
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,233
I know you hate me.

297
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,155
Don't worry, I'm going soon,
you won't see me anymore.

298
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,473
- Back to Catania'? - No, I'm going
to go live in the country.

299
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,791
- When'?
- In a few days.

300
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,791
A friend of mine is taking me

301
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,997
to a farm where there are horses.

302
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,590
I was just dreaming about it.
Have you ever been to see horses?

303
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,276
- No.
- Me neither.

304
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,593
But...

305
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,557
I have to go through cold turkey
and be clean before I see him.

306
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,278
Do you have to do it here'?

307
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,591
I'm not exactly dying
to be in this craphole.

308
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,148
But I don't know where else to go.

309
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,192
- What do you take'? Cocaine?
- No, heroin.

310
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,438
- Is it expensive?
- Less now, but it still is.

311
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,036
- Where do you get the money'?
- Your dad sends it to me every month.

312
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,190
To get over his guilt.

313
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,670
- What guilt'?
- Ask him.

314
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,556
Because he left
your mother for mine'?

315
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,835
You really don't know anything!

316
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,037
Your dad's never given a shit
about me and my mom.

317
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,918
I guess we're
not elegant enough for him,

318
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,309
<i>she sells shoes!</i>

319
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,270
- That's not true, Dad's not like
that. - Isn't he'? How old are you'?

320
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,796
- 14, you know that.
- What planet are you from'?

321
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,437
Can't you see
what shits your parents are,

322
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,034
they don't even realize
they have a psycho son

323
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,318
who reads upside down'?

324
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,032
Psychopath.

325
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,874
"I made that scene
more cruel and playful... "

326
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,157
You'll get a rush of blood
to your head.

327
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,633
"Then the night
lost its normal dimension.

328
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,790
In fact, it remains
one of the longest nights... "

329
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,555
- I don't like this dead zebra.
- Neither do I.

330
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,358
Poor thing.

331
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,473
Can we take it away'?

332
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,115
I know, but the supervisor
had a few problems.

333
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,991
Quiet, please, be quiet!
Quiet, or they' find us!

334
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,155
I have things to do,
I can't wait all morning.

335
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,949
I'll tell the surveyor to call you.

336
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,917
I'm out of sleeping pills.

337
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,429
Did you hear me'?
I'm out of sleeping pills!

338
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,795
Stop! I don't give a shit
if you're sick.

339
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,235
You make me puke.

340
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,791
- I'll kill you if you don't go,
you bitch! - I'm too sick, shit!

341
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,950
Olivia'? Olivia, Olivia...

342
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,795
I didn't mean to hurt you, please.

343
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,872
Please, help me.
I'm too sick.

344
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,238
Want me to call someone'?

345
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:59,519
No, get me something strong,

346
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,592
that makes me feel well,
I can't do this awake.

347
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:10,792
Stand by me, please.
Get me some sleeping pills.

348
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,559
I'm that close.

349
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,270
- A little sugar?
- No, thank you.

350
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,999
Get him off,
I don't like the dog on the bed.

351
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,153
- It's time to take him out.
- I already did.

352
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,236
- Lorenzo. Is that you'?
- Yes, Grandma.

353
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,190
Can you do me a favor?
Will you lower the bed'?

354
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,789
There, that's fine.

355
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,714
I have to go now though,
we've got lots of homework.

356
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,872
Won't you tell me
one of your stories'?

357
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:44,389
- Okay. Do you remember Olivia?
- Yes, Olivia.

358
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:53,118
Of course, she's my granddaughter.
Her mother was showy, but very nice.

359
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,110
- She was nice? - Yes.
She took me to Mt. Etna once.

360
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,879
It was beautiful.

361
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,399
You must go there.

362
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,150
And Olivia'?

363
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,997
Olivia'? Are you awake'?

364
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:01,751
- Finally! You were gone so long.
- Mission accomplished.

365
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,308
Awesome!

366
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:18,309
- Come on. Don't get mad.
- Why'? - Don't get mad.

367
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,478
I'm Ferdinando,
a friend of Olivia's.

368
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,638
- VVho is this guy'?
- A friend, I called him.

369
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,075
- Why'?
- You didn't come back.

370
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,479
She said she wasn't well,

371
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,916
so I came to see
if she needed anything.

372
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,197
- We're old friends.
- I don't want him in here.

373
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,158
He shouldn't have
touched my computer.

374
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,312
Stop making such a big deal.

375
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,315
You've made my brother jealous.
Come here.

376
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,029
- We'd better go, I'll get your stuff.
- Where are you going'?

377
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,590
I don't feel like going all that way.

378
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,514
Please, Olivia,
you sleep, I'll drive

379
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,353
we'll be there in two hours
and you'll wake up by the sea.

380
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,594
- No, I want to stay with my brother.
- I'll take care of everything, c'mon.

381
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:32,948
- Do you really want one of my pieces?
- Yes, the street lamp with arms.

382
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:42,399
- But, could you pay for it now'?
- Sure. - Really? - Yes.

383
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,632
- Thank you. - I'll come back for you
if you want. Call me.

384
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,632
You're so sweet.

385
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,790
- Was that your friend with the horse'?
- No, are you crazy'? He's an old man'?

386
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:23,039
Maybe he was old,
but he was coming on to you.

387
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,079
Really?
Shit, I'm out of cigarettes.

388
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,078
- Want to see a movie?
- No.

389
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,472
I need to get some rest.
Good night, sweetheart.

390
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,311
So why did he give you all that money'?
Maybe he wanted to buy you.

391
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,509
I'll explain later.
I'm sleepy now.

392
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:04,839
Sicilians can be jealous,
but you... My goodness!

393
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,556
Fantastic.

394
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,711
Impressive.

395
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,628
"They live in colonies that can be
small units or tens of millions.

396
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,712
Often divided into
females, males and workers.

397
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,711
The workers can be
sterile or apterous.

398
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,429
The bigger ones can act like
soldier ants and defend the colony.

399
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,718
After mating, in general,
of the winged males and females,

400
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,837
the first often die
and the females lose their wings. "

401
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,319
No, the snow...

402
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,714
it's weird because
it's all soft and white and clean.

403
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,712
It's like wool,
it's like being in Paradise!

404
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,476
Then you look at the sky
and you realize you're on the ground.

405
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,515
Yesterday we went
to see these frozen waterfalls,

406
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,431
they looked frozen in time.

407
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,559
Next to them was this precipice
that was all brown.

408
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,315
There was some snow
but like it was dirty.

409
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,711
No, that gurgling is a stream
where we've stopped,

410
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,268
it's still flowing, I don't know why
it's not frozen...

411
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,432
it's pretty cold.

412
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,632
Yes, we should be back
around lunchtime.

413
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,793
You don't need to come and get me,
I'll get a lift from Pennacchini,

414
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,519
that tall guy, in my classroom.

415
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,715
Come on, Mom, I have to go.

416
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,030
Talk to you later.

417
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,238
Thirty-eight.
Thirty-eight!

418
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,793
- Are you awake'?
- No.

419
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,516
How much do you sleep'?

420
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,951
You're so tanned,
you look so handsome! Darling!

421
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,440
I missed you so much. Come in.

422
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,152
Lorenzo'?

423
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,238
- Lorenzo. What time is it'?
- I don't know.

424
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,275
It's night time. I'm better,
you know'?

425
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,995
But I have to eat something.

426
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,878
We were invaded by ants.

427
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,033
I saved what I could
but they ate everything.

428
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,038
There's nothing left to eat.

429
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,114
I have to eat something healthy,
not your junk.

430
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:05,234
- Are those the house keys'?
- Yes, why'? What are you going to do'?

431
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,917
- I'm going upstairs for some food.
- No, you can't!

432
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,560
- You're nuts!
- I won't get caught!

433
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,030
Yes, you will!
You're nuts!

434
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,555
Hey, are you staying or coming'?
C'mon.

435
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,357
I'm begging, it's the end.

436
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,112
Which key is it'?
Come on, I'm hungry! Idiot.

437
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,839
Be quiet.

438
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,198
- Come on.
- Be quiet!

439
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:04,349
- Come on, I'm hungry.
- Hungry, hungry, hungry!

440
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,877
No, I'll do it.

441
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,799
Olivia!

442
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:11,789
Go away. Go away.
Get away from there.

443
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,956
Please, go away, please.
Go away, go away!

444
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,358
- Have some more beer.
- No, I don't like it.

445
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,512
It's our last night, we'll get out
of this prison tomorrow.

446
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,997
- C'mon.
- Okay.

447
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,759
Yesterday,
when your friend was here...

448
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,389
- What did you sell him'?
- What kind of work'?

449
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,598
- One of my works.
- Photographs.

450
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,318
- Then I think I saw them.
- Where'? - On the computer.

451
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,716
Shit. I forgot.

452
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:49,516
- Do you like them'?
- They're nice. - Nice?

453
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,634
- No, I mean, they're great.
- Fantastic.

454
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,999
Let's see this one.

455
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:06,435
You know until a few years ago
I took photos. I did video art.

456
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,112
I even had some exhibitions.

457
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,792
I won an important award
when I was 18.

458
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,871
- Yeah, right...
- It's true.

459
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:21,111
- I went to Los Angeles.
- Yeah, right...

460
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,792
- I did.
- Of course.

461
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,192
But then I got messed up with dope
and I stopped.

462
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,475
The photos you saw

463
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,710
are part of a series called...

464
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,952
- "I am a wall".
- What wall?

465
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,031
It's a metaphor,

466
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:42,392
basically it's me becoming that wall,

467
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,631
entering the wallpaper,
going inside the plaster.

468
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,597
Like a lizard...

469
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:53,835
Not like a lizard.
Virtually, I wanted to ale-materialize.

470
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,233
Me and you, if we didn't have a point
of view anymore, we'd be the same.

471
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,076
Yes, I mean without a point of view,

472
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,152
we'd stop being against each other

473
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,671
and accept reality for what it is,
without judging it.

474
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,748
- Like... Do you know Buddhism?
- Yes.

475
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,515
- But you're not a Buddhist at all.
- Of course I am.

476
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,037
- No, you're always pissed!
- It's not easy to be a Buddhist.

477
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,430
Besides, it's drugs
that made me mean.

478
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,910
Before, I could pass through walls.

479
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,596
- Yeah, right...
- Really! Sure.

480
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,949
- Do you like this dress?
- It's beautiful.

481
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,158
Want me to put a different one on'?

482
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,993
Countess Nunziante is my size.

483
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,072
- Alright.

484
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,360
Hi, Pablito, look at me.

485
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,959
Do you like my bow'?

486
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,432
Nice, like an Easter egg.

487
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,717
I understand nothing
of retro punk, drunkard.

488
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,916
I prefer serious things.

489
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,590
- VVho are you texting'?
- My friend with the horses.

490
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,069
I'm setting up a place
to meet tomorrow.

491
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:04,470
Tell me the name of a nice cafe
where he can pick me up.

492
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,638
Bar Afrodite, in Piazza Verdi.
They make good sandwiches.

493
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:17,718
- Is he your boyfriend? - No.
I just had an affair with him.

494
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,317
But when we met
he was with someone else.

495
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,791
- Did he leave her for you'?
- He cheated on her with me.

496
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,159
After we met,
we couldn't live without each other.

497
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,477
But after a few months
he got back with her.

498
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,876
- Were you upset?
- A little. But I understood him,

499
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,478
You don't break up for a junkie,
that's normal.

500
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,237
But...
two weeks ago he sent me a text.

501
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:59,079
He said he's made up his mind,
he wants to get back with me.

502
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,837
Only if I kick the habit though.

503
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,956
What's he like'?

504
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,472
Tall, with curly hair,
green eyes.

505
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,714
He's a graphic designer in Rome.

506
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,191
He wants to quit everything
and move to the country with me.

507
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,840
- Where'?
- To Tuscany.

508
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:30,517
One of his relatives owns a farm.
Maybe we could work there.

509
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,952
For a change of scenery.

510
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,392
I've been on drugs for so long

511
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,712
I can't imagine how it is
being around a normal person.

512
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,268
'WW-Baum...

513
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:56,794
You don't feel anything.
No one can hurt you.

514
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,117
- Isn't that cool'?
- No, because you're indifferent.

515
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,638
And indifference isn't a nice thing.

516
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,713
You become cold and mean.

517
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,791
Like me!

518
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,835
My mind has taken off,

519
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:44,236
one thought, just one.

520
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:52,157
I walk while the city sleeps.

521
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:58,229
Her eyes in the night,

522
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,154
white headlights in the night,

523
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,348
a voice that talks to me, who is it'?

524
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:32,117
Say, lonely boy where are you going,
why so much pain'?

525
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:39,115
You've lost a great love, no doubt,

526
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:45,431
but the city is full of loves.

527
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:52,230
No, lonely girl, no, no, no,

528
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,790
you're wrong this time,

529
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,796
I didn't lose just a great love,

530
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,195
last night I lost everything
with her...

531
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,158
Can I ask you something'?

532
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,550
- Why didn't you ever come back to
our house? - You don't know'?

533
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:18,316
- No. - One summer I almost
killed your mother, remember?

534
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,595
Absolutely not.

535
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,559
I threw a rock at her head,
it bled a lot.

536
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,916
Dad had to take her
to the hospital for stitches.

537
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,512
- Why did you do that'?
- Because I hated her.

538
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:39,076
- She'd taken my dad away.
- A rock, though...

539
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,991
Where will you go now, lonely boy'?

540
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:58,517
The night is a big sea,

541
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:05,278
if you need my hand to swim.

542
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:11,071
Thanks, but I just
want to die tonight

543
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,550
because you know in my eyes
there's an angel,

544
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:22,430
an angel who can fly no more,

545
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,354
who can fly no more...

546
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,277
- Are you sleeping? - No.
- Will you promise me something?

547
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,192
- What'? - That you never take drugs
again. Never again.

548
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:48,149
I promise.
And will you promise me something?

549
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,389
Yin.

550
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,357
Stop hiding.
Shit, you're grown up.

551
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,600
It's time to get a life.

552
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,510
If you get knocked around
once in a while, it doesn't matter.

553
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,795
Look at me, I'm all black and blue.

554
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,440
But you have nine lives like a cat.

555
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,791
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

556
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,159
It's really late now, let's sleep.

557
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,271
Shit.

558
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,913
- Olivia?
- Yes, I'm done.

559
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,599
- You're beautiful.
- Thanks.

560
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,317
Lion'?
urea

561
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,189
Your cigarettes.

562
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,436
Here.

563
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,795
Come here, c'mon.

564
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,198
- I can't do it.
- Sure you can, I'm right here.

565
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,798
- We had fun, right'?
- Yes. It'd be fun to do it again.

566
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,548
Our week on the snow!
