1
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,939
Lower the window.

2
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,537
Let some air in.

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,375
I'll buy you an ice cream
if you want.

4
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,055
We're late, get going.

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,408
No, Nima said that the match
starts at 9:45. It's only 9:20.

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,931
Nima isn't coming?

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,015
Nima?

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,209
I don't know if he's coming.

9
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,258
He has a slight cold.

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,458
But your stepfather Mortaza said

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,011
he might bring him
to the pool after breakfast.

12
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,697
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,218
Today, we have time.
I can even buy you an ice cream.

14
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,809
Hurray...

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,258
Sorry, but it takes half an hour
to get to the pool from here.

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,571
I have to be there by 9:45.

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,052
You'll be there at 9:45
and wait 1 5 minutes out in the sun.

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,376
What's new?

19
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,576
I'm okay.

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,569
Omid!

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,850
I saw him at the park.

22
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,098
"Such strange times, my dear."

23
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,218
A friend called me last night...

24
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,211
Who?

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,135
You don't know her.
She called me...

26
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,453
What do I care
whether she calls or not?

27
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,729
I'm talking to you. Let me finish.
When I talk, you raise your voice.

28
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,409
So what?

29
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,779
It's impolite.
Let me finish and you'll understand.

30
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,773
I don't want to hear
what she told you.

31
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,660
Too bad.
You listen to everyone

32
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,619
but you refuse to listen
to your own mother.

33
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,129
Because you're going
to lecture me again.

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,816
You always have to talk.

35
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,290
-I lecture you?
- Yes.

36
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,817
"When you're big
you'll be like this...

37
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,576
"you'll do like this
you'll do like that."

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,978
Think what you like.

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,730
You'll tell me you have a friend

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,416
that her mother divorced.
I know all that.

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,731
No, on the contrary.

42
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,779
She was telling me
why her parents never divorced

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,137
and have always lived in the shit
with loads of problems!

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,099
I knew you'd say that.

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,537
You mean it's good
that you divorced dad

46
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,977
that he was the one in the wrong.

47
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,259
Say what you like
I don't believe it.

48
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,935
I don't believe it.

49
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,491
Don't believe it then.
You only talk to fight.

50
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,654
Like those children full of hate.

51
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,698
I didn't get married again

52
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,488
just to give you another father.

53
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,812
He's a good companion for me
a friend.

54
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,098
But you won't look at him
or compare.

55
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,138
What could I do with your father?

56
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,570
She's starting again!

57
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,416
-How dare you?
- Not so loud.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,536
Not so loud yourself.

59
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,976
You started it:
"l have a friend..."

60
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,858
You didn't let me speak.

61
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,298
You start again.
You start again. You see, mum.

62
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,613
You see, Amin, if we lived to 1 00
we'd still argue.

63
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,818
Unless you listen to me
and start thinking.

64
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,212
You must have
your own experiences...

65
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,008
to understand life.

66
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,053
You're like your father.
He shut me away, destroyed me.

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,292
He wanted me only for himself.

68
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,850
Not so loud.

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,968
Not so loud
or I won't listen to you.

70
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,619
I'll say what I have to say.

71
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,534
I don't want to listen.

72
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,771
Plug your ears, then!

73
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,975
-She's starting again.
-Good for you!

74
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,420
You're obstinate.
You're full of rage.

75
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,253
You want revenge.

76
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,218
You're angry like that

77
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,498
because you refuse reality.

78
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,288
You want me to feel guilty.

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,656
You want me to pity you.

80
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,255
I want what?

81
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,094
-You want me to pity you.
- I can't hear.

82
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,931
You can't hear? Yes, you can.

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,575
You want me to feel guilty.
It won't work.

84
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,090
As soon as I get in the car

85
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,014
she starts again.
Give it a rest!

86
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,251
I want some peace and quiet now.

87
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,138
You refuse to listen.

88
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,294
I don't want to listen
I don't have to.

89
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,258
And I have to?

90
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,650
We said it all yesterday.

91
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,095
I didn't say it all.

92
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,934
Stop talking.

93
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,457
So listen to me.

94
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,089
I'm not shouting
it's my tone of voice.

95
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,770
- "My tone of voice..."
- Listen.

96
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,092
Say it all at home.

97
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,615
You talk
as soon as we're in the car.

98
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,659
There's Mortaza at home.

99
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,369
There's no privacy.

100
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,611
You stupid cow...

101
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,453
Bravo.

102
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,056
As soon as I get in the car
you start again.

103
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,733
This is no time to talk about it.

104
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,255
Two sentences and I'll shut up.

105
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,619
Two sentences
and I'll never speak again.

106
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,819
I feel fulfilled now
like a flowing river.

107
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,088
I was a stagnant pond.
My brain was devastated.

108
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,890
That makes three sentences
and they're all rubbish.

109
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,497
I'll never listen
to your lies again.

110
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,017
-Why lies?
- I won't listen.

111
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,298
I won't listen to you anymore.

112
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,933
You're just telling me again
that you were right to divorce

113
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,137
that dad was wrong.

114
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,974
You may think it's wrong.

115
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,939
But it's good for me
and I'm happy.

116
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,728
You only thought of yourself.

117
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,335
If you love yourself

118
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,493
you can love someone else.

119
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,570
But if not...

120
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,050
Enough. You talk too much!

121
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,375
I won't say anything.

122
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,656
Good. Keep your voice down.

123
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,731
You first, me after.

124
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,290
In the past, I craved
my parents' love.

125
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,214
I'd beg them for a little love...

126
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,976
Enough! You're saying too much.

127
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,739
You're not staying with me
tonight.

128
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,379
I don't want to.

129
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,295
You know why?
You want me for yourself.

130
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,293
I don't want you to be mine.

131
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,211
More excuses.

132
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,250
You want me to be yours.

133
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,336
You're just like your father...

134
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,976
You want to prove

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,498
that you were right to divorce.
And I don't accept it.

136
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,493
You've always looked for trouble.

137
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,851
I'm not stupid.

138
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,454
Think what you like.

139
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,619
You've screwed up.

140
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,259
Think what you like.

141
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,176
You can think that way too.

142
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,692
A man who doesn't love himself
loves no one.

143
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,013
If someone stinks of rot
he'll stink everywhere...

144
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,696
Enough, you've said
your two sentences.

145
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,253
Out of the way!

146
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,174
You get on my nerves
every day.

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,728
Calm down.

148
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,210
I can't. You drive me mad!

149
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,970
- She doesn't understand.
-Out of the way...

150
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,296
I can't live with you.

151
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,211
Why?

152
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,336
I can't.

153
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,736
Because you're a selfish woman.

154
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,778
What have I done?

155
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,568
You see, mum
I talk to you calmly...

156
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,935
Me too.

157
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,137
You get carried away...

158
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,497
I mean that Mortaza
isn't my real father.

159
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,496
My father
couldn't take care of me.

160
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,539
It all confuses me
ruins my life.

161
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,648
I can't live with you.

162
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,657
But once my father marries
I'll go to live with him.

163
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,379
Okay, go ahead.

164
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,009
But don't call me selfish.

165
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,490
Say rather
"l want mum for myself."

166
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,256
But she belongs to no one
only to herself.

167
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,176
Mum, you're not letting me finish.

168
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,857
You'll never know how to talk.

169
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,740
And you'll never be anything.

170
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,451
Bravo, bravo. Thank you.

171
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,935
Here's the result...

172
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,818
The result of what?

173
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,455
The result of your selfishness.

174
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,615
Give me an example.

175
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,977
An example of your selfishness?

176
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,212
You've only ever loved yourself.

177
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,213
You've only thought of yourself.

178
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,293
You've thought of no one else.

179
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,133
I'll tell you something:

180
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,736
no one belongs to anyone
not even you.

181
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,370
You're my child
but you're not mine.

182
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,851
-You belong to this world.
- Sure.

183
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,499
We try to live here.

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,017
That's true
but you don't let me speak.

185
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,776
I'm only a child.

186
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,809
I can't belong to myself.

187
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,733
I have to grow up
to attain an age

188
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,609
that will allow me
to belong to myself.

189
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,090
What's your problem today?

190
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,412
You have to be mine?
And your rights...

191
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,894
No, I can't
you've only thought of yourself.

192
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,653
- You left...
- Where?

193
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,096
You crossed to the other side.

194
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,376
You left this life.

195
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,373
You left me at my father's.

196
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,012
And now you want your child.
It's not possible.

197
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,292
Your father too

198
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,374
is obsessive
wary and superficial.

199
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,258
He isn't wary.

200
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,252
When I married Mortaza

201
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,573
I didn't insist
on making him your father.

202
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,733
How can I tell?
Say something true.

203
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,370
I never said to replace
your father with my husband.

204
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,418
You never said so.

205
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,650
What?

206
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,335
You made it clear enough.

207
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,810
You can say things without words.

208
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,212
- I never did that.
-Yes, you did.

209
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,170
I told Mortaza to be kind to you

210
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,094
Iook after you and love you.

211
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,571
He looks after me?
He gets on my nerves!

212
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,097
-What does he do to you?
- I hate him.

213
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,172
Don't talk to him

214
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,889
if you hate him
or if he annoys you.

215
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,735
But in any case he's my friend
and a good companion.

216
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,294
I swear I'll throw my bag out.

217
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,658
I've had enough. You drive me mad.

218
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,256
You drive me mad with your words.

219
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,616
Besides
you've missed the pool now.

220
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,931
-We're not there yet.
- We are.

221
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,730
But forget it.

222
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,377
Listen, Mortaza
is a stranger to me

223
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,533
Iike any other man.

224
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,772
Like that one or another.

225
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,414
He isn't my father.

226
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,376
Take Peyman...

227
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,294
He's like Peyman for me.

228
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,658
That's it, he's nothing more.

229
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,892
I don't want to eat his food.

230
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,778
I force myself.

231
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,811
-Who taught you to talk like that?
-No one. I taught myself.

232
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,858
Whose food?

233
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,412
I don't want someone
paying for my food

234
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,492
as if I was poor or an orphan.

235
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,496
Who taught you that crap?

236
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,778
Friends share things together
each in turn.

237
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,170
I'm not his friend.

238
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,611
He's a stranger to me.

239
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,450
He's your friend, not mine.

240
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,055
It's pathetic feeling that way.

241
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,009
"l don't want to see him
at his stepfather's table."

242
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,535
That's what your father says.

243
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,498
That's not you.

244
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,857
You're an innocent child
who loves everybody.

245
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,978
You're more obsessive
than my father.

246
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,451
Either it's him
or you're worse than him.

247
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,897
And I'm going crazy.

248
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,969
If I go to his place, he says

249
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,370
"Your mother makes you say
I'm quick-tempered

250
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,498
"and that I'm sick."

251
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,493
I swear it isn't true.

252
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,698
You tell me that my father
gives me these ideas.

253
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,296
It pisses me off in the end.

254
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,573
It shouldn't piss you off.
Try to see reality.

255
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,695
What's the truth?
That you lied at the trial.

256
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,251
You accused my father
of being a drug-addict.

257
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,172
Who said that?

258
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,172
You did!

259
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,173
It was a good way
of getting a divorce.

260
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,014
The rotten laws
in this society of ours

261
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,251
give no rights to women!

262
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,252
To get a divorce

263
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,936
a woman has to say
that she is beaten

264
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,820
or that her husband's on drugs!

265
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,973
- A woman...
- Don't shout in the street!

266
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,768
A woman has no right to live!

267
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,137
A woman has to die
so as to be able to live?

268
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,813
I'll shout if I want.
I'll say what I have to say!

269
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,129
Say it calmly.

270
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,173
Speak quietly!

271
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,219
- And he accuses me.
- Never.

272
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,579
-I ran away...
- Don't shout!

273
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,368
I will. I was like a zombie.

274
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,008
- A zombie!
- Don't shout.

275
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,936
I'll show you what I'll do.

276
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,617
What are you doing?

277
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,019
You stupid idiot.
I've never seen anyone so stupid.

278
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,137
Bravo.

279
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,978
Sir, are you leaving?

280
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,012
You can get by now.

281
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,330
There's enough room.

282
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,974
Come on, back up. Keep going.

283
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,408
There's room.

284
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,535
You're through.

285
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,497
That's it.

286
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,937
- Put it in the back.
- In the back?

287
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,937
6 000 tomans wasted.

288
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,970
It's fruit for the guests

289
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,133
and it's a good price.

290
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,530
That's true. I noticed that...

291
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,693
Careful behind.
He's dropping his passenger.

292
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,330
You were at school?

293
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,618
I give classes there every day.
I have a job.

294
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,259
Every day? And lliade?

295
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,731
He goes to playschool
or comes with me...

296
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,856
He won't accuse you
of abandoning him at playschool.

297
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,896
Of course not.

298
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,372
Today, children accuse
parents of all kinds of things.

299
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,979
They're wrong to. I mean
parents can't kill themselves.

300
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,372
Go straight on.
You can go downhill later.

301
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,498
I wanted to get his cake.

302
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,811
- What cake?
- A simple cake

303
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,779
and I'll put
"Happy birthday Mortaza" on it.

304
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,413
You're buying it at a baker's?

305
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,499
I remember we accused mum
of being a bad mother

306
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,620
because she worked
day and night...

307
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,013
I said to wait
until your son grew to understand.

308
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,173
You'd say
"l leave my son free

309
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,252
"l accept my mistakes".

310
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,138
You see, you can never...

311
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,688
Go that way.

312
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,057
- Is it a dead-end?
-No, go on.

313
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,534
You go to a lot of trouble
and then regret it.

314
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,373
Now, he tells me

315
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,976
"You're not a good mother
you prefer your work to me."

316
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,815
I tell him, "Sweetheart..."

317
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,777
A day-nursery isn't always
a good thing.

318
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,852
At one or two, it's no good.

319
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,458
But at three, especially
for an only child, it's ideal.

320
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,499
Straight on.
After the bus stop

321
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,175
turn onto the main street.

322
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,895
You know what's wrong, sis?

323
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,939
Amin convinces himself
that he's unhappy:

324
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,732
"My mother has remarried
but my father doesn't have a wife."

325
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,975
Leave him be
let him go to his father's

326
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,370
to get to know him better.

327
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,531
Don't fool yourself.

328
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,531
I don't know.

329
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,328
You must let him
get to know his father.

330
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,333
I know you're all right.

331
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,730
But such a close bond hurts you.

332
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,290
I know. You said one day

333
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,010
that we shouldn't have
any bonds at all.

334
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,853
I told you that a bond
comes naturally.

335
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,696
You grow fond of what you love.

336
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,288
That's true.

337
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,133
You can't deny it.

338
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,456
I'm waiting for him to realize that.

339
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,771
When? I don't know.

340
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,418
Look at that guy. What an idiot.

341
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,091
Leave them, they're truck drivers.

342
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,018
Go on, out of the way!

343
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,938
- What an idiot.
-They're holding up traffic.

344
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,298
People are crazy these days.

345
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,333
Go on, follow him, quick.

346
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,819
Follow him through.

347
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,892
Go on.

348
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,934
Don't stop.

349
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,976
Pull over here.
The baker's is just there.

350
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,734
Park in the shade.
Park on a slant.

351
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,139
Wait here a minute.

352
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,336
I won't move.

353
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,093
What did he say?

354
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,652
He says you can't park
outside his shop.

355
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,098
Just a second
I'll be right back.

356
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,735
Sir...

357
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,499
Just a second.
I'll be back in a minute.

358
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,499
Outside the baker's
a guy's selling tapes and new CDs.

359
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,333
What's he doing?

360
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,337
You want money? Here...

361
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,690
They have it easy.

362
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,095
I swear.

363
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,092
- Your husband's 39?
- Yes.

364
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,133
Next year, he'll be 40?

365
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,055
I thought he was a year older.
He still has time.

366
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,258
Bahram is a year younger
than Mortaza...

367
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,979
One year older...

368
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,336
He's a year younger.

369
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,652
- How old is he?
- He was born in 1 964.

370
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,050
And Mortaza in 1 963.

371
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,611
You're right, he's 39.

372
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,137
He's passing 38...

373
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,849
-He's turning 39...
- He needs a 38 candle.

374
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,455
Let him age.

375
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,132
Why this way?!
I've broken my nail.

376
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,893
Which way do I go?

377
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,451
If it was for me
I'd have picked a 25 candle.

378
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,656
I'm sure you would.

379
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,130
But who cares about their own?

380
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,655
- Will his sisters be there later?
- Yes.

381
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,335
They'll ask, "It's 2001.

382
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,890
"why has your wife
got a 39 candle? "

383
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,536
Does lliade go to school
near your house?

384
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,897
No. It's not good
to change schools.

385
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,778
Go down here.

386
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,933
I wanted a word about Amin.

387
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,332
Actually, he's not doing well
at the moment.

388
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,333
You're his mother.
I didn't want to pry.

389
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,050
I saw him over the holidays.
He's become mean.

390
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,578
Mum would speak to him nicely
but he kept shouting.

391
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,415
Mum said, "The more I help him
the less grateful he is."

392
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,890
I told him :
"She's your grandmother

393
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,496
"you can't treat her like that.
What's this attitude?

394
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,052
"You're part of the family."
Not this way, there's a hole.

395
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,692
You found it.

396
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,212
He would play with lliade
and say

397
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,610
"Auntie, if he comes near me
I'll hit him..."

398
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,408
I'd tell him, "He's a child
he wants to play.

399
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,413
"He doesn't know.
Be gentle with him.

400
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,492
"Talk to him to control him."

401
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,299
He didn't do that?

402
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,819
No, not at all.
Nor with Bahram.

403
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,577
He doesn't realize
he's an adult, a man.

404
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,368
He used terrible language.
"What an asshole."

405
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,090
I'd tell him, "Stop it.
It was funny when you were little.

406
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,139
"But no one laughs at you
anymore.

407
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,099
"You've grown up. Be reasonable."

408
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,136
He has to go to his father's.
He'll set him straight.

409
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,213
He won't call him an "asshole".

410
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,929
If he says it...

411
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,773
I hope.

412
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,455
It will do him good.

413
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,419
And don't worry.
Don't look so upset.

414
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,779
He won't be just anywhere
he'll be at his father's.

415
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,853
You haven't put him
in an orphanage.

416
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,535
Go down here.

417
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,213
You'll end up alone
with Mortaza.

418
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,691
Without Mortaza's son or Amin.

419
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,771
It's not easy.

420
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,532
It's not easy
but you have to try.

421
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,179
Mind that old woman.

422
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,456
She's on her last legs
but all the same.

423
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,338
She won't be around much longer.

424
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,979
Don't stop.

425
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,451
Can I give you a lift?

426
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,373
You want to walk?

427
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,532
Thank you. Goodbye.

428
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,858
I'll be like her one day.

429
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,332
He's gone to his father's.
Why are you worried?

430
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,093
He's not just anywhere.

431
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,935
His father should have
looked after him sooner.

432
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,010
He didn't do it.

433
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,773
Now it serves him right.

434
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,570
And don't worry
about what people say.

435
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,652
Tell them
"He's always lived with me

436
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,813
"now he's going to his father's.

437
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,531
"At his age, a boy needs his father
to go to matches.

438
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,328
"To play football
he needs his father.

439
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,857
"Even at the baths. He's a man
he can't come with me now."

440
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,738
So there's no problem.

441
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,452
Stop there, just next door.
Pull over.

442
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,699
I'll run and put the cake
in the fridge.

443
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,212
Don't go any further
there are stones.

444
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,452
- Get out and take the cake.
- Stop here.

445
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,136
Let me take all this.

446
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,939
Hello.

447
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,852
Is this a dead-end?

448
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,171
No. Where do you want to go?

449
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,138
Want me to drop you off?

450
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,735
I'm going
to Ali Akbar's mausoleum

451
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,937
Get in then, on the other side.

452
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,536
May God bless you.

453
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,818
May God protect you.

454
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,893
May He save us
from all our worries.

455
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,778
What's your worry?

456
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,295
If you want to go this way...

457
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,975
I'm lost
I don't know this way.

458
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,973
Well, don't go down here
it leads nowhere.

459
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,450
- Should I turn back?
- No.

460
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,211
Where's the mausoleum?

461
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,292
Over there.

462
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,851
I'll turn back
and take the other road.

463
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,329
Why are you going there?

464
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,935
I go in the morning
at midday and at sunset.

465
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,569
I pray
for the boys and the girls.

466
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,573
I pray for the old women
and old men.

467
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,651
You only go there to pray?

468
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,335
I pray there or elsewhere.

469
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,378
Are your wishes granted?

470
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,818
God alone grants wishes
my prayers don't need that.

471
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,213
My husband is dead
my twelve-year-old son too.

472
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,576
That's why I pray.

473
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,858
I also sold my house
to go on a pilgrimage to Syria.

474
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,855
This is Saint Roqyé's rosary.

475
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,851
Let me see.

476
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,809
Here, this is Saint Roqyé's
and this is the lmam Hossein's.

477
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,177
- It's beautiful.
- Here.

478
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,697
-It's so pretty.
- Here.

479
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,250
I swear on the severed arms
of St Abolfazl

480
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,617
that these are the only riches
I own.

481
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,693
-Just this rosary?
-I've known great misfortune.

482
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,092
But I gave everything I owned

483
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,176
to someone who had 1 2 daughters.

484
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,617
I had 20 pillows, I swear.

485
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,977
I've been to lspahan.

486
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,258
I have a daughter with 7 children.

487
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,176
She has a stomach tumour.
She's afraid of the operation.

488
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,899
She stayed three days.

489
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,814
She left this morning
with two of her daughters.

490
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,256
She's just married off
one of her girls.

491
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,855
She's three months pregnant.

492
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,535
I gave all my things.

493
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,772
1 0 pillows for each of them.

494
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,212
I swear, on the lmam Reza.

495
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,735
May God be praised.

496
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,530
I gave my eight mattresses.
I gave away the quilts too.

497
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,373
Small and large.

498
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,057
I also went
on a pilgrimage to Meched

499
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,575
two weeks ago.

500
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,051
This way leads
to lsmail's mausoleum.

501
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,896
That way leads
to Ali Akbar's mausoleum.

502
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,975
May God grant your wishes.

503
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,736
There's the mausoleum sign.

504
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,539
Yes. Good.

505
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,648
I hope your wishes
will come true.

506
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,936
Of all the riches in the world

507
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,773
apart from God, I own only this.

508
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,933
Very good. The fewer ties you have
the better you live.

509
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,979
I hope so.
When I'm dead...

510
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,451
They say you leave
from where you came.

511
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,778
Do you always come on foot?

512
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,651
Sometimes on foot
sometimes people give me rides.

513
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,616
You see all these people?

514
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,771
It's Friday, of course.

515
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,455
- This is it.
- Yes, this is it.

516
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,294
If you like, I'll watch the car
while you pray.

517
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,850
No, thank you.
I have a lot to do.

518
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,296
-May God bless you.
-Pray for us too.

519
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,058
In the name of St Ali Akbar
and the lmam Hossein

520
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,612
I'll stay in the car.
Go and pray.

521
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,851
May God grant your wishes.

522
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,772
I'll stay here. Go on.

523
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,614
No, I'm in a hurry.
I have to go.

524
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,012
Listen, I'm going.

525
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,776
I already came this morning
at midday and now.

526
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,977
-May God preserve you.
-Goodbye.

527
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,497
May God help everyone.

528
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,932
May God grant you all you desire.

529
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,688
Goodbye.

530
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,973
-Stop here, I'm getting out.
- You made a mistake?

531
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,892
It doesn't matter.

532
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,214
I'm interested in talking to you.

533
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,772
Stop here, I'm getting out.
This is fine.

534
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,573
-You thought I was a man?
-What did you think?

535
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,575
I'm getting out here.

536
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,179
-Okay. A bit further on...
-They've gone.

537
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,093
I'll drop you.

538
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,535
Here, I said.

539
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,010
I saw you get out
of the Mercedes.

540
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,808
This is pissing me off.
Stop here.

541
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,058
No further.
No one passes by here.

542
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,177
Let me out here.

543
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,968
I'll drop you where you want.

544
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,291
I'm going nowhere. Leave me here.

545
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,894
Really?
Why do you do this?

546
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,290
Why not? Give me a break.

547
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,376
You want to lecture me?
An honest trade, a decent job...

548
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,656
Let me out here!

549
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,618
It's interesting
a girl of your age...

550
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,818
Not too far.

551
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,893
Where are you taking me?
I have to walk back after.

552
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,938
Leave me be
or I'll go back to where I was.

553
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,376
I'll take you back.

554
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,098
How old are you?

555
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,095
No, really, how old are you?

556
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,059
What is it? How old are you?

557
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,134
Let me out.
There's no need to take me back.

558
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,132
I'm getting out here.

559
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,054
Pretend I'm a man...
Imagine.

560
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,859
You're crazy.

561
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,694
How can I imagine that?!

562
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,738
Just imagine that I'm a man.

563
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,451
I'm not working
in that field yet.

564
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,657
I'm still working the first...

565
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,255
You've only had experience
with men.

566
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,616
Talk to a woman for once.

567
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,293
I'd like to know...

568
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,498
But I can't do anything for you.

569
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,697
Maybe you're not wrong?

570
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,531
No, really.
What's the reason why you do this?

571
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,331
The reason?
Sex, love, sex...

572
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,256
That's all life is?

573
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,778
It's a trade, it's my job.

574
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,657
And I like it.
What is this, "interesting"?

575
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,732
Who do you think you are

576
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,530
sitting at your wheel
lecturing me, guiding me?

577
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,569
I'm not going to start sobbing

578
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,017
"It's life or it's destiny."

579
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,892
What is this place?
Go somewhere with people around

580
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,017
where cars pass by.

581
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,458
This is the back of beyond.
The place is dead.

582
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,332
-Really, it's interesting...
-Here we go again.

583
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,130
I braked, you thought I was a man
and you got in.

584
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,213
- Surprise! I'm a woman.
-You thought I was a guy?!

585
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,056
-I saw you get out of the Mercedes.
- You're worse than me.

586
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,771
I'm telling you the truth.

587
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,013
I didn't think you'd get in.

588
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,456
They were there for me.

589
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,056
I got in
I shook them off for you.

590
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,259
Serves them right.
We shook them off.

591
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,813
Anyhow, I don't want to guide you
or lecture to you.

592
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,815
I've never had your experience
what you feel, your sensations...

593
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,372
Why? What are you trying to prove?

594
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,019
I didn't mean that...

595
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,332
The sensations?
What sensations?

596
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,011
Which one do you want to know?

597
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,259
Is everything sexual
interesting for you?

598
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,253
Not at all. What's sexual?

599
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,855
You're the ones who
focus on the sex.

600
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,535
We don't see the sex in it.

601
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,650
I'll take off my shoes.
My feet hurt...

602
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,808
Were you out on the streets
too long?

603
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,889
It's my job, I like it.
Don't go thinking...

604
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,768
It's really interesting.

605
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,252
Don't you ever think
about sin or guilt?

606
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,370
That was a stupid thing to say
wasn't it?

607
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,418
Guilt?

608
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,939
Really, why do you do it?

609
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,820
When I see you on the streets...

610
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,689
Why don't you ask yourself
the same question?

611
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,212
Why don't you do it?

612
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,213
Why don't you do it?
Are you married?

613
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,216
- Yes, I'm married.
- You're married...

614
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,012
Does he love you?

615
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,570
It's okay, we get by.

616
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,731
He says, "l love you "
doesn't he?

617
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,255
I suppose so.

618
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,413
You know, I don't tell anyone.

619
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,489
But I see them.
When they're in bed with me...

620
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,175
The wives call:

621
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,616
"Sweetheart."

622
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,135
They call their husbands?

623
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,497
Yes. It's easy with a cell phone.

624
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,175
"Sweetheart, sweetheart...

625
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,098
"l was just leaving the office.

626
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,732
"Take care. I love you too."

627
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,291
He says, "l love you."
Then he hangs up.

628
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,408
Most of them manage to say
"l love you."

629
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,729
You mean they lie?

630
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,335
In bed, when they're with me...

631
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,220
That's normal for a lot of our men.

632
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,416
What?

633
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,093
And the poor wife is like you.

634
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,699
You think your husband
is faithful and loves only you?

635
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,970
If they're like that
why do you do it?

636
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,936
I like it.

637
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,173
You see. You're a woman, I am too.
You mustn't...

638
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,379
No, no, don't say it like that.

639
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,818
You're an idiot
and I'm smart.

640
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,779
Why do you think that?
It's interesting...

641
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,490
You think that we're all idiots.

642
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,213
I always wondered
"Why do those women do that? "

643
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,658
I remember that someone
told me :

644
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,098
"You could end up like them
you mustn't..."

645
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,130
You mustn't make fun
it can happen to you too.

646
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,294
You can make fun of me
I don't care...

647
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,257
Not at all.

648
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,095
I know what I'm doing.
I know the life I lead.

649
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,811
You can lecture me
I don't care.

650
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,654
- No, not at all.
-I like my job.

651
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,972
Don't you ever grow fond

652
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,576
of the men you sleep with?
Do you fall in love?

653
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,255
Don't you like to have feelings

654
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,538
before making love?

655
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,888
-What are you talking about?
-Don't you need that?

656
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,652
I used to need them.
But I needed them so much that...

657
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,179
That's your problem. You're all
clinging to your men.

658
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,496
You cling to your husband.

659
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,574
You know that?
You cling to your husband.

660
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,370
To satisfy yourself.

661
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,459
Why? To satisfy your needs.

662
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,251
You just need to know
he's been with another woman.

663
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,378
I don't know how much he loves you.

664
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,170
- You mean...
-Let me speak.

665
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,252
Listen to me.

666
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,376
You just have to know
he has another woman.

667
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,294
Was that the reason
why you started

668
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,858
what you're doing?

669
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,535
Was it?

670
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,610
No.

671
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,978
You know, I'm not sighing

672
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,690
because I'm unhappy.

673
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,296
I'm sighing
because I was unhappy.

674
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,611
My foot hurts.

675
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:04,094
It's not that.
I was unhappy.

676
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,095
He'd tell me, "Until the day I die
you'll be the only one."

677
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,813
I'd wake up thinking of him...

678
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,416
- A husband or a boyfriend?
-We were engaged.

679
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,094
I'd wake up thinking of him.

680
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:25,774
I loved him so much.
I was such a fool.

681
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,933
I'd tell him
"I'm yours alone."

682
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,572
And he'd say, "You're mine
and I'm yours."

683
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,055
You understand?

684
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,328
- You understand?
-Now you belong to no one?

685
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,811
I don't know. I don't care.

686
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,689
You think
life is easier now?

687
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,770
Now?

688
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,931
My life's easy...

689
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,613
I don't need anyone or anything.

690
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,250
You're all unhappy.

691
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,050
If ever your guy says
the wrong thing

692
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,336
or doesn't sleep with you...

693
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,571
I know.

694
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,379
No nookie tonight.

695
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,772
That doesn't bother us.

696
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,931
And the money?

697
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,339
No screwing, no money.

698
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,539
But it makes you others
desperate...

699
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,454
You mean you do this
for the money?

700
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,136
You don't feel the need
for more sentiment?

701
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,169
No. Sometimes I get off.

702
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,059
You get off?

703
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,299
Sometimes...

704
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,977
You don't think
and you grow fond of no one?

705
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,653
Do I look like an idiot?
Like you?

706
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,098
It's a contract with yourself.

707
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,299
You have sex, take the money
and so on?

708
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,450
Yes.

709
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,528
You see, it's like...

710
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,297
It's give and take.

711
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,970
You think
it's not the same for you?

712
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,773
- It's not the same?
- What?

713
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,091
- Give and take?
- Who with?

714
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,015
With your husband.
There's no give and take?

715
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,771
Who bought you that necklace?

716
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,854
It's fake
I'm not too keen on jewellery.

717
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,978
-Who bought it for you?
-My husband.

718
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,296
You see.

719
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,180
And that night, he gave you...

720
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,376
You're saying
that life is all trade?

721
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,053
Is that it?

722
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,578
I don't care but you have
the give and take too.

723
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,289
You're the wholesalers.

724
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,497
We're the retailers.

725
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,892
I was wrong to say
you're the wholesalers?

726
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,251
Do you have children?

727
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,930
No.

728
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,858
Perhaps if you got pregnant...

729
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,057
No, I've been pregnant.

730
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,611
I get pregnant.
We get pregnant...

731
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,816
- You abort?
- Yes.

732
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,859
This is good. It's nice and busy.

733
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,772
Goodbye.

734
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,529
Hello.

735
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,779
- You come to the mausoleum too?
- Yes.

736
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,293
They let you in
without a chador?

737
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,258
The chador's in my bag.

738
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,019
I came yesterday

739
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,616
and got in without any trouble.

740
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,376
But today they wouldn't
let me in without a chador.

741
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,850
Maybe because it's Friday.

742
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,859
In some mausoleums
they loan chadors

743
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,410
to women who don't have one.

744
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,129
Or, as they say
if they're not correctly veiled.

745
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,056
I don't know why it happened
like that today.

746
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,571
Do you come here every day?

747
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,415
Not every day
once or twice a week.

748
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,208
I'm used to coming here.

749
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,773
It hasn't become a habit
for me yet.

750
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,455
But I came yesterday

751
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,976
and I wanted to come today
as well.

752
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,139
It's interesting...

753
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,534
I never imagined that I'd come

754
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,132
to a mausoleum one day

755
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,779
to pray.

756
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,217
I never imagined that either.

757
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,290
Why?

758
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:26,008
- You're not a believer?
- Actually, I wasn't.

759
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,572
- You believe now?
- To a certain extent...

760
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,178
Actually
when I come to the mausoleum

761
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,453
it soothes me.

762
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,217
Anyhow...

763
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,218
I haven't found
peace of mind yet.

764
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,771
One day maybe. Who knows...

765
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,528
One day, a woman said to me

766
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,739
"lf you pray here
your wishes will be granted."

767
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,135
I don't know.

768
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,530
Maybe her wishes were granted.

769
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,612
That's what she claimed.

770
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,377
-I haven't had anything yet.
-Not yet?

771
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,572
I've been coming here for ages

772
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,529
and I still haven't had anything.

773
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,528
I don't know.

774
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:35,334
Perhaps it's a big wish...
Too big?

775
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,493
It's not a very big wish.

776
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,693
I was supposed to get married.

777
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,933
But I don't know
if it's feasible.

778
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,376
I come here to pray
to make it come true.

779
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,337
You mean, he's hesitating...

780
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,568
Or do you have
family problems?

781
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,776
No.

782
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,137
I think he's full of contradictions.

783
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,850
Excuse me.

784
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,819
How can I get by
if you just stand there?

785
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,415
And you think it's funny?

786
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,532
What an idiot!

787
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,616
You don't care how you park.

788
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,055
Go that way.

789
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,212
-This is a one-way street.
- I don't believe it.

790
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,417
Go, sister, go!

791
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,253
Sorry, I interrupted you.
I didn't understand.

792
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,933
He doesn't want to or...

793
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,457
No, it's not
that he doesn't want to.

794
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,898
I think he's full of contradictions.

795
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,972
He's not sure he wants to marry?

796
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,768
How about you?
Do you want to marry?

797
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,649
They say it's fate, of course.

798
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,698
When I hear that

799
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,488
I don't really feel
like coming to the mausoleum.

800
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,653
When they say
it's all in the hands of fate?

801
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,010
I also tell my son
that fate is behind things:

802
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,015
"Come what may."

803
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:22,136
He says he doesn't understand fate.

804
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,930
-He just can't accept it.
- What's his problem?

805
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,894
He has no particular problem.

806
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,132
Or maybe he has. I'm not sure.

807
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,691
I divorced his father.

808
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,852
And I remarried.

809
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,853
One day, he no longer wanted
to live with me.

810
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,818
And he left.

811
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,459
He tells me
that I'm a bad mother

812
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,135
because I split up
with his father

813
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:57,215
and married someone else.

814
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,895
That kind of thing.

815
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:06,489
Mainly, he couldn't stand
the atmosphere at home anymore.

816
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:13,413
I don't know.
I feel guilty at times.

817
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,494
I don't know.

818
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,894
The first time
that I came to the mausoleum

819
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,810
that feeling all but faded away.

820
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,289
For now, all I do is pray.

821
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,535
Before, praying seemed ridiculous.

822
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:14,971
I used to say, "You pray
to force God to give you things."

823
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,933
-That's interesting. Sorry!
- Don't mention it.

824
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,378
When do I bring him back?

825
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,530
Amin.

826
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,650
-When do I bring him back?
- You have to.

827
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,495
-Can he stay the night?
-No, bring him back.

828
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,615
All right.

829
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,090
Hello.

830
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,212
Are you well?

831
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,615
Take me to grandma's.

832
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,936
All right.

833
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,250
If you want
you can keep him tonight.

834
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,970
But ask him where his school is
to drop him off tomorrow.

835
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,972
Thanks. All right.

836
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,174
Are you pleased
to be staying with me tonight?

837
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,856
No.

838
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,489
I don't get a kiss?

839
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,651
- I don't want to.
- You don't want to?

840
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,656
When you come to pick me up
from grandma's

841
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,970
don't forget to bring
the tape of Hercules.

842
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,289
Where is it?

843
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,498
At home.
Ask Nima, he knows.

844
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,932
Don't forget.

845
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,170
I'll call you.

846
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,695
- Want an ice cream?
- No.

847
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,931
Is your throat sore?

848
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,171
Even with a sore throat
I'd have had one...

849
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,819
I wouldn't have.

850
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,371
I have a bad cold.

851
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,339
I have to take my medicine
at five o'clock.

852
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,498
Do you have it with you?

853
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,179
Why do you have a cold?

854
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,538
Were you at the pool?

855
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,970
-Do you have a fever too?
- No.

856
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,135
- Your head's cool.
-But you're burning up.

857
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,850
I'm taking computing classes.

858
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,649
Weren't you already?

859
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,968
Not like these.

860
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,888
Have you learned more?

861
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,334
I'm doing programming now.

862
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,889
I could have gone that way.

863
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,688
-You have to go there!
-There's another way.

864
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,453
Mum!

865
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,417
It's that way.

866
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,333
I'm not stupid.

867
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,658
This is a short cut.

868
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,138
This leads there too.

869
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,014
I'm not going home.

870
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,291
Don't count on it.

871
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,010
How will we do it?
Tell me, how.

872
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,457
You know a short cut, do you?

873
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,289
I'll take a short cut.

874
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,259
We're going to grandma's.
Is that what you want?

875
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,656
I remember
coming this way in a cab.

876
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,455
You see, I'm not lying.

877
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,619
A pity there's no gear
that lets us fly.

878
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,972
A gear that lets us fly?

879
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,536
How much would a car
with a gear like that cost?

880
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,259
I don't know.

881
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,338
I don't even know if it's possible.

882
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,810
It is, they have them abroad.

883
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,088
We saw it on satellite TV.

884
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,614
Your father has a dish?

885
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,218
You watch cartoons?

886
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,498
There's a non-stop carton channel.

887
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,928
And other stuff
he won't let me watch.

888
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,689
What?

889
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,813
He locks the channels

890
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,573
and watches them at night.

891
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,015
He unlocks them
to watch them on his own?

892
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,693
Why not with you?

893
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,453
It's not right.

894
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,931
-What's not right?
-Not right at all.

895
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,090
There are
some very, very sexy scenes.

896
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,968
Sex! Sex!

897
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,251
-He watches alone at night?
- Yes.

898
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,655
I'm stopping here
to buy a cake.

899
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,174
Who for?

900
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,774
For us.

901
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,731
Wait here, I won't be long.

902
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,619
Hello.

903
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,374
How are you?

904
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,536
-Okay?
-I'm getting by.

905
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,490
What's the matter now?

906
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:40,699
Give it a rest
so we can eat in peace.

907
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,455
That's enough. Forget it.

908
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:10,215
You're weak, very weak
you understand?

909
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:14,216
You cling to someone
who leaves you like this.

910
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:18,215
I didn't know
I was so fond of him.

911
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,416
It's useless.
I don't understand.

912
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,413
Forget him.

913
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,332
We women are unhappy.

914
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,697
We don't love ourselves.

915
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,215
We don't know how to live
for ourselves.

916
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,897
What does that mean?
That's enough.

917
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,417
You can't sum it all up
in just one person.

918
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,693
You're pretty far gone.

919
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,053
Life is so vast

920
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,530
why depend on just one person?

921
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,929
Why not?

922
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,011
Why not be different?

923
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,490
It's not love.
It's an illusion.

924
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,539
If it's an illusion
what is love, then?

925
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,732
First, you must love yourself.

926
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,972
You despise yourself so much
you hurt yourself.

927
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,619
Has he gone? Too bad.

928
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,212
There's more than one man
in the world.

929
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,609
And you're still crying?
Go on. Leave him too.

930
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,419
I can't!

931
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,050
You're wrong to cling to him.

932
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,928
It's an illusion. That's all!

933
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,411
You were hurting each other
like psychopaths:

934
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,573
"Why are you late?
Who's on the phone? Where were you?

935
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,936
"Why this, why that? "

936
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,136
I can't believe it.

937
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,015
I went to a health club.

938
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,213
Some bitch, the manageress
told me

939
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,577
"Women need a big ass
or big tits.

940
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,413
"That's what men like."

941
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:56,299
We should please them.
That's a weakness!

942
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,088
All the same
I was fond of him.

943
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,536
You were wrong.

944
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,213
We're unhappy
dependent, clinging.

945
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,259
When we were little, we clung
to our mother and father.

946
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,094
Then to another boy
then to our child.

947
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,298
When our child is taken
we cling to our work.

948
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,089
Like idiots.

949
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,980
When he's there, it's love.

950
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,212
When you lose him
you say it was an illusion

951
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,735
and that it wasn't love.

952
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,733
He's no longer there.

953
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,618
Honey...

954
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:33,329
You can cry all you want.

955
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,174
He's not there anymore.

956
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,857
It's all over now.

957
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,889
What can I do about it?
Cry, weep?

958
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,336
I don't understand.

959
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,336
What's the difference now?

960
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,973
You mustn't destroy yourself.

961
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,335
I'm not telling you
to be carefree.

962
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,857
I've lost him, he's gone.

963
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,330
I'm a wreck. What can I do?

964
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,618
Why focus everything
on just one person?

965
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:07,012
Should your life and your ruin
depend on just one person?

966
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,130
What's preventing you
from being yourself?

967
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,936
What's preventing you
from being yourself?

968
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,818
I can't believe it.

969
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,210
It makes me sick.

970
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:23,135
So do you.
Go on cry! Too bad for you.

971
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,652
He's having a great time.
Bastard!

972
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,972
Don't say he's having a good time!
Don't say that!

973
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,291
She's mad.

974
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,214
It's crazy!
I don't understand a thing.

975
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,612
What does it mean?

976
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,057
You never had a good time?

977
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,253
- You haven't known pleasure?
-Pleasure isn't everything.

978
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,170
Even if I've known pleasure

979
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,334
why allow someone else
to take it from me?

980
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,054
After seven years.

981
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,132
Why not after seven years?

982
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,017
Tell me, what's the problem?

983
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:06,253
What's the problem?
I've lost him!

984
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,334
Honestly, honey.

985
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:14,858
You can't live without losing.
We come into the world for that.

986
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,653
To win and to lose.
Win! Lose!

987
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,619
Why don't you want to lose?

988
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,089
See what it's like.

989
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,618
Experience, more experience.

990
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,613
You need it, that's all.

991
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,577
Nothing but experience!

992
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,459
Move it!

993
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:39,132
I think we've passed the restaurant.

994
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,058
See, you're making me nervous.
I can't drive anymore.

995
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,536
Dry your tears
and let's have dinner.

996
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,058
I'll park here.
We can walk a little.

997
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,939
What can we do?
It doesn't matter.

998
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,775
Parking's banned here.

999
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,051
We'll get a fine.

1000
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,409
A fine at the worst.

1001
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,570
Look if I'm in the way.

1002
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,697
Back up a little.

1003
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:31,208
- Am I still on it?
-No, it's okay.

1004
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,490
Right.

1005
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,409
Let's go!

1006
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,053
Are you okay?

1007
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,615
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1008
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,972
What did she say?

1009
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,495
Nothing.

1010
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,653
She said, "Amin's well.

1011
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:06,609
"We're very happy with him.
He seems happier like this.

1012
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:11,339
"He's a man.
He has to grow up with a man

1013
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,970
"He has to grow up with his father.
You must let him."

1014
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,495
I said
"I'll accept your opinion.

1015
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,611
"Do as you like.

1016
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:27,298
"Do what Amin and his father
decide is best.

1017
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,057
"lf Amin is happier
then I agree."

1018
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,896
She said

1019
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:38,018
"Allow Amin to live with his father

1020
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:43,095
"because he's calmer
and more easy-going there."

1021
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,331
I said, "Agreed."

1022
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:53,495
- That's all? In 1 5 minutes?
- She said that.

1023
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,048
She also said

1024
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,692
"Amin has spent 7 years with you
you've done enough.

1025
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,976
"Now he's a man.

1026
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:06,693
"He has to grow up
alongside a man."

1027
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,817
I told her, "You're right.

1028
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,938
"You're right, all of you
Amin's father too.

1029
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,693
"Do as you see fit.

1030
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,932
"I'll accept Amin's decision
and yours."

1031
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,099
That kind of thing.

1032
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,571
Can we use the fifth gear?

1033
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,697
No, don't do that.

1034
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,417
Can I slip into second?

1035
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,412
No, we can't.

1036
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,579
-You drive in first gear?
- Third.

1037
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:53,057
Which is the fastest?

1038
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,139
Which is the fastest?

1039
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,375
Fifth.

1040
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,538
Which is the slowest?

1041
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:12,328
First. You use it to start.

1042
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,896
-How are you? I've missed you.
- And second?

1043
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,097
First gear
is when you start the car.

1044
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:20,890
Second is faster.

1045
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:24,098
Third even faster.
In fourth, you go very fast

1046
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,615
and in fifth, very, very fast.

1047
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,139
- A kiss for mum?
-What gear is this?

1048
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,212
Another kiss for mum?

1049
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,128
-Which gear is this?
- That's neutral.

1050
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,819
She said you're enrolled at school
is that right?

1051
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,295
Do you feel hot, like me?

1052
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:03,495
Yes.

1053
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,333
Are you a bit chesty?

1054
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,332
Are we going to grandma's?

1055
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,732
Yes, we are.
Aren't you coming to our place?

1056
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,412
It's up to you.

1057
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,612
Your aunt also told me

1058
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,578
that you want your father
to get married?

1059
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,936
That you'd like him
to marry again.

1060
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,378
That it could be better.
Is that true?

1061
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,095
You think your father needs it?

1062
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:39,255
Tell him to take a wife
for you too.

1063
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,728
Tell him to find
a mother and a daughter.

1064
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,699
The mother for him
and the daughter for you.

1065
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,855
He'll take the uglier one
and you the prettier one.

1066
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:56,853
His will look after you
and yours will look after him.

1067
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,218
As long as he doesn't lay hands
on your wife.

1068
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,978
It's so hot!

1069
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:24,010
In any case, his wife
won't be prettier than me.

1070
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,855
Marjan was prettier than you.

1071
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,295
Impossible.

1072
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,488
In any case, she won't be better.

1073
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,492
Rubbish!

1074
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,897
If she isn't prettier

1075
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:44,530
she's bound to be better.

1076
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,612
Better than me?

1077
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,569
What'll make her better?

1078
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,292
- Tell me.
- You know better than I do.

1079
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,770
-No, say it.
- You know better than I do.

1080
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,453
Give me two reasons.

1081
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:01,295
You know better than I do.
There are a thousand reasons.

1082
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,611
Will she say her prayers?

1083
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,533
No, why do you ask?

1084
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,812
I thought that maybe...

1085
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,970
No make-up allowed.

1086
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,975
No mini skirts allowed.

1087
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,497
She'll wear baggy dresses
she'll stay in all day...

1088
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:26,099
She'll do the dishes
cook good meals...

1089
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,973
The house will be perfect.

1090
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,416
In any case
she'll be better than you.

1091
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,059
A good wife for your father!

1092
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,052
Better than you.

1093
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,893
I get the message.

1094
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,859
She'll always smell of cooking.

1095
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,613
She'll say to her husband
"All right, dear.

1096
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:45,932
"l agree and I'll obey you."

1097
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,690
True or not?

1098
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:52,093
I'll add one thing:

1099
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:58,299
At least, we won't have
the same food every night!

1100
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,969
Even if she has all those faults

1101
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,337
we won't eat the same thing

1102
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,776
tonight and tomorrow night.

1103
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:13,651
She won't be out all the time.

1104
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:14,412
I see.

1105
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,538
You've talked so much
and then one word convinced you.

1106
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,737
All right, I surrender.

1107
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:23,570
It's good that life
can be summed up in the stomach.

1108
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,049
What?

1109
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:30,215
Nothing. It's good that everything
comes down to food.

1110
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,529
It's not that.

1111
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,889
It has nothing to do with it.

1112
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,009
That's not the problem.

1113
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:43,896
If last night's meal was excellent

1114
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:48,099
you can eat the same thing again.

1115
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,095
That's not the problem.

1116
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:58,177
The problem is taking on
responsibility at home.

1117
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:03,848
Not being afraid of washing
two plates in the evening.

1118
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:07,416
Managing without a maid.

1119
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:12,052
Spending a day or an evening
without a maid.

1120
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,771
If you have money
you can hire home help.

1121
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,614
I have to take photos
paint or travel.

1122
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,532
I have more important things
to do

1123
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,055
than wash dishes
or vacuum the carpets.

1124
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,053
A maid can do the housework.

1125
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,290
She can't take photos.

1126
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:33,853
But the other will never have
as much work as you.

1127
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:38,173
You're not the only example.

1128
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,689
Okay.

1129
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,979
-You think everyone's like you.
-You're right.

1130
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:47,849
The new wife won't have
as much work as me.

1131
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:49,738
You'll be able to spend
more time with her.

1132
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,891
- You don't understand.
-I say you're right.

1133
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,972
You think everyone's like you.

1134
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,211
It's not our problem.

1135
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:59,131
You don't know what a mother is.

1136
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,259
All right.

1137
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,258
No, it's this way.

1138
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,569
I don't want to...

1139
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,290
-I already told you...
-I don't want to go this way.

1140
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,498
It's a short cut, dear.

1141
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,090
I want to go to grandma's.

1142
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:24,732
I'll cook for you at grandma's.
Why are you shouting?

1143
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,173
I'll stay at grandma's with you.

1144
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,808
I don't want you to.

1145
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,095
Go away.

1146
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:42,578
You were supposed to come at 1 1 :30
but you were working.

1147
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,649
You didn't go for petrol.

1148
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,773
It takes a minute to fill a tank.

1149
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,536
When you panicked
I knew I was right.

1150
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,259
You're not letting me explain.

1151
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,048
You didn't go for petrol.

1152
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:02,692
You didn't want to leave work
to pick up your child.

1153
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:05,090
It's not that. You're wrong.

1154
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:09,049
I called. The maid told me
you weren't there.

1155
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:11,496
You weren't at home.

1156
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,493
I called a thousand times.

1157
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,936
I'll explain.
I'll tell you where I was.

1158
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,093
-I've figured that out.
- Where was l?

1159
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,460
- I don't know.
-So what do you mean?

1160
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,894
I just meant I understood...

1161
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,688
Look, don't judge others.

1162
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,092
I understand! You didn't go
to fill your tank!

1163
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,893
Stop shouting.

1164
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,335
I get it!

1165
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,252
- Don't shout.
-I like shouting!

1166
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,538
I'll explain.

1167
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,370
You didn't go for petrol.

1168
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:48,170
Just say you had work
or something else to do.

1169
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,297
Don't shout, Amin.

1170
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,850
I needed water for the battery.

1171
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:58,254
Yes, yes, sure!
You're right. Get out of here!

1172
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:01,617
I had to change the water
in the battery.

1173
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,895
It wasn't that.

1174
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:06,053
Yes. I had something else to do.
What do you say?

1175
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,972
-There, you were busy.
- So?

1176
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,656
You didn't want to...

1177
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,457
You're lying.

1178
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,452
One last thing and we'll stop.

1179
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:17,010
Get lost! You're lying!

1180
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,168
I'm a selfish liar
and the conversation's over.

1181
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,010
If I remember rightly, last time

1182
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:43,374
you said he was full
of contradictions.

1183
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,737
Yes, but I was wrong.
They aren't contradictions.

1184
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:50,052
He won't marry me.

1185
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,379
Why?

1186
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,372
He says it wouldn't work.

1187
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,218
I don't know what wouldn't work.

1188
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:02,896
But...

1189
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:09,496
When I asked him, "Are you sure
you don't want to marry me? "

1190
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,775
he said, "Yes".

1191
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,295
I told him
"You'll regret it one day."

1192
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,496
I don't know.

1193
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:22,213
The thing that upsets me...
No, it's not that.

1194
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,533
What hurts me...

1195
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,615
is that he's thinking
of someone else.

1196
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:33,896
I feel really bad.

1197
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:37,493
I'm getting jealous.

1198
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,932
After all this time
he's after someone else?

1199
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:46,332
In fact, it hasn't been that long.

1200
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:51,892
He thinks that easily
of someone else?

1201
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,493
I don't know
if it's easy for him...

1202
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,539
But he's thinking of someone else.

1203
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,571
That's hard, isn't it?

1204
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:13,699
Yes, it's hard.

1205
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,569
No, not that hard...

1206
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,539
The hardest part for me

1207
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,973
is admitting that it's hard.

1208
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,099
I'm ashamed of saying
that it's hard.

1209
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:42,853
Because I thought
everything I liked would happen.

1210
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,853
I never imagined
it would be impossible.

1211
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,293
I understand.

1212
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:55,089
Sometimes, I tell myself
that it's very selfish to think

1213
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:58,059
that everything I like
has to come true.

1214
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,648
How do you feel?

1215
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,699
Not bad.

1216
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,896
I think I'll soon be over it.

1217
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:23,691
Are you modest?
Why is your veil so tight?

1218
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,330
It doesn't suit you.

1219
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,496
Have you cut your hair?

1220
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,778
You have?

1221
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,177
Am I hideous?

1222
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,458
-lt suits you.
-Thank you.

1223
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,814
Why?

1224
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,891
Why did you do it?

1225
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,449
Why did you do it?

1226
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,693
In any case, it suits you.

1227
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,017
Let me see.

1228
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,132
Why are you crying?

1229
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,654
I know it's hard to lose.

1230
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,859
Very hard.

1231
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,659
You lose at times, unfortunately.

1232
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,419
I don't know.

1233
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,297
Don't cry.

1234
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,615
I'm laughing and crying.

1235
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,172
What did you feel
when you did that?

1236
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,929
I felt great.
I stopped crying.

1237
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:51,731
This is the first time I've cried
since then.

1238
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,812
It really suits you.

1239
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,768
You're very pretty. Really.

1240
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,330
My scarf has slipped...

1241
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:06,537
It doesn't matter now.
Let your head breathe.

1242
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,372
Do you feel better now?

1243
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,895
Yes, much better.

1244
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,969
He's gone. Have you changed?

1245
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:23,616
But I'd like him to be here.

1246
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,659
I understand.

1247
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:56,415
When shall I bring him back?

1248
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,576
- What time?
- What?

1249
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,732
-When do I bring him back?
- You have to.

1250
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,096
Can't he stay tonight?

1251
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:17,935
-What time will you be here?
-1 0:30, is that okay?

1252
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,728
I'll bring him at 1 0:30

1253
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:25,890
All right.

1254
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:27,255
Hello.

1255
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,215
Take me to grandma's.

1256
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,008
All right.
