1
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,262
CONVERSATION PIECE

2
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:31,762
Exquisite.

3
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:37,220
No other word for it.

4
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,179
Yes, without doubt.

5
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:50,470
- I'm sorry, let me move these...
- Really, it's not necessary.

6
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,095
Actually, I'd like to see the veranda.

7
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,220
Please, be my guest.
I'm afraid it's a bit untidy.

8
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,720
- I'll accompany you.
- Don't worry, I'll manage.

9
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:17,554
- Well, Professor?
- It really is exquisite, but...

10
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,929
- I can't.
- It's a reasonable price, Professor.

11
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:26,929
Last year at Sotheby's, you paid...

12
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,887
£3,000 Sterling, not a penny more.

13
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:33,929
Come now, Professor,
I made a bid of £3,500 myself.

14
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,471
- I can show you the receipt, if you like.
- No, please. I'll take your word.

15
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,304
I am quite surprised though.

16
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,929
In any case, my congratulations.

17
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:47,054
Still, you must admit,

18
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:50,304
prices have risen considerably
since last year.

19
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,637
Only yesterday,
I received a request for...

20
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:21,012
Anyone here?

21
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,137
Excuse me.

22
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,596
- May I ask a favor?
- Certainly, madam.

23
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:30,804
We'll leave it here
and you can think about it.

24
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,304
I've already thought about it.

25
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,846
The price is too high and...

26
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:39,804
it's not the right moment.
The taxes...

27
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,846
The apartment needs some work.

28
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,596
Bring it away.

29
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,179
I don't want the responsibility.

30
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:54,471
Don't worry yourself,

31
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:57,054
but would you do us a favor?

32
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:00,387
We have to look at some
paintings in a villa on Via Cassia,

33
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:03,471
and these days one can't just
leave it in the car.

34
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,512
Could we leave it here
and collect it this evening?

35
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:09,512
If you don't, I'll send it back myself.
I won't be buying it.

36
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:12,054
I'm still hoping
you'll change your mind.

37
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,346
We'll see ourselves out, Professor.
We know the way.

38
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,471
- I hope to see you soon.
- Thank you and good day.

39
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,304
Goodbye.

40
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:27,679
- It'd be a shame to let this one go.
- I won't be changing my mind.

41
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,054
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

42
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:49,929
So they finally left!

43
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,346
Yes, just this minute.

44
00:05:58,887 --> 00:05:59,971
Good.

45
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,512
Not to be rude, but...

46
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:08,971
are you the owner of the painting?

47
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,929
- What? Goodness no!
- No?

48
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:14,179
Are you sure it's worth all that money?

49
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,596
What a slimy pair!
Are they stolen art dealers?

50
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:19,012
Stolen art!

51
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:22,512
They're from the Blanchard Gallery in Paris.

52
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:25,012
But...
Weren't you with them?

53
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:27,346
No, I only met them in the elevator.

54
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,429
- So to what do I owe this pleasure?
- Your housekeeper told me

55
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:34,887
that the apartment above is empty.
I want to rent it.

56
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:36,721
- Rent it?
- Yes.

57
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:38,096
It's not for rent.

58
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:41,054
I've no space here,
I intend to use it as a library.

59
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:45,804
Now, Professor, I've had a good look
in the hallways and storage areas.

60
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:49,512
You've got plenty of space down here.
And what's more:

61
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:53,846
You wouldn't have any problem
if you got some modern bookcases.

62
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,262
Thank you for the advice,
but I'd rather...

63
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,012
My husband,
who has never read a book in his life,

64
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:03,637
and I'm sure of that,
fills every single room with books.

65
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:06,137
Complete foolishness, if you ask me.

66
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:08,846
He had some bookcases made,

67
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,346
and not those horrible metallic ones,

68
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:15,221
but made out of cherry-wood,
and they can hold a lot of books.

69
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:19,387
I don't want new bookcases,
and the apartment's not for rent.

70
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,596
At least let me see it.

71
00:07:23,304 --> 00:07:25,012
- See what?
- The apartment.

72
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,887
I might not like it,
and that'd be the end of it.

73
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:30,554
It'll only take a few minutes
and you needn't budge.

74
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:34,387
Your housemaid can show me.
Her name's Erminia, isn't it?

75
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:39,346
Erminia!

76
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:45,637
She told me she's been working
for you for twenty five years.

77
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:48,179
You're a lucky man.

78
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,012
Erminia.

79
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,221
Erminia!

80
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:02,054
- The Professor has very kindly...
- The keys to the upstairs apartment.

81
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:03,346
Straight away, Professor.

82
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:08,512
Not to be rude,
but you really are wasting your time.

83
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,137
Yes, I understand.
I'd just like to have a look.

84
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:13,679
I've been looking at
those windows up there for years.

85
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,887
I often park in Piazza Campitelli
when I come into town.

86
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:20,262
Parking has become nearly impossible.

87
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,971
It's another reasons why I'm looking
for a place in the center.

88
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:25,054
I live ten miles from Rome now.

89
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:28,179
- Well?
- Oh, darling.

90
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,221
- My daughter, Lietta.
- Hi.

91
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,721
For that matter, excuse me,
I'm Bianca Brumonti.

92
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:39,012
- Your coat, Professor.
- What have you been doing all this time?

93
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:40,929
Let's go up.

94
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,804
- Keep quiet. It's complicated.
- Okay.

95
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,096
- Nice up here.
- Remind me to ask Stefano

96
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,554
if he knows of the Blanchard Gallery.
I think they're thieves.

97
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:30,679
The Blanchard Gallery, it's as famous
as Christie's or Sotheby's.

98
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:33,179
But they'd probably rob you blind as well!

99
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:05,012
I won't open the windows,
they're barred up.

100
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,554
As I already said, I'm in a hurry.

101
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:09,262
Lietta, help me.

102
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:13,012
- Really, madam, I just said...
- Don't worry, I'll close them again.

103
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:17,221
It's just to get an idea.
Besides, it's so musty in here.

104
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:22,346
Perfect! You're a genius, Bianca.

105
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,471
It's stupendous!

106
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:33,429
Don't get excited.
He won't give it to us.

107
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:37,763
- What do you mean?
- He's keeping it for the mice and bats.

108
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,929
- He just wants more money.
- Think so?

109
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,304
Actually, that's not the case.

110
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,513
Mom, come and see.

111
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:08,888
Why can't we have it
if it's for rent?

112
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:14,471
From the very start
I told your mother it wasn't for rent.

113
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:17,763
Your mother insisted on seeing it.

114
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:20,346
He's not my son. Thank heavens!

115
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,346
They say he's his parents' son.

116
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:26,679
Bianca, get your ass down here fast!

117
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,513
Come on, you'll enjoy yourself.

118
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:34,888
Why is Konrad here?

119
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,013
Pardon me.

120
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,221
I can't see him.

121
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:45,013
I saw him.
Why did he stay down there?

122
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,179
I don't know.

123
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:52,554
He said he couldn't come with me
because he had to meet you.

124
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,054
Meet me?

125
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:58,971
I was there when he said
he'd come to collect you.

126
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,221
Oh, I must have misunderstood him.

127
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,554
Sorry about this.

128
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,679
Let me, you'll get all dirty.
I told you I'd close up.

129
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,679
A tow truck is bringing your car away.

130
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:35,221
- Couldn't you have stopped them?
- You never let me have the keys.

131
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:38,429
You ungrateful...

132
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,638
Can I see this luxury brothel?

133
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,346
Don't be an idiot.

134
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:51,013
Lietta, Stefano, see if you can
catch up with that tow truck.

135
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:39,638
Miss, is Mr. Blanchard there?

136
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:41,679
Yes, it's me.

137
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,888
Blanchard, is my doorman still there?

138
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,429
The one who brought the painting.

139
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,221
That's a shame,

140
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:57,554
because now one of your men
will have to come here.

141
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,513
I've changed my mind. I'll buy it.

142
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:05,388
Sold?

143
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:07,804
How? When?

144
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,513
Micheli, the lawyer.

145
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,388
- Come in, Micheli.
- Sorry for disturbing you.

146
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,596
Not at all.
Please, take a seat.

147
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,596
What are you doing there?

148
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,763
Here I am.

149
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:59,304
Yesterday evening I had a call from
Marquise Brumonti, whom you know.

150
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:03,179
I met her but I don't know her.
She's of no interest to me.

151
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:06,429
I hope that's not why you're here.

152
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:09,471
Careful, Professor,
don't say anything you'll regret.

153
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,471
Tell me you like it
or I'll have a stroke.

154
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,971
We bought it.
Where should I put it?

155
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,804
- Are they with you?
- We won him over!

156
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:38,429
As I was saying, yesterday evening
I had a call from Marquise Brumonti

157
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:40,513
- with a proposal of considerable...
- A proposal?

158
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,388
Yes, and as your lawyer it's my duty to
hear all serious proposals,

159
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:49,221
- as well as advise you on any...
- Micheli, don't beat around the bush.

160
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:52,304
It's our fault.
Listen, Professor, I know how you feel.

161
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:56,013
I know mom can be invasive,
but you simply can't say no.

162
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,429
Just for one year.

163
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:02,263
You'd let us have it for free
if you knew what it meant to us.

164
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:06,471
Perhaps Mrs. Brumonti didn't tell you,

165
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:09,346
she only wants the apartment
for one year.

166
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:14,054
Since you weren't planning to turn it
into a library before spring,

167
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,388
- I thought it would be an idea...
- No.

168
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,638
No. I'm sorry.

169
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:22,304
Rome is full of luxury houses
that would suit people like you.

170
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,929
But mom always invents excuses
not to see them.

171
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,054
From what the Marquise told me,

172
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:31,179
her daughter, the young lady here,
is engaged to...

173
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,346
Stefano and I are just dating.

174
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:36,554
Mom agreed that I can live here
with Konrad and Stefano.

175
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,138
Who is this Konrad?

176
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,221
He was with us yesterday, Professor.
The apartment is for him.

177
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:45,554
You're extraordinarily frank,
young lady.

178
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,013
And I'll answer you frankly.

179
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,971
I'm in no hurry to transfer
my library upstairs.

180
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,013
I'm an old man.
Neurotic, perhaps even hysterical.

181
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:01,721
I get disturbed by strange noises
and strange people.

182
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,513
I shy away from any sort of formality.

183
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:07,013
That's why I don't want
to rent the apartment.

184
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,638
You're neither old nor hysterical.
You're interesting, and you know it.

185
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:16,971
Maybe you're a little crazy,
like all interesting people.

186
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,638
But at least your craziness
is for things like this painting.

187
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,221
Don't tell me you no longer like it.

188
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:27,138
- He called Blanchard when we were there.
- Yes, I forgot.

189
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:32,013
Mom was right, that dealer's a thief.
He asked us for much less.

190
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:35,305
- You weren't meant to tell him!
- Why not?

191
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,096
The Professor should know he's a crook.

192
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:41,513
Those two tried to rip him off
because he's a collector.

193
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:45,513
We're even, Professor.
This is our three-month deposit.

194
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:49,305
Well, Professor,
shall we make these young people happy?

195
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:51,555
A one year contract.

196
00:17:57,971 --> 00:17:59,555
What's going on?

197
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:04,305
Oh God!

198
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,555
Please God, help me.

199
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,346
Help me, God. Help me!

200
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,055
What's going on?
Are you mad?

201
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:22,138
The ceiling's falling down.

202
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:26,221
Domenico, Domenico!
Is anyone down there?

203
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:41,013
- Good evening, Professor.
- Good evening, Erminia.

204
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:48,680
What happened here?

205
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,930
I nearly went out of my mind.

206
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:55,263
You should take a look
in the kitchen too.

207
00:18:55,346 --> 00:19:00,055
It's a good thing you dined out,
I couldn't even boil an egg in there.

208
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,430
It's soaked.

209
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:13,930
It's better since they
shut the water off.

210
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:16,763
I've never seen such madness.
It was like the war.

211
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:19,180
As though we were being bombed again.

212
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:22,180
I called Micheli, the lawyer,
but he wasn't in.

213
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:25,471
They wouldn't answer the door.
I wanted to call the police,

214
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:28,763
but Domenico said not to.
He told me to wait for you.

215
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:31,013
Would you stop chattering!

216
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,930
Bring me the keys to upstairs.

217
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:38,013
And a flashlight.

218
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:09,513
- It's in ruins!
- Call Micheli, the lawyer.

219
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,805
Who's there?
Mauro, is that you?

220
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,638
My house is full of rubble.

221
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,096
Water's running down the walls!

222
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:46,305
After what you've done it's a wonder
the building's still standing.

223
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:48,513
This madness is unforgivable!

224
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,138
So is your entering here,
silently, like a thief.

225
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:55,221
I could shoot you.

226
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,888
I am glad to still be alive
to hear your justification for this.

227
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:08,096
I do what I want in my house.

228
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,638
You said work could start,
even if the contract hasn't been signed.

229
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:17,305
The redecoration of one bathroom
is the only thing in the contract.

230
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:20,471
A contract which now I will not sign.

231
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:24,471
I do, however,
intend to claim for damages.

232
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,680
Excuse me, but that rental contract
is nothing but a piece of paper.

233
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:34,221
- The sales contract will be in my name.
- Sales contract?

234
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:37,638
It simply proves that
the painting was a sales deposit.

235
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,680
It's a one year rental contract,
and it's non-renewable!

236
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,263
- Can I make a phone call?
- A phone call?

237
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:52,805
So you can clear this matter up with
Mrs. Brumonti in my presence.

238
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:53,971
As you wish.

239
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:57,971
There's no way that Mrs. Brumonti
can support your claim.

240
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:08,263
- Did you call Micheli?
- The lawyer wasn't at home,

241
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:11,888
but I left a message for him
to call you immediately.

242
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:13,680
Thank you.

243
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:17,346
Could I have a whiskey?
Straight, please.

244
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:20,055
- I don't have any spirits.
- Not even...

245
00:22:31,596 --> 00:22:33,263
I do it all the time.

246
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,388
I call the house in London
instead of Paris.

247
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:41,346
You can add this call
to your claim for damages.

248
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:47,305
Do you really have no whiskey,
or don't you want to give me any?

249
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:51,763
- There's wine, if you want some.
- I'm glad you're not a teetotaler.

250
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,388
Some red wine, please.

251
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:57,971
So, it's you!

252
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:02,013
Well, you ugly bitch,
what's this latest trick?

253
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:06,221
No bullshit, or I'll get really mad.
What's this trick about?

254
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,721
The fucking apartment, my dear.

255
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:11,971
The apartment, you whore!

256
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:15,555
I'll clear this up.

257
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:19,180
Actually, here's someone else
to clear it up with.

258
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:24,096
Hello, how dare you ring me like this,
you ungrateful shit!

259
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,930
- I'll tear you...
- Madam, it's the Professor.

260
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:30,305
May I talk? Yes, but...

261
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:33,221
- Hello?
- Pass me Konrad!

262
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:35,971
- Please, madam...
- And quit your lies!

263
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:38,596
Look here, I don't tell lies!

264
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:43,346
- My lawyer will be in touch with you.
- Wait, Professor, I'm sorry.

265
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,471
Please, Professor,
it was a misunderstanding.

266
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:48,096
I'll come straight to Rome
and clear this up.

267
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:51,388
It's all that bastard's fault.
I can explain everything.

268
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,346
Shame I won't hear your explanation.

269
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:57,596
You thought I'd be good for another year,
but you were wrong.

270
00:23:58,055 --> 00:24:03,013
From this moment it's over,
Madam Marquise of Shit!

271
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:05,388
Bitch!

272
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:11,680
- Is that all right?
- Dreadful, thanks.

273
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,638
Goodnight, Erminia.

274
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:20,471
Well, now this is over too.

275
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:29,138
I don't like to interfere
in other people's business.

276
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,263
And besides, I haven't quite understood...

277
00:24:35,597 --> 00:24:37,305
You understand, Professor,

278
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:39,722
the richer they are
the worse they are.

279
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:42,347
Do you know what it's like
to be vulgar on the inside?

280
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:50,347
Goodness, what happened in here?

281
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,513
This is nothing.

282
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:01,180
You should see the rest of the apartment.

283
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:06,763
Sue them and you'll get
millions in damages.

284
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:09,597
Trust me, millions.

285
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:24,513
When did this record come out?

286
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:28,597
I was sent it from New York,
it has just been released.

287
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:33,972
It has Mozart's wonderful aria,
"Vorrei spiegarvi, oh Dio!"

288
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:36,805
I've wanted to hear it for some time.
May I?

289
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:54,222
I never get around to going to concerts.
However, records...

290
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,763
It's better like that.

291
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:28,263
I love Mozart.

292
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,972
I have to make a call, excuse me.

293
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:51,847
I was expecting a friend upstairs and...

294
00:26:57,597 --> 00:26:59,638
It's Konrad, who's there?

295
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:03,805
What about Mauro?
No, tell him not to come.

296
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,472
I might pass by.

297
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:07,472
Okay.

298
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:14,888
Just one minute.

299
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,888
Jane?

300
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:26,388
Who else would it be?
Still going to St. Moritz tomorrow?

301
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:31,638
Try to manage.
If you go, I'll go too.

302
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,347
I'm all by myself.

303
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,680
Arthur Devis.

304
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:40,222
No, nothing.

305
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:43,638
Listen, I'll call you later. Bye.

306
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:48,138
That's by Arthur Devis, isn't it?

307
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,805
It's definitely by an 18th century
English painter.

308
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,513
Some friends of mine
have an Arthur Devis.

309
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:01,138
A landscape with figures.
I've studied it well.

310
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:09,013
Yes.

311
00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:12,263
It might well be.

312
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:17,263
In the center of my friends' painting,
not at the side,

313
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,513
there's the same monument.

314
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:23,388
What's more, this was painted...

315
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:28,055
- around the middle of the 18th century.
- I'll bring you a photo of it.

316
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:32,097
- Are you interested in art?
- No, not really.

317
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:36,430
But I know that painting intimately.
It's beside the telephone.

318
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:48,263
Who's that, Marcello?

319
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:50,972
Who's there?

320
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:54,013
Who else?

321
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:56,055
If she's there.

322
00:28:57,888 --> 00:28:59,388
What are you doing later?

323
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:03,347
No, I've had enough scams for today.

324
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:06,180
I'll tell you tomorrow. Bye.

325
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:20,638
It's a strange house.

326
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:24,972
I don't like it,
but it has enchanted me.

327
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,430
Don't get up. I know the way.

328
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,472
It's a shame things ended like this.

329
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:40,930
I would have enjoyed chatting
with you now and again.

330
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:45,888
- Goodnight, Professor.
- Goodnight.

331
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:49,222
You should unplug the telephone
if you want some peace.

332
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,680
Sooner or later,
Mrs. Brumonti will call.

333
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:55,888
She's a real ball-breaker.

334
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,847
I don't want to talk to your lawyer.
These things don't interest me.

335
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:55,138
You're right, so what?

336
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:58,722
I didn't take
the overnight flight from Paris,

337
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:02,597
full with Arabs, to tell you
they were wrong to knock down a wall.

338
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:05,180
You call this knocking down a wall?

339
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,263
My dear, Professor,
your behavior is disgraceful.

340
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:15,472
I had my reasons for not telling him
the truth about the contract.

341
00:31:15,722 --> 00:31:17,013
You had no right to interfere!

342
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:22,138
But since you did,
it must have been for a reason.

343
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,722
Perhaps you are protecting
Mr. Huebel's interests.

344
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:30,097
What do you mean?
I'm not protecting anyone's interests.

345
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,638
And certainly not Mr. Huebel's,
whom I don't even know!

346
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:36,514
You don't know him?
Well, I'll tell you.

347
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:43,514
He's my gigolo, my kept lover.

348
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:48,222
Want to know how much
I spend on him a month?

349
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:52,930
How awful to be reduced to this.

350
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:01,722
Mom!

351
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:06,347
- When did you arrive?
- Poor brainless idiot!

352
00:32:07,347 --> 00:32:10,222
Now you can put
everything back as it was.

353
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,014
But I...

354
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,430
- only did what you asked.
- Everything as it was before.

355
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,347
I want to talk to you.

356
00:32:30,055 --> 00:32:32,222
- Where's Konrad?
- I haven't seen him.

357
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:35,722
We called into number 74 yesterday,
but it was quite late.

358
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:41,139
Mauro said Konrad was going to St. Moritz
for a few days, while you were in Paris.

359
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:44,597
- Didn't you tell him you were coming?
- No.

360
00:32:45,555 --> 00:32:49,055
I decided in a hurry,
I jumped on the first plane.

361
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,389
- Why?
- Don't you know?

362
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,889
That idiot told him
I hadn't bought the apartment,

363
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,014
so now I'll have to buy it.

364
00:32:57,097 --> 00:33:00,472
The Professor will never sell it,
isn't that right, Professor?

365
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:03,472
What advice can I give you?

366
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:07,055
Your mother's hysterics
have nothing to do with me.

367
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:10,972
I've no interest in people
who can't control their own actions.

368
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,680
Any opinion of mine would be...

369
00:33:14,972 --> 00:33:18,180
as futile as the drama
you're trying to involve me in.

370
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:20,680
I'm simply not interested!

371
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:27,847
Lf, as you say...

372
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:32,764
the lawyers have
already signed the contract,

373
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:37,639
and you put everything back as it was,
at your expense,

374
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:42,014
then you can keep the apartment.

375
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:45,930
But if you don't want it
I will reimburse you for the painting,

376
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:48,139
immediately.

377
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:51,305
You decide,
and then leave me in peace.

378
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:54,764
Okay, we made a mistake,
but you seemed so understanding...

379
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,514
Don't make another mistake.

380
00:33:56,764 --> 00:34:00,222
I promise we won't mention
our family problems again.

381
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,347
Now you can tell Stefano
what you want done upstairs,

382
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,972
but don't forget about
the second bathroom,

383
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:10,180
and that it should be twice the size
of the one that's...

384
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,389
Why are you laughing, Professor?

385
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:22,805
It's as if we spoke
two different languages.

386
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:26,555
- We can never understand one another.
- And that's funny?

387
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:31,680
Tragically so.
I must be completely out of touch.

388
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:36,430
I want to show you
the new plans for the apartment.

389
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,514
The walls marked in yellow
are those we want to knock down.

390
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:46,514
Let's see, so...

391
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:54,514
- Can I make a call?
- Yes, over there.

392
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:57,264
This here...

393
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,805
This here is all right.

394
00:35:00,805 --> 00:35:02,055
This too.

395
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:05,722
No, you can't do this.

396
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:10,264
Doesn't it work?

397
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:15,139
- It's unplugged.
- What?

398
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:18,389
- The telephone.
- It's been like that since yesterday.

399
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,555
No wonder you're out of touch.

400
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,430
- I'm not complaining.
- But it surprises you.

401
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:32,597
Jane, how are you?

402
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,430
I thought you were going to St. Moritz.

403
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,222
Who wanted to go with you?

404
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,139
Jane, are you kidding me!
Everyone knows Konrad's a whore.

405
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,389
Stefano, he didn't go.

406
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:54,430
I really hate him,
as soon as I see him...

407
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:58,055
Darling,
whose bed did you fall out of?

408
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,430
- Where were you yesterday evening?
- I was here.

409
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:03,889
- Listening to music.
- Here?

410
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:06,264
Why didn't you tell me?

411
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,847
Mom's back, did you know?

412
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,055
- You fought, didn't you?
- No, I've left her.

413
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,847
She's hysterical.
She took a night flight.

414
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:17,014
I was at my friends' place
and got a photograph.

415
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:19,139
Take a look.

416
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:35,264
Interesting.
We'll continue this later.

417
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,555
Very interesting.

418
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:46,180
It's hard to see well in a photo.
It's not just the landscape.

419
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,472
It's also the technique.

420
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:50,805
The trees are different...
Sorry!

421
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:53,305
From other painters of that period.

422
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:59,305
I'm impressed.
Did you study art history?

423
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:02,014
I studied it at university for a while.

424
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,680
Why did you quit?

425
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,722
Those were difficult years.

426
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,514
It was '68.

427
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:13,305
I became part of the student movement
and got into trouble.

428
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:15,222
So I came here.

429
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:18,764
And got mixed up with these people.

430
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:22,305
There's no doubt about it.
Congratulations.

431
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,514
Why didn't I think of it?

432
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:30,680
Of all my paintings that one has the
most complete documentation. Come.

433
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,764
Konrad is here.
He said you didn't fight.

434
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:39,555
- He didn't tell me anything.
- Why would he tell you?

435
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:41,930
Mom, we'll talk later.

436
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,805
I told mom you're not offended,
so now she's offended.

437
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:52,389
- Call her, what'll it cost you?
- I've finished with her!

438
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,055
- But you said you didn't fight.
- I'm still finished with her!

439
00:37:56,555 --> 00:38:00,430
- So she'll buy you the apartment.
- Tempting, but I'm not interested.

440
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:01,847
Sure!

441
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:04,930
Listen, be nice and...

442
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:07,680
Do something,
I don't want to see her like this.

443
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:11,014
- Professor?
- What?

444
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:14,597
- Professor, you talk to him...
- No, thank you.

445
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:20,972
I need some air. Clear air.

446
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:25,264
You won't find it with Jane.
Lietta told me that...

447
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,847
Mind your own business!
Where are you going?

448
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,097
To see Bobby in Fiumicino.

449
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:34,931
Great, I'm coming too.
Maybe we can go sailing.

450
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:39,847
He's a friend who ordered a yacht.
It was meant to be delivered in June,

451
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:44,639
instead, he only got it now.
Konrad, you're a genius.

452
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:48,764
- Let's get going. So you're staying here?
- To do what?

453
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:52,431
Take care of the house.
Besides, if mom needs someone?

454
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:55,222
Listen, can't you call her?

455
00:38:55,306 --> 00:38:58,431
And it's better if the Professor
talks to the engineer.

456
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:02,514
- That way there'll be no more mistakes.
- If you're coming, get a move on.

457
00:39:03,014 --> 00:39:05,806
Keep the photo, and just ask if
you want to see the painting.

458
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:08,056
- Let's go, Lietta.
- First, a quick call.

459
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:11,722
No, I'll call from the bar downstairs.
I'm starving.

460
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:15,347
- I'm not waiting, I'm already late.
- But I've cramps.

461
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:18,347
Professor, could I have a bit of bread?

462
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,847
Konrad, I'll be there in a second.

463
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:25,847
- Erminia?
- Get a move on, Lietta!

464
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:27,597
Come this way.

465
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:50,556
- What can I offer you?
- Stefano, Konrad, come and see!

466
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:56,181
- The Professor has hidden treasure.
- Stefano, bring your car too.

467
00:39:56,972 --> 00:40:00,097
- I might stay in Fiumicino.
- Are you really leaving Bianca?

468
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,514
Listen, I want to be free.
I have things planned.

469
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,431
In Fiumicino?

470
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:07,264
Asshole!

471
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:13,472
- Want a drop, Stefano?
- Yes, please.

472
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:15,514
- Some glasses, please?
- At once.

473
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:19,889
This salami is quite spicy.
I'm certain you'll like it.

474
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:23,097
I'm sure I will, thanks.
Can I have some cheese too?

475
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,972
Need some help?

476
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:30,222
- Erminia, get the door, please.
- I'll go. You stay here.

477
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:34,264
Professor, do me a favor.
Send them away!

478
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,431
- Can I have a taste?
- No, it's not ready yet.

479
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:57,097
A little patience, Stefano.
Erminia isn't used to all this confusion.

480
00:40:57,472 --> 00:41:01,764
Neither is he, he doesn't even
like hearing my footsteps.

481
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:27,597
You're a son of a bitch.

482
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:32,139
He didn't want to rent it,
but I persuaded him to.

483
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:36,514
He didn't want it,
but we're doing work on it.

484
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:39,306
I could have persuaded him to sell it.

485
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,681
But you thought you'd be clever
and you ruined everything!

486
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:47,639
You're suspicious, pathetic and mean!

487
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:52,347
I'm ashamed of everything I've done for you!

488
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:54,722
You make me ashamed of myself.

489
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,347
I'll never forgive you, never!

490
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:03,139
- Where are you going? Come back!
- Let go of me!

491
00:42:07,014 --> 00:42:09,014
I don't care about your apartments,

492
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:12,181
but don't make fun of me by
pretending to give me presents.

493
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,764
You're hurting me.
Let me go, you're crazy!

494
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:17,972
Let me go!

495
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:20,306
- Shout, what are you waiting for?
- Yes!

496
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:39,056
Professor, I've decided that
you're coming to Fiumicino too.

497
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,931
We'll come back this evening
and have dinner together.

498
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:46,639
We'll eat Erminia's stew
and decide about the work upstairs.

499
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,181
- Mom!
- That sounds great to me.

500
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:53,889
- I'm sure Erminia is a wonderful cook.
- She's fantastic!

501
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:56,556
Stew and what else?

502
00:42:57,056 --> 00:42:59,222
- Stew and artichokes.
- Perfect.

503
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:03,931
- So, shall we go?
- Go where, darling?

504
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:08,972
To see Bobby's yacht in Fiumicino.
The Professor's coming too.

505
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:11,889
With this breeze today
the sea will be lovely.

506
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:14,847
The sea is always wonderful.
Its colors.

507
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:18,347
Its voices, the sounds it makes.

508
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,931
I've never understood
how the Greek artists

509
00:43:24,014 --> 00:43:26,681
were able to concentrate
and create such marvelous forms

510
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,139
with such a spectacular,
fascinating spectacle before their eyes.

511
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:37,056
- Just the thought of it bewitches me.
- So you're coming with us?

512
00:43:38,764 --> 00:43:40,639
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

513
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:43,472
Don't insist.
The Professor doesn't want distractions.

514
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:46,264
He likes to be alone.
You know that.

515
00:43:47,556 --> 00:43:50,389
People say it's better to be alone,
but it's not true.

516
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:53,889
He does live alone though.

517
00:43:55,222 --> 00:43:56,889
The truth, Professor:

518
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:00,972
What's the secret in your life?
I think you...

519
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,347
were once a really handsome man.

520
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:08,722
You still are.
I find you very interesting.

521
00:44:10,222 --> 00:44:11,597
How come...

522
00:44:12,764 --> 00:44:15,014
Why do you live your life like this?

523
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,597
Living amongst other men...

524
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:25,056
forces one to think about men,
instead of their works of art.

525
00:44:26,514 --> 00:44:29,014
You become involved with them,
you suffer because of them.

526
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:32,889
Somebody once wrote:

527
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:35,681
"Crows fly in flocks,

528
00:44:36,722 --> 00:44:38,431
the eagle soars alone."

529
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,889
- Well, you wanted to know.
- Let's get going, crows!

530
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:50,306
See you for dinner
this evening, Professor,

531
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,514
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

532
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,264
But in the Bible it's written:

533
00:44:56,014 --> 00:45:00,139
"Woe to him who is alone when he falleth,
for he hath not another to help him up."

534
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:03,264
Konrad, the Bible!

535
00:45:08,014 --> 00:45:09,972
- Thank you, Professor.
- See you this evening.

536
00:45:18,556 --> 00:45:19,556
Erminia?

537
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:23,472
- Tidy this up.
- Yes, at once.

538
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:32,973
They haven't arrived yet.
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

539
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:37,389
They would have rung
if they thought they'd be late.

540
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:39,806
They're so refined and well-educated.

541
00:45:40,306 --> 00:45:42,639
They're not as refined as you think.

542
00:45:43,306 --> 00:45:46,223
They're empty, stupid.
More than anything else, useless.

543
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:48,556
I'm going to eat.

544
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:51,264
I'm not waiting another minute.

545
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:53,931
As you wish, Professor.

546
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,306
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

547
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:10,931
- These are the samples.
- Yes, the samples.

548
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:16,014
I haven't heard from them
in over twenty days.

549
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:19,681
- We're wasting time with all these...
- It's your decision.

550
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:22,764
The house is yours.
You can do whatever you want.

551
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:26,681
I could decide about the walls,
but these...

552
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:30,431
- I need a decision, Professor.
- Immediately?

553
00:46:30,598 --> 00:46:33,098
- Yes.
- All right then.

554
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:37,223
Let me take a look.

555
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:39,389
For the kitchen...

556
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:44,223
- I'd say this would go well.
- Yes, that's a nice color.

557
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:46,306
Yes, this color for the walls.

558
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:51,639
Professor?

559
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:55,431
Professor? Open up,
we have something for you.

560
00:46:55,806 --> 00:46:58,348
We won't even come in.
Just open the door.

561
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:02,681
Just for a second. It's a surprise.
We can't tell you what it is.

562
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:06,681
Professor, be nice and open up.

563
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:11,514
- It's a surprise.
- Never mind them, Professor.

564
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:14,348
See you in the morning.
Goodnight.

565
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:17,306
I'll open up at once.

566
00:47:33,306 --> 00:47:36,389
Hi, Professor,
we brought you a present.

567
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:40,098
- It's wonderful upstairs.
- You worked a miracle, Professor.

568
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:43,848
We'll look better tomorrow.
Pity there aren't two more beds.

569
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,181
Professor?

570
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:48,348
- Do you still have my blanket?
- Blanket?

571
00:47:49,973 --> 00:47:52,056
- Yes, it's where you left it.
- I'll get it.

572
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:57,056
This is Simone.

573
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:03,848
It's all he can say,
and he never quits.

574
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,514
That's why we got him.

575
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:12,806
I've never had a pet in the house.

576
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,681
Animals should live freely
in their natural environment.

577
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,098
If it annoys you, send it up to me,

578
00:48:20,723 --> 00:48:23,556
I'll deal with him.
I've a score to settle.

579
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:28,264
It was in Konrad's cabin on the yacht,
and it drove him mad.

580
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:33,223
- You really should have come with us.
- You must be kidding, Lietta.

581
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:35,723
You were actually very lucky.

582
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:40,556
You'll have to keep it tonight.
In the morning...

583
00:48:40,723 --> 00:48:43,181
Listen, young man,
I want a word with you.

584
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:46,556
I don't want a repeat
of the last time.

585
00:48:47,014 --> 00:48:51,556
You were meant to discuss the plans
with me over a month ago.

586
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:53,598
Hey, come and see!

587
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:59,056
- I found the skeletons. He's a pirate.
- What are you talking about?

588
00:49:03,348 --> 00:49:06,431
- Very nice.
- Very nice? It's ingenious!

589
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:12,681
- Was it here, or did you have it made?
- It was already here.

590
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:16,389
It helped a lot of people during the war.

591
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:20,931
There's nothing interesting to see.
It's just a room.

592
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:22,681
Let's go, Stefano.

593
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:27,306
My mother was Italian,
she was living here when war broke out.

594
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:32,598
She had it made
to hide political refugees,

595
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:36,264
Partisans, Jews.

596
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:40,139
I know very little about her
when she lived here.

597
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,181
She died before the war ended.

598
00:49:43,973 --> 00:49:46,556
I was in America
and came here with the Army.

599
00:49:46,848 --> 00:49:48,639
I've lived here since then.

600
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:52,264
We're going, Professor.
We're very tired.

601
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:54,306
Are you coming, Konrad?

602
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:57,931
I'll get my blanket.

603
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:10,556
I'm disappointed.
I was sure you'd like Simone.

604
00:50:10,723 --> 00:50:13,598
Perhaps I will in time.

605
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:22,389
Okay, I'm ready.

606
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,098
Now I can sleep over your head again.

607
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:29,556
- But nobody must know! Understand?
- No.

608
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:32,931
- Bye. Goodnight, Professor.
- Goodnight.

609
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:36,514
Bianca thinks he left for Vienna.

610
00:50:37,473 --> 00:50:41,014
A holiday after sharing a cabin
with her for a month.

611
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:42,889
Shut up, Stefano!

612
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,473
- Goodnight, Professor.
- Goodnight, Lietta.

613
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:47,598
Stefano.

614
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:52,056
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Professor.

615
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,098
Who's there? Stop!

616
00:52:46,223 --> 00:52:47,348
Good God!

617
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:50,015
What happened?
I'll call the police.

618
00:52:50,098 --> 00:52:53,390
No, don't call anyone.
Mind your own business.

619
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,598
- Help me get out of here.
- All right.

620
00:52:57,973 --> 00:52:59,890
I'll bring you downstairs.

621
00:54:07,117 --> 00:54:09,950
No, don't move.
Try to stay calm.

622
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,075
- Where am I?
- In my house.

623
00:54:13,909 --> 00:54:16,534
You fainted twice. I brought you down.

624
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:20,659
You're better now. I'll be right back.

625
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:46,117
I'll kill the bastards!

626
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:49,909
You'd better lie down.

627
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:21,784
Do you know who attacked you?

628
00:55:23,075 --> 00:55:24,075
I...

629
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:25,992
No. Why?

630
00:55:27,617 --> 00:55:29,034
Because it seemed...

631
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,159
I didn't even see them.
They surprised me.

632
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:34,825
I saw one of them.
I'd recognize him again.

633
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,200
- You asked me...
- What?

634
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:41,909
You insisted I didn't call the police.
I thought you knew who they were.

635
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,117
That it was part of a dispute.

636
00:55:45,034 --> 00:55:47,659
- I wanted to be sure before calling.
- Wait, don't!

637
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:55,742
It's my duty to help you.
To call the police.

638
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:57,909
You don't have any duty.

639
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,409
And I don't want anything
to do with the police.

640
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:08,909
Besides they'll never find those bastards.
They won't even look for them.

641
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:12,742
They've enough death and madness
to deal with every day.

642
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:17,867
Murders, robberies, rapes,
strikes, demonstrations.

643
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,909
What do they care about my split lip?

644
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,284
Four lines of a report, and that's it.

645
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:28,075
A load of shit.

646
00:56:29,117 --> 00:56:31,575
No, the police don't give a damn.

647
00:56:32,992 --> 00:56:37,325
But there'd be some asshole reporter
who would recognize my name.

648
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:40,825
"Young man involved in love affair."

649
00:56:41,284 --> 00:56:43,992
Yes, that's what they'd write.

650
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,867
"With Bianca Brumonti,
wife of well-known Fascist."

651
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:53,409
Understand how it would finish up?

652
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,617
It's better like this.

653
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,950
- And the blood?
- The blood?

654
00:57:05,034 --> 00:57:08,825
- There must be blood upstairs.
- Don't worry, we'll clean it tomorrow.

655
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:13,242
I already told you,
nobody must know anything!

656
00:57:13,992 --> 00:57:16,867
- Let me go.
- I'll sort it out, you stay here.

657
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,367
I'll clean it. You stay here.

658
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:22,200
Don't move.

659
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:26,075
- Can I at least call a doctor?
- Christ!

660
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:28,867
We must. What if you get worse?

661
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:30,909
No, nobody must know.

662
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,492
All right.

663
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:38,950
- Professor?
- Yes.

664
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:44,784
Can I stay here tonight?
I'm afraid to go back upstairs.

665
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:50,075
- Of course, you can stay here.
- Thank you.

666
00:57:51,284 --> 00:57:52,784
I'll be back soon.

667
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,534
It's so humiliating to get beaten up.

668
00:57:57,992 --> 00:58:00,825
At least you have your pride
if they kill you.

669
00:58:03,492 --> 00:58:06,492
Like this, people will just laugh.

670
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:09,367
"Have you heard?

671
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:12,075
They finally taught
that asshole a lesson."

672
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,492
- Oh God!
- Do you want a sedative?

673
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:21,700
No. I never take them.

674
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:06,575
Professor, open up!

675
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:13,409
Why did you lock me in?

676
00:59:14,242 --> 00:59:18,242
No. It's because Erminia rises early
to do the cleaning.

677
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:22,242
Sorry. My nerves are shot.

678
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:27,659
Leave it open. I feel trapped.

679
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:30,117
Don't close it.

680
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:40,200
Apart from everything else,
you must think I'm a coward too.

681
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:43,575
Have you ever been afraid?

682
00:59:46,492 --> 00:59:47,659
Yes.

683
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:55,367
Yes, I've been afraid.
I was afraid during the war.

684
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,742
But there are worse fears to have.

685
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:01,201
For example, when I quit working.

686
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:05,409
The fear of not knowing
how to start a new life.

687
01:00:06,242 --> 01:00:08,451
- What was your job?
- I was a scientist.

688
01:00:09,826 --> 01:00:13,701
Strange, I thought you were
a science Professor when we first met.

689
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:15,742
- Once.
- Once?

690
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:20,242
The price of progress is destruction.

691
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:26,159
I began to realize that
modern science can't be neutral.

692
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:28,659
In its attempt to be useful

693
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:33,242
science has turned technology's
power to liberate into a kind of slavery.

694
01:00:34,076 --> 01:00:35,909
And that the use of science...

695
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,992
in today's social reality...

696
01:01:39,617 --> 01:01:41,659
So you're already here, filthy beast.

697
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:44,409
- So they're with the Professor?
- No.

698
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,826
Must have come yesterday evening.

699
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:49,951
Shut up. Annoying, isn't it?

700
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:53,076
- May I use the phone?
- I'll bring it out.

701
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:55,659
I'm sorry, we should have one soon.

702
01:02:06,784 --> 01:02:10,284
Excuse me, Professor?
I came to get the telephone.

703
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:13,409
The lady from upstairs is waiting for it.

704
01:02:13,909 --> 01:02:16,242
Did you sleep here all night, Professor?

705
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:18,617
No, I...

706
01:02:21,284 --> 01:02:24,784
I woke up early and came in
to do some work,

707
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,409
- and I fell asleep.
- I'll get your breakfast ready.

708
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:30,784
Yes. But bring it in here, please.

709
01:03:15,742 --> 01:03:18,492
- The telephone is in the drawing room.
- Thank you.

710
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,201
In my opinion, it's starving.

711
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:23,701
Erminia, may I have a coffee?

712
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:36,701
Good morning, Erminia.
I'm looking for Mrs. Brumonti.

713
01:03:36,784 --> 01:03:39,242
I have a message for her
from Mr. Stefano.

714
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:44,784
Luigi, is that you?
I'm in the drawing room.

715
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:50,326
Good morning, madam.
Mr. Stefano is waiting downstairs.

716
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,492
Tell him I'll be right down.

717
01:03:52,576 --> 01:03:55,451
Meanwhile he should
buy some food for the blackbird.

718
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:58,492
That's a funny looking blackbird.

719
01:04:08,284 --> 01:04:10,117
Here they are. They've arrived!

720
01:04:10,617 --> 01:04:13,242
Daniele, come quickly!

721
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:15,117
Hurry up!

722
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:21,867
- Sir, give me your bag.
- Luisa, look at you!

723
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,784
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

724
01:04:24,951 --> 01:04:28,742
- Daniele, how are you?
- Fine, thank you, madam.

725
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:38,409
- Give me the bag, miss.
- Thank you.

726
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:40,117
Sorry, "madam".

727
01:04:57,701 --> 01:05:01,284
Finally, our little American
boy has arrived.

728
01:05:01,617 --> 01:05:03,159
He looks like you.

729
01:05:03,992 --> 01:05:06,451
- Help us with these bags.
- At once.

730
01:05:08,326 --> 01:05:09,576
Say something.

731
01:05:10,076 --> 01:05:11,992
Come on, say hello to Luisa

732
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:16,242
Don't you like my house.

733
01:05:17,617 --> 01:05:19,409
Smile for your mother.

734
01:05:21,909 --> 01:05:23,742
He's shy, madam.

735
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,034
Leave it on the table.

736
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:47,617
Mrs. Brumonti requested a coffee.
May I give her one?

737
01:05:47,992 --> 01:05:49,076
Certainly.

738
01:07:25,826 --> 01:07:28,659
I slept 16 hours straight.
Why didn't you wake me?

739
01:07:28,743 --> 01:07:30,159
You needed sleep.

740
01:07:31,368 --> 01:07:34,659
Besides, if you had left
someone would have seen you.

741
01:07:34,743 --> 01:07:37,659
When I awoke this morning
Mrs. Brumonti was here.

742
01:07:38,076 --> 01:07:40,076
- Did she ask about me?
- No.

743
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,076
She came to use the phone.

744
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:45,951
Then she brought Erminia upstairs
to help her do something.

745
01:07:46,451 --> 01:07:47,909
They were moving things all day.

746
01:07:49,576 --> 01:07:51,909
- Does Erminia know I'm here?
- No.

747
01:07:57,118 --> 01:07:58,784
She didn't realize anything.

748
01:08:29,743 --> 01:08:35,243
The bird's on the balcony, Professor.
I covered the cage with a sheet.

749
01:08:35,326 --> 01:08:38,576
Leave it in the kitchen.
It should be kept warm.

750
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:41,409
Why not give it to the doorman?
He likes it.

751
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:44,534
- I will return it to them.
- As you wish.

752
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:46,909
- Is there anything else?
- No, thank you.

753
01:08:47,326 --> 01:08:49,451
- Goodnight, Erminia.
- Goodnight, Professor.

754
01:09:07,493 --> 01:09:09,368
I have to tell you something, Professor.

755
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:12,034
I lied last night.

756
01:09:13,743 --> 01:09:15,743
I know who attacked me, and why.

757
01:09:16,368 --> 01:09:19,201
- I never doubted that.
- Ask me whatever you like.

758
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:22,451
I don't want to ask anything.
I'm not curious.

759
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,951
It'll hardly be noticeable.

760
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:28,368
Noticeable enough.

761
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:32,368
You can't wait
for me to go, can you?

762
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:36,368
In a way.

763
01:09:37,243 --> 01:09:38,284
Okay.

764
01:09:40,368 --> 01:09:41,993
Thank you for helping me.

765
01:09:42,909 --> 01:09:45,826
I understand that you don't
want to get involved.

766
01:09:46,243 --> 01:09:47,909
That has nothing to do with it.

767
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:50,118
I'm used to living alone, so...

768
01:09:50,576 --> 01:09:54,368
another person in the house disturbs me,
prevents me from working.

769
01:09:54,826 --> 01:09:57,493
I'll make a few calls
and might be able to leave tonight.

770
01:09:58,534 --> 01:09:59,784
As you wish.

771
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:06,284
What I told you about myself,
my studies.

772
01:10:06,993 --> 01:10:08,868
Well, that was the truth.

773
01:10:10,659 --> 01:10:15,368
And now to get myself out of one mess,
I've landed myself in a worse one.

774
01:10:16,618 --> 01:10:18,368
I wasn't always like this.

775
01:10:19,534 --> 01:10:20,909
Once...

776
01:10:22,409 --> 01:10:23,409
Shit!

777
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:27,659
I don't give a damn about
all the things I once believed in.

778
01:10:30,576 --> 01:10:32,201
I didn't sleep all day.

779
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:35,326
I kept waking up.

780
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:37,159
I heard footsteps.

781
01:10:38,284 --> 01:10:39,659
I imagined...

782
01:10:40,743 --> 01:10:43,159
I thought about telling you about me.

783
01:10:44,659 --> 01:10:47,868
- And to ask you for advice.
- I don't have any advice for you.

784
01:10:48,784 --> 01:10:52,243
A man of your age and intelligence
should know what to do.

785
01:10:52,993 --> 01:10:54,951
A clean break.

786
01:10:56,909 --> 01:11:00,118
Sure! It's that simple.

787
01:11:00,868 --> 01:11:03,493
If Erminia's in bed
I'll get you something to eat.

788
01:11:03,576 --> 01:11:06,784
Then I'm going to bed myself.
Make all the calls you want to.

789
01:11:06,951 --> 01:11:11,243
Close that door when you leave.
I'll tidy up tomorrow.

790
01:12:20,451 --> 01:12:22,076
I want to tell you everything.

791
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:25,326
Tell me if it's my fault.

792
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:28,743
Believe me, only you can help me.

793
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:50,535
Hey, we woke him up.

794
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:53,868
"If you see a fair form,

795
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,201
"chase it,
and if possible embrace it!

796
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:03,160
"Be it a girl or a boy, don't be bashful,
be brash, be fresh.

797
01:15:03,618 --> 01:15:08,868
"Life is short! So enjoy whatever contact
your flesh might at the moment crave,

798
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:11,243
"There is no sex life in the grave."

799
01:15:11,493 --> 01:15:13,826
- What are you saying?
- You taught it to me.

800
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:15,451
Don't you remember?

801
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:19,076
They say it's Auden's last poem.
You know everything,

802
01:15:19,451 --> 01:15:21,285
have you ever heard of it?

803
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,868
We brought your patient
some suitcases.

804
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:28,076
He's finally leaving for Munich.

805
01:15:29,368 --> 01:15:32,951
- Clean breaks are never possible.
- What does that mean?

806
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:35,535
The Professor knows.

807
01:15:36,451 --> 01:15:39,035
Not good enough,
I want to know too.

808
01:15:40,493 --> 01:15:43,868
The Professor thinks
I should change my life.

809
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:46,743
The Professor expects too much.

810
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,076
- And what would you know?
- What would I know?

811
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,201
Stefano is envious,
the only bad Cardinal Sin.

812
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:56,243
One day you can tell me
why I'd be jealous of Konrad.

813
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:58,576
Yes, I'll tell you one day.

814
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,243
Poor Professor, still half-asleep.

815
01:16:01,826 --> 01:16:03,285
We'll soon go.

816
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,160
See, this is just a game.

817
01:16:06,993 --> 01:16:08,993
There's no harm in it, honestly.

818
01:16:10,493 --> 01:16:12,243
You were once young.

819
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:14,826
- Weren't you like us?
- No.

820
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:17,368
Absolutely not.

821
01:16:17,868 --> 01:16:21,993
Shame, you missed out!
But you must have had fun.

822
01:16:22,326 --> 01:16:24,618
You were rich and handsome,
what did you do?

823
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:27,035
- What did I do?
- Yes.

824
01:16:27,826 --> 01:16:30,201
I studied and travelled.

825
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:33,618
I fought in a war and I got married.

826
01:16:36,535 --> 01:16:38,035
But it didn't work out.

827
01:16:39,743 --> 01:16:43,451
And when I finally looked around,
I found myself in the middle

828
01:16:43,993 --> 01:16:46,451
of people I no longer understood.

829
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:49,743
Come on, Professor,
We're not that different.

830
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,951
No, he's right.

831
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:56,326
Don't forget, society is what it is.

832
01:16:56,868 --> 01:17:00,201
- It's the fault of...
- No, Konrad. Don't start!

833
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:04,201
I want to know all about
the Professor's private life.

834
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:06,743
- His past, present...
- Present.

835
01:17:07,493 --> 01:17:11,243
- Presently I'm old.
- Professor, don't talk like that.

836
01:17:12,285 --> 01:17:15,326
You have to believe that
you're still an attractive man.

837
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,701
I think you are.

838
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:20,951
- And if I wanted to kiss you?
- I wouldn't envy you.

839
01:17:21,451 --> 01:17:25,035
If I were in your place,
I'd see before me...

840
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:27,326
the face of a man who...

841
01:17:27,785 --> 01:17:29,785
hasn't been young for a long time.

842
01:17:31,993 --> 01:17:34,160
- Quit it, you idiot.
- I'm serious.

843
01:17:34,826 --> 01:17:37,993
I like him.
If he asked me, I'd marry him.

844
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:40,285
I won't ask.

845
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,451
I see myself as a
tragic character from a play.

846
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:47,826
The old man who is deceived
and made fun of.

847
01:17:48,326 --> 01:17:51,243
King Lear is the only
true love story for me.

848
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:54,243
A father and his daughters.

849
01:17:54,535 --> 01:17:56,826
You managed to avoid that problem.

850
01:17:57,451 --> 01:17:59,410
No children, no tragedy.

851
01:17:59,826 --> 01:18:02,243
The Professor would be
an extraordinary father.

852
01:18:02,743 --> 01:18:04,160
Know what I'll do?

853
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:08,326
If one of these idiots gets me pregnant,

854
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:11,285
I won't get rid of it,
I'll keep it and give it to you.

855
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:15,243
I don't have much time left,
I'd need an older child,

856
01:18:16,618 --> 01:18:19,701
- to tell them the few things I know.
- Konrad!

857
01:18:20,326 --> 01:18:24,076
Why not adopt Konrad?
He's intelligent and beautiful.

858
01:18:24,451 --> 01:18:25,826
Distinguished looking.

859
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,368
And if he stops getting
into trouble over money...

860
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:32,576
Konrad, let him adopt you.

861
01:18:33,451 --> 01:18:36,576
Mind you, Professor,
he doesn't come cheap.

862
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:40,535
Tonight alone would have cost you
five million lire.

863
01:18:41,535 --> 01:18:44,826
Poor Konrad, a gambling debt
from some backroom club.

864
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:47,326
That's why they smashed his face up.

865
01:18:48,701 --> 01:18:53,826
We'll pay the debt off with money
from the building work upstairs.

866
01:18:54,993 --> 01:18:57,993
Whether Bianca knows or not,
she's always the one who pays.

867
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,368
A gambling debt.

868
01:19:03,576 --> 01:19:06,868
That wouldn't be so bad,
but it's not just that.

869
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,326
You see...

870
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:12,993
I'd better go if I want to be
in Munich tomorrow evening.

871
01:19:13,576 --> 01:19:15,201
Your jacket's there, Stefano.

872
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:18,785
- We'll walk you to the car, Konrad.
- Thanks.

873
01:19:20,368 --> 01:19:23,410
- Be quick though.
- Did he agree to adopt you?

874
01:19:25,368 --> 01:19:28,285
Not yet, but I'm working on him.
It won't be easy.

875
01:19:32,743 --> 01:19:36,326
Professor, tell your son
not to drive too fast.

876
01:19:36,701 --> 01:19:39,451
You risk losing him
before adopting him.

877
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:42,910
And I risk losing my car.

878
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:46,493
Would you come to my funeral, Professor?

879
01:19:46,576 --> 01:19:50,868
You'd be the only respectable person
in the whole funeral cortège.

880
01:19:51,493 --> 01:19:54,076
All the whores of Rome
dressed in black.

881
01:19:54,451 --> 01:19:58,243
- A catwalk of widows.
- Followed by a crowd of dealers,

882
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:01,493
- junkies and lesbians.
- And a delegation of queers.

883
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,493
- Excuse me, Professor?
- Yes.

884
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,076
- What is it, Domenico?
- These two men would like a word.

885
01:20:35,868 --> 01:20:37,785
I don't have any appointments.

886
01:20:38,368 --> 01:20:40,326
- They're police.
- Police?

887
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,410
Yes.

888
01:20:43,952 --> 01:20:47,452
May we have a word, Professor?
I'm Inspector Bernai,

889
01:20:47,952 --> 01:20:49,910
from the Campitelli Precinct.

890
01:20:50,535 --> 01:20:53,743
We need some information,
if that's not a problem?

891
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,743
- I was about to go out...
- It'll only take a minute.

892
01:20:58,243 --> 01:21:02,743
Does a Mr. Konrad Huebel
live in your house?

893
01:21:03,327 --> 01:21:04,660
No.

894
01:21:05,743 --> 01:21:09,827
- So you don't know Mr. Huebel?
- You asked if he lives in my house,

895
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:13,202
- and I told you no.
- Yes, but do you know him?

896
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:19,160
Yes, I've met him.
He was a guest of my upstairs tenants.

897
01:21:19,993 --> 01:21:25,118
We'd appreciate it if you could call
into the precinct when it's convenient.

898
01:21:25,452 --> 01:21:28,493
- But if I don't know...
- The commissioner will explain better.

899
01:21:29,493 --> 01:21:34,952
Huebel claims to have spent the night
of 2nd February in your house,

900
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:37,243
and all the following day.

901
01:21:41,452 --> 01:21:43,368
I'll go with you to the precinct.

902
01:21:56,493 --> 01:21:58,993
- It's simply awful.
- Please, Mom.

903
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:03,118
- It makes me vomit!
- We need some color behind the sofa.

904
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:07,702
- Very expensive for some color!
- We paid the market valuation.

905
01:22:07,993 --> 01:22:11,243
- Stefano's right.
- A classical painting would be perfect.

906
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:16,243
I'll go down to the Professor
and ask him for one of his.

907
01:22:16,493 --> 01:22:18,743
Sure, keep annoying him.

908
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:21,160
Professor, what a surprise!

909
01:22:23,035 --> 01:22:25,035
Did you come to take Erminia back?

910
01:22:25,452 --> 01:22:29,952
Sorry, Professor, we've shamefully
taken advantage of her recently.

911
01:22:30,035 --> 01:22:34,868
Erminia, there are things to do
downstairs if you've finished here.

912
01:22:41,493 --> 01:22:44,493
You hate it, don't you?
You'll get used to it.

913
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:48,785
I let the kids choose everything
since they're going to live here.

914
01:22:49,327 --> 01:22:51,952
Don't you think a classical painting
here would...

915
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:55,493
Did you know that Konrad
was stopped at the border?

916
01:22:56,118 --> 01:22:58,160
- Stopped?
- By the police.

917
01:22:59,327 --> 01:23:03,035
But when? Where?
Konrad's in Munich.

918
01:23:03,618 --> 01:23:06,452
They took him to the airport
the day after our cruise.

919
01:23:07,035 --> 01:23:09,827
He left by car last night,
but that's not important.

920
01:23:09,993 --> 01:23:12,243
It is important because it's not true.

921
01:23:14,118 --> 01:23:15,535
What's going on, Mom?

922
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:20,743
The Professor says Konrad left by car.

923
01:23:20,827 --> 01:23:24,493
It's true. We didn't tell you
because you worry when he drives.

924
01:23:24,577 --> 01:23:28,452
- Did he have an accident?
- He's been arrested.

925
01:23:29,285 --> 01:23:30,993
I didn't say that.

926
01:23:31,327 --> 01:23:33,035
They stopped him because...

927
01:23:33,952 --> 01:23:35,785
they had some suspicions.

928
01:23:36,535 --> 01:23:38,702
He gave my name as an alibi.

929
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:43,202
He told them he stayed
in my house for two days.

930
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:48,160
- It's all very disagreeable.
- Is it true he left last night?

931
01:23:48,493 --> 01:23:53,077
Yes, he delayed leaving
to sort some things out.

932
01:23:53,702 --> 01:23:58,452
But why all these secrets?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

933
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:03,285
Once again the whole lot of you
have treated me dreadfully!

934
01:24:04,202 --> 01:24:05,827
You too, Professor!

935
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:12,202
I did no such thing.
I simply allowed him to be my guest.

936
01:24:14,577 --> 01:24:16,410
How nice of you, Professor!

937
01:24:17,077 --> 01:24:21,202
You wouldn't happen to be
another victim of Konrad's charm?

938
01:24:22,327 --> 01:24:24,827
- What does that mean?
- Exactly what I said.

939
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,243
Mom, quit it!

940
01:24:26,618 --> 01:24:30,410
Just because Konrad stayed here two days
and didn't tell you, it's no reason to...

941
01:24:30,493 --> 01:24:31,618
Shut up, you idiot!

942
01:24:32,952 --> 01:24:37,618
She's only clever when she's making up
excuses to stay out all night.

943
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:40,368
Didn't you hear?
They arrested him.

944
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:43,077
Why?
What did he do when he was here?

945
01:24:43,452 --> 01:24:46,868
- Can't you see how worried I am?
- No, you're jealous.

946
01:24:47,535 --> 01:24:50,202
You want to know his every movement.

947
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:52,910
Give him some space.
Everyone needs a day off.

948
01:24:53,243 --> 01:24:55,410
- Quit it!
- Professor,

949
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:00,493
- why was Konrad staying with you?
- It's not my place to tell you.

950
01:25:01,202 --> 01:25:04,452
I didn't even tell the police,
something which wasn't easy.

951
01:25:04,868 --> 01:25:07,577
I'm not used to concealing things.

952
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:13,202
They may still search both apartments.
They're looking for drugs.

953
01:25:14,952 --> 01:25:17,243
I hadn't realized
that the police possess

954
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:19,952
a long list, let's call it,

955
01:25:20,702 --> 01:25:22,202
regarding Konrad Huebel.

956
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:25,077
We already knew that, he told us.

957
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:29,327
Konrad has a record because he
was in the Berlin student movement.

958
01:25:29,952 --> 01:25:32,702
- Such nonsense!
- You're unfair.

959
01:25:32,868 --> 01:25:36,118
You know he was arrested.
He was committed to the cause.

960
01:25:37,327 --> 01:25:42,702
Sure, he was only at the barricades
to get close to a little bitch,

961
01:25:43,077 --> 01:25:47,243
whose father just happened to be
one of the richest men in Berlin.

962
01:25:47,868 --> 01:25:52,702
Konrad's able to do anything
to get what he wants,

963
01:25:52,785 --> 01:25:55,702
- it doesn't matter what the cause is.
- You love putting him down.

964
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:58,660
I might be infatuated with Konrad,

965
01:25:58,952 --> 01:26:02,285
but I know who he is
and what he gets up to.

966
01:26:02,993 --> 01:26:06,368
Know why he didn't
get off the yacht in Cannes?

967
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:10,410
If he sets foot in France
they'll throw him straight in jail!

968
01:26:10,827 --> 01:26:14,702
I'm horrified, appalled.
What kind of people are you?

969
01:26:14,993 --> 01:26:19,077
You entrust your daughter to someone
for whom you have absolutely no respect?

970
01:26:19,993 --> 01:26:22,035
I've never entrusted her to him!

971
01:26:23,285 --> 01:26:25,535
They live together, in this house.

972
01:26:25,827 --> 01:26:28,202
Mom exaggerates, Konrad isn't so bad.

973
01:26:28,285 --> 01:26:30,160
It's not fair to judge him from this.

974
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:32,452
I'm not judging anyone.

975
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:36,160
Konrad could be a saint for all I know,
unfairly accused.

976
01:26:36,827 --> 01:26:41,618
What disgusts me is that you consider
him to be an immoral good-for-nothing,

977
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:45,910
yet you entrust him with your daughter
and force him onto your friends!

978
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:50,535
My friends are all vaccinated,
don't you worry, Professor.

979
01:26:50,618 --> 01:26:53,118
And Lietta's not in any danger.

980
01:26:53,702 --> 01:26:56,118
That's not what I saw in my house,

981
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,285
but let's not get into that.

982
01:26:58,785 --> 01:27:02,368
- It's my duty to warn you, in case...
- In case I'm deluded?

983
01:27:02,868 --> 01:27:05,077
No, I'm not deluded!

984
01:27:08,993 --> 01:27:11,618
That would be the
only possible justification.

985
01:27:13,243 --> 01:27:15,410
We have nothing else to say to one another.

986
01:27:40,202 --> 01:27:45,244
The lady told me that you had agreed
for me to help her sometimes.

987
01:27:45,744 --> 01:27:49,410
You may help them if you wish.
I don't ever want to see them again.

988
01:27:49,494 --> 01:27:51,702
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

989
01:28:36,452 --> 01:28:38,785
You weren't very nice to grandpa.

990
01:28:40,744 --> 01:28:42,827
He's so happy to have you here.

991
01:28:43,744 --> 01:28:45,244
He's usually all alone.

992
01:28:49,869 --> 01:28:54,035
It's not nice being alone
when you're old and sick.

993
01:28:54,827 --> 01:28:56,035
Alone?

994
01:28:56,994 --> 01:28:58,410
He's not alone.

995
01:28:59,077 --> 01:29:02,785
He has a cook and a maid,
and even a cat.

996
01:29:04,327 --> 01:29:05,952
I don't even have a cat.

997
01:29:37,577 --> 01:29:39,744
Erminia, go upstairs at once.

998
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:43,619
- Tell those people to be quiet!
- Yes, Professor.

999
01:29:47,077 --> 01:29:48,744
- Hello?
- Is that you, Professor?

1000
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:51,827
- Yes.
- I hope we didn't disturb you.

1001
01:29:52,244 --> 01:29:54,410
You've disturbed me plenty.

1002
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:57,702
- Will you turn that music down, please?
- Sure.

1003
01:29:58,285 --> 01:29:59,910
- Thank you.
- Professor?

1004
01:30:00,785 --> 01:30:03,410
- Yes?
- You know we have a telephone now?

1005
01:30:03,785 --> 01:30:06,619
Obviously, since you called me.

1006
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:10,077
I'll give you our number: 676013.

1007
01:30:11,327 --> 01:30:15,702
- 676013.
- You can call if you need anything.

1008
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,660
Did you write it down?

1009
01:30:18,077 --> 01:30:19,660
Yes, I did.

1010
01:30:33,202 --> 01:30:34,535
Hello?

1011
01:30:34,785 --> 01:30:38,619
Sorry for bothering you, Professor,
but you didn't answer my letter?

1012
01:30:38,702 --> 01:30:40,119
- Letter?
- Yes.

1013
01:30:40,202 --> 01:30:42,410
- I didn't receive any letter.
- Didn't you see it?

1014
01:30:42,494 --> 01:30:44,785
I slipped it under your door earlier.

1015
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:50,119
- Very well.
- I'd like it if you answered it.

1016
01:31:12,619 --> 01:31:16,327
Something told me you wouldn't have
answered, so I came down myself.

1017
01:31:21,785 --> 01:31:23,202
It's an invitation.

1018
01:31:23,494 --> 01:31:27,702
Konrad's back and we wanted
to throw a big house-warming party.

1019
01:31:28,452 --> 01:31:32,702
Then we changed our minds,
it's just us and a few friends.

1020
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:36,577
We'll just listen to some music,
dance and chat.

1021
01:31:36,994 --> 01:31:39,994
- Do you want to come?
- Thank you, but I have...

1022
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:44,035
You know Konrad had nothing to do
with that business before?

1023
01:31:44,452 --> 01:31:47,869
- Yes, I know.
- You said some dreadful things to us.

1024
01:31:48,452 --> 01:31:51,619
- You really upset me.
- I know I lost my temper.

1025
01:31:51,702 --> 01:31:54,244
- I shouldn't have.
- You were right to.

1026
01:31:54,619 --> 01:31:59,535
But it's true that mom doesn't know
that much about Konrad's life,

1027
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:01,535
neither do we.

1028
01:32:02,077 --> 01:32:03,369
Poor Konrad!

1029
01:32:03,452 --> 01:32:08,910
He'd do anything for some money,
gambling, getting into trouble.

1030
01:32:10,077 --> 01:32:14,035
The one time he won a lot
he spent it all on a present for mom.

1031
01:32:14,535 --> 01:32:18,452
You know, he was so proud to know
an important person like you.

1032
01:32:19,202 --> 01:32:22,285
Perhaps once he had ambitions
we don't know about.

1033
01:32:23,369 --> 01:32:27,619
Anyway, it'd make everyone very happy
if you came upstairs for a minute.

1034
01:32:28,077 --> 01:32:29,369
Just for a minute.

1035
01:32:30,535 --> 01:32:31,369
No.

1036
01:32:32,077 --> 01:32:34,077
Because of that infamous evening?

1037
01:32:34,744 --> 01:32:37,869
Try to forget about it.
I'm the one who mustn't forget.

1038
01:32:38,952 --> 01:32:40,994
It won't happen again, I promise.

1039
01:32:41,702 --> 01:32:44,160
- Will you come up?
- No, I...

1040
01:32:44,869 --> 01:32:46,244
I'm working.

1041
01:32:52,035 --> 01:32:55,827
If you like, you can come here
for dinner tomorrow evening.

1042
01:32:56,702 --> 01:32:58,119
At nine o'clock.

1043
01:33:13,327 --> 01:33:16,952
Is this wine from your land?
Where exactly?

1044
01:33:18,202 --> 01:33:19,619
Tuscany, near Arezzo.

1045
01:33:24,994 --> 01:33:26,119
It's good.

1046
01:33:28,702 --> 01:33:33,077
Come now, Professor,
we're nearly finished, then we'll go.

1047
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:43,327
You're not in good form.
I bet you didn't want to invite us.

1048
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:46,619
- Lietta forced you to.
- No, it's not true.

1049
01:33:47,577 --> 01:33:49,244
No, it was my idea.

1050
01:33:49,577 --> 01:33:52,494
So, how come you've hardly said a word?

1051
01:33:53,369 --> 01:33:54,952
We're all a bit down.

1052
01:33:55,327 --> 01:33:58,702
It's all these troubles
that are in the news.

1053
01:33:59,285 --> 01:34:00,827
It's the same everywhere.

1054
01:34:00,994 --> 01:34:04,619
Today I was at home for breakfast
for the first time in a while.

1055
01:34:05,369 --> 01:34:06,660
It was a mistake.

1056
01:34:06,744 --> 01:34:10,327
Father's workers have been
on strike for over a week,

1057
01:34:10,994 --> 01:34:12,827
and he wasn't speaking to my brother.

1058
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:17,535
He just sat there in silence
at the head of the table,

1059
01:34:18,369 --> 01:34:19,744
like you, Professor.

1060
01:34:21,202 --> 01:34:25,285
But you don't have any striking workers,
or a son...

1061
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,702
who pretends to be a Marxist.

1062
01:34:30,702 --> 01:34:34,410
You only have happy, calm,
characters surrounding you,

1063
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,577
without any problems.
Do you like all of them?

1064
01:34:40,035 --> 01:34:42,827
I have my favorites,
and my infidelities.

1065
01:34:44,536 --> 01:34:47,619
For a long time I favored
the Sitwell Family.

1066
01:34:48,661 --> 01:34:53,786
I even brought them into my bedroom,
but we experienced some difficulties.

1067
01:34:54,161 --> 01:34:57,786
I quarreled with the eldest daughter.
The tall one in the corner.

1068
01:34:58,369 --> 01:35:00,577
And who will you fight with
in your new family?

1069
01:35:01,369 --> 01:35:03,244
Which family? This one?

1070
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:06,952
I'll fight with all of you.
I already have!

1071
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:10,411
But we made up again.
We're here now, aren't we?

1072
01:35:11,452 --> 01:35:14,744
The elderly are strange creatures.
Didn't you know?

1073
01:35:15,369 --> 01:35:17,327
Argumentative and intolerant.

1074
01:35:18,077 --> 01:35:21,452
Sometimes they're frightened by
the Ioneliness they wished for,

1075
01:35:21,536 --> 01:35:24,202
other times they defend it
when it's threatened.

1076
01:35:25,077 --> 01:35:27,619
It was during one
of these brief crises...

1077
01:35:29,244 --> 01:35:31,494
that I invited you here this evening.

1078
01:35:32,536 --> 01:35:36,202
But by the time we came
the crisis had already passed.

1079
01:35:40,411 --> 01:35:42,702
You really should try to change.

1080
01:35:46,536 --> 01:35:49,702
Really, Professor,
your solitude is over.

1081
01:35:50,577 --> 01:35:52,286
We really like it here,

1082
01:35:52,952 --> 01:35:55,536
and you'll have us at this table a lot.

1083
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:05,244
- And mom will complete our little family.
- So I'm part of this family too?

1084
01:36:05,911 --> 01:36:08,077
- Mom!
- Please, Professor, don't get up.

1085
01:36:08,161 --> 01:36:09,994
Of course you're part of it.

1086
01:36:10,452 --> 01:36:14,619
We just formed it:
Father, mother and we're the children.

1087
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:17,661
You look beautiful, Mom.

1088
01:36:17,911 --> 01:36:21,744
- Our family is somewhat incestuous.
- You're such a fool!

1089
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:26,202
- Apologies for being late, Professor.
- That's all right.

1090
01:36:26,702 --> 01:36:29,411
- Erminia, would you mind...
- Thank you, but I already ate.

1091
01:36:29,494 --> 01:36:32,077
But I wouldn't say no
to that wonderful dessert.

1092
01:36:35,286 --> 01:36:38,786
I'm very happy
that you could come too.

1093
01:36:44,327 --> 01:36:46,994
You were right to find a new father,

1094
01:36:47,077 --> 01:36:49,911
- seen as your old one has left.
- He's left?

1095
01:36:51,077 --> 01:36:52,952
I brought him to the airport.

1096
01:36:53,452 --> 01:36:58,494
You know, airports these days
look a lot like cemeteries.

1097
01:36:58,994 --> 01:37:03,494
- Why did you bring him to the airport?
- I'm still asking myself that.

1098
01:37:03,869 --> 01:37:05,786
It was a nightmare evening.

1099
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:10,369
I think your father
is going a little mad.

1100
01:37:10,827 --> 01:37:12,202
If you say so.

1101
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:16,494
My husband invited his friends,
the Gasparris, to dinner.

1102
01:37:17,327 --> 01:37:20,411
And since he had some
urgent business to attend to

1103
01:37:21,661 --> 01:37:25,619
he begged me to meet and entertain
the Gasparris until dinnertime.

1104
01:37:26,994 --> 01:37:30,911
I was making them comfortable
when my husband rushed in.

1105
01:37:31,661 --> 01:37:35,327
He was in a state,
shouting that he had to leave immediately.

1106
01:37:36,619 --> 01:37:41,119
What's more, I had to drive him to
the airport as he had to talk to me.

1107
01:37:41,786 --> 01:37:43,536
A great evening!

1108
01:37:44,369 --> 01:37:46,036
What about the Gasparris?

1109
01:37:46,452 --> 01:37:49,161
- They weren't happy.
- So I'd imagine.

1110
01:37:49,244 --> 01:37:51,869
I almost sent them here.

1111
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:53,994
That would have been fantastic!

1112
01:37:54,077 --> 01:37:56,161
- Where did father go to?
- Madrid.

1113
01:37:57,494 --> 01:38:01,244
He told Gasparri
the political situation is very serious,

1114
01:38:01,827 --> 01:38:04,244
and that he had
to leave on a secret mission.

1115
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,077
They seemed to believe him.

1116
01:38:08,286 --> 01:38:12,077
Instead, I think your father
remembered at the last moment

1117
01:38:12,494 --> 01:38:15,994
that hunting season opens tomorrow
at Villaverde in Madrid.

1118
01:38:16,536 --> 01:38:18,327
He went last year as well.

1119
01:38:18,994 --> 01:38:21,827
- Who did he talk to before dinner?
- I don't know, darling.

1120
01:38:22,327 --> 01:38:24,411
A man I'd never seen before.

1121
01:38:26,036 --> 01:38:29,952
My husband told Gasparri
that he's someone who works...

1122
01:38:31,536 --> 01:38:33,369
in the government press office.

1123
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:38,369
Shall we retire to
the drawing room for coffee?

1124
01:38:39,827 --> 01:38:42,327
But my story isn't finished, I warn you!

1125
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:59,161
Excuse me, Bianca,
but was it a Mr. Ghisberti?

1126
01:38:59,244 --> 01:39:01,286
I already told you, I don't know!

1127
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:13,202
Thank you, I'll serve.

1128
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:18,036
- Who wants coffee?
- Mom never has coffee in the evening.

1129
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:21,369
But I'll have a drop
with cream this evening.

1130
01:39:21,661 --> 01:39:23,702
- Would you like me to serve?
- If you please.

1131
01:39:39,077 --> 01:39:40,369
- Thank you.
- Professor?

1132
01:39:40,452 --> 01:39:42,536
Thank you, without cream.

1133
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,869
- Konrad?
- I'll get my own.

1134
01:39:47,202 --> 01:39:48,744
- Stefano?
- No, thanks.

1135
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:54,744
Now that we're relaxed,
I'll tell you the rest of my story.

1136
01:39:57,661 --> 01:40:01,036
Pay attention, Konrad,
it should particularly interest you.

1137
01:40:02,161 --> 01:40:05,952
Having gotten rid of the Gasparris,
we rushed to the airport.

1138
01:40:06,869 --> 01:40:09,161
And what did my husband want to tell me?

1139
01:40:09,994 --> 01:40:12,452
"I expect...",
and these are his exact words.

1140
01:40:13,494 --> 01:40:17,702
"I expect you to leave Konrad
and never see him again!"

1141
01:40:17,786 --> 01:40:21,286
- Papa? Since when has he...
- Exactly, since when?

1142
01:40:22,161 --> 01:40:25,827
He was in such a state
I didn't want to go against him.

1143
01:40:27,494 --> 01:40:29,619
I've never seen him like that before.

1144
01:40:29,952 --> 01:40:32,119
His passion has returned.
He's jealous.

1145
01:40:32,202 --> 01:40:35,327
Oh please, he was perfectly clear:

1146
01:40:35,411 --> 01:40:38,202
He doesn't mind if I take another lover,

1147
01:40:38,286 --> 01:40:41,036
but he wants me to get rid of Konrad.

1148
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,827
He was saying some ridiculous things.

1149
01:40:44,161 --> 01:40:47,077
He told me to send him away
immediately, otherwise...

1150
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:49,327
Finally I lost my patience and said:

1151
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:54,161
"If that's how you want things,
I prefer to get a divorce."

1152
01:40:55,077 --> 01:40:57,786
- So that's what we're doing.
- So you can marry Konrad?

1153
01:40:59,244 --> 01:41:00,452
No!

1154
01:41:04,952 --> 01:41:08,369
Besides, Konrad has never
asked me to marry him.

1155
01:41:09,452 --> 01:41:11,119
Isn't that right, dear?

1156
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:14,536
- I'm asking you now.
- Thank you,

1157
01:41:15,286 --> 01:41:17,161
but the answer is no.

1158
01:41:18,536 --> 01:41:22,661
You marry to have a family,
and divorce to be free.

1159
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:25,536
- Free to remarry.
- No, free.

1160
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:27,827
- Simply free.
- Don't talk crap.

1161
01:41:28,952 --> 01:41:30,911
- What do you mean?
- You know well.

1162
01:41:31,369 --> 01:41:34,702
- Lietta, what's he on?
- Come on, why won't you marry me?

1163
01:41:35,619 --> 01:41:37,619
- Enough. Shut it.
- Konrad.

1164
01:41:38,286 --> 01:41:41,911
- Shall I say?
- Don't worry, I'll tell them.

1165
01:41:43,536 --> 01:41:47,869
I won't marry you because
you're twelve years younger than me.

1166
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:50,786
And because you're not marriage material.

1167
01:41:51,703 --> 01:41:53,536
Am I not? Why's that?

1168
01:41:56,286 --> 01:41:58,161
You're not being entertaining.

1169
01:41:58,494 --> 01:42:00,578
I'm not trying to be. Answer me.

1170
01:42:00,994 --> 01:42:03,286
He's drunk,
he's been drinking all evening.

1171
01:42:03,703 --> 01:42:07,453
I'm not drunk.
And I don't want her to marry me.

1172
01:42:08,786 --> 01:42:11,578
It would be absurd. I know what I am.

1173
01:42:13,161 --> 01:42:17,619
I know what you are too,
and I won't let you make fun of me.

1174
01:42:19,078 --> 01:42:22,203
- No one's making fun of you.
- I'm sorry, I wasn't referring to you.

1175
01:42:23,369 --> 01:42:24,661
Now then, darling...

1176
01:42:25,286 --> 01:42:29,578
tell me why, according to the rules
of your respectable society,

1177
01:42:30,203 --> 01:42:32,203
I'm not good marriage material?

1178
01:42:33,286 --> 01:42:35,953
- Enough of this foolishness.
- What is it?

1179
01:42:36,369 --> 01:42:39,411
- Did something happen to you?
- It's not because of my origins.

1180
01:42:40,161 --> 01:42:42,203
It's because of my life, isn't it?

1181
01:42:43,203 --> 01:42:45,661
A kept lover. Illegal dealings.

1182
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:48,078
That's what matters.

1183
01:42:48,619 --> 01:42:51,078
Yes, my dear, that's what matters.

1184
01:42:51,869 --> 01:42:53,744
It matters because I wasn't successful.

1185
01:42:54,744 --> 01:42:57,786
Because I'm still just
a rich woman's lapdog,

1186
01:42:57,953 --> 01:43:01,036
to be brought where
other dogs are strictly forbidden.

1187
01:43:01,411 --> 01:43:06,828
Of course the others don't mind when he
steals food, or makes a mess, or bites.

1188
01:43:07,328 --> 01:43:10,953
Don't say these things,
you know they're not true!

1189
01:43:11,244 --> 01:43:12,744
Don't encourage him, Bianca,

1190
01:43:12,828 --> 01:43:17,078
he just wants to attack our
corrupt capitalist bourgeois society.

1191
01:43:17,828 --> 01:43:21,453
You're talking about
a society that doesn't exist anymore,

1192
01:43:21,786 --> 01:43:25,119
and if it does exist
all you do is profit from it.

1193
01:43:25,828 --> 01:43:27,369
It does exist.

1194
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:29,703
It exists,

1195
01:43:29,869 --> 01:43:32,453
and it's more dangerous
now than ever,

1196
01:43:32,536 --> 01:43:35,703
- because it's disguised.
- Not you too, Professor!

1197
01:43:36,244 --> 01:43:38,369
I'm not a reactionary, you know that.

1198
01:43:38,744 --> 01:43:41,119
No, I don't.
You too are in disguise!

1199
01:43:41,203 --> 01:43:44,286
Every intellectual I've met
says they're left-wing,

1200
01:43:44,369 --> 01:43:48,911
a claim which luckily is never
substantiated in their lives or art.

1201
01:43:50,911 --> 01:43:52,911
The intellectuals of my generation

1202
01:43:53,578 --> 01:43:57,119
tried hard to find a balance
between politics and morals.

1203
01:43:57,786 --> 01:43:58,994
An impossible task.

1204
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:02,119
At least they committed their lives to it,

1205
01:44:02,203 --> 01:44:05,703
but he's never tackled any
political or moral problems.

1206
01:44:05,869 --> 01:44:09,661
Who's he to hate a society
that lets him live like a lord?

1207
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:13,119
- Even if he did sneak in the service door.
- It's true.

1208
01:44:13,494 --> 01:44:17,703
With an old shirt and
a jacket I'd had since I was young.

1209
01:44:21,203 --> 01:44:25,703
I remember the first house,
it was wonderful,

1210
01:44:25,994 --> 01:44:28,786
and the lady of the house's bed.

1211
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:32,786
She wasn't beautiful like you.

1212
01:44:34,161 --> 01:44:36,161
To me she seemed marvelous.

1213
01:44:36,828 --> 01:44:39,703
I had a lump in my throat
and tears in my eyes,

1214
01:44:40,286 --> 01:44:44,453
like a prospector who sees gold
for the first time in a stream.

1215
01:44:46,661 --> 01:44:50,828
That was what I wanted,
and I've done everything to keep it.

1216
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:54,786
The methods that disgust you so much,

1217
01:44:55,494 --> 01:44:57,244
well, I learned them there.

1218
01:44:57,328 --> 01:45:00,244
They're the same methods
that are used in your world.

1219
01:45:00,953 --> 01:45:04,703
They just have different names
because the stakes are higher.

1220
01:45:05,036 --> 01:45:08,411
They have fine names,
and are spoken of with respect,

1221
01:45:09,328 --> 01:45:11,369
instead of making you sick.

1222
01:45:12,494 --> 01:45:15,244
You think you live amongst gallant men,

1223
01:45:15,328 --> 01:45:18,494
but often these same men are criminals.

1224
01:45:19,786 --> 01:45:24,161
If I told you that your husband
escaped because his associates' plan

1225
01:45:24,536 --> 01:45:29,744
to get rid of a dozen communists
and some government ministers

1226
01:45:29,828 --> 01:45:32,536
and carry out a coup d'état
has been discovered,

1227
01:45:32,619 --> 01:45:35,869
- you'd be appalled.
- I wouldn't be appalled,

1228
01:45:36,536 --> 01:45:38,869
I'd say you've gone crazy!

1229
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:45,453
My husband's an industrialist,
naturally he's right-wing.

1230
01:45:46,119 --> 01:45:48,828
But where are the left-wing industrialists?

1231
01:45:50,078 --> 01:45:52,369
Maybe some of them claim to be.

1232
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:57,161
My husband is right-wing,
and he openly acknowledges it.

1233
01:45:57,536 --> 01:45:58,869
And why shouldn't he?

1234
01:45:59,494 --> 01:46:03,411
But that doesn't mean he's part
of a criminal organization!

1235
01:46:03,786 --> 01:46:06,994
Yes he is! Ask Stefano.

1236
01:46:07,536 --> 01:46:08,953
He knows the truth.

1237
01:46:11,703 --> 01:46:12,744
You're mad!

1238
01:46:13,619 --> 01:46:16,786
This little lapdog was also a pointer.

1239
01:46:18,078 --> 01:46:21,119
So that's your game!

1240
01:46:22,661 --> 01:46:25,453
That's how you manage
to stay out of trouble.

1241
01:46:25,786 --> 01:46:28,828
When everyone else is flushing
their cocaine down the toilet

1242
01:46:28,994 --> 01:46:31,869
you're the only one
who doesn't have to worry.

1243
01:46:32,786 --> 01:46:35,411
You're stopped at the border
and let go the next day.

1244
01:46:35,494 --> 01:46:39,244
- Your lies and defamation protect you.
- Enough!

1245
01:46:39,661 --> 01:46:42,786
It's not a lie, I denounced them!

1246
01:46:43,369 --> 01:46:44,994
And I'm happy I did it.

1247
01:46:45,078 --> 01:46:47,578
And you tolerate this
in your house, Professor?

1248
01:46:48,078 --> 01:46:50,078
- What do you want?
- Bastard!

1249
01:46:50,703 --> 01:46:51,994
Konrad!

1250
01:46:52,578 --> 01:46:54,369
- Get away!
- Stefano, no!

1251
01:46:56,869 --> 01:46:58,744
- Don't!
- Stop this!

1252
01:46:59,078 --> 01:47:00,619
I won't allow this!

1253
01:47:02,269 --> 01:47:03,228
Stop!

1254
01:47:04,019 --> 01:47:06,394
Even the damned in hell
don't accuse each other

1255
01:47:06,478 --> 01:47:08,144
- like you two do.
- One minute!

1256
01:47:08,686 --> 01:47:12,853
Konrad gave his side of the story,
now it's my turn.

1257
01:47:13,186 --> 01:47:18,311
Professor, you've already met
the people he's involved with,

1258
01:47:18,769 --> 01:47:22,978
they're scum, petty criminals
who beat him up over some drugs.

1259
01:47:23,519 --> 01:47:26,644
That's his world,
and it's all he knows.

1260
01:47:27,144 --> 01:47:28,978
Konrad, answer him!

1261
01:47:30,019 --> 01:47:31,144
Bastard!

1262
01:47:32,311 --> 01:47:33,728
I said stop!

1263
01:47:35,853 --> 01:47:37,978
You're fighting like rabid dogs!

1264
01:47:38,436 --> 01:47:40,436
I thought you loved each other,
that you were friends.

1265
01:47:40,519 --> 01:47:42,228
True friends. Inseparable.

1266
01:47:42,853 --> 01:47:45,061
That we loved each other?
Friends?

1267
01:47:46,186 --> 01:47:48,728
Sure, we're together every day,

1268
01:47:49,394 --> 01:47:52,186
we talk, laugh, eat and fuck together!

1269
01:47:53,561 --> 01:47:56,769
But when the fun is over
these friends disappear.

1270
01:47:57,311 --> 01:48:01,353
- Everyone for themselves.
- It's true. Everyone for themselves.

1271
01:48:02,228 --> 01:48:04,894
Anyway, people like you
always land on their feet.

1272
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:07,019
Well,

1273
01:48:07,769 --> 01:48:11,186
I'll say goodbye and be on my way,
since that's what you want.

1274
01:48:12,061 --> 01:48:14,603
Isn't that what you want, Professor?

1275
01:48:17,728 --> 01:48:19,353
You said some very grave things.

1276
01:48:21,603 --> 01:48:24,603
I told the truth,
and I won't apologize for that.

1277
01:48:25,978 --> 01:48:29,019
Thanks for dinner, Professor,
but take my advice:

1278
01:48:30,186 --> 01:48:32,894
Stay out of the fray,
you have until now.

1279
01:48:33,603 --> 01:48:36,936
Stay here, with your beautiful
portraits of dead people.

1280
01:48:37,436 --> 01:48:41,353
They're the only ones safe
from the violence of Fascist clowns.

1281
01:48:49,978 --> 01:48:51,478
I hope you will suffer.

1282
01:48:52,186 --> 01:48:54,186
I hope it'll soon pass.

1283
01:48:55,561 --> 01:48:58,061
You people always
land on your feet as well.

1284
01:48:58,686 --> 01:49:01,811
It's not so easy at my age,
but I'll do my best.

1285
01:49:06,478 --> 01:49:08,061
Where will you go now?

1286
01:49:09,061 --> 01:49:11,186
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

1287
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:30,520
I always tried to give him the best.

1288
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:34,770
Nice clothes, trips,
they're part of life too.

1289
01:49:36,853 --> 01:49:41,311
Even if I did make some mistakes,
I did something for him.

1290
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,645
I really loved him.

1291
01:49:46,978 --> 01:49:49,436
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone!

1292
01:49:57,478 --> 01:50:00,228
You insulted him, fine!

1293
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:09,145
You chased him away like
a servant who's caught stealing, fine!

1294
01:50:12,811 --> 01:50:14,770
But you, Professor,

1295
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:19,186
you shouldn't have
turned your back on him.

1296
01:50:19,978 --> 01:50:21,770
You shouldn't have.

1297
01:50:24,145 --> 01:50:26,436
Not you. Not you as well!

1298
01:50:30,811 --> 01:50:33,936
Come now, nobody here is to blame.

1299
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:37,770
If you want, I'll run after him.

1300
01:50:38,686 --> 01:50:41,228
I'll beg on my knees for his forgiveness.

1301
01:50:48,228 --> 01:50:50,895
I hope Konrad won't forgive anyone.

1302
01:50:52,353 --> 01:50:53,853
Myself included.

1303
01:51:01,895 --> 01:51:07,103
When Mrs. Brumonti first came here
and asked to rent the apartment,

1304
01:51:07,561 --> 01:51:08,936
I said no.

1305
01:51:11,145 --> 01:51:13,978
I was afraid of being near
people I didn't know.

1306
01:51:14,728 --> 01:51:16,645
People who might disturb me.

1307
01:51:20,311 --> 01:51:24,811
Instead, all this has been much worse
than I could ever have imagined.

1308
01:51:27,145 --> 01:51:29,978
If ever there existed
impossible tenants,

1309
01:51:30,645 --> 01:51:32,478
I think I found them.

1310
01:51:34,103 --> 01:51:36,395
But then I started thinking,

1311
01:51:37,311 --> 01:51:39,020
as Lietta had said,

1312
01:51:40,936 --> 01:51:43,478
that they could have been my family.

1313
01:51:45,353 --> 01:51:49,561
A family that turned out well or badly,
but completely different to me.

1314
01:51:50,061 --> 01:51:53,686
And since I love this wretched family

1315
01:51:55,061 --> 01:51:58,770
I want to do something for it,
just as it, without realizing,

1316
01:51:58,853 --> 01:52:00,061
did something for me.

1317
01:52:01,853 --> 01:52:05,145
There's a book by a certain writer
in my bedroom,

1318
01:52:05,728 --> 01:52:07,936
and I read it continually.

1319
01:52:09,561 --> 01:52:14,353
It talks about a tenant who moves
into the apartment above the writer's.

1320
01:52:16,228 --> 01:52:17,895
He hears him moving about.

1321
01:52:18,936 --> 01:52:21,728
Walking, doing things.

1322
01:52:23,311 --> 01:52:25,728
Sometimes, all of a sudden,
he disappears.

1323
01:52:26,103 --> 01:52:28,978
And for a long time
there's nothing but silence.

1324
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:31,770
But just as suddenly, he returns.

1325
01:52:33,103 --> 01:52:35,936
His absences become rarer,

1326
01:52:36,811 --> 01:52:38,686
and his presence more constant.

1327
01:52:41,853 --> 01:52:43,395
It's death.

1328
01:52:49,436 --> 01:52:52,728
The knowledge of being near
the end of his life

1329
01:52:53,853 --> 01:52:58,603
appeared to the writer in one of its
innumerable, deceitful forms.

1330
01:53:03,186 --> 01:53:05,061
Your presence upstairs...

1331
01:53:06,061 --> 01:53:08,145
meant the opposite to me.

1332
01:53:09,853 --> 01:53:12,353
I don't think I was deceived.

1333
01:53:14,228 --> 01:53:17,228
You woke me up again,

1334
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:19,186
roughly,

1335
01:53:20,395 --> 01:53:22,311
from a very deep sleep.

1336
01:53:23,395 --> 01:53:26,645
A sleep that was deaf and numb...

1337
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,186
like death.

1338
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,520
There's a letter for you.

1339
01:53:53,936 --> 01:53:57,061
Erminia! Hurry to see
if Konrad is upstairs.

1340
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,978
Quick, go!

1341
01:54:06,853 --> 01:54:09,770
Dear Professor,
I wish I were mistaken,

1342
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:12,478
but I don't think
we will see each other again.

1343
01:54:12,561 --> 01:54:14,145
Your son, Konrad.

1344
01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:47,520
- Oh God!
- Professor, don't touch him.

1345
01:54:48,561 --> 01:54:50,478
Wait for the police.

1346
01:55:41,103 --> 01:55:42,895
Breathe out slowly.

1347
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:45,895
That's it.

1348
01:55:49,437 --> 01:55:50,895
Very good.

1349
01:55:53,937 --> 01:55:56,895
We'll be finished in a second.

1350
01:56:10,562 --> 01:56:13,603
Professor? You have visitors.

1351
01:56:30,853 --> 01:56:33,062
I gave back the keys to Erminia.

1352
01:56:33,895 --> 01:56:36,020
My lawyer will be talking to yours.

1353
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:40,395
They'll sort out all payments
for what happened upstairs.

1354
01:56:42,103 --> 01:56:44,770
I'll let you know
what the inquiry finds.

1355
01:56:46,978 --> 01:56:48,312
I'd like to...

1356
01:56:50,687 --> 01:56:53,603
I only wish I had some doubts.

1357
01:56:56,812 --> 01:56:58,187
Unfortunately...

1358
01:57:01,687 --> 01:57:05,645
Konrad's suicide was his way
of having the final word.

1359
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:12,312
In a horrible and cruel way
he wanted to punish us forever.

1360
01:57:14,395 --> 01:57:17,478
But there's something Konrad
hadn't yet realized:

1361
01:57:19,395 --> 01:57:21,312
That we will forget him.

1362
01:57:22,895 --> 01:57:24,853
And we will forget him.

1363
01:57:30,395 --> 01:57:35,520
He was too young to have learned
yet another horrible thing...

1364
01:57:39,395 --> 01:57:44,228
that even pain is fleeting,
like everything else.

1365
01:58:06,437 --> 01:58:07,978
Goodbye, Professor.

1366
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:11,895
Don't believe mom.

1367
01:58:13,937 --> 01:58:16,353
Believe me,
he didn't kill himself.

1368
01:58:16,895 --> 01:58:18,437
They killed him.

1369
01:58:19,853 --> 01:58:22,770
You were the only one
to have faith in him.

1370
01:58:24,562 --> 01:58:27,145
Don't lose that faith
just because he's dead.
