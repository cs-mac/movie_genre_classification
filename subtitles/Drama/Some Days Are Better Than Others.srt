00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,598
Hi, my name is
Katrina Collins.

2
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,757
I live in Portland

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,835
and I think I'd be
the ideal candidate

4
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:24,958
to be on the
next season of

5
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,299
the Real World.

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,363
Hi, my name is
Katrina Collins

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,342
I live in Portland

8
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,412
and I think I'd be
the ideal candidate

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,706
to be on the
next season of

10
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,747
the Real World

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,037
I've been watching
the show

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,346
ever since I was a kid.

13
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,244
And its always felt
like I'm watching

14
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,877
an exact replica
of my own life.

15
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,456
Sort of like a
dramatic reenactment

16
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,658
except instead of actors

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,523
playing the role of
famous people

18
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,560
is real people

19
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,628
playing the role of me.

20
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,961
I work at a dog shelter,
taking care of dogs

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,035
and I have a
boyfriend named Brian

22
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,757
who I've been dating
for five years

23
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,738
and I'm totally
crazy about.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,418
...Fifty-six...

25
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,150
Y'know, I just don't
understand what they

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,630
need this information for.

27
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,386
And besides,
don't you think

28
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,121
they could call around
and just ask the stores

29
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,033
how many different
brands of milk they carry?

30
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,127
Its like the fact that
somebody would decide

31
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,962
"Hey, we need to
hire somebody

32
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,464
to drive all
around town

33
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,065
to count milk jugs
for us," pretty much

34
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,875
explains how screwed up
the world is.

35
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,674
I guess its better
than that stupid

36
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,450
office job they had
me doing last month.

37
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,479
All I did there
was make copies

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,460
for twenty hours straight.

39
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,663
And the machine broke
down every ten minutes.

40
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,621
That's why my hands

41
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,602
still smell like
that ink loner.

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,797
Hey, thanks again
for letting me

43
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,776
use the car.

44
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,146
- Oh, you're welcome Eli.

45
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,093
- So I don't think
it will take

46
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:55,799
as long tomorrow.

47
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,598
- I hope not Eli.

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,798
- Um, I'll be by
about 9

49
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,869
if you wanna come.

50
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,738
- Well, I'll see how
Heel.

51
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,007
- Alright.

52
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,938
Alright, well thanks
for today.

53
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:07,883
- My pleasure.

54
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,886
Hey, you want to
come in the house?

55
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,110
I want to show you
a new setup I got

56
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,057
for the soap films

57
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,281
I discovered

58
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,262
that the best
light source

59
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,288
for the soap films

60
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,898
is the sun.

61
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,502
And this room

62
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,004
has the best light
in the house

63
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,573
So...

64
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,643
Come over here

65
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,182
You put that into there.

66
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,548
And then you go
over there.

67
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,583
And you edit it.

68
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,092
- And the camera here...

69
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,219
sends the image
through these cables

70
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,164
over there.

71
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,692
Really cool.

72
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,294
I hope you don't
plan on using

73
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,666
the sink anytime soon.

74
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,693
- Do you want to

75
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,866
turn that light oh'?

76
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,040
- Sure

77
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,170
- Look at that.

78
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,115
- Whoa

79
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,754
All this from reflections
of a bubble...

80
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,557
- That's right

81
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,067
- You have one unheard
message

82
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,070
First message sent

83
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,677
today at 1:18pm

84
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,708
- Afree DVR

85
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,017
- If you don't know
what a DVR is

86
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,055
press 1 on your phone

87
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,679
and a rep will tell
you all about it.

88
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,947
Its awesome technology

89
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,325
that will change the
way you watch TV.

90
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,983
Basically, if you
still have a

91
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:32,962
cable provider-.

92
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,126
- Breaking hearts...

93
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,984
Breaking Hearts

94
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,126
someone has to
be sent home.

95
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,099
Hi girls

96
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,831
We've had a long journey

97
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,425
but unfortunately
I only have

98
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,404
two roses left.

99
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,007
Clarissa

100
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,903
We've had some
really good times

101
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,733
like our trip on
the yacht.

102
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,734
Or our long walks

103
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,715
on the candle-lit beach

104
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,138
So this one is easy,

105
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,085
you get a rose...

106
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,459
Megan...

107
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,282
you know how special
you are to me

108
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,017
and I want to keep
the specialness

109
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,725
going for as long
as it can.

110
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,324
And each day,
I feel that

111
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,070
we get connected
stronger and stronger

112
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,773
So this last rose...

113
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,477
This last rose is
for you Megan

114
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,313
- I just can't believe this

115
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,916
I thought what
we had was real

116
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,751
I felt it

117
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,953
And I thought
he felt it, too.

118
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,944
I was ready to
spend the rest of

119
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,083
my life with him.

120
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,826
I just don't understand.

121
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,284
- Stay tuned for scenes
from next week's

122
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,752
episode of...

123
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,733
"The Single Guy."

124
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,558
- Okay, so...

125
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,059
Check this out-

126
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,460
I've figured out
how to eat out

127
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,099
for every meal
of the day

128
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,477
for less than
six bucks total.

129
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,480
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

130
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,282
Okay, so...

131
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,386
For breakfast,

132
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,555
all you really need
is cofiee, right?

133
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,978
So you just...

134
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,458
...head over to stumptown.

135
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,515
Get the bottomless cup.

136
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,154
By your second cup
of coffee,

137
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,551
you've pretty much
forgotten about eating

138
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:46,996
breakfast.

139
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,454
And they're cool there,
you can pretty much

140
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,196
hang out as long
as you want.

141
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,504
And then for lunch,
go over to the

142
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,301
Happy Monday Thai Buffet.

143
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,366
Get the lunch special #3,
for $3.25.

144
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,135
And the lunch special #3
I'm pretty sure

145
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,547
is actually like...

146
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,273
the leftovers from the
previous day's

147
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,912
lunch special #1.

148
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,344
But, good things come
to those who wait

149
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,551
my friend.

150
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,415
Now, the best place
for dinner is

151
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,396
you go to La Sirenita

152
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,032
and you get
the soft tostada.

153
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,301
Its $1.75,
and its huge.

154
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,870
Totally fills you up,
and you're done.

155
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,304
Less than six bucks.

156
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,162
And on the weekends,

157
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,564
you can hit the
Natural Food store

158
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,132
and get all those
free samples

159
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,510
that they give out.

160
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,082
You can kill like
one meal right there.

161
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,110
- I've, ah.

162
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,623
Got a razor blade
that I've

163
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,186
gotten over 2,000
shaves with it.

164
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,556
I've been thinking
about sending it in to

165
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,489
the Guiness Book of
World Records

166
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,436
- Okay, now, what?

167
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,306
- Well, you know

168
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,498
a shaver.

169
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,500
One of them, one of them...

170
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,310
double-bladed things

171
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,369
- The old-fashioned kind --

172
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,437
I think its a Bick.

173
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,576
- Yeah

174
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,855
I've been using it now

175
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,411
for six years

176
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,358
and I've never had
to sharpen it.

177
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,315
- That's pretty cool, Otis.

178
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,659
- Yeah

179
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,254
- This depression ain't
gonna have any impact

180
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,233
OH US.

181
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,146
- Good god, that's a
lot of fucking milk.

182
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,715
The freshest milk is
always in the back.

183
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,984
- Excuse me

184
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,430
Can I help you?

185
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,098
He'll) me?

186
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,465
Not unless you can
tell me how many

187
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,192
quarts, gallons, half-gallons

188
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,594
of Dairy-Gold Sunshine

189
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,541
and Happy Cow Milk
you have in your case.

190
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,097
Um...

191
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,232
Can I ask you to
wait here for

192
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:47,506
just a moment?

193
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,711
- Yeah, sure
- Thanks.

194
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,389
- Hello, there.
Excuse me.

195
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,357
Can I, ah, help you
with anything?

196
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,117
- Not unless you can
tell me how many

197
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,654
cartons of milk you have
in your dairy case today.

198
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,454
- And why do you
need to know

199
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,763
how many cartons of
milk are in there?

200
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,690
- That's an excellent question.

201
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,227
I really have
no idea why.

202
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,227
It makes no sense, but

203
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,208
they don't pay me
to ask questions, so...

204
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,231
- Are you with the
health board, because

205
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,506
I didn't get a notice
you were coming.

206
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,434
No sir, my name
is Eli

207
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,413
I'm with manforce.

208
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,437
They sent me last year
to be the Easter Bunny

209
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,418
and now they've sent
me to count the milk.

210
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,652
- That was you?

211
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,243
- I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave

212
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,382
the building immediately.

213
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,213
C)h

214
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,125
it looks like your
pen is leaking.

215
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,496
- That's old, actually.

216
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,085
I don't know when
that happened.

217
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,064
Months ago maybe.

218
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,602
- Come on, let's go.

219
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,213
- Dear Katrina Collins,

220
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,352
Congratulations.

221
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,149
We would like to
invite you

222
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,451

being produced today.

231

Bring a copy of
your most recent

232
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,849
headshois, video audition
tapes, and resumes

and become a better
reality TV participant

237
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,781
We look forward
to meeting you.

238
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,762
Sincerely, Joe Prescott.

239
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,331
President,
Talent Services America

240
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,834
Awesome, I better get started.

241
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,870
Okay, I'm gonna need
some supplies.

242
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,742
- Come in.

243
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,955
- Hi, uh, hi.

244
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,619
Mr. Bear?

245
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,959
I'm sorry to bother
you, but

246
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,053
something was donated

247
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,262
that I...l...

248
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,599
I don't think was meant
to be donated.

249
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,591
- Another stash of money?

250
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,770
- No, um.

251
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,707
Its, its a little girl.

252
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,796
- What?

253
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,777
- Well, um, I mean --

254
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,600
- What is that?

255
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,969
- Its the ashes
of a little girl.

256
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,950
- Where did it come from?

257
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,973
- I just found it,
I don't know what

258
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:29,918
to do with it.

259
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,044
- Well, who knows?
I guess we have to

260
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,025
do something about it.

261
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,394
- Its someone's child.

262
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,903
- Hi, this is Tom Bear
at the East Side

263
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,659
Recieving Center.

264
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,661
We found something
in our donations today

265
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,302
that we are unsure of
what to do with.

266
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,869
- Well, it appears to be
a cremation urn with

267
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,009
a person's remains in it.

268
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,609
Yes. Ashes.

269
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,054
Oh.

270
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,917
Oh, okay.

271
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,531
Hi, Mr. Bradshaw,
this is --

272
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,900
Oh, I see.

273
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,668
Okay.

274
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,772
Thank you very much.

275
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,733
They say we should
contact the police

276
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,034
and let them know

277
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,015
and wait to see
if someone comes to claim it.

278
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,442
- Where,
where do we keep it?

279
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,713
- I suppose you could
put it just right there.

280
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,180
If it were donated
on accident

281
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,922
then the owner
will track it down.

282
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,417
They probably just
don't realize

283
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,396
what they did.

284
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,766
I'll call the police
and report it.

285
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,370
I'll tell them.

286
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,163
- Hey, this is Brian.
Leave me a message.

287
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,390
- Hey, where are you?

288
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,866
Why aren't you
calling me back?

289
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,226
- Hi, this is Brian...

290
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,258
- Have a nice day.

291
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,627
People I swear...

292
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,263
Honey, are you okay?

293
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,286
You look terrible.

294
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,097
- I'm okay, I didn't
sleep very well last night.

295
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,325
Um, do you know what
the story is with

296
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,306
the new dog in pod 14?

297
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,373
- Oh, the poor thing.

298
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,697
Someone just dumped him
here Sunday night.

299
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,109
Tied up to
the front door.

300
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,008
He's in bad shape.

301
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,113
Are you sure
you're okay?

302
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,384
I don't know.

303
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,123
I love you so much.

304
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,528
- I'm excited to meet
your grandma.

305
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,100
- Yeah, she's excited
to meet you, too.

306
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,270
Wait...

307
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,969
Isn't she...
I can't remember if...

308
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,639
- The phone's ringing...

309
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,586
Aren't you going
to answer it?

310
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,289
Yeah.
Where is the phone?

311
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,550
Where's the phone?

312
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,387
Where are my pants?

313
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,506
- Hello?

314
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,141
- Eli...

315
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,804
The phone. Do you
wanna get it?

316
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,248
- What?

317
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,173
- The telephone. I
think its Manforce,

318
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,312
do you want to get it?

319
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,118
- Yeah, hold on.

320
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,482
- The company is called
Metro Estate Movers

321
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,985
and their office is at:

322
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,553
822 Southeast Water
Street.

323
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,487
Your contact
there is Noel.

324
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,055
- Okay. Noel.

325
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,002
822 Southeast Water.

326
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,458
Alright, I'll head
right over.

327
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,060
- Have a good
day at work!

328
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,041
- Thank you.

- Man, with all
this temping

333
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,507
its almost like
you have a real job.

334
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,078
- Yeah and it
totally sucks, too.

335
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,010
- Aw. So much for
your theory

336
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,991
of the unemployed
blissful life style.

337
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,014
- Yeah, well these
student loan people

338
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,255
are starting to circle
like sharks.

339
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,117
Its starting to look
like I might

340
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,352
need to do something
with my life.

341
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,491
- Like temping?

342
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,157
- That's harsh, Aubrey.

343
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,634
No, I want to be a
subtitute teacher.

344
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,202
But I can't get my
teaching certificate

345
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,695
until I get my degree.

346
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,096
I can't go back
to school until

347
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,303
I get this debt
payed off.

348
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,366
- Sounds like a
viscious cycle.

349
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,402
- Totally.

350
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,169
- If only Chloey
would get me a

351
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,438
production assistant job
on one of her film shoots.

352
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,672
- Wouldn't that go
against your

353
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,107
anti-corporate stance?

354
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,341
After all the crap
you've given me

355
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,643
about working for the
evil corporate

356
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,577
media machine?

357
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,345
- These debt collectors
are making me

358
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,654
rethink the whole
anti-corporate thing.

359
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,383
Or...

360
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,617
Maybe I can just
work on commercials

361
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,596
for bikes.

362
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,154
Or community gardening
centers or something.

363
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,155
- Yeah...

364
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,499
When's the last time
you saw a community

365
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,536
gardening commercial?

366
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,359
- Well, even if
they made those

367
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,661
I doubt they'd be
the jobs that pay

368
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,606
20 bucks an hour

369
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,363
What am I saying?

370
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,310
As if I'll ever make
20 bucks an hour.

371
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,369
Shit, now watch...
I'm gonna be late

372
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,407
for my 9-dollar-an-hour
furniture moving job.

373
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,041
- Hey, its your turn
to take out the

374
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,375
recyclables this week.

375
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,144
And I should have
the bills figured out

376
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,112
in the next day or two.

377
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,413
And tell mystery
roommate if you

378
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,552
see her too.

379
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,665
Oh nice.
Good work.

380
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,287
- Dude, I've got money
to lose. Absolutely.

381
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,444
Correction, I have
money to win.

382
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,423
Thank you very much.

383
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,679
- Is this Metro State Movers?

384
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,318
- Yeah, just hang on
for a minute.

385
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,994
Yeah, I'm game if
you are!

386
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,694
Yeah, I got chips

387
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,500
No, actual betting chips.

388
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,165
I'll bring some doritos,
too. I don't care. Fuck it.

389
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,796
Chips and chicks man,
that's what I'm telling you.

390
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,276
Beer and bitches.
Can't go wrong.

391
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,246
- Hey, is this a
good place to park?

392
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,514
- Sure

393
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,009
- What's wrong with that?

394
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,308
I don't care how
old they are --

395
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,617
alright, that's a lie,
nevermind...

396
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,082
Alright man, I'll
call you back.

397
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,381
Yeah, Hall & Oates
just showed up.

398
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,259
Yeah, I'll call
you back. Later.

399
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,192
Classic.

400
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:23,687
Let's go.

401
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,122
You're driving, you
have a license, right?

402
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:25,658
- Yeah

403
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,138
Alright ladies, file in.

404
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,266
- Yeah?
Come in.

405
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,270
- Hi Mr. Bear. I'm
sorry to bother you, but

406
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,072
has anyone called
about the urn?

407
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,563
No, I haven't
heard anything yet, but

408
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,531
I talked to someone
at the police department

409
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,300
and they put a
notice in their

410
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,746
lost and found department.

411
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,849
So I'm sure someone
will call soon.

412
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,620
- What will we do if
no one comes for it?

413
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,743
- I don't think you
have to worry yourself

414
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,848
about that.

415
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,359
Its been reported.

416
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,110
Alright ladies, here's
the deal -

417
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,540
We're going to clear
everything out of this

418
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,542
house today.

419
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,380
And we're gonna
do it in two stages.

420
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,512
First, I'm going to
go through everything

421
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,459
and mark all the
good stuff with a sticker.

422
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,717
This is the stuff
we're going to keep.

423
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,693
It should be
packed up carefully.

424
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,254
Once we have the
good stuff packed up,

425
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,322
we'll get the rest
of the shit loaded

426
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,734
and get the fuck
out of here.

427
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,458
There are boxes
and packing supplies

428
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,859
in the back of
the truck, so why don't

429
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,136
you guys open it up,
and bring that stuff in.

430
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:45,996
K?

431
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,698
Then go ahead and
get that piece of shit

432
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:48,939
out of here.

433
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,276
- Whoa, dude.

434
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,877
Shouldn't we warm
up or something

435
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,186
before we lift this?

436
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,348
- Come on, princess.
We got all day

437
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,589
to warm up.

438
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,695
- Alright

439
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,841
- So how long you been
working with this guy?

440
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,378
- Well, I got there two
minutes before you, so

441
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,178
- So you're with Manforce?

442
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,308
Well, I hate to think
of it in terms of

443
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,617
being "with" Manforce, but

444
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,511
yeah, that's who called
me this morning

445
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,679
and turned me on
to this englightening

446
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,852
experience.

447
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,395
- Oh yeah?
Whatever, dude.

448
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,864
Whenever you're ready there,
we can do this.

449
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,192
- My name's Eli,
by the way.

450
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:47,736
- Dale.

451
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,330
- Pleasure

452
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,231
- So what do we
do with this stuff?

453
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,212
- Either throw it away,
or give it to charity.

454
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,614
If its not obviously
trash,

455
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,903
put it in a box

456
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,884
and write "donation" on it.

457
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,509
- Okay, and the
dirty dishes...

458
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,610
I mean, do you
want to wash them

459
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,677
or throw them out?

460
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,612
- No. Fuck.

461
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,480
Just throw them in
the donation box.

462
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,782
They don't care
if its dirty.

463
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,050
Besides, they hire
retarded people to

464
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:13,722
clean this stuff.

465
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,332
Don't throw anything
away you don't have to.

466
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,734
It costs money to
take shit to the dump.

467
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,031
But donating shit to
charity is tax deductible

468
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,795
- So what's the deal?
Who left all this

469
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,896
stuff here anyway?

470
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,877
- Some old lady's house
who just died.

471
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,873
Daughter lives in LA
and doesn't have time

472
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,038
to deal with it.

473
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,716
What about stufi
with red stickers then?

474
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,839
I sell them.

475
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,411
On ebay.
I make a killing.

476
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,513
I don't make dick
on the furniture removal.

477
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,479
I underbid everyone
else, just so I can

478
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,618
get to the stuff first.

479
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,582
- So you're the reason
there's nothing cool

480
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,960
at the thrift stores
any more?

481
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,287
So...

482
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,022
Why do you work
temp labor jobs?

483
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,658
I mean, I've never
been able to figure

484
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,263
out why anybody
would want to do this.

485
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,536
- I don't know.

486
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,063
I think I've been
having a hard time

487
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,065
committing to anything.

488
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,879
- Shit, I know how
that is.

489
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,649
But with me -
its women

490
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,840
There's just too
many of them.

491
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,720
Probably one of them now.

492
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:13,949
This dipshit...

493
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,653
What's up dickweed?

494
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,954
Haha, no, man I'm
moving a house today

495
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,865
Yeah, man, totally
bummed.

496
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,532
Hey sounds good,
bring the babes.

497
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,631
Bitches and hoes,
you know how I roll.

498
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:29,996
Oh nice!

499
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,962
Dude, I just found
the old lady's

500
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,340
liquor cabinet.

501
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,499
Looks like this is
going to be a

502
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,774
fun weekend.

503
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,382
Hey, hand me
one of those boxes.

504
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,386
Hell yeah, but I ain't
sharing with you bitch.

505
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,487
Yeah, because you're
a fucking lightweight?

506
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,886
Haha

507
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,026
Yeah, keep dreaming.

508
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,759
Damn, I think granny
liked drinking, huh?

509
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,922
Fucking alcoholic bitch.

510
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,493
Good for her.

511
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,446
Alright, leave this here.
Don't touch it.

512
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,702
Start cleaning out
the fridge, just

513
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,114
throw everything in
a big trashbag

514
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,552
I'm going to start going
through this bitch's clothes

515
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,181
Start working on the
bathroom when you're

516
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,354
done with the fridge.

517
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,990
Don't you touch
that fucking liquor.

518
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,654
I don't want that
shit on my truck.

519
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,253
Just leave it on
the curb.

520
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,633
Where's your little
boyfriend?

521
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:45,660
Huh?

522
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,290
- That other dude, is
he inside taking a shit

523
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,497
or something?

524
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:49,959
- I don't know, I
thought he was out

525
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,665
here on the truck.

526
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,228
- That shithead.

527
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,970
He's probably inside
jerking off or something.

528
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,034
YO!

529
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,808
Dude, we got work
to do, what the fuck!

530
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,120
Dude, you better not be
sleeping on the job.

531
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,044
- I think his name's Dale.

532
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,581
I don't give a flying fuck!

533
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,896
Oh, God fucking damnit!

534
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,152
Goddamn Fuck.

535
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,030
Jesus Fucking Christ!

536
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,602
Dale, where the fuck
are you?

537
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,764
Dale!

538
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:27,873
Fuck!

539
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,714
Fucking prick.

540
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,647
Dale, where the fuck
are you?

541
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,990
Jesus titty fucking Christ!

542
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,235
Fucking damnit!

543
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,366
Dale, where the fuck
are you?

544
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,369
God!

545
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,280
I'm not paying shit,
your man just

546
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,988
stole my property
and vanished.

547
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,652
No, I didn't give
it to him, he just

548
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,291
snuck off with a
box full of liquor.

549
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,169
I don't know where
the hell he went!

550
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,638
Manforce, more like
shitforce.

551
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,329
Do you have
anyone working there

552
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,900
who's not a
complete fuck up?

553
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,413
I have no problem
coming down there right now.

554
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,005
No, fuck you!

555
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:39,182
- Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely

556
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,163
and you never
come around

557
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:46,422
- Every now and then
I get a little bit tired

558
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,926
listening to the sound
of my tears

559
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,595
Every now and then
I get a little bit

560
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,131
nen/ous that the
best of all the years

561
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,975
have gone by.

562
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,169
Every now and then
I get a little bit

563
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,980
terrified and then I see
the look in your eyes.

564
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,255
Every now and then
I fall apart.

565
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,955
Every now and then
I fall apart

566
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,299
and I need you
more tonight

567
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,102
yeah, I need you more
than ever.

568
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,864
If you only
hold me tight

569
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:29,373
we'll be holding
on forever.

570
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,181
Yeah, we'll always be
making it right

571
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,215
we can never be
wrong

572
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,141
together we can make
it to the end

573
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,942
of the line

574
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,711
Your love is like
a shadow on me

575
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,521
all the time

576
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,022
Need you tonight.

577
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,097
Always in the dark,

578
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,287
we're living in a powder
cake and giving off

579
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,089
sparks

580
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,070
I really need you tonight.

581
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:59,233
Forever's going to start
tonight...

582
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,664
Forever's going to start to...

583
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:05,668
Once upon a time
I was falling in love

584
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:09,242
Now I'm only falling
apart...

585
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:16,420
Nothing I can do,
a total eclipse of the heart

586
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,708
- Judy, hey,
Its Katrina

587
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,689
I'm looking at today's
paperwork and it says

588
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,758
that Buster is on
the unadoptable list.

589
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,827
Is this a mistake?

590
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,430
Yeah, dog C57

591
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,556
But it must be a mistake.

592
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,558
Buster's the sweetest
dog here.

593
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,232
Everybody loves Buster.

594
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,197
I know, I know...
Really,

595
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,233
Buster's different.

596
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,214
He really is the
best dog here.

597
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,380
Please you have to
take him off the list.

598
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,043
Fine.

599
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,059
We have to get
you adopted Buster.

600
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,490
- Now I don't know
how much longer

601
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,697
I can handle this
temping.

602
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,306
Why don't you get
me a PA job?

603
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,463
I mean it seems a
whole lot like temping

604
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,307
just better pay and
less crazy people.

605
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,413
- I've told you you need
a car to be a PA.

606
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,236
- And I have Otis's car

607
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,505
- Yeah, I can't really
imagine a producer

608
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,574
being impressed with a
PA who's driving

609
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,309
his grandpa around
everywhere.

610
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,290
Or step-grandpa,
whatever he is...

611
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,179
Being a PA is
a lot of work

612
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,523
Its really stressful.

613
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,549
If there's one thing
you've made clear

614
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,451
its that you don't
like working.

615
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,432
- Well, I suppose I
can't argue with that.

616
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,255
I still think this
whole "have to

617
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,792
have a car" thing
is kind of fascist, though

618
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,326
Y'know I just need
to make some money

619
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,601
so I can go back
to school

620
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,765
This working stufi
is killing me.

621
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,600
So where's Aubrey?

622
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,468
I know you didn't
plan this meal for me.

623
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,914
We got in a
big fight last night.

624
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,505
And now she's
giving me the silent

625
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,507
treatment.

626
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:05,942
She totally freaked
out about my

627
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,217
new Myspace persona.

628
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,352
- Don't you guys have
like 80 of those?

629
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,547
- This one got her
really jealous

630
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,615
for some reason.

631
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,816
You know how
irrational she gets

632
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:14,557
sometimes.

633
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,919
I've been
corresponding with this

634
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,454
one particular guy
who's like a

635
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,789
45-year-old
high school teacher

636
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,394
and he thinks I'm
one of his students.

637
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,326
- Yeah, see Chloey,
that is a little

638
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:23,930
fucked up.

639
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,461
- I know but

640
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,229
its like I've gotten
addicted to performing

641
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,141
under a fake persona.

642
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,633
When I shed
my identity I

643
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,578
can do anything.

644
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,715
- Yeah, actually, I
know how that goes.

645
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,671
But for me its
karaoke.

646
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,506
Diamond Dave on
the mic.

647
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,487
Here I am...

648
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,589
Rock you like a hurricane

649
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,520
- When's the last time
you actually sang karaoke?

650
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,353
Excluding all the times
that you practice

651
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,687
in your bedroom, of course.

652
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,356
- What?

653
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,890
Are you stoned or
something? I do not

654
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,492
practice karaoke in my
bedroom.

655
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,728
- Whatever. I guess
you just get so

656
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,496
swept up by the
emotional power of

657
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,764
Total Eclipse of the
Hean

658
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,265
you don't realize you're
belting it out at

659
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,567
the top of your lungs.

660
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,235
- Total Eclipse of the
Heart is one of

661
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,570
the most underrated
songs of all time.

662
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,005
- I know, I know.

663
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,606
But seriously when
is the last time

664
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,382
you actually went out
and sang karaoke?

665
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,276
I go out. I go out
and do karaoke

666
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,813
all the time.

667
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,480
Remember that night
at the Alibi

668
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,324
when those girls tried
to depants me?

669
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,484
I had the whole
place singing along.

670
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,953
- Yeah, that was a
good night for you.

671
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,955
But it was like
two years ago.

672
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,556
Have you actually
sang karaoke

673
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:28,891
since then? Publicly?

674
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,026
- Well, you know,
I don't want to

675
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,494
wear out my audience
or anything.

676
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:32,962
- Oh, yes. I can
definitely see the

677
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,943
danger in that.

678
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,775
- I'm sorry to bother
you, Mr. Bear, but

679
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,584
Has there been
any calls about Kelly?

680
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,452
'Kelly?

681
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,290
- Well, um, you
know, the urn.

682
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,918
The ashes of the
little girl.

683
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,328
- Oh. No, no
one's called.

684
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,821
You know, its
possible the owner

685
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,267
passed away.

686
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,059
I wouldn't worry
yourself about it.

687
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,040
Its been reported, so

688
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,242
let headquarters deal
with it.

689
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,402
HS H01 OUT COFICGTFI.

690
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,406
- Yes, Mr. Bear.

691
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,459
Crap

692
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,051
- That looks so good
on you.

693
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:36,986
- You like it?

694
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,694
- Oh, I love it.

695
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,129
- I saw Brian today
with his new girlfriend.

696
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,909
This all happened so fast.

697
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,079
I have to stop
checking his e-mail.

698
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:33,936
I need to think
of something else

699
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,439
and just get my
mind off this.

700
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,109
I need to work
on my audition video.

701
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,246
I need to stay
focused on that.

702
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,755
- I found this sign
for a missing urn

703
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,758
that someone at the
thrift store found

704
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,034
At first I thought
it was kind of funny

705
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,708
but now I just think
its really sad...

706
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,145
I wonder how many
urns get lost.

707
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,504
- I guess an urn
is like a family

708
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,245
heirloom or something.

709
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,540
But I wouldn't want
something like that

710
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,713
handed down to me.

711
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,977
Its a lot of
responsibility having

712
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,286
an urn.

713
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,147
You can't just throw
it away or

714
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,718
sell it at a garage
sale or something

715
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,025
Maybe that's what
happened with this one.

716
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,654
Maybe it was too
much for someone

717
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,889
and it got too
sad, and they had

718
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:27,732
to push it away.

719
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:29,733
I don't know

720
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:33,796
It'd be sad
to be the person

721
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:34,571
in there.

722
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,933
Like some sad ghost
that nobody wanted

723
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,106
around any more.

724
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,676
Kind of like the
dogs on the

725
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:43,779
unadoptable list.

726
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,265
OK,
Hold on a second.

727
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,320
Hey!
Wake Up!

728
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,321
I got a
job for you.

729
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,302
A P.A. job.

730
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,136
- What time is it?

731
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,204
- I got a P.A.
job for you

732
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,374
Are you available
tomorrow?

733
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,507
Just say "yes."

734
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,542
- Available?

735
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:30,198
Yeah, sure...

736
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,007
OK. I think
he can do it.

737
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,334
I'll fill him in
and call you back.

738
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:32,904
Alright, bye.

739
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,503
OK, check
it out dude...

740
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,482
I got the
perfect P.A. job

741
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:36,175
for you.

742
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:37,408
We're shooting
a commercial

743
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:38,178
on the coast,
on Friday

744
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:38,974
on the beach,

745
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,142
and the director
just realized

746
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:41,143
that the look
of the beach

747
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,144
is going to
change all day

748
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:43,055
as the tide
comes in.

749
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,090
So we need
someone to go

750
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,057
out there and
get footage of it

751
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,349
at various times
throughout the day

752
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,584
and then bring
the tapes back

753
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,563
so he can
see it.

754
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,827
- OK, now...
What is it?

755
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,197
- Sounds perfect, right?

756
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,428
You can even
bring Otis along!

757
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,963
He can keep
you company.

758
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,064
- OK, you want me
to drive out to

759
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,169
the coast, and
videotape a beach

760
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:03,972
all day?

761
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,512
- Yeah. A specific
beach. But, yeah.

762
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:07,269
- And I get paid
to do this?

763
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,137
- Yep. Standard rate.
Two hundred a day.

764
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,205
- Two Hundred bucks?

765
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,306
- Yeah. And they'll
even give you

766
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,307
gas money. And
you can use

767
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:13,408
my camera.

768
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,218
- OK... So what's the
commercial about?

769
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,478
Some life insurance
company...

770
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:17,457
It's just going to
be like a typical

771
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,151
American family hanging
out on the beach

772
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,549
while some voiceover
talks about

773
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,585
protecting the ones
you love.

774
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,363
- Whoa...

775
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,620
This sounds like
the sort of

776
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,888
fucked up shit I'm
totally qualified to do.

777
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:27,959
- OK. good!

778
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,091
But this is for
real, man.

779
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:29,925
You can't
mess around.

780
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:30,904
It's my ass
on the line.

781
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,194
You've got to
be out there

782
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,299
really early.
Like 7:00 a.m.

783
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,529
Come back when
the sun sets,

784
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:35,338
and give me
the tapes.

785
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,205
- OK.

786
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,165
- Are you
positive you can

787
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:37,974
get Otis' car?

788
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,069
- Yeah. Probably.

789
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,270
I mean it's not
like he has

790
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:41,937
anything else
going on. So...

791
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,205
OK. I've got
to go...

792
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,206
I'll see you
tonight,

793
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,015
and I'll give
you my camera.

794
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:45,518
- OK, cool.

795
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,212
- OK.

796
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,255
Hello, this is Chloe.

the phone...

01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,174

Otis...

Otis. It's me, Eli...

805
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,495
You left your front
door unlocked again.

Otis?

Otis?

Hey.

01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,281
Well, hello there

814
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,387
- What are you
doing back here?

- Well I was doing
some recording

01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,494
and this is the
quietest place

817
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,655
in the house.

818
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,700
- Cool. What are
you recording?

819
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,932
- I was doing a
narration for the

820
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:09,594
soap film.

821
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,672
- Oh, cool...

822
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,536
- Yeah.

823
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,573
You uhh,

824
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,341
want to go
in the kitchen?

825
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,240
- Sure.

826
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,373
- Look at
these images

827
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,004
that I,

828
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,083
that I recorded
yesterday.

829
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:23,416
They're amazing.

830
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,553
- Man...

831
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,519
- You know, the
world of soap...

832
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:30,350
It's...

833
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,426
It's incredible.

834
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,591
That there are
whole worlds

835
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,561
inside there.

836
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,161
That. That one there...

837
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,404
It's no bigger
than a fingernail.

838
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,007
- Otis, it's really,
really cool.

839
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,377
It looks great.

840
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,048
- So Katrina...

841
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:58,542
Why do you
want to be

842
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,654
on a reality
television show?

843
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,320
Well...

844
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:03,254
I guess when
you're on

845
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:04,620
a reality T.V. show.

846
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:05,747
It just seems like

847
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,489
everything is more important

848
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,996
When somebody has a
breakdown it's really

849
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,032
sad and dramatic.

850
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,360
And everybody feels
really bad for the person

851
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,472
When you have a
breakdown by yourself

852
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,508
it's just sad.

853
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,977
No one really notices

854
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,379
OF cares

855
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,238
I hear you've been
going through

856
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,616
a difficult breakup

857
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,255
Would you like
to talk about that?

858
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,196
It's been the worst
experience of my life.

859
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,593
I went from being
totally in love

860
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,632
to toally heartbroken

861
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,701
in a matter
of hours.

862
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,138
I caught him
cheating on me.

863
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,631
And how did
you catch him

864
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,612
cheating on you?

865
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,644
I know the password
to his email account

866
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:07,475
I figured it out
by reading emails

867
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,456
that he sent to
his best friend.

868
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,194
He has the same
password for everything.

869
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:16,028
His emails, his MySpace,

870
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,265
his bank account.

871
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,836
I figured it out
a long time ago,

872
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,069
but

873
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,102
I didn't make
it a habit

874
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,140
of spying on him.

875
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,729
Just a couple
times when he

876
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,676
was acting strange.

877
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,814
I guess I never
really did trust him.

878
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,254
And are you still
spying on him?

879
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,590
Yeah...

880
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,628
I guess so.

881
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,694
I know I shouldn't be

882
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,832
but I can't help it.

883
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,429
Why?

884
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,139
What is it that
you hope to find?

885
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,845
I guess I just want
to find some indiction

886
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,081
that he misses me,

887
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:09,138
that he feels bad
and guilty,

888
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,218
and that he thinks he
made a mistake.

889
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,325
And is that what
you've found?

890
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,367
No.

891
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,103
It's been the
exact opposite.

892
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:30,701
It's like,

893
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,140
being able to read
somebody's mind,

894
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,130
but only finding out
things that you

895
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,111
wish you didn't
know about.

896
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,649
What is it that you
want to do with your life?

897
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,126
Right now I just want
to get out of my head.

898
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,235
I want to turn
these thoughts off.

899
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,495
I can't stop
thinking about this.

900
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,743
This is driving me crazy.

901
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,247
And is that why

902
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,288
you want to be on
a reality T.V. show?

903
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,439
- Here we are, on
the beach. 7:30 a.m.

904
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,911
Cold and misty here,
on the beach.

905
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,491
[Turns off camera.]

906
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,008
Whew...

907
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,372
It's chilly
out there man.

908
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,415
- I bet it is.

909
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,914
- OK, so if I have
to go out there

910
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,452
every half hour...

911
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,708
That basically means,

912
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,689
8:05 I'll go back out.

913
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,326
- You know, your
grandma and I

914
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,587
came here once.

915
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,993
Well, a whole bunch
of us did,

916
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,053
from the center.

917
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,721
That was when they
were doing those,

918
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,700
those "field trips."

919
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,497
- Wait, you came to
this exact spot?

920
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:43,569
- Yeah.

921
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,739
I remember...
I remember that rock.

922
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:47,500
- Which one? The big one?

923
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:47,973
- Yeah.

924
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,764
- Huh. You know, I
think I actually

925
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:51,599
I think I remember
her talking about that.

926
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,510
That trip.

927
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,309
- She loved to go
out in the world.

928
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,383
- Oh she loved it.
Any kind of road trip...

929
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,610
- Yeah.

930
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,014
- She was fun.

931
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,549
You look nice today, Otis.

932
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,593
That's a great suit
you have on there.

933
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,762
- Oh, well...

934
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,831
[Chuckle] Thank you, Eli.

935
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:13,527
I thought I should

936
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,336
look my best.

937
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,571
- So what's this?

938
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,612
- Oh it's the, uhh...

939
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,008
It's the soap film.

940
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:28,514
- Oh, yeah...

941
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:29,675
- So you finished it?

942
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,847
[Laughs to himself]

943
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,921
- I don't know whether
it'll ever be finished,

944
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,956
but uhh, that's the sample.

945
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,525
- Cool.

946
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,356
- I was wondering...

947
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,759
Do you think
we could...

948
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:46,855
give that to one of
the people from the

949
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:47,857
film company?

950
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,058
Oh...

951
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,868
Y'know, its just
us today.

952
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:54,896
Yeah, they're coming
out on Friday to

953
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,531
do the commercial,
but its just you

954
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,977
and me today.

955
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,368
You know, I could
give that to Chloey though

956
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,349
and maybe she can
pass it on to them.

957
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:03,977
.OkaV-

958
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,079
- Is that why you got
all dressed up today, then?

959
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,519
- No, no...

960
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:14,048
-ls Chloey your
girlfriend?

961
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,996
- No, nope.
She's ah...

962
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,466
She's my roommate.

963
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:21,934
She got me
this job though.

964
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,901
We're just friends.

965
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:26,667
- Do you uh...

966
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,864
Do you have a
girlfriend now?

967
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,845
- No, I don't.

968
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,569
"Why not?

969
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,371
- Well, I...
y'know...

970
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,940
I think its just...
Its hard to meet people.

971
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,579
Y'know?

972
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,777
And I have a
bad habit of

973
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,758
falling in love
with lesbians.

974
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,424
Lesbians?

975
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:52,398
- Yeah. You know,
lesbians, like, um

976
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,035
women who like
other women.

977
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,568
- Oh, right. Right.
Lesbians.

978
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,612
- How about you?

979
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,669
Any new love interests?

980
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,411
- Oh...

981
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,847

01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:56,537
I want him to see
me moving on

1145
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,176
and having fun.

1146
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,947
- What's that on her head?

1147
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,112
[Crowd laughs]

1148
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,917
- And maybe I want
him to be jealous.

1149
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:04,311
I don't know.
I don't want him to

1150
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,620
completely forget about me.

1151
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,349
OK.

1152
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,184
Here is an example

1153
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:13,098
of a video that
is very heartfelt,

1154
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,494
but might not be

1155
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:18,037
best suited for
an audition tape.

Katrina,

1157
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:23,134
I'd really like to see what
you could come up with,

1158
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,404
with one of our

1159
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,446
professional
videographers.

1160
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,648
We really want
to figure out

1161
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,411
what you're all about.

1162
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:31,605
OK?

1163
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:33,586
Like, what drives Katrina?

1164
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,382
Alright?

1165
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:37,021
Plus I think you could
use a little bit of help

1166
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,615
with makeup and wardrobe,

1167
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,093
just to bring out
your inner beauty. OK?

1168
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:45,157
But uhh, I love the
crazy bear hat

1169
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,200
that you were wearing,
though.

1170
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:49,490
I mean, where on Earth
did you find that, huh?

OK, now we're getting
close to lunchtime

1174
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,431
so what I want to do
now is share with you

1175
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,433
some information about
becoming a member

1176
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,035

1177

And I also want to talk
to you about

1178
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,176
a special deal that
you won't find listed

1179
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,446
on these sheets.

1180
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:09,376
We decided that, today
only, we're going to

1181

all for the phenomenally
ridiculous price of

1185
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,234
One hundred and
ninety nine dollars.

1186
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,336
OK. We take all major
credit cards

1187
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,268
and we get
started today.

Yeah.

1189
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,661
- Are we going to
actually audition for

1190
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,263
any shows today?

1191
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:31,098
- That's the
beauty of it.

1192
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,666
When you sign
up with us

1193
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,135
you're actually
auditioning for

01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:35,603
several shows at once.

1195
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:36,604
OK?

1196
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,606
And I personally make sure

1197
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:39,740
that your information

1198

pay for this stuff first?

1201
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,281
- Well, think about it
like you're making

1202
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,649
an investment
in your future.

1203

Kind of like
going to college.

1204
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,632
OK. So once you
fill out your forms

1205

give them back
to us,

is that woman
spreading ashes?

She is, look.

want to go.
