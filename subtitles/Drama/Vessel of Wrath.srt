00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,813

my son...</i>

3
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,750
<i>...who defeated the Kraken
and saved humanity.</i>

4

a place to rule at my side.</i>

<i>But Perseus...</i>

6
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:04,062
<i>...was strong-willed
and chose a different path.</i>

7
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,459

9

14

Go on. I'll tie this off.

15
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,976
Good catch today, Dad.

16
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,703
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it myself.

17

Hey, Clea.
I have a confession to make.

22
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,711
I, uh, needed him for chores
so he skipped studying.

23

27
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,355
He's like his father.
A strong-willed boy.

28
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,913
You just passing through?

29
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,221
No.

30
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,483
I need your help, Perseus.

31
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,801
You're the great god Zeus.
You don't need my help.

32
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,886
There is a calamity coming.

33
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,110
It will affect us all.
Gods and men.

34
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,760
- The humans may have stopped praying to us...
- With good reason.

35
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,502
...but there are consequences.

36
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,865
Without prayer,
we gods lose our power.

37
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,813
When our power leaves us,
all our work comes undone. All of it.

<font color="#ffc6ff">[RUMBLING]</font>

39
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,172
The walls of Tartarus are falling.

40
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:42,192
It is emptying all its demons onto
the earth. The first are already here.

41
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,559
If our power diminishes much further,
we gods will become mortal.

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,347
We will die and Kronos himself
will escape.

43
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,567
It will mean chaos.
The end of the world.

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,647
What am I meant to do?

45
00:03:58,337 --> 00:03:59,814
This is business for gods.

46
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,993
We need all our children now.

47
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:06,111
Perhaps,
together we can remedy this.

48
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,071
But we need every shred of power,
Perseus.

49
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,030
I will never leave my son.

50
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,052
I know your heart better
than you know it yourself.

51
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,768
You believe your human half
makes you unworthy to join us.

52
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,133
You will learn someday that
being half-human...

53
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,564
...makes you stronger than a god,
not weaker.

54
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,585
I think you should go.

55
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,660

I'm gonna need a boat,
your fastest boat.

315
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,446
The Fallen One lives
far across the ocean.

316
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,094
Where?

317
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:14,054
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I'll show you.

318
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,746
Your ship awaits.

319

333

Heh, heh.

And who's Hephaestus?

335
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,842
Hephaestus was the god
that made Poseidon's trident...

336
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,082
...Hades' pitchfork...

337
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,697
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.

338
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,786

the weapon the gods used...</i>

341
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,627
But Hephaestus lives on the
island of Kail. Ha-ha-ha.

342
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,817
Which no one has ever found.
