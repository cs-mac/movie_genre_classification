1
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,619
You gotta put the fuel
in first, dickhead!

2
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,579
Uh, fuel from the lawnmower.

3
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,259
- Oh, sweet.
- Here's a better one.

4
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,579
Fuckin' fuel, fuel, fuel.
Come on, Bug.

5
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,321
Pour it in. Come on, guys.

6
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,218
Where's the rag?
Where's the rag?

7
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,658
Give me that.

8
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,578
And be careful, now, Bug.

9
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,367
Light it up.

10
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:12,698
Oh! Here we go, boys!
Here we go!

11
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,567
Come on, give it here.

12
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:21,647
Oh! Mad bastard!

13
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,881
Come on, Bullet! Come on!

14
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:50,204
Gotcha!

15
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:02,735
Bullet! Jeez, boy!
What were you thinking?

16
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,319
Eh?

17
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,763
Uncle Texas!

18
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:14,734
What the hell? What's going on?

19
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,934
Bullet! It WAS you! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?!

20
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,235
- What do you care?
- What?!

21
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:25,798
What... what's happening?
What's... what's going on?

22
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:29,084
You stink.

23
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:32,133
Nella.

24
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,373
Nella, give me back
my fuckin' cigarettes, hey?

25
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:36,453
Fuck off, you mob!

26
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,481
My son could be going to jail!

27
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:43,812
Uncle Tex...

28
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,158
what's gonna happen
to my baby?

29
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:04,881
 Got to find a place
to hide my head

30
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:12,671
 A shady billabong

31
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:20,553
 Crash out on a cyclone bed

32
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:28,354
 Maybe time will right the wrongs

33
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:36,031
 But nothing really matters

34
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,669
 In the season of the lullin'

35
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,675
 Yeah, nothing really matters

36
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:59,588
 When you're rolling on the run

37
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,551
 Drifting off in dreamland

38
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:15,630
 Cops and journos on my trail

39
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:23,112
 Trying to pin me down
with slander

40
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:31,349
 Trying to haul me off to jail

41
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:38,867
 But nothing really matters

42
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:46,664
 In the season of the lullin'

43
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:54,865
 No, nothing really matters

44
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:02,309
 When you're rolling on the run. 

45
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:24,594
When you're rolling on the run.

46
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,789
Raise your arms.

47
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,584
Turn around.

48
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,600
What's this, then?

49
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,480
Well, what do you reckon it is?

50
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,064
You know the rules.

51
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:17,428
Fuckin' men in uniform, unna?

52
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:26,063
Your brother's waiting.

53
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,749
He's my blood, bro.

54
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,145
Just like you.

55
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,019
Mum won't even let him talk to me.

56
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,538
They brought him in here
to visit you, or what?

57
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,718
What do you reckon?

58
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:52,780
Mum and Candy grow him up now.

59
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,865
They probably tell him his dad's dead.

60
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:03,317
- So, how old's yours now?
- My what?

61
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,117
I thought you went up there
to visit him.

62
00:07:05,118 --> 00:07:08,437
Yeah. I was gonna.
But it's a long fuckin' way.

63
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:11,637
I've just got one thing to say to you.

64
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:13,301
Don't leave it too late, Thomas.

65
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:18,860
Here.

66
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,636
I made it myself.

67
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,996
Woodwork class.

68
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:27,716
Yeah, well, I can see that.

69
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:31,876
It's Dylan's birthday this weekend.

70
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:34,156
He turns six.

71
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,955
Oh, no. No, bro. No way.

72
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,715
Come on, bro. Just take it to him.
He's at Mum's.

73
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:42,195
True, brother, Mum don't like me
more than she don't like you.

74
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,115
TJ. Kudda.

75
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,335
Please.

76
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,273
Shirl...

77
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,460
what's all this stuff here?

78
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:26,633
That's for that Five Rivers men's group
you wanted to start up.

79
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:28,352
What do they need?

80
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:30,698
Uh, just the infrastructure cost.

81
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:35,992
Oh... pretty much, we need...
sausages and...

82
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:38,072
- Yep.
- bread and...

83
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:40,312
butter and tomato sauce and...

84
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,832
Yeah.

85
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,112
They like an informal
environment, you know?

86
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:47,511
Just somewhere to sit down and talk
and have something to eat.

87
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,459
That's all they need.

88
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,214
How's the homework going, bub?

89
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,216
Good.

90
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,469
Won't be long, bud.

91
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,309
For fuck's sake!

92
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,769
Mum! Shithead's here.

93
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,134
- G'day, Mum.
- What do you want?

94
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,308
I've been to see Mick.

95
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,097
What do you think you're doing?

96
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,846
Don't you go bringing
your dirty business around here.

97
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,296
You know, I went to see Mick.

98
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:06,507
He made this for Dylan
for his birthday.

99
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:07,613
Solid, huh?

100
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,986
- He's got a nerve.
- What the fuck...?

101
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,605
I don't want you boys
around my grandson.

102
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,666
Come on. Mum!

103
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,250
Get!

104
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:22,176
Fuck!

105
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:34,825
- What are you guys doing?
- Nothing.

106
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:36,305
Got any drink?

107
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:38,265
- Nah, not mine.
- Nah, it's the last one.

108
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,134
Come on, give me a fuckin' drink.

109
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:44,905
What the fuck? Get the fuck off me.

110
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:47,264
I just want a fuckin' drink of beer!

111
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,451
- It's fuckin' hot out here.
- Fuckin' too bad!

112
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,464
Well, the boys are down there.
Want to go see them?

113
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,055
Yeah.

114
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:13,063
Thank you, boys, for coming.

115
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,703
You blokes had a good feed?

116
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:16,810
Yeah? That's good.

117
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:22,262
This is our first...
men's group meeting,

118
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,608
and I'd like to welcome you all here.

119
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:28,382
The reason I wanted to get this going

120
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,982
is to bring men together,
sit down and have a talk.

121
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,742
You want to talk about
marriage problem,

122
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:37,088
you know, alcohol problem,
all that sort of thing.

123
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:41,501
And this is about... making you...

124
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,101
sort of, feel a little bit important,

125
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:46,941
so you don't feel like
no-one care about you.

126
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:49,141
Well, to kick it off,

127
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:53,221
I might just sort of ask
if anyone want to say anything.

128
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,009
Any of you boys want to...

129
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,288
talk about something that...

130
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,442
that you want to get off your chest?

131
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,618
- Hey!
- Hey!

132
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:41,378
We only just started
and we've run out already.

133
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:42,803
Bring that stuff inside.

134
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:30,015
Hey! Spider! Howthe fuck are you?

135
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:31,935
Yeah, good, brother.

136
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,535
- TJ, look who's here.
- Spider.

137
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,535
- How are you going, mate?
- How are you going, bud?

138
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:37,495
- Yeah, always good, yeah.
- When did you get out?

139
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,974
- About two months.
- Solid. Staying under the radar?

140
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:42,614
They've got a tight leash on me,
the parole dogs. You get that.

141
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,174
What were you pushing in there?
Weights?

142
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:46,077
- Me best, son.
- Yeah, straight out.

143
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,134
Come on!

144
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:52,254
You've got to pay attention.
Youse are getting flogged.

145
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,934
Eh? They reckon you're the man
around here, mate.

146
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,597
I find it very hard to believe.

147
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,573
Shot!

148
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,533
- You DO want it!
- No, I don't!

149
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:04,133
You've been acting
like this all night!

150
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,133
- Get outta my fuckin' house!
- You're just a fuckin' slut!

151
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,933
What do you fuckin' think
you're doing?!

152
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,333
- Oi!
- Fuck off!

153
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,964
- Come here!
- Don't touch me!

154
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,363
Come here!

155
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,932
Don't miss that.

156
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,482
Oh! Look at that one.

157
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,612
- Just letting you catch up.
- The 50's in the wallet, Eddie.

158
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,483
The 50's in the wallet, mate.

159
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:30,531
Hey, hey, hey!
Settle down, settle down!

160
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,851
- Come on, come on!
- Hey, hey, hey! Let go!

161
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,931
Another lucky shot, mate. Jesus!

162
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:37,571
You're playing the game
of your life, mate.

163
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,171
You're playing
the game of your life.

164
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,242
Huh? You're on fire.

165
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,211
Hey! Nella! Nella!

166
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,131
Come on! Break it up!

167
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,795
You bastard!

168
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,050
You useless prick!

169
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:53,890
Fuck you! Hey?

170
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,210
TJ, what are you doin'
picking on your little mate?

171
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,316
Hey?

172
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:01,570
Fuck! TJ!

173
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:04,610
Get out of here,
you fuckin' arsehole!

174
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,520
Get out of here, you fuckin' bastard!

175
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,889
Get him! Get him off me!

176
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,809
Fuck him up, bro!

177
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,409

180
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:25,528
Uncle Texas! Uncle Texas!

181
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,208
Damien! Damien, that's enough!

182
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,888
- Uncle Texas, look here!
- Joseph, that's enough.

183
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,888
- Uncle Texas, look here...
- Nella, get back in that yard!

184
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,128
Now, you two, fuck off now!

185
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,208
Otherwise somebody's getting
locked up.

186
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,270
Get out of here. Now!

187
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:50,007
Alright, that's it. Nella!

188
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:52,927
No! No! Fuck you! Fuck you!

189
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:54,431
Fuck you, arsehole!

190
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:30,165
Keep going, boys.
Keep walking down that way.

191
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,624
You mob, get.

192
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,347
Bullet.

193
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:43,324
Get back down to my place.

194
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:46,004
You're not staying here tonight.

195
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,713
Go on.

196
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:56,603
Look, Aunty, I hate to do this to you...

197
00:16:56,604 --> 00:17:00,554
But, TJ, why do you
want to go all the way up there?

198
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:04,587
You haven't even
been there before. Hey?

199
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,202
'Cause I got fuckin' nowhere else to go.

200
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:09,282
Oh, TJ, you're such a mess.
Listen to you.

201
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:11,562
You've just gotta sit down
and sort yourself out for once.

202
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,082
Aunty, I know what I've gotta do
and I'm doing it.

203
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,522
But... Mum won't even see me,
and... I've got no money.

204
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:20,162
- TJ, TJ.
- Are you able to help me out?

205
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:23,441
Listen, TJ, I'll put
some money into your account.

206
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,281
But please be careful up there, bub.

207
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,721
Yeah, Aunty.

208
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,201
Just remember I love you

209
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:30,881
and my prayers will always be with you.

210
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,481
You know, Aunty, I love you so much.

211
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:35,272
You've always been there for me.

212
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:42,877
You got swimming today, babe?

213
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:44,666
- Yeah.
- Yep.

214
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,197
How was your night, babe?

215
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:51,476
Oh, flat out.

216
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:53,916
- Bloody chaos.
- Yep.

217
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,137
Had a big blue
at bloody Nella's place last night.

218
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,756
Stupid. It's just madness.

219
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:02,659
I wonder when that lot's gonna stop.

220
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:07,579
Knock knock!

221
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:14,075
Everybody OK?

222
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,579
Alright.

223
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:41,259
Oh.

224
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,824
Nella!

225
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,663
Hello?

226
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,462
Hello?

227
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:17,055
Who this?

228
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:22,671
Hello? Hello?

229
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:24,301
Anybody there?

230
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,258
Oh, come on! What was that?

231
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,457
Go on, son, get it.

232
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,487
Come on, bud.

233
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:28,531
Come on, Bullet.

234
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:32,214
Come on, Bullet, come. Come play.

235
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,097
What's the matter?

236
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:47,730
What's the matter, mate?

237
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:54,366
I don't want to go away
from you guys, Grandpa.

238
00:21:58,787 --> 00:22:00,705
Well...

239
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:03,973
I don't want you to go either,
mate, but... you know...

240
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:07,407
you've got to think
about what you done.

241
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:12,065
I mean, lighting fires -

242
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,854
people get locked up for that, mate.

243
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,174
You know? I mean...

244
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:25,292
You've got to take some responsibility
for your actions, you know?

245
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:32,824
Well, what's that camp gonna be like?

246
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:37,503
Two weeks out there is better
than six months in jail.

247
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:40,327
And they'll teach you how to act
a bit more like a man.

248
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:52,853
One, two, three, four...

 'Pearly Shells' and 'Old TI'

264
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:25,497
 Rattling with the spoons
late into the night

265
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,937
 Matchstick picking
on a fishing line string

266
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:30,417
 Play the melody
just to make 'em sing

267
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:33,057
 Under the mango tree

268
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:38,056

Here, last one, yeah?

275
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,443
Thank you, my boy.

276
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:18,214
You look... you're not from this country.

277
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:20,534
From down Perth way. Down south.

278
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:21,934
Jumbardu.

279
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,654

Nella.

299
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,433
Is she there?

300
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,954
Is Nella there?

301
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,387
So tell me exactly what he said now.
Exactly what happened.

302
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,488
Well, the phone rang. I answered it.

303
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:58,992
This bloke was there.

304
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,848
He was asking for you.

305
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:03,688
I told him you weren't here.

306
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,088
I said, "Who's this?"

307
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:08,568
He said, "It's TJ.

308
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:10,357
"Tell her I'm coming up".

309
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,847
And did he say where or when?

310
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:17,068
Nuh. He just said he was coming.

311
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,391
Fuck.

And what did they say?

318
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:50,605
They just reckon he coming here.

319
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:52,189
Your proper dad?

320
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:55,708
What do you reckon he'll be like?

She don't like him that much.

323
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:12,946
I wouldn't mind meeting him.

324
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:36,723
Hey.

325
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:40,033

Righto, boys. Just out here.

329
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:55,421
What, they think
we're gonna stop for them?

330
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:00,954
What the fuck is going on here?

331
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:02,354
They'd better move.

332
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:04,514
I don't think
they're gonna move!

333
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:05,914
Come on, come on!

334
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:07,234
Get out of the way!

335
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:08,514
- Come on!
- Move, move!

336
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:09,994
Jesus!

337
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:12,074
- What the fuck?
- Hang on. Pull up. Pull up!

338
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:14,713
That's Uncle Black.
What's that old bugger doing out here?

339
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:16,424
What's all that about?

340
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:22,174
Oh, here we go.
We can't fit 'em all in.

341
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:26,193
Jesus, we nearly run you mob
over. What's wrong with you?

342
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:27,953
Next time, bro.
We can't fit you all in.

343
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:29,713
You'll have to try
the next car coming there.

344
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:31,072
Hey, Uncle Black,
what you doin' here?

345
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:33,392
Trying to go home.
I want a lift to Five Rivers.

346
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:34,942
Hop in. Jump in the back.

347
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,552
Hello, my boy.
I think I know you.

348
00:31:39,553 --> 00:31:41,232
Hey.

349
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,339
You got a smoke?

350
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:59,951
They've been, sort of,
smoking ganja and drinking

351
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,551
and running amok, you know?

352
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,111
One boy there - petrol-sniffer.

353
00:32:04,112 --> 00:32:05,933
Keep an eye on that one.

354
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,470
And that other boy there with
the black shirt with that...

355
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,190
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little granny, that one.

356
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:15,950
I don't want you and Harry
to pull up on him.

357
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:17,950
Be a little bit fuckin' hard
on him, you know?

358
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:19,659
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't ease up on him.

359
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,733
Look at this shit!

360
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:44,148
I don't even want to go
outside anymore.

361
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:47,108
Bullet's gone to the fuckin' camp
'cause he's a run-amok kid

362
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:48,931
and everything's just falling apart.

363
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:51,988
Why do you think that is?

364
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:53,508
Why do you think your son

365
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,588
is running around at night
like a madman?

366
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:57,012
'Cause he's a little shit!

367
00:32:58,028 --> 00:32:59,907
I feel like slapping you, girl.

368
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:01,507
You want to wise up.

369
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:03,535
And you want to wise up real quick.

370
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:13,387
OK.

371
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:16,066
No, don't be rough with the swag.
You're gonna sleep on that.

372
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:20,026
OK, take your stump and sit down.

373
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:22,066
OK?

374
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:25,626
Hey, you know...
you know why you're here?

375
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,866
'Cause you've been mucking around.

376
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,626
That's why you're here. You know?

377
00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:33,265
What about you?
What are you in trouble for?

378
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:35,785
You been chasin' girls? Huh?

379
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:37,145
Stealing in a shop.

380
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,705
Robbing a shop?

381
00:33:38,706 --> 00:33:40,665
I don't know what
we're gonna do with you.

382
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,065
What about you, Bullet?

383
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:44,934
What have you done wrong?

384
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:49,424
- Lighting fire.
- Lighting fire!

385
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:51,725
You know, that's a serious thing too.

386
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,984
Well, we're gonna be walking
through countries.

387
00:33:56,985 --> 00:34:00,264
Over these creeks, over them hills.

388
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,485
There mightn't be any water, but...

389
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:06,653
we'll survive.

390
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:11,583
You see lovely country, you know,

391
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,543
when you get up on top
of the hill, looking down.

392
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:17,063
Sleeping in the bush,

393
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:19,330
you can hear the dingoes
howling at night.

394
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:23,686
And get up in the morning and
you hear the birds calling out.

395
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,302
People call it desert,

396
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:31,102
but to us, it's lovely to see the place

397
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:34,006
our grandfathers
and grandmothers come from.

398
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:41,261
We're trying to save you blokes
from going to jail, you know?

399
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:43,252
That's why you're here.

400
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:58,529
You alright, my boy?

401
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,119
Hello, young fella. You look worried.

402
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:41,658
What's the matter, my boy?

403
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:43,527
You got trouble anywhere?

404
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:52,078
Young fella, you must be got
family trouble, look like.

405
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,800
I wouldn't know where to start.

406
00:36:02,018 --> 00:36:04,045
Wouldn't know where
to start to tell you.

407
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:13,122
I got a little man inside of me
with an axe.

408
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:17,521
And that little man,
I like to keep him quiet...

409
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:21,718
but sometimes I've got
no control over it.

410
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:27,644
I fuckin' just wish there was...

411
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:34,095
I got this fuckin' little man
inside of me...

412
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,599
with this fuckin' axe.

413
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:18,156
This is very, very hard country.

414
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:25,035
As we move along, we've got to
find something to eat.

415
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:30,412
And that's the only way we're
gonna survive here, you know?

416
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,519
Don't think there's no tucker.
We've got to find it.

417
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:39,611
You can get a goanna.
You can get a snake.

418
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:43,291
You boys know
that we've got nothing on us,

419
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:45,478
so, um... we've got a long way to go.

420
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:00,330
Oh! Shit.

421
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:01,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

422
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,921
Get him.

423
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:40,190
I remember very, very clear...

424
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:45,068
this old grandfather of mine,
a bloke called Nebatabiji.

425
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:49,956
I remember this day,
he's carrying me.

426
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:53,393
I must have been about five, six.

427
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:56,356
And he was a big man.

428
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:03,166
He had dogs running out,
chasing kangaroos.

429
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,926
And this one kangaroo
come straight for him.

430
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,955
And the kangaroo must have been
coming about 100 miles an hour.

431
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:12,587
He got the spear
hooked up on a woomera.

432
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,630
Threw it from the hip shooter.

433
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:20,065
He got that kangaroo
right through the chest.

434
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,485
And I said to myself, "Jingo!

435
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,514
"One day, I'm gonna be like this man".

436
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,874
So I grew up trying to be
somebody like him.

437
00:40:04,724 --> 00:40:06,307
Hey, look at them mad bastards!

438
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:11,442
Hey! That my gully car.
My nephew car.

439
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,362
Pull up! Pull up!

440
00:40:13,363 --> 00:40:15,442
- Hey, what happening, gully?
- Hello, gully.

441
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:17,282
Oh, we just here making a bit of dust.

442
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:19,122
- How you like that?
- We can come with you?

443
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:21,633
- No worries. Yeah.
- Jump on!

444
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:27,161
Oh! Shit.

445
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:29,961
Bloody good, yeah! Whoo!

446
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:31,721
Fuckin' oath. Fuckin' oath!

447
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,961
We go dancing tonight
or what, Unc?

448
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:36,521
 Mama says
she want to dry her eyes

449
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:38,663
 She don't like crying

450
00:40:39,922 --> 00:40:44,906
 Trying hard to forget
her younger days

451
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,440
 Kids are wonderin'
why she doesn't sing along

452
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:50,800
 Maybe she's dying... 

453
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,760
Come on, Wazza!

454
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:54,105
Let's have a party here!

455
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,826
Come on, Wazza.
Let's run amok, brother!

456
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,458
Fuckin' car!

457
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,598
Oh!

458
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,678
- What was that?
- Whoa, pull up!

459
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,238
Pull up, pull up, pull up!

460
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,598
Oh, shit.

461
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,069
He might fuckin' blow up,
the bastard! Come on!

462
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,158
Come on, get out!
Get out of there, Wazza!

463
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,637
- It's ruined now!
- Fuck!

464
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:37,460
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

465
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:45,357
Oh, fuck!

466
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:46,941
There goes the ride, boys.

467
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:51,065
We'll be fuckin' walking from here.

468
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:01,436
You can have a little bit
of rest here today.

469
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:03,896
Another walk tomorrow morning.

470
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:08,582
And tomorrow morning, a long walk.

471
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:38,394
Must be something...
something in you, eh?

472
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:39,944
Something bothering you?

473
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:43,904
I don't know.

474
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:48,063
Why are you so angry?

475
00:42:51,954 --> 00:42:55,593
I guess it's my mum.
She not really round much.

476
00:42:55,594 --> 00:42:57,462
She always out drinking.

477
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:04,095
Alright. But, um...

478
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:07,935
you gonna straighten up?

479
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:13,032
If you keep on doing this,

480
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,312
you're not going to be with your family.

481
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:17,181
You're gonna be locked up
all the time.

482
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:15,498
Hello, hello, my brother.

483
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:18,732
Hey, bro.

484
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:27,827
What happened here?

485
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:30,627
Those young fellas give us lift,
me and this young fella here.

486
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:33,087
And then it blow up on us.

487
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:37,107
Is that Wazza's car?

488
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,737
Yeah.

489
00:44:41,948 --> 00:44:43,467
Where's all the piss?

490
00:44:43,468 --> 00:44:46,609
All got burnt up in his motor car.

491
00:44:48,107 --> 00:44:49,690
We can get a lift?

492
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,986
Yeah.

493
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:58,775
Alright.

494
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:28,904
Jimmy!

495
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:30,655
How are you, fella?

496
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:37,740
What are you doing up here, mate?

497
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:39,529
Just cruising. Passing through.

498
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:45,807
You don't look like
you're from up these parts.

499
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,339
You look like
a bit of a sheep-eater to me.

500
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,219
What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?

501
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,939
What I mean by that...

502
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,365
is, what the fuck
are you doing up here?

503
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,649
I might be looking for work.

504
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,041
Might go work out in the mines.

505
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:06,927
Might be up here on a holiday.

506
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,808
Working on my tan.

507
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:13,058
Scratching my balls in the sun.

508
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:16,018
When I see fuckin' shit, I know shit.

509
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:18,524
And you look like
fuckin' shit to me, pal.

510
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:21,897
I'm not gonna go there.

511
00:47:21,898 --> 00:47:23,817
You're just trying to get
a rise out of me

512
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:25,657
so you've got a reason
to lock me up.

513
00:47:25,658 --> 00:47:27,657
I know coppers like you.

514
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:30,657
Yeah? I've been in the city
with coppers. You know?

515
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:32,217
Yeah, well,
you're up here now.

516
00:47:32,218 --> 00:47:34,279
Five Rivers is my fuckin' turf.

517
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,976
And I don't like
when fuckin' cunts come up here

518
00:47:37,977 --> 00:47:40,482
and think they can hide away
up this end of the world.

519
00:47:41,497 --> 00:47:44,216
You fuck up up here, pal...

520
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:45,766
and you'll fuckin' deal with me.

521
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:54,456
Look, I've got a young fella
up here I'm visiting.

522
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:55,675
Yeah?

523
00:47:57,536 --> 00:47:59,095
My son, actually.

524
00:47:59,096 --> 00:48:00,998
I mean, if you're running
from something...

525
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:04,199
I'll find out, pal.

526
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:42,113
Jesus! Fuck!

527
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:52,892
What's wrong with this fella here?
What's he doing?

528
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:54,442
I don't know, my boy.

529
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:13,879
Are you here to see Nella?

530
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,511
Yeah.

531
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:24,917
Well, I know who
your fuckin' boy is, then, boy.

532
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,278
I really know who your son is.

533
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,249
Put your head under the water.

534
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,197
- Yep. Alright.
- Ready... go!

535
00:49:57,049 --> 00:49:58,568
Get him! Grab him by the tail!

536
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:00,835
Run!

537
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:03,313
Whoo!

538
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:09,808
Last day today, boys.
We'd better hurry up.

539
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:11,728
You want to see your girlfriend?

540
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:13,168
Come on, get in front.

541
00:50:13,169 --> 00:50:14,717
Don't let the old fella lead you.

542
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:19,948
I'm glad I'm going home.
I'm gonna have a shower.

543
00:50:22,968 --> 00:50:25,847
Hello, hello, my countrymen!

544
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:27,407
Look who's back.

545
00:50:27,408 --> 00:50:30,072
Hello again!
What, you been swimming, eh?

546
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,865
Thomas.

547
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:45,033
You need to sort out
what you come here for.

548
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:49,949
So don't go wandering, eh?

549
00:50:58,326 --> 00:51:00,245
Hey, Black. See you, brother.

550
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:01,725
- See you, mob.
- See you, brother.

551
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,356
- How are you going?
- Hello.

552
00:51:19,045 --> 00:51:22,504
 Got to find a place
to hide my head

553
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:30,192
 A shady billabong

554
00:51:35,244 --> 00:51:38,192
 Crash out on a cyclone bed

555
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:46,102
 Maybe time will right the wrongs

556
00:51:50,843 --> 00:51:53,666
 But nothing really matters

557
00:51:58,002 --> 00:52:01,588
 In the season of the lullin'

558
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:09,271
 Yeah, nothing really matters

559
00:52:13,962 --> 00:52:17,262
 When you're rolling on the run

560
00:52:22,721 --> 00:52:25,180
 Drifting off in dreamland

561
00:52:29,201 --> 00:52:33,229
 Cops and journos on my trail

562
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,826
 Trying to pin me down with slander

563
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,978
 Trying to haul me off to jail

564
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:56,382
 But nothing really matters

565
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:04,698
 In the season of the lullin'

566
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:12,658
 No, nothing really matters

567
00:53:16,598 --> 00:53:20,741
 When you're rolling on the run. 

568
00:53:47,236 --> 00:53:48,978
Hey.

569
00:54:03,475 --> 00:54:05,820
So, what, did you expect
some big welcoming party, did you?

570
00:54:08,755 --> 00:54:10,394
I just want to see him, Nella.

571
00:54:10,395 --> 00:54:12,234
Reckon we should be counting
our fuckin' blessings?

572
00:54:12,235 --> 00:54:14,137
The great man has arrived?

573
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:20,553
I've come a long fuckin' way.

574
00:54:20,554 --> 00:54:22,233
So you should!

575
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:24,375
And you're 13 years late!

576
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:29,513
He's not here.

577
00:54:29,514 --> 00:54:32,233
He's not sitting around waiting for you

578
00:54:32,234 --> 00:54:34,152
just 'cause you phoned
and said you were coming.

579
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:36,976
- Yeah, well, good...
- I only made that mistake once.

580
00:54:41,353 --> 00:54:44,192
Yeah, well, good to see you all
fuckin' glamorous and perfect

581
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:46,552
with your fucked-up lives here.

582
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:47,952
This place is a shithole.

583
00:54:47,953 --> 00:54:49,783
Well, no-one asked you to come!

584
00:54:53,272 --> 00:54:56,591
You know, me and you had
that great time all those years ago,

585
00:54:56,592 --> 00:54:58,071
but all you've fuckin' done since then

586
00:54:58,072 --> 00:55:01,111
is lie to me and fuck up that boy.

587
00:55:01,112 --> 00:55:02,900
He don't give one shit about you.

588
00:55:04,752 --> 00:55:07,150
Have you got any idea
the fuckin' shit I've been through

589
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:08,670
the last couple of fuckin' years?

590
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,750
I don't care!
I don't give a shit, Thomas!

591
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:12,175
Just go.

592
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:15,430
You're not here to be real

593
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:17,670
and you're not here
to be no father, so fuck off!

594
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:20,070
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna listen
to this fuckin' shit anyway!

595
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:21,620
Yeah, good.

596
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:52,651
There you go, TJ.

597
00:55:54,109 --> 00:55:55,658
Cheers.

598
00:56:00,428 --> 00:56:02,330
- Cup of tea?
- Ah. Thank you, sis.

599
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:38,215
How are you, my boy?

600
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,215
He don't need me.

601
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:51,572
He better off without me anyway.

602
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:07,814
You right, Grandpa?

603
00:57:09,624 --> 00:57:11,253
Yep.

604
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:28,006
This is mammoditch place here,
Uncle, this country.

605
00:57:31,543 --> 00:57:33,172
That's a Noongar word.

606
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:37,012
It means 'the best'.

607
00:57:44,382 --> 00:57:47,621
Bet you fellas have got a big mob
of sacred places round here.

608
00:57:47,622 --> 00:57:50,411
Oh, big mob round here, my boy.

609
00:57:53,622 --> 00:57:56,240
On our river down in Perth...

610
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:01,020
our sacred site,

611
00:58:01,021 --> 00:58:05,687
where the Wakkal, he had
his final resting place there...

612
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:12,970
they built a road... there,
and a bridge.

613
00:58:16,741 --> 00:58:19,609
The whitefellas even built
a brewery on it.

614
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,528
Right on the freshwater spring.

615
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,965
I used to go there
when I was a little fella.

616
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,606
Throw rocks at that poxy place.

617
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:44,878
But this country here,
it's like medicine.

618
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:53,287
This is my son's country.

619
00:58:58,378 --> 00:58:59,777
He's here now?

620
00:58:59,778 --> 00:59:01,327
Yep.

621
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:06,577
So he's... really here?

622
00:59:06,578 --> 00:59:08,047
Yes, bub.

623
00:59:09,977 --> 00:59:11,640
Mmm.

624
00:59:17,097 --> 00:59:18,576
But, Mum, you said that he not...

625
00:59:18,577 --> 00:59:21,136
I knowwhat I said, bub.

626
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,656
And you don't have to see him
if you don't want to.

627
00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:25,160
But he is here.

628
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,255
Do you reckon he'll like us?

629
00:59:32,256 --> 00:59:33,839
Course he will, baby.

630
00:59:38,536 --> 00:59:40,165
But why'd he come now?

631
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:26,956
Nella!

632
01:00:29,853 --> 01:00:31,356
I want to see him!

633
01:00:36,652 --> 01:00:39,236
Nella, you can hate me,
but I want to see my son.

634
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:08,191
You fellas can talk
to each other, you know.

635
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,832
You want to go for a walk, mate?

636
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,393
That's alright with you?

637
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,715
Hmm?

638
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:37,888
All I'm saying is just have
a little bit of patience.

639
01:01:37,889 --> 01:01:39,568
He come long way, you know?

640
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:42,008
At least he's here.

641
01:01:42,009 --> 01:01:46,567
Yeah, it's just... it's hard.

642
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:49,687
'Cause he's been running around
for 13 years,

643
01:01:49,688 --> 01:01:51,687
acting like he doesn't care,

644
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:53,807
and now I don't know
what to expect from him.

645
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:55,357
And, what, you're perfect?

646
01:01:57,648 --> 01:01:59,207
Well, at least I've stopped drinking.

647
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:00,871
Good.

648
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:23,749
Anyone?

649
01:02:29,766 --> 01:02:32,191
Fair enough.
Maybe a bit too soon, eh?

650
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:34,565
Maybe as we go along,

651
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:38,004
people can start feeling comfortable
in saying something.

652
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:39,793
We'll try again next week, eh?

653
01:02:41,245 --> 01:02:42,748
It's good.

654
01:02:44,725 --> 01:02:47,004
So, where's
TJ and Bullet today?

655
01:02:47,005 --> 01:02:48,764
Watching the footy.

656
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,004
That's what my husband
used to do with his sons.

657
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:52,844
Watch the footy!

658
01:02:52,845 --> 01:02:54,950
- That's true, Aunty.
- That's right.

659
01:02:56,444 --> 01:02:59,634
They might have even said
a few words to each other by now.

660
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:31,961
 Catfish swimming

661
01:03:31,962 --> 01:03:35,900
 In the brown water mud

662
01:03:37,162 --> 01:03:41,041
 Salt water running

663
01:03:41,042 --> 01:03:43,041
 Through the fresh river flood... 

664
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,601
You know what?

665
01:03:44,602 --> 01:03:47,120
I heard you've got to watch out
for the crocs, eh?

666
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:48,640
You get pretty big crocs up here?

667
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,986
- Mmm.
- I've never seen a crocodile.

668
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,440
You've got a deadly haircut there.

669
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,000
Who does your hair?

670
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:58,120
Me and my mates cut it.

671
01:03:58,121 --> 01:03:59,784
Solid.

672
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:03,079
 Rivers and lakes

673
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,508
 Where the rain comes down

674
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,869
 We're gonna wash them blues away

675
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:25,302
 When the rain comes down

676
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:33,438
 On a hot summer's day... 

677
01:04:33,439 --> 01:04:35,318
Hey.

678
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:36,718
TJ. How are you going?

679
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:38,677
Yeah, Elvis.

680
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:41,428
And a-one, two,
one, two, three, four...

681
01:04:49,758 --> 01:04:54,157
 Dust flies up and it's dry as hell

682
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:58,076
 Fire breaks out like a magic spell

683
01:04:58,077 --> 01:05:03,396
 Twisting and a-turning
like some big old snakes

684
01:05:03,397 --> 01:05:07,156
 Veins through the land,
rivers and lakes

685
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:10,756
 When the rain comes down

686
01:05:10,757 --> 01:05:13,500
 Gonna wash
them blues away, yeah

687
01:05:15,236 --> 01:05:18,662
 Oh, when the rain comes down

688
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:22,982
 On a hot summer's day, yeah. 

689
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:38,585
I'll see you during the week.
I'm sure you'll be here.

690
01:05:41,755 --> 01:05:43,674
Got to go. Goodnight.

691
01:05:43,675 --> 01:05:45,514
Somebody's gotta work.

692
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:47,593
See you mob tomorrow.

693
01:05:47,594 --> 01:05:49,793
- See you, girls.
- Goodnight, Uncle.

694
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:51,353
Thank you.

695
01:05:51,354 --> 01:05:53,673
- Friday night, eh?
- Friday night in Five Rivers.

696
01:05:53,674 --> 01:05:55,052
Fuckin' alright.

697
01:06:15,993 --> 01:06:18,259
 Last sip of wine

698
01:06:20,073 --> 01:06:23,020
 Last cigarette

699
01:06:23,992 --> 01:06:27,532
 I've lived a full life

700
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:31,591
 I have no regrets

701
01:06:31,592 --> 01:06:36,020
 Oh, man, my patience is tired

702
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:40,750
 My brain's always wired

703
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:44,416
 Oh, the pain in our hearts

704
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:48,890
 Tore us apart

705
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,910
 How we gonna find a fantasy?

706
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:59,629
 Something special
just for you and me?

707
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,578
 Kinda happy
but it still feels sad... 

708
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,932
I see you've still got the tatt.

709
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,300
Been trying to scrub it off for years.

710
01:07:22,629 --> 01:07:24,068
Want some of this?

711
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:25,618
I don't drink.

712
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,406
You're joking.

713
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,690
I'm not gonna bite you.

714
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:54,615
I'm the father of your son.

715
01:07:57,787 --> 01:07:59,450
Oh, come on.

716
01:08:07,506 --> 01:08:09,169
This is a bad idea.

717
01:08:12,066 --> 01:08:13,569
No, it's not.

718
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:16,385
It's just two people dancing.

719
01:08:16,386 --> 01:08:20,051
 For the want and more

720
01:08:21,626 --> 01:08:25,024
 A strain on the core

721
01:08:25,025 --> 01:08:28,963
 Oh, now, the hold and the truth

722
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:33,123
 Is something aloof

723
01:08:35,105 --> 01:08:39,304
 How we gonna find a fantasy?

724
01:08:39,305 --> 01:08:43,463
 Something special
just for you and me

725
01:08:43,464 --> 01:08:47,863
 Kinda happy
but it stills feels sad

726
01:08:47,864 --> 01:08:50,847
 Kinda sane but a little mad... 

727
01:09:05,983 --> 01:09:08,342
Mmm... I can't do this, eh?

728
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:09,942
What do you mean, you can't do this?

729
01:09:09,943 --> 01:09:13,051
I mean I fucking can't do this, TJ!
I can't be with you.

730
01:09:14,462 --> 01:09:15,761
Fuck.

731
01:09:24,182 --> 01:09:26,084
So, that's what it is, eh?

732
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:29,089
I'm not fuckin' good enough for you?

733
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,180
What are you fucking...?!

734
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:34,940
Fuck off!

735
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:39,084
Oh, typical fuckin' TJ.
Got to start smashing shit up.

736
01:09:40,941 --> 01:09:42,860
- Get!
- Hey, mate.

737
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:44,891
Get out!

738
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,202
Baby, put it down.

739
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,243
It's alright. He's gone.

740
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:07,858
Bullet?

741
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:14,218
 Will you rise
or will you fall?

742
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:20,938
 Will you walk or will you crawl?

743
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:27,737
 Will you dream in black and white

744
01:10:27,738 --> 01:10:34,217
 When you're sleeping cold tonight?

745
01:10:34,218 --> 01:10:41,056
 Will you bend or will you break?

746
01:10:41,057 --> 01:10:47,416
 Will you give or will you take?

747
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:53,176
 Will no angel shine no light? 

748
01:10:53,177 --> 01:10:56,216
I need to get out of here, Aunty.

749
01:10:56,217 --> 01:10:58,455
I need to come back home.

750
01:10:58,456 --> 01:11:01,695
I'm sorry, my boy,
but I can't do it anymore.

751
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:04,335
I'm tired. I'm sick
of worrying about you.

752
01:11:04,336 --> 01:11:05,895
Just book my bus fare.

753
01:11:05,896 --> 01:11:07,455
I gotta get out of this shithole!

754
01:11:07,456 --> 01:11:08,935
You're a grown man now.

755
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:10,815
You've got to stand
on your own two feet.

756
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:11,921
Fuck ya!

757
01:11:12,816 --> 01:11:15,254
I know there's a bag of shit
in your pocket. Hand it over!

758
01:11:15,255 --> 01:11:16,814
Or this fella's gonna cop it.

759
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:18,654
And this fella, that fella, and you!

760
01:11:18,655 --> 01:11:20,443
Hand it over now!

761
01:11:21,975 --> 01:11:28,134
 Would you fail or would you leave?

762
01:11:28,135 --> 01:11:34,653
 Would you stand your ground
and fight

763
01:11:34,654 --> 01:11:40,242
 When I'm sleeping cold tonight?

764
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:44,813
 Way, oh, way

765
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:51,332
 Way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, I. 

766
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:52,836
You little cunt!

767
01:11:53,773 --> 01:11:55,372
What did I tell you?!

768
01:11:55,373 --> 01:11:58,772
I warned you, gave you
all the possible chances,

769
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,322
and you fucked it up.

770
01:12:02,893 --> 01:12:04,715
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

771
01:12:05,773 --> 01:12:07,451
Just one of those fuckin' coppers

772
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:08,971
who thinks his fuckin' shit
doesn't stink.

773
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:10,077
Is that right?

774
01:12:10,972 --> 01:12:12,794
- Hey? You don't know me, pal.
- Fuck!

775
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:20,476
Fuck you. I always wanted
to flog a copper.

776
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:26,718
Well, come on, then! Get up!

777
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,849
That's what you want?

778
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,513
That's how you want it?

779
01:13:04,329 --> 01:13:06,549
I was gonna cap that, you little prick!

780
01:14:31,004 --> 01:14:33,224
We've all been through the shit
up here, bro.

781
01:14:35,924 --> 01:14:38,713
And I don't want my family
putting up with no more.

782
01:15:21,481 --> 01:15:23,144
That's your ticket out of here.

783
01:15:27,681 --> 01:15:29,583
The bus comes in half an hour.

784
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:05,798
I know I might come across

785
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:08,638
as a bit of a hard bastard,

786
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:13,657
but, you know... amongst
all the chaos and bullshit...

787
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:19,300
somebody's got to be strong
for everyone, you know?

788
01:16:21,638 --> 01:16:23,904
But you're my grandson's father.

789
01:16:25,438 --> 01:16:27,996
And you belong to us now.

790
01:16:27,997 --> 01:16:29,626
If that's what you want.

791
01:17:20,434 --> 01:17:21,953
Bullet, open the door!

792
01:17:21,954 --> 01:17:23,353
Go away! Leave me alone!

793
01:17:23,354 --> 01:17:24,937
Come on, baby.

794
01:17:28,754 --> 01:17:31,543
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to see anybody!

795
01:17:37,993 --> 01:17:39,663
Bullet!

796
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:42,741
That's enough, baby.
Come on. Come out.

797
01:17:47,073 --> 01:17:48,975
Baby, come on.

798
01:17:50,353 --> 01:17:51,982
Nella.

799
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:10,270
This is your damage.

800
01:18:10,271 --> 01:18:12,139
You fuckin' fix it.

801
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:16,895
Just leave me alone!

802
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,413
Hey, mate.

803
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:36,259
Go away. Leave me alone.

804
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:43,229
Bullet, it's me, mate. Your dad.

805
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:45,268
I hate you, you dog.

806
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:46,898
I hate you.

807
01:18:49,149 --> 01:18:50,948
Come on, mate. Let me in.

808
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:54,375
I said go away. Are you deaf or what?

809
01:19:00,429 --> 01:19:03,217
Go on, get!

810
01:19:46,226 --> 01:19:47,968
Hello?

811
01:20:58,702 --> 01:21:00,604
Deadly, unna, them birds?

812
01:21:11,661 --> 01:21:13,529
What did you come here for?

813
01:21:19,661 --> 01:21:21,243
I come here to see you.

814
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,819
You seen me.

815
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,619
Now you can go.

816
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,203
No, mate.

817
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,681
I don't believe you.

818
01:21:39,779 --> 01:21:41,282
I know.

819
01:21:42,299 --> 01:21:43,802
But you will.

820
01:21:56,018 --> 01:21:59,001
I, uh... just want to share that...

821
01:22:01,138 --> 01:22:05,097
I've had a pretty...
pretty hard week.

822
01:22:05,098 --> 01:22:07,297
A few things with my family.

823
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:09,166
Had to sort a few things out.

824
01:22:10,898 --> 01:22:13,163
Little... few things
with my grandson and...

825
01:22:14,377 --> 01:22:17,599
My... my boy's been
like a son to me. I've...

826
01:22:18,737 --> 01:22:21,256
You guys know...
I've grown my grandson up

827
01:22:21,257 --> 01:22:24,256
from a... from a baby,

828
01:22:24,257 --> 01:22:27,936
and... we all need a man in our life.

829
01:22:27,937 --> 01:22:31,055
A father... father figure.

830
01:22:31,056 --> 01:22:35,404
Um... I've never had
that opportunity, but...

831
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:41,735
I'm glad that my grandson's
father's here to be with him.

832
01:22:41,736 --> 01:22:43,444
Mmm.

833
01:22:45,056 --> 01:22:47,254
But it's good to see
his father turn up here,

834
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,999
and... I'm sort of...

835
01:22:52,255 --> 01:22:55,681
proud that he's here to see his son.

836
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:00,404
Yeah.

837
01:23:18,814 --> 01:23:22,751
 Got to find a place
to hide my head

838
01:23:26,493 --> 01:23:29,362
 A shady billabong

839
01:23:33,933 --> 01:23:36,692
 And crash out on the cyclone bed... 

840
01:23:36,693 --> 01:23:41,171
I grew up basically going to...
well, getting locked up.

841
01:23:41,172 --> 01:23:43,931
I basically got locked up
before I was 10 years old.

842
01:23:43,932 --> 01:23:45,331
Getting locked up.

843
01:23:45,332 --> 01:23:48,371
I was in that process
before I was 10 years old.

844
01:23:48,372 --> 01:23:52,731
I grew up, um, witnessing
domestic violence.

845
01:23:52,732 --> 01:23:57,130
I've consequently been through
some relationships

846
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,170
with domestic violence.

847
01:23:59,171 --> 01:24:02,610
And it's hard when you're there.

848
01:24:02,611 --> 01:24:05,229
Um, and if you're... you know...

849
01:24:07,171 --> 01:24:08,930
if you end up
being one of those women...

850
01:24:08,931 --> 01:24:12,729
that can step outside and look
at what's actually going on

851
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:15,129
and realise that you don't want
that for your life...

852
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:17,209
And even if you've only been
locked up for one night...

853
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,769
and you wake up in a prison cell...

854
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:21,150
and you're coming down off
the drink and the drugs and...

855
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:25,889
You know, and then they read
in your sheet, they...

856
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:27,529
When they release you,
they're saying to you...

857
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:29,289
You know, you're obviously
signing your release papers,

858
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:31,236
and it's like, "Oh, assault," you know?

859
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:33,888
And then you're like, "Fuck,"

860
01:24:33,889 --> 01:24:36,008
and start thinking about that
poor bastard lying in hospital

861
01:24:36,009 --> 01:24:37,968
that you beat the crap out of,
you know?

862
01:24:37,969 --> 01:24:39,728
And he's just gonna be going around,

863
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,768
"Well, I just got beaten up
by a drunken blackfella".

864
01:24:41,769 --> 01:24:43,272
You know?

865
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:47,008
And then there's a...
You know, I'd have...

866
01:24:47,009 --> 01:24:49,047
You know, I'd start crying.

867
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:54,007
Then it went to drinking really bad.

868
01:24:54,008 --> 01:24:55,527
And it was a choice.

869
01:24:55,528 --> 01:24:58,567
I think the biggest thing for me
was my kids.

870
01:24:58,568 --> 01:25:01,607
I got to a point where... I thought,

871
01:25:01,608 --> 01:25:06,006
"Well, if I really love my kids,
I should give it another go,"

872
01:25:06,007 --> 01:25:07,526
you know?

873
01:25:07,527 --> 01:25:10,846
And maybe change my ways, get a job.

874
01:25:10,847 --> 01:25:15,206
Here I am in denial about
so many things, and I'm a man.

875
01:25:15,207 --> 01:25:16,646
Fuckin' bullshit, you know.

876
01:25:16,647 --> 01:25:18,246
I wasn't... You know, I haven't...

877
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:20,006
I've only just started to become a man...

878
01:25:20,007 --> 01:25:22,405
in the last fuckin' three years,
you know?

879
01:25:22,406 --> 01:25:25,765
Because I was blaming other...
blaming, you know?

880
01:25:25,766 --> 01:25:28,485
And a bit of that poor fella me
would come out in my drinking...

881
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:30,645
and then I'd, like, turn that
into rage, you know?

882
01:25:30,646 --> 01:25:33,525
That's why a lot of those kids
go the wrong way,

883
01:25:33,526 --> 01:25:36,605
walking the street
and doing what they want to do,

884
01:25:36,606 --> 01:25:38,365
trying to find something,

885
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:39,884
and something they find,

886
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,164
maybe the wrong people,
they mix up with,

887
01:25:42,165 --> 01:25:44,084
and that is the people
that get into trouble.

888
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:47,204
It is different when they get out there

889
01:25:47,205 --> 01:25:49,844
in a different environment, you know?

890
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:51,684
You know, once you get 'em
away from town,

891
01:25:51,685 --> 01:25:53,164
they're different kids.

892
01:25:53,165 --> 01:25:54,964
They love it.

893
01:25:54,965 --> 01:25:56,963
And that's why I like taking them out.

894
01:25:56,964 --> 01:25:59,523
The first sergeant I worked with,
he said to me one day,

895
01:25:59,524 --> 01:26:04,043
he said, "The best copper
is an ex-crim".

896
01:26:04,044 --> 01:26:05,763
'Cause you think like them, you know?

897
01:26:05,764 --> 01:26:08,003
You know what they're thinking
and you can...

898
01:26:08,004 --> 01:26:09,523
Body language,
you know all that shit,

899
01:26:09,524 --> 01:26:11,123
because you've done all that crap.

900
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:15,522
And you can only do that
sober or clean, you know?

901
01:26:15,523 --> 01:26:16,901
You can't...

902
01:26:18,203 --> 01:26:21,322
No use getting drunk and then
getting emotional, you know?

903
01:26:21,323 --> 01:26:23,602
You've got to get emotional
and cry when you're sober,

904
01:26:23,603 --> 01:26:27,322
and go through that
over a long period of time.

905
01:26:27,323 --> 01:26:30,162
I'm the kind of woman that
clashes with a mad bastard,

906
01:26:30,163 --> 01:26:34,521
because I can be pretty mad
myself, so... yeah.

907
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,521
Yeah, the biggest fight
I've ever had in my life...

908
01:26:36,522 --> 01:26:38,081
is within myself.

909
01:26:38,082 --> 01:26:42,232
And the hardest fight is with me.

910
01:26:43,762 --> 01:26:47,587
And, yeah, I'm still fighting.
I'm still having that fight.

911
01:26:48,601 --> 01:26:53,188
A mad bastard, he's not really,
really mad. He's in between.

912
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:57,720
He can be a good man
when he's sober..

913
01:26:57,721 --> 01:27:00,880
and he can be a mad bastard
when he's drunk.

914
01:27:00,881 --> 01:27:04,040
There's nothing wrong with that.

915
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:09,628
But it might seem to be mad,
but... it's not.

916
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,867
But it's just a good...

917
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,281
good name for that movie.
