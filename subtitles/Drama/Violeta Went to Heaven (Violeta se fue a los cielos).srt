1
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:30,455
WHEN the lights go out

2
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,016
According <i> true events </ i>

3
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,551
For what was wrong
Our old house?

4
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,803
Where do you want me to start?
- I loved it.

5
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:04,118
Right. You could stay there.
- Very funny ...

6
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:16,937
Can you let some music, please?
- I say, no problem.

7
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,755
How are workers paid?
- 20 pounds.

8
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,897
Naughty boys.

9
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,400
Will appear when Brian and Rita?

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,538
Probably when all done.

11
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:37,288
Typical Brian.
- Typical Rita.

12
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,557
I do not like.

13
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:56,462
You do not know how good.

14
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:59,029
What this glupaèa doing here?
- Who?

15
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,032
I know from school.
Smells like mokraæu.

16
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:02,782
Sally!

17
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,819
Then hang out with
staraèkom people in the home.

18
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,613
Hello!

19
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:08,572
Hello.

20
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,772
Sally!

21
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,613
The cavalry has arrived!
- Is there a problem.

22
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:50,959
Do not panic, Len.

23
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,332
I have a job for you.

24
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,333
Oh shit, did we
so much missed.

25
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,411
I have a housewarming gift.
- What, now I will dobiæu free.

26
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:59,826
There is no place for the weak.
The first three are yours.

27
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,244
The first three?

28
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,826
There is a bathroom, baby.

29
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,555
Come on, smiling happily and look.

30
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:47,974
We go to the bedroom?
- Bezobraznièe!

31
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:51,319
Do you think it would be better?

32
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,674
Raèunaj on me at all times.

33
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,681
Forest Kastlfild. I was there.

34
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,941
Yeah, and?

35
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,610
It's really mysterious.

36
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,979
Turn.
- Come on!

37
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,033
For what so namrgoðeno face?

38
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,326
I do not take part in your
gentle talks.

39
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:10,777
Did you hear that?

40
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,789
Come on, come here. Come.
- To take pictures.

41
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:14,948
Come on, girls.

42
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,148
The show.

43
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,571
Beautiful, beautiful girl.

44
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,819
Way to go, you see?

45
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,417
God, nazdraviæete and you two?

46
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:29,121
For a new house!
- For a new house. Cheers!

47
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,329
Cheers!

48
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,343
Mehuriæi we have entered into the nose.

49
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,482
Yes, it is. Show
I love her. Great!

50
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,142
What's the matter, honey?

51
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:47,230
I thought you were happy.
- I'm more than happy, Len.

52
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,534
It's sick, is not it?
- I think it's really nice.

53
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:54,029
Become a slut?
- What do you say, I like the clothes.

54
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,739
It was supposed to be a model.

55
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
It's nice. Again. One more time ...
ptièica, come on!

56
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,621
Dad?

57
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,206
Yes, dear?

58
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,076
Have you moved my clothes?

59
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,784
You're kidding, right?

60
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,487
Fix it before you see your mother.

61
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:12,334
<i> inflation rate of 17%, the largest
in the last 34 years ... </ i>

62
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,296
Avocado?

63
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,339
What?

64
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,344
Avocado. That would be nice, would not it?

65
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,811
What do you think of the green, baby?

66
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,564
Then you have no feeling for style, Len.

67
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:27,399
Or, more importantly, money.

68
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,277
Cheer up, honey.

69
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,853
What is it?

70
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:35,740
I do not like this house, it scares me.
- Is it?

71
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,868
The lamp rocked by itself.

72
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,290
Have you left a window open?
- Konjiæ dispersed.

73
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,239
Is not it made of?

74
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,439
Itself.

75
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,933
Do not believe me, do not you?
- It's time for school.

76
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,438
And so there was a decline
Catholic Church in England.

77
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:09,358
The monasteries were closed by the will of the king?

78
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,101
Sir!
- Mr. Pryce!

79
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:13,301
Sir!
- Sir!

80
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,679
Sally?

81
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,349
Yes, sir?

82
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,746
She drew you, sir.

83
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,170
See, once
he blushed.

84
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,555
Well girls, that's enough. Hall,
Bring us to see. Come on.

85
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,255
This is really good.

86
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:42,682
I even said, and great.

87
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,809
If this is art for EAS.

88
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:48,564
And my hair is drawn're wrong.
It's a little polished.

89
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:53,059
Okay, now can anyone tell me
says who closed the monasteries?

90
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,527
Sir!
- Lucy!

91
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,146
Henry VIII, Sir.
- That's right, girl.

92
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:59,225
And how many women have?

93
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,968
I do not want to stay here alone, Mom.

94
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:39,282
We will not be long.

95
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:42,317
Just to spend a few shillings.
- Someone has here.

96
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:46,571
Stop it, honey. Now you're great
girl. Thus the act.

97
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,089
If I'm a big girl now
why can not I do that emerging?

98
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,333
Because you're still young.

99
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,578
I can not win, right?
- Do not ...

100
00:10:53,678 --> 00:10:56,583
Hi, honey.
- See you later!

101
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,658
Then go.

102
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,813
Still it's your turn, right?

103
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:24,753
Here you are. To put the planted,
we have to be civilized, is not it?

104
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,134
Is conciliation goes according to plan?
- Yes.

105
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,296
He just got into his Sali
head, we are not alone in the house.

106
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,139
What do you mean?

107
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,409
Conviction that we have a spirit.

108
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,755
It's still pretty childish.

109
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,507
Rita?

110
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,727
I think I saw something.

111
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:53,813
Do not mention it, otherwise there
veèito hear that.

112
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,640
Ladies ...

113
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,840
To join you.

114
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,187
Cheers, darling!

115
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,387
Cheers!

116
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,223

Hi, love ...

124
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:39,002
She was soaking wet, jadnièak!

125
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:41,752
What are you doing out here, honey?

126
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,488
Come on.

127
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,492
Mom, I saw him.

128
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,147
See, when a toy falls down stairs

129
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,325
does not mean that we have a spirit.

130
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:57,220
It's late. We're all tired.
Go to bed!

131
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,005
I believe you.

132
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,457
She's just angry.
- Really?

133
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,462
Next time will go with you.

134
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,213
Another damn power cuts.

135
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,514
It was supposed to inform us.

136
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,794
Others still have light.

137
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,806
Do you have sveæe?
- I do not know where they are.

138
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,841
God, what is that?

139
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:30,013
Come on, EIK guess.
Hello, Miss ...

140
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:32,854
What are you doing up there, hell?

141
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,751
You little naughty!

142
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:41,361
That's the spirit!
- Yes, hell!

143
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,234
God!

144
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,489
I'm not going to stay here.

145
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,582
I'm going to see if I was okay.

146
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,582
Bring a flashlight!

147
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,265
Rita, behind you!

148
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,561
What is going on here?

149
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,242
Welcome home. What happened?

150
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,005
Listen, this is not the first
time to play stupid joke.

151
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,428
No, this was different.
- How?

152
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:32,083
Simply different.

153
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:35,219
And then what happened to the lights?
- Power key was turned off.

154
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,159
A sound?

155
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,098
These children are recorded.

156
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,443
What about slavininom?
- Only needs to be replaced.

157
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,978
A grandfather clock?
- I fell.

158
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,178
Or was pushed.

159
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,609
I do not know ...

160
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,985
Look, it is obvious. It
does not want to stay here.

161
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:55,640
It's just her way of protest ...
- You think so.

162
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,578
Do not believe me, do not you?
- Not at all.

163
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,966
Where's Mom?

164
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,683
She's tired, it's still in bed.

165
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:16,806
Odneæu her tea.

166
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:17,928
I do not want to be disturbed.

167
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:20,128
You do not want more strife?

168
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,441
What are you doing? Let me go!

169
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,956
All ulepilo!

170
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,636
What is it?

171
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:07,770
Nothing, sir.

172
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,095
Then continue with it.

173
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,954
Look what I found in the library.

174
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,331
So, all spirits cool room ...

175
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,000
throwing things on and off the lights.

176
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,325
You know what I mean?
- What?

177
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,630
I believe that everything happens for a
normal explanation.

178
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,340
Yeah, you got spirit at home.

179
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,309
I think Len was not wrong.

180
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,012
You blame the kids?
- And before we had all kinds of jokes.

181
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:45,022
These are not two babies Èamps
Zens and exit the bar.

182
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,768
Maybe not everything you think.

183
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:48,478
Better let these things
stay where they are.

184
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:50,813
I saw you, you were
saw her, she was seen.

185
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:53,441
This is not a child's imagination
performed jokes.

186
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,068
How do you know she was lying.
- But I know what I saw.

187
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,848
If you had a child might understand it.

188
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,893
Sorry, I should not have said that.

189
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,093
It's okay.

190
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,957
I just want us all to be happy.

191
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,322
I know.

192
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,397
Shit.

193
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,256
You stupid cow!

194
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,780
You're like everyone else, do not.

195
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,380
Do not go.
- Today you hurt me.

196
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,224
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:39,362
Really do you like g. Pryce?
- Mind your own business ...

198
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,065
Yes.
- He was really nice, right?

199
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:44,343
He's like John Denver.
- Not!

200
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,673
<i> You filled my senses, as in the night ... </ i>

201
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:48,839
Stop it!

202
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:52,593
And I like it.
- Leave it.

203
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:55,497
Maybe it's better that we go inside.

204
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:56,597
No more!

205
00:20:56,697 --> 00:21:00,552
All right. You want to raise
doll in the air?

206
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,016
You little bitch, if it's my jacket?

207
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,759
Just to get my hands on.

208
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,765
If you, Sally, then ...

209
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,411
Shit!

210
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,707
Open the door!

211
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,168
Hall, open the door!

212
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:20,237
Something is in there!

213
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:22,422
Get out!

214
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,807
Sally, I'm warning you!
Open the door!

215
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,232
Dad, what is it?
- You little ...

216
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,476
bitch!

217
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,773
I'm sorry, honey.

218
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:41,900
I'm sorry.

219
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,596
What are you gonna do now?
- We're leaving.

220
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,929
Really?

221
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:54,138
What else would I need to do?
- Where to go?

222
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,558
We are already hard to find this house.

223
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:57,434
Then he would return to the wait
Subsidies to the end of the list.

224
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:59,404
But when they were told of the spirit?

225
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,189
You would not believe us.

226
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,278
What about the father of Clifton?

227
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:03,819
We were in the church!

228
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,359
He slammed the door in our face.

229
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,319
You need to know that you are always welcome.

230
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,104
I'm not going to be driven away. And full stop!

231
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,887
Who are you?

232
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,445
<i> friends ... </ i>

233
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,903
Get out of here!

234
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,187
What do you want?

235
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,285
Avocado? Is not it green?

236
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,657
That's what I wanted.

237
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,723
If you can not afford
then you can not afford.

238
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,209
It is this lack of logic when ...

239
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,789
they imagine something in my head.

240
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,003
I hear that you have the spirit?

241
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,401
Yeah, and?

242
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:53,966
've Apologized a newspaper?

243
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,529
Just me more journalists missing!

244
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:57,823
For you, I could not find a couple of them.

245
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,825
My buddy works for 'Express'.

246
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,440
If you want, I can call him.

247
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,876
Do you get asked if I want to press?

248
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,798
Sorry, but this case may
help us to move.

249
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:12,422
What if they think that's the trick?

250
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,153
It will not. In addition, they get paid well ...

251
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:15,883
if you like the story.

252
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:18,083
Cancel them.

253
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,829
It's too late for that.

254
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,687
So here I was attacked.

255
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,105
But what, Mr. Maynard?

256
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,191
As a kind of presence.

257
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,192
Presence?

258
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,502
Yes, as a creepy priviðenje.

259
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:36,659
Have you seen him?

260
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,871
Do not ...

261
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,365
Were you touched?

262
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,066
No, but ...

263
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,736
Listen, I was scared, g. Smith.

264
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,936
I can not believe it.

265
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,334
I think there's nothing you can
be imteresantno our readers.

266
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,461
Everyone loves stories about ghosts.

267
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,005
But for this you need a ghost.

268
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:57,800
What do you think, Mr.. Smith?
- I'm a journalist.

269
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,099
I do not see anything specific
I would have to write.

270
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:04,159
If you look around a little ...
- I'll take a look.

271
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,126
Bravo, a wise head.

272
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,963
Shut up.

273
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:21,344
Ozbilno, g. Maynard, I
really busy man ...

274

<i> Poltergeist haunts
Local family ... </ i>

275
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:35,788
Look at my hair.
The picture is terrible, is not it?

276
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,132
I'm not even mention.

277
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:39,929
It's not fair, honey, I do not think so.

278
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,129
No, not so.

279
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,870
Can we look?

280
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,935
Mom does not like people
come to our house.

281
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:48,685
My dad said to make up ...

282
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:49,999
No, it's true!

283
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:51,311
And how I pay the newspaper?

284
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:53,981
Leave her alone, tired.
- Want to be a good soul!

Idiots.

What is going on here?

289
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:14,642
Sightseeing of the house, ma'am.

290
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:16,870
It costs a pound, but it's worth it.

291
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,574
Get out! This is my fucking house.

292
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,751
This is my daughters room. It
there was not much happening.

293
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,749
I'll be right now.

294
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,938
What are you doing this, Len?
- A little I earn.

295
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:37,026
Get rid of them!
- Want a new kitchen, or not?

296
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:39,226
Now!

297
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,657
Are we next?
- No, the show is over. Go!

298

What?
- Can I get a ten pence, please?

301
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:57,911
Go on, get out!

302
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:00,111
Hunks.

303
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,166
Pound?

304
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,882
Jenny.

305
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,897
I thought you wanted to paste
wallpaper, not that you take them.

306
00:30:06,997 --> 00:30:09,097
I did not do.

307
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,892
Shit.

308
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,999
Where did you get it?

309
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:20,202
I stole from the store.
It has a terrible taste.

310
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,871
Thief. Give it to me.

311
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,024
It looks like honey.

312
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,004
And it tastes Dubreta.

313
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:56,664
Shut up! Izbaciæe us out.

314
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,776
To whom it belonged to, please tell me?
- No one.

315
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,149
Then get out of here.

316
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,912
I'm drunk.
- I am.

317
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,716
Have you ever been drunk?

318
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:52,511
Yes, sometimes I steal from my mom a little sherry.

319
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,435
Are you coming to my birthday?

320
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:58,290
Of course! If you ask me.
- Of course.

321
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,513
Whether it was you in the hall?

322
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,849
You're really pretty.

323
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,959
Stop.

324
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:34,159
Stop it!

325
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Get away from me!

326
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,747
Stop it!

327
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,627
What are you laughing?

328
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,818
What do you think?
- What?

329
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,279
It ...

330
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,479
I do not know.

331
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,334
The girl, perhaps a boy.

332
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:09,939
Yes, some of the city below. -What do you think?

333
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,249
I'll tell you what I think.

334
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:14,349
What?

335
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,035
Evil.

336
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,963
Where were you last night?
- With Luka.

337
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:28,300
Right. I am pleased to
You found a friend.

338
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,080
Lively companion.

339
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,300
I do not know what you're talking about.

340
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,324
Then suddenly appears
bodiless hand on the door

341
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:39,102
and then his wife
begun to preobraæuje.

342
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:40,202
Do not talk!

343
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:43,056
Yes, actually it's not bad.
Can be used.

344
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:44,156
What about your family?

345
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:47,576
Then God said good night.

346
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,132
I'm sure she's happy, you have ...

347
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:54,852
such a nasty guy
like you, is not it?

348
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,283
Who are you?

349
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,754
Friend.

350
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:02,466
Well, my friend, it might be
time to hurry home.

351
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:05,711
I just wanted to suggest to you.
- Really?

352
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,972
You shit, you fucking moron!
- Len, stop!

353
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:11,172
Stop ...

354
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:20,117
What do you imagine this? Damn idiot.

355
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,943
Maybe he was right.

356
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,874
And you tell me that?

357
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:27,304
I'm telling you, you should go home.

358
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,668
We had a row.

359
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,421
So what? Go home and make it up to her.

360
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:37,586
I do not know how to do that.
- You are married. That is enough.

361
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,117
Bastard!

362
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,077
I guess I'm not that bad.

363
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:26,247
Do not you ...

364
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,148
You've been drinking.

365
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:33,238
Not so much to realize.

366
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,308
Look what he's done.

367
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:37,838
It seems he wants us to break up.

368
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,360
Then do a good job, right?

369
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,277
Only if we allow him to.

370
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,218
Hi, you must be Sally?

371
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:58,318
Come in, my dear.

372
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:00,125
Did I arrived first?

373
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:05,205
Lucy did not tell you, honey?
Today you will be just the two of you.

374
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,752
Happy birthday.

375
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,865
What is it? Do you like it?

376
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,810
If not, you can not return it.

377
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,010
I love it.

378
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,184
On the nose.

379
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,666
Where is your father?

380
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:34,732
He went to a hooker. Mom tells all ...

381
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:37,907
to work night shift.

382
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,665
Sally, baby, come here.

383
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,582
Sit down, honey.

384
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,506
Can you do me a favor?

385
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,185
Making sure that Lucy
does not go into your house.

386
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,570
All right.

387
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,770
Promise?
- I promise.

388
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,866
Thank you, honey.

389
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:09,066
Is it because of the spirit?

390
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,145
Yeah, about that.

391
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,945
Sally, come here!

392
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,275
Go, baby.

393
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,548
Let's act a group Sweet.

394
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:25,188
I'll be the drummer. You
You'll be Brian Connolly.

395
00:37:25,288 --> 00:37:27,288
Right.

396
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,371
Why are crying?

397
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,085
Are your parents home, my dear?

398
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,817
No.

399
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,317
I do not mind them saèekam?
- What is it?

400
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:21,197
You have an evil spirit in the house,
and I can not get him to leave.

401
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,272
If you want to do it
let go, of course.

402
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,836
Tell parents to
call me, will you?

403
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,036
Right.

404
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,846
Stop it, Len.

405
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,392
Stop it!

406
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,286
Len!

407
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:07,486
Yes, dear?

408
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,476
What's the matter, honey?

409
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,854
What is going on?

410
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,051
Who is this spirit and what the hell he wants?
- Let go of me. I'm tired.

411
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,462
You know more than you
tell me, Miss!

412
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:58,848
Getting dressed up! You're coming with me to the father Clifton.
- I'm not going to go anywhere.

413
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:00,100
Get out of bed!
- Let go of me!

414
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,351
Little bitch!

415
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:03,881
Slow down, please! Come on.

416
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,981
For you I'll take care of it later.

417
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,484
A four-hour morning
honey, he's sleeping now.

418
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,684
I do not care.

419
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Am I to go down?

420
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,691
Yeah, sure, you go.

421
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:31,756
I've got the whole damn community
to help? Jesus Christ!

422
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,476
Jenny, you say
to the spirit of a young girl?

423
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,389
Why did not because of this
came to see me earlier?

424
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:42,174
I thought that you would chase me.

425
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,399
What do you want me to do?
- To free us from it, Father.

426
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:52,986
From what you told me,
It requires an exorcism.

427
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:55,186
Exorcism?

428
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,839
This is a very serious undertaking.

429
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:03,105
I need my license bishops.

430
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,116
God. And what do we do now?

431
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,198
I want to talk to you.

432
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,960
I'm sorry.

433
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,670
It's okay.

434
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,410
Last night I was
too hard on you.

435
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,510
Do you forgive me?

436
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,610
Yes.

437
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,469
Maybe he'll go away by itself.

438
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:32,265
Who knows, maybe it's already gone.

439
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,331
And here we come ... Nirsbi monastery.

440
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,747
Who will go first? - Oliver,
course. - Come on, guys!

441
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,702
And this is the dining room. What's that?

442
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,811
Where are the monks ruèavali, sir.

443
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,380
Very good, Lucy.

444
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,516
They had two meals a day flying
and one in the winter.

445
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,101
And what they ate, sir?

446
00:43:07,201 --> 00:43:09,854
Only the necessary supplies.
Vegetables, meat, bread.

447
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:15,494
I have kept bees for honey. In
that time sugar was not invented.

448
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,900
What do you have?
- Mustard.

449
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,168
What is your problem?
- I love it.

450
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,736
Lesbians!

451
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:37,905
Come on.

452
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,413
I'm going to pee.
- OK.

453
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:45,316
Try not ukvasiš panties.
- Good.

454
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,282
Sally?

455
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:55,482
Sally!

456
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,112
Mr. Pryce!

457
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,475
What is it?
- I'm not allowed to come in.

458
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,480
Why?
- For the Spirit, sir.

459
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,196
I guess you do not believe in that nonsense, is not it?

460
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,715
Come on.

461
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,200
It is true, sir.
She told me.

462
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,572
He wakes up at night and play with her.

463
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:31,996
And that is why it is
always tired, sir.

464
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,418
I think you look
too much tv, miss.

465
00:45:34,518 --> 00:45:36,998
We do not have television, sir.

466
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,004
How do you feel, Sally?

467
00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:50,924
Hello, sir.
- Are you sure?

468
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,851
Lucy will take care of you, and
your mom gets home. Right?

469
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,636
She should not be here.

470
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,134
Okay, but should remain this way.

471
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,260
See you later.

472
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,441
You do not have to stay if you do not.

473
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:42,641
No, it's okay.

474
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,858
Where's the bathroom?
- On the floor.

475
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,490
You have no control?

476
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,285
I had earlier and I wear diapers.
- I am, too.

477
00:46:52,385 --> 00:46:54,485
But not in ten years.

478
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,109
Again dark.
- I have to go.

479
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,526
All right.

480
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,747
Is that you, Sally?

481
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,843
What?

482
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,043
It's nothing.

483
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:57,735
Lucy?

484
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,278
Sally!

485
00:48:59,378 --> 00:49:01,378
Lucy!

486
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:04,843
Sally! Please!
- I try to open it!

487
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,609
Sally!

488
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,489
What happened?

489
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,784
Lucy, come back!

490
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,514
Hi, Sally.

491
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,355
You know why I'm here, is not it?

492
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,467
You did not listen to what
I told you recently?

493
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:44,791
And you promised me, right!

494
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:47,877
It'll be good, right?
- I had to take her to the hospital!

495
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:49,879
Can I see it?
- You can not!

496
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:53,666
And the more you will not continue unless the VIDAS
If you do not want to have to deal with me.

497
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:55,843
Got it?
- Yes.

498
00:49:55,943 --> 00:50:00,431
I thought I was just fine. Because
You were her only friend.

499
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,141
What is going on?

500
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:05,394
Your damn daughter, it is
going on! I asked her to ...

501
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:08,230
Lucy does not bring into the house.
I promised.

502
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,837
I had to take Lucy to the hospital.

503
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:11,442
I had no idea what was going on!

504
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,642
Now you know!

505
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,010
Mom, I'm not. I did not want ...

506
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,782
Fucking little bitch!

507
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:21,247
I'm sorry!
- How could you do that!

508
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,772
Bitch!

509
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,032
Do something to her.

510
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,300
Do not!

511
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,761
Do not! Stop it!

512
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,024
Do not!

513
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,859
Please do!

514
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:03,110
Please!

515
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,310
Please do!

516
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,492
Jenny? My God!
Come on! Hurry up!

517
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,540
Sally.

518
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,013
Is it ringing?
- Yes.

519
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,706
I gotta go.

520
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,027
It can wait five minutes.
Sit down.

521
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:02,642
I want to talk about.

522
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,371
Lucy had mentioned something about you and ...

523
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,477
spirit.

524
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,182
All have a tremendous fear of it,

525
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:17,378
as for the awful things, but
I think it's just lonely.

526
00:53:17,478 --> 00:53:18,346
'It'?
- Yes.

527
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:22,236
The town hall
There is even her picture.

528
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,949
Not as bad as it looks, honey.

529
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,265
What is it?

530
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,734
Oh, my God!

531
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,236
What happened?

532
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,028
Come on! Try it!

533
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,294
Let me feel your sorrow weeping.

534
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,323
Honey?

535
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:01,523
Honey!

536
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,281
Sally?

537
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,079
Sally!

538
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,208
Sally!

539
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,460
Sally!

540
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,104
Sally, my dear, is prehladiæeš.

541
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,677
There, he found me.

542
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,273
Something we took.

543
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,953
Sally, come in, please.

544
00:56:38,053 --> 00:56:41,128
There was lonely.

545
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,100
Odvešæu you here.

546
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,106
Odvešæu you both here.

547
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,379
Do not go near her, she's a witch.

548
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,346
Because of her, Lucy is not in school.

549
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:36,221
Certainly zaèarala, and
She will pee in death.

550
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,598
Give this a chance, honey.

551
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,293
At least no ghosts.
- But I'm not moving in here.

552
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,837
Shall we then stay there and suffer?

553
00:58:18,937 --> 00:58:21,682
What else can we do?
- I'm worried about Sally.

554
00:58:21,782 --> 00:58:23,782
And I am.

555
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:26,720
Just not enough to
gave up their dream home.

556
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,940
Bastard. It is always a
else's fault, right?

557
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,657
Probably my fault
I took you there.

558
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:34,621
But it's not my fault
our spirits fly in the house!

559
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,197
Why do not you take responsibility, Len!
- That's what I'm trying, that's why I brought you here!

560
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:38,941
Then look at all this!

561
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,141
Lord!

562
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,258
It was not easy to catch you, Mr. Maynard.

563
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:52,458
Who are you?

564
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,706
Your daughters teacher.

565
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:57,801
She asked me to find out
something about her spirit.

566
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,869
Really?

567
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:04,441
What I found ...
was the daughter of the local landowners.

568
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,228
Your spirit, that is, she went to a

569
00:59:06,328 --> 00:59:08,145
Castlefield forest where
is lost and gone.

570
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:11,231
Sledeæeg morning she was found.

571
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:14,526
Hanged and half-dead ...
iseèenim with language.

572
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:18,026
She was thirteen. Just
as your daughter.

573
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,216
And now it is in our house?

574
00:59:21,316 --> 00:59:24,206
From what I was told Sally that.

575
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,754
And then what?

576
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,364
Then what?

577
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:30,269
Maybe we should move?

578
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,836
That's what I wanted!

579
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:35,163
What prevents you?
- My wife!

580
00:59:35,263 --> 00:59:37,004
I'm sure they watched
that differently if

581
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:38,593
She apologized to you
what I am to you.

582
00:59:38,693 --> 00:59:41,962
It is now our already Lien thing.

583
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,830
After all, why do you
interested in this?

584
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,186
Concerns of teachers for their pupils.

585
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:53,140
I need to look at their problems.
Sally is a very special girl.

586
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,340
I see.

587
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,251
So that's the question, is not it?

588
00:59:58,351 --> 00:59:59,237
What's this?

589
00:59:59,337 --> 01:00:01,491
It would not be the first time that the teacher ...

590
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:04,226
Students attacked the beautiful, is not it?

591
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:13,447
Read it. In that case,
tomorrow be a little more reasonable.

592
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,907
What do you see?

593
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,694
What is the decision, Father?

594
01:00:38,794 --> 01:00:41,793
He believes that there is insufficient
arguments for doing so.

595
01:00:41,893 --> 01:00:45,123
So, that's it?
- I'm afraid so.

596
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:47,885
And what, if I move?

597
01:00:47,985 --> 01:00:50,580
<i> It will not be the end of the world, is not it? </ i>

598
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,657
Feel free to scroll. The Church can
be a great comfort in these ...

599
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,383
You have to do something.

600
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,382
And lose the priesthood?

601
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,589
I'd like that, would not you?

602
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,370
I found some things of the spirit ...

603
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:29,194
and tried to talk to your father.

604
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:31,394
Come, come.

605
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,318
You'll be all right?

606
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,156
See you tomorrow.

607
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,514
I'm sorry that you were killed.

608
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:09,990
But it is time to leave me in peace.

609
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:30,797
Lucy!

610
01:02:30,897 --> 01:02:32,997
Come on!

611
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:26,896
The thing that belonged
deceased would be very useful.

612
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,613
This is our home.

613
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,255
We need your help.

614
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:47,507
I already gave the answer to your wife.

615
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:49,092
He wants another answer.

616
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:53,180
It's not possible. Lost
I would priesthood.

617
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,950
Anyway, it would be lost,
when this is released.

618
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,868
Who is this picture?
- It does not matter.

619
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:09,271
Yes, the world is a little less,
But what to do?

620
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:12,157
Blackmail is a serious
violation, g. Maynard.

621
01:04:12,257 --> 01:04:15,327
Yeah, fuck rooms Pets and assistants!
- Even as a Catholic priest!

622
01:04:15,427 --> 01:04:16,912
What is she doing in this picture?

623
01:04:17,012 --> 01:04:19,331
At this ... She Klee.

624
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:21,531
Yes, Klee.

625
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,587
Please talk with us.

626
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,837
Do we understand?

627
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,777
And why you will not talk to us?

628
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,975
Are you dumb?

629
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,409
Will you go to Veena light?

630
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,683
You've got some unfinished business here?

631
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,077
With who?

632
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,038
Len?

633
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,543
Jenny?

634
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,214
Sally?

635
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,550
Oh, baby!

636
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,221
Is she in danger?

637
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,891
From who?

638
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,071
Tell me!

639
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:24,906
Tell me!

640
01:06:25,006 --> 01:06:27,006
No!

641
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,609
Sally!

642
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,705
Get away from her! Get away from her!

643
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:42,048
Sally immediately take away.
- Come on, baby!

644
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:45,377
Come on, hurry up!
- Come with me.

645
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:50,046
I'm sorry.

646
01:06:50,096 --> 01:06:52,096
I Razoèarao you.

647
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,477
Simply, they are too much for us.

648
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:55,577
'They'?

649
01:06:55,677 --> 01:06:59,297
There is more than one ghost in this house.

650
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,033
I felt sympathetic presence.

651
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,729
And no one who is evil.

652
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,450
Yes.

653
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,960
And this is the presence of well-intentioned
a young girl who was raised ...

654
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,672
Poltergeist majority of these activities,

655
01:07:14,772 --> 01:07:17,175
with the intent to scare and drive away.

656
01:07:17,275 --> 01:07:20,704
Not to hurt you, but to protect you.

657
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,871
What others like?

658
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:45,654
It was not the first.
There were others before her.

659
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,187
Peasant women.

660
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,070
All have been done respectively
silent, just like her.

661
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,238
Iseèeni their tongues.

662
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,162
But she was educated.

663
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,223
Before he died,

664
01:08:05,323 --> 01:08:09,503
managed to write
description of his attackers.

665
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,924
And who was that?

666
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:27,745
It was a monk from the monastery Nirsbi,

667
01:08:27,845 --> 01:08:31,330
who prayed over nevinošæu
young girls.

668
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:34,627
He could have cost the church
nezapamæene shame.

669
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:40,383
Because the cards for him and hanged
I secretly buried.

670
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,097
Thank you for apologized.

671
01:08:42,197 --> 01:08:44,297
Now I'm talking to.

672
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:19,956
What is it?

673
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:22,300
I think it's better to go home now.

674
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,801
I thought you'd help us out?

675
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:27,011
I did my part, right? So ...

676
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:32,072
What will you say when Rita
know that you are a coward?

677
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:41,505
You are a very ruthless
man, Len Maynard.

678
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,834
Under no circumstances does not
hesitate to answer.

679
01:09:53,934 --> 01:09:56,484
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

680
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,829
Then points.

681
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,219
All holy saints of God ...

682
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,049
Answer!

683
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,385
Pray for us.

684
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,440
From all evil, deliver us, O Lord.

685
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:38,155
Of all the sins of sudden
and unexpected death.

686
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,153
Deliver us.

687
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,738
Hear our prayers for help.

688
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:24,193
Carry terror, Lord,
beasts that destroy thy vineyard.

689
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:29,080
Look at the Cross of the Lord. Run,
enemy force.

690
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,603
Here is terribly cold.

691
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:36,523
I bind them and cast into the abyss ...

692
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,695
Damn ...

693
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,535
Come on, after you.
- Go!

694
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:15,313
This is your fucking house!
- Get up!

695
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,128
He went there.

696
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,006
No matter what you say.

697
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,935
Your place is empty.

698
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,535
Go and stay in a snake pit.

699
01:12:35,635 --> 01:12:36,501
Shit!

700
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,826
Go down and crawling with them.

701
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:46,693
I will not wait you here
all night, cowards?

702
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:00,377
Go away, I order you!

703
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,550
Blood of martyrs commanded you!

704
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,385
Continue.

705
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:13,740
Go on!

706
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,440
Nereðuju all you servants of the faith is Christian.

707
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:22,997
Exalted Christ commanded you!
- Exalted Christ commanded you!

708
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,816
Thank you, Father.

709
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:41,189
And no offense.

710
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,523
Negative!

711
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:56,584
If any of this occurs,
I will personally give you tearing their skin.

712
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:12,672
I'm sure that later
enjoy your images.

713
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,426
Give me some.

714
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,395
You're still here, are not you?

715
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,194
Mom!

716
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,532
Mom!

717
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,049
Mom!

718

722
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:05,155
Sally!

723
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,912
Sally!

724
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,088
Oslobodiæu, baby!

725

01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,800
Help me!

730
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,344

731
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,850

732

733
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,260
Sally!

734
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,460
Sally!

735
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,556
My God! Sally, are you okay?

736
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,476
Let's go!

737
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:31,576
Come on, sweetheart.

738
01:21:31,676 --> 01:21:33,726
Get out of here.

739
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,140
Quickly!
