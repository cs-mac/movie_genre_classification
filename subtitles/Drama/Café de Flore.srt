00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,754
At dusk, the hills of Hollywood,

4
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,550
light barrier often beautifully saturated Technicolor tones.

5
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,386
The homes of the stars, late 30s,

6
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,638
was said to sumptuous, were.

7
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,435
At cocktail parties and dinners, the upper crust of the film world

8
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:43,104
chained drinks, peddled rumors,

9
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,690
doing business and exchanged gossip.

10
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:49,694
No feast of the Most Hollywood was successful without Phil Stern,

11
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,238
an all-powerful agent,

12
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,115
and his lovely wife, Karen.

13
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:58,787
Brilliant, dynamic, Stern was invariably surrounded by his court.

14
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,706
I saw Paul Muni on stage in New York

15
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:05,084
and I detected the first that go well in film.

16
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:09,964
I knew long before everyone, he was an actor.

17
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:13,134
- You've got the idea. - I knew he would fit.

18
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,094
What quality do you view him?

19
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,138
Slowly, with this glass.

20
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,265
The party is successful, what do you want!

21
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:20,558
Excuse me.

22
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,603
- A telephone call, Mr. Stern. - For me ?

23
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,606
I answer. I expect a call from Ginger Rogers.

24
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,691
I told him that I would be here.

25
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,487
She was disappointed by his manager, so who knows?

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,955
Phil Stern to the device.

27
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,249
Phil, it's Rose.

28
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,375
Rose ?

29
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,876
This s ?? s.

30
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,420
You've unearthed here?

31
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,798
Your housekeeper gave me the number.

32
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:53,258
What is happening ?

33
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,511
Bobby leaves the jewelry Marty.

34
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,680
He'll go to Hollywood.

35
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:02,308
I was hoping that you find a place in your agency.

36
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:03,768
Who ?

37
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,144
Bobby.

38
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:06,646
My son.

39
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,106
Your nephew.

40
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:09,399
Phil.

41
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:12,443
It is expected that Warner dug up the rights of the book.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,529
Bette Davis would be perfect.

43
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:17,031
If they are right, we'll talk.

44
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:21,494
Meanwhile, to wrap up, it's like turning a damp squib.

45
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,664
- Well, I finished it. - Hang up, talk.

46
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,045
He does not know anyone down there.

47
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,506
But damn, why did he come?

48
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,426
I do not know what to do for him,

49
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,761
and this appeal will ruin you.

50
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,263
Listening,

51
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,681
I have to leave you.

52
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:45,059
Ginger Rogers tries to contact me.

53
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,271
Two weeks later, a taxi from the train station

54
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,733
stopped in Hollywood before the Ali Baba Motel.

55
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,154
Pulled out a young man full of hope to build his life:

56
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,198
Robert Jacob Dorfman.

57
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,492
Bobby Dorfman, du Bronx,

58
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,162
away from home for the first time.

59
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,041
Son of a poor jeweler, Marty Dorfman,

60
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,084
and his whiny wife, Rose,

61
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:14,047
quarreling about everything, especially about Phil Stern.

62
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,506
It is not Jewish, this man.

63
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:16,966
What about you ?

64
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,927
Are not you an example.

65
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,095
Not you pray, you fast not,

66
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,265
and you is not got the noggin of a traditional Jew.

67
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,559
T'es idiot!

68
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,772
Then came the ?? s younger sister, Evelyn, the teacher,

69
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,650
married to Leonard, the nerd,

70
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,110
the teacher, the Communist.

71
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,780
"Religion is the opium of the people."

72
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,074
It raised big questions.

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,241
Un "human being".

74
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,744
The perfect companion for Evelyn.

75
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,873
And finally, the older brother, Ben.

76
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,751
To sum up, Ben was a gangster.

77
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:52,961
Bobby loved

78
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:57,131
and wanted to see in its operations that supply restaurants.

79
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,259
But in addition to providing bars and nightclubs,

80
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,804
Ben led a less blameless life.

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,312
In short, a glorious day on Wilshire Boulevard,

82
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,483
Bobby Dorfman heads to his office Uncle Phil Stern.

83
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,786
Hello, I just see Phil Stern.

84
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,746
- You have an appointment ? - Yes.

85
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:30,999
I'm Bobby Dorfman, his nephew.

86
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,126
He is in a meeting.

87
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,877
Sit down.

88
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,603
Monsieur Dorfman ?

89
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,857
It will not be available today.

90
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,067
We had to deal with an emergency.

91
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,902
Can you come back on Friday?

92
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,196
It's in three days.

93
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,990
Yes, 19.

94
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,367
Thank you.

95
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,759
Much love to Sid

96
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,013
Sorry,

97
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,307
Stern had to go to Acapulco.

98
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:32,810
It was a promise for the birthday of his wife.

99
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,313
It goes from Mexico to Chicago for business!

100
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,607
In 3 weeks, impossible to see!

101
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:41,027
M.G.M., Ginger Rogers, Ronald Coleman...

102
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:44,280
That's why Phil Stern is someone.

103
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:47,158
He will come back, then make yourself a reason.

104
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:51,162
I'll pass your brother. He came to eat latkes.

105
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,538
Take the handset.

106
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,291
So old, you're already bored?

107
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,585
I spent 3 weeks, never again.

108
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:01,214
It's nice but it's not New York. I do not know anybody.

109
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,134
The danish are called "rolled sugar" and serves coffee first,

110
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,554
barely seated before the orange juice.

111
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,099
I'll give you numbers.

112
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,603
Toni White, Klondike 0079.

113
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,396
She knows lots of girls.

114
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,108
I know you're shy. No need to talk.

115
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,526
Just give $ 20.

116
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,361
She knows champions.

117
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:27,240
Never. It's not erotic, commercial exchange.

118
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,202
It's ugly, but sometimes we do not choosy.

119
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,411
Good bye.

120
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,747
This is a nice, that's fine.

121
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:38,042
But Uncle to the nuts poses.

122
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,544
He is busy.

123
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:43,005
You know what that means, you.

124
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,425
He eats with Fred Astaire and Gary Cooper.

125
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,885
Unbelievable.

126
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:48,845
Here.

127
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,264
Delicious. Buy yourself a hat.

128
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,473
What do you mean ?

129
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,184
1 500 $ ?

130
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,395
So go to Florida a few days.

131
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:02,567
I refuse this money if you did something wrong.

132
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,946
We think buying a nightclub, it would reassure you?

133
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,449
As long as everything is done properly ...

134
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,286
- You'll know when? - Have to see if the owner sells.

135
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,912
We try to convince him.

136
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,431
If asked politely, people listen.

137
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,020
At Ali Baba Motel,

138
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:40,938
at the corner of Grace and Yucca streets.

139
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:45,318
Room 222, Bobby Dorfman.

140
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,777
22 h 15 ?

141
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,780
That sounds good, 22 h 15.

142
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,532
No matter, really.

143
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,160
Blonde, brunette ... what she wants.

144
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,204
Well, I will wait.

145
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,354
It's that room.

146
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,147
Your friend was wrong chamber.

147
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,398
Slim ! Sorry.

148
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,692
Hello, come in. Sorry.

149
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,695
What you damn?

150
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,239
Sorry, I hurt noted.

151
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,574
I live here, everyone will know.

152
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,369
- I look like a professional? - And how ! Are you kidding?

153
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,287
Where were you ? I went to bed.

154
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:41,707
I popped, sorry. My name is Candy.

155
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,043
Delay, wrong room ...

156
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,711
I'll take it.

157
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,213
Serve yourself.

158
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,423
You know, I do not usually.

159
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,051
I can tell you a secret?

160
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,721
I never charged, we are in the same boat.

161
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,932
I'm your first customer?

162
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,475
Yes.

163
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,394
I might screw up ...

164
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,688
Toni sent me a beginner.

165
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:04,981
For the moment.

166
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,776
It do not mind taking that path?

167
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,319
I have to work.

168
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,321
My acting career does not take off.

169
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,615
Maybe, but think.

170
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,325
I have no money.

171
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,494
Listen ...

172
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,830
No need to lie, I pay you.

173
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,290
No, I'm ready.

174
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,709
Not on my conscience, is too much.

175
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,294
That's fine. I decided.

176
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,838
Thank you ! You believe the dentist?

177
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,507
No ! You are not a fatso frica.

178
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,801
You are tense and suddenly too.

179
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,804
I'm not afraid to sleep, I go out a torrid history.

180
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,848
But I never paid.

181
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,183
In this regard, you pay in advance.

182
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,978
There is nothing erotic to it mechanically.

183
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,646
Take them and go.

184
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,232
You not want to try me?

185
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:52,194
I'm so alone that would have been enough talk, but I'm exhausted.

186
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,030
I'm not pretty?

187
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,657
Yes, it will. It's me, I have a headache.

188
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,494
Here there are so many beautiful girls.

189
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,539
They land everywhere dreaming of cinema.

190
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,876
You do not want me?

191
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:11,047
I'm not in the mood, sorry. This happened.

192
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,341
Oh no, do not cry.

193
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,469
Well, come on! If this is so serious, we go.

194
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,512
I just want out.

195
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,348
You're not made for this trade.

196
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,140
So say !

197
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,808
I was a little late,

198
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,852
but here, it is you who stand back.

199
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,813
You tense up me. Give me the bottle.

200
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,066
We undress and go to bed

201
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,319
I can not, it's too mechanical. Here, your $ 20.

202
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,696
No, I'm leaving. Sorry I ruined everything.

203
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,908
It's me, I should not have. It's not my style.

204
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:42,453
Nothing to do with your physical, do not take offense.

205
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:47,041
- You do not want? - If you insist so much, let's go!

206
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,209
Let's go.

207
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,127
Come.

208
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,881
Here, take the money.

209
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,885
So your name is Cindy?

210
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,553
This is Candy.

211
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,305
Candy ?

212
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,891
It's a real name? Is Candice?

213
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,102
No, not a real name.

214
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,187
But it's exciting, right?

215
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,397
If one wants.

216
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,650
My real name is Shirley.

217
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,902
Shirley Garfein.

218
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,279
Are you Jewish?

219
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,573
Yes and so ?

220
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,575
A Jewish whore. It exists ?

221
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:24,453
Oh, I'm good ! I'm not a career!

222
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,373
Take notes and go, please.

223
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,041
But what is it?

224
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,709
Nothing, I can not ...

225
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,170
But are you sure?

226
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,841
Very. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Do not tell anyone.

227
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,884
- Really sorry. - It's nothing.

228
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:41,804
Down the hall.

229
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:48,978
Between !

230
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,689
Sorry to all these setbacks.

231
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,358
What hell, Howard Hawks at Chicago.

232
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,277
It's okay, Uncle Phil.

233
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,195
Assisi.

234
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,284
So...

235
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,244
tell me.

236
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,621
Rose said you want to live here?

237
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:08,622
Yes.

238
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,417
I could not work with my father.

239
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,378
It was mind-numbing. I want a more interesting life.

240
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,507
Hello Paul.

241
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,677
What a mess. Adolphe Menjou wants to release the film.

242
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,097
I tell you this Friday. You will be poker?

243
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,599
We will speak again.

244
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,477
I am appointment.

245
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,478
Good.

246
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,025
Incredible past two weeks.

247
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,362
This city is fueled by ego, Ben.

248
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:43,240
Me, it's Bobby. Ben is my brother, it says.

249
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,700
What we will not care ...

250
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,285
What can I do for you ?

251
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:47,369
A moment.

252
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,289
Lord...

253
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,083
Absolutely. Yes.

254
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,586
Friday lunch at the Brown Derby.

255
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:00,549
Harry leads. Joel McCrea would be ideal to lead.

256
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,426
Absolutely, Friday.

257
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,346
And do not cancel under a phony pretext.

258
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,182
What do you think of Joel McCrea?

259
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,728
It's a big movie star.

260
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:16,273
He knows how to give the drama a light touch.

261
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,983
Ample range game.

262
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,490
What do you want to do ? You settle here?

263
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,119
Do you have an idea to run me? Perhaps here in the agency?

264
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,955
Here, like what?

265
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,456
What remain.

266
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,959
I really need a job.

267
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,420
We have nothing for now, anyway Mail.

268
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,589
Mail, that ...

269
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,175
Okay, for starters.

270
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,344
If a vacancy occurs, I warn you.

271
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,596
There is nothing now?

272
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,056
Unless...

273
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,350
you work for me.

274
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,354
We can find you a title.

275
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,439
A horse, it can be used.

276
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,983
Anything goes.

277
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,484
You know people here?

278
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:02,361
No one.

279
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,280
Living in the hotel, it is fatal.

280
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,991
Karen and I invite you to dinner.

281
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,867
It organizes parties.

282
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,288
of lunches. You will know friendly people.

283
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,081
Vonnie, you can come?

284
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,917
I'll find something to occupy you.

285
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,169
It's very nice, Uncle Phil.

286
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,005
Stops with "uncle". This is Phil.

287
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,840
Let the discrete piston.

288
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,676
Here's my nephew ...

289
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,428
Bobby.

290
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,513
He just arrived.

291
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,474
Help him to identify, know the city.

292
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,976
It is a little lost.

293
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,477
Willingly.

294
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,272
It could be this weekend. Saturday ?

295
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,982
Yes Perfect.

296
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,151
Great. Enchanted.

297
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,446
On leaving, leave me your details.

298
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,164
She looks kind.

299
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,500
Dear Evelyn, a few words to say hello.

300
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,670
I'd call but between parents, you and Ben,

301
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,340
long distance calls will ruin us.

302
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,425
Ben sent me in, I'm doing.

303
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,676
I work for Phil.

304
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:12,306
In fact, he will invite me to dinner, introduce myself to people.

305
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,351
His secretary will show me the city this weekend.

306
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,102
She is very beautiful.

307
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,937
Dear Bobby,

308
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,564
It's raining today.

309
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,067
Very nice, but a little melancholy.

310
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,694
Leonard sees the poignancy of life:

311
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,781
accept that it has no meaning,

312
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,659
and even rejoice in that absence of meaning.

313
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,704
Beats me, but mom summed it by saying:

314
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,040
"Live each day as the last.

315
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,042
"One day it will be."

316
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,388
- Thank you very much. - It's natural.

317
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,892
- So ? - So...

318
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,478
Where to start ?

319
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,315
The villas of Beverly Hills, the stars mansions razzle-the ?? it?

320
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,775
It's okay with me.

321
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,736
The house of Spencer Tracy.

322
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,031
One of the most beautiful, not too hast thou seen.

323
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,574
And then, who is it?

324
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,575
I do not know.

325
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,869
A bit pretentious, no?

326
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,037
Really ?

327
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,665
They make me all the effect of the Taj Mahal.

328
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,542
I see very well.

329
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,921
That's the home of Joan Crawford.

330
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,382
Breathtaking. And this car!

331
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,552
- I saw one day. - That is true ?

332
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,429
This is a client of your uncle.

333
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,597
- How is she ? - Magnificent.

334
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,892
One immediately feels the star from another planet.

335
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,896
I can not imagine what it feels to be on another planet.

336
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,232
That must be fun time.

337
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,527
But I prefer to stay on land.

338
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,743
The house of Robert Taylor.

339
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,954
If you could live in one of these houses,

340
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,414
which would it be?

341
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,502
It would not be in Beverly Hills.

342
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,129
Why not ?

343
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,339
I love living on the coast.

344
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,218
My apartment is near the ocean, I often contemplate.

345
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,475
I pity those who need these palaces to feel important.

346
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,644
I say that now.

347
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,439
I like the girls here, ambitious ...

348
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,691
You wanted to be a movie star?

349
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,276
I loved to play.

350
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,277
In high school.

351
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,612
Where it was ?

352
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,489
Nebraska.

353
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,826
I imagined in Hollywood, in a house with swimming pool,

354
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,037
paving with the beautiful people.

355
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,830
From the first.

356
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,666
But I grew up a bit and ...

357
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,212
I understand how this life was absurd.

358
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,090
Delightful, charming,

359
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,385
indifferent to the lure of an attractive city

360
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,347
who worshiped celebrity and record revenues,

361
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,015
Vonnie the subjugated,

362
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,519
even if he dared ask if she had a boyfriend.

363
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,897
To quote his brother, the great philosopher:

364
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,442
"It matters that it is better to ignore the answer."

365
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,863
Meanwhile, he performed small tasks of his uncle,

366
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,742
and only the thought that she would be free the next Saturday

367
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,118
and he would see

368
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,538
gave him a motivation.

369
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,573
- And now your two beers. - Thank you.

370
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,741
What a great movie!

371
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,952
- I loved it, and you? - Of course.

372
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,704
J'adore Barbara Stanwyck.

373
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,915
It's nice here. You were right, it's a greasy spoon.

374
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,042
Not like the Brown Derby or Chasen's,

375
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,421
where to make his entrance, sitting at the right table,

376
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,799
next to Mr. Goldwyn or James Cagney.

377
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,759
You heard Mr. Goldwyn talk?

378
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,012
a variety of comic Looks.

379
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,890
He has a terrible accent, it's very funny.

380
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,391
That surprised me.

381
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,561
What are you thinking about ?

382
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,105
The fact that ...

383
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,815
you're very beautiful.

384
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,025
Thank you.

385
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,280
It better not.

386
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,782
I'm with someone.

387
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,535
How is he ?

388
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,829
Doug is a journalist.

389
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,167
I thought, as you have lots of free time ...

390
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,502
He travels a lot.

391
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,214
But I love spending time with you, if it suits you.

392
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,926
You're lovely, are you already said?

393
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:03,430
You remind me of a deer caught in the headlights of a car.

394
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,474
Thank you.

395
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,770
If I was your boyfriend, I would not be traveling.

396
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,189
Or I'll emmènerais.

397
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,900
I hope it embrace you and all that ...

398
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,070
It's personal.

399
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,113
I ensure your wellbeing.

400
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,823
- Thank you ! - That is true.

401
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,451
- What would I do without you ? - I dunno.

402
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,670
Sweetheart !

403
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,965
- You know Karen. - It was only crossed.

404
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,675
Phil made your praise.

405
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,719
He wanted to invite you to a lunch for a long time.

406
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,722
Thank you very much. I am very grateful to him.

407
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,016
I may be good news.

408
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,144
I thought I saw Joan Blondell. It's possible ?

409
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,229
It is there.

410
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,190
It is said that Louis is an ink blood

411
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,151
because his new film will be a furnace.

412
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,862
Spencer is unheard of. As always, no?

413
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,781
They do not review their money.

414
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,866
Gentlemen, welcome Bobby Dorfman.

415
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,034
Comment va ?

416
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,121
Mike talked about the fiasco that awaits MGM

417
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,123
Howard, Rad, Steve !

418
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,333
It's not the best news of your life?

419
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,210
Howard Fox, Bobby Dorfman.

420
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,878
He won two Oscars.

421
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,630
- Congratulations! - Thank you.

422
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,757
My name is unknown, I am writer.

423
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,300
Rad Taylor, Bobby Dorfman.

424
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,554
Rad and Steve are New Yorkers, like you.

425
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,305
Steve manages our law firm.

426
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,683
Right, I manage their law firm,

427
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,727
but I have a question, Phil:

428
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,604
you said that I would see Greta Garbo. Where is she ?

429
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,897
It is impossible.

430
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,150
She wants to be alone, it is well known!

431
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,861
- Bobby, who would you like to see? - Babe Ruth.

432
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:41,987
Aside from all of us.

433
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,532
She sleeps as she wants, she will not have this role.

434
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,117
You saw her in a swimsuit?

435
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,829
It has huge thighs. No MGM thighs

436
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:55,584
Your faithful reporter Hollywood called you as promised.

437
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,753
Yes it's me.

438
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,465
You're lucky that your boss does not prompt you to these sauteries.

439
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,842
That's all you hate.

440
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:08,055
We talk about the medium, place names, one stabbed in the back ...

441
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:12,017
But there are faces you saw on the screen.

442
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,018
Me ?

443
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,562
I'm between boredom and fascination.

444
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:20,567
I would rather we eat tacos in your little Mexican bar.

445
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,613
If you were here, we could laugh together.

446
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,449
No, of course. Go ahead.

447
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,743
We'll talk later.

448
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,926
Look good, I Appear.

449
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:49,930
It's fascinating, I recognize so many celebrities.

450
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,724
Seek unknown 10 years.

451
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,601
No ! It's you ?

452
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,853
That's me, next to DW Griffith.

453
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,230
Yikes!

454
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,691
I grew up here but I married an inveterate New Yorker.

455
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,319
Exact. What are you doing down there?

456
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,071
I have a modeling agency.

457
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:06,947
Oh yes ?

458
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,991
There are more beautiful girls in Hollywood or New York?

459
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,327
This is what will determine your choice?

460
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,704
No, it's curiosity.

461
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,498
There's more here.

462
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,668
You may find wrong one for you.

463
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:23,171
Alas, the most beautiful for me here someone already has.

464
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,339
It's life !

465
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,675
Hence the success of musical Rodgers & Hart.

466
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:30,345
I'm tipsy. I never mix champagne and bagels.

467
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,888
Welcome to Hollywood.

468
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,473
What is your branch?

469
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,310
Trivial tasks. But I do not see a great future.

470
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,147
- We met down. - Absolutely.

471
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,650
Our New York friend like no return.

472
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:49,114
The unrequited love kills more people than tuberculosis.

473
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,282
I believe you !

474
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,200
- I am joking. - I know, but ...

475
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,579
If you return to New York always lonely,

476
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,624
call us and I will introduce young goddesses

477
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,918
who feel as alone as you,

478
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,795
despite their dream measurements.

479
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,214
Thank you, I will take you perhaps literally.

480
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,384
If you are bored, come to the projection

481
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:13,013
a film in which I had the good idea to invest.

482
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,847
Willingly.

483
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,724
- Does that mean? - Obviously. Thank you.

484
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,894
Take your friend, if you tear her lover.

485
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,397
There you are ! I was looking for you.

486
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,524
I have good news.

487
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:28,945
Vonnie...

488
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,406
You are free tonight ?

489
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:32,574
Non.

490
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,285
I wanted that party something.

491
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,329
- What? - My promotion.

492
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,081
And my increase. I will read the scenarios.

493
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,833
It's fantastic !

494
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,627
I'm delighted for you !

495
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,838
Just a projection. I was invited by a ...

496
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,256
largest producer.

497
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:49,466
it can be returned?

498
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,594
Of course, but I was hoping to offer you champagne.

499
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,013
Having dinner...

500
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,056
Wednesday ?

501
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,390
Yes OK.

502
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:58,808
done deal.

503
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,810
We will go in a very classy place.

504
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,731
I would have me dressed up, all that. Why not...

505
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,108
at your home ? I'll cook.

506
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,236
You know how to cook ?

507
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,031
No pheasant or blown, but ...

508
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,450
spaghetti and meatballs?

509
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,285
Yes, very well.

510
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,788
You will make me listen to your jazz records.

511
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,123
My mother made the spaghetti.

512
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,292
But do all Jewish overcook

513
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,544
to be sure to kill the microbes.

514
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,505
I prefer your side.

515
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:33,218
It was his first private screening at a producer,

516
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,636
and the film was good.

517
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,847
He would have liked Vonnie sharing it with him.

518
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,810
But she told him early on that she was somebody.

519
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,589
Sorry for the delay. It was driving badly, it's crazy!

520
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,926
Punctual or late, you're still beautiful.

521
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,429
I'd like a glass of white wine.

522
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,514
It is the light of the candles.

523
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,350
I took my decision.

524
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,063
I'll talk to Karen on his return to Toronto.

525
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,024
His mother is much better.

526
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,114
That's really what you want?

527
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,616
I can not go to hide,

528
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,454
stealing moments in hotels and dark bars.

529
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,372
I'm in love with you.

530
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:49,586
You've told me, but I fear I have the impression of breaking

531
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,046
ton couple.

532
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,923
To be honest,

533
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:57,761
my relationship with Karen was long and rather successful.

534
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,638
The I would leave if I had not met you?

535
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,223
Probably not.

536
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,351
But I met you.

537
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,898
Of course I want to be with you. I hate this double game.

538
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,984
I know it is unfair to make you undergo that.

539
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,528
You were so understanding.

540
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,572
Too understanding, actually.

541
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,701
I love you, Vonnie.

542
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,748
C ?? My heart is racing when you tell me that.

543
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,085
Joy, hope. No anxiety.

544
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,420
Yes, joy.

545
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,839
I am so excited.

546
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,551
Dare I kiss you?

547
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,430
Dare to.

548
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,729
Dear Bobby,

549
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,816
So you met a girl crazy you are.

550
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:56,069
You wrote that it was a small journalist friend.

551
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,279
My advice: do not be discouraged.

552
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,990
Send her flowers and perseveres.

553
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:05,787
Even very sensitive to gift a woman like touches.

554
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,789
To the wise...

555
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:11,418
As for Ben, he invests in nightclubs.

556
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,962
What does he know of the club management?

557
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,925
It is entangled with the unions, but he knows coax.

558
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,687
Ben Dorfman, Benny for short.

559
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:33,398
Ten typewriters stolen this weekend!

560
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:37,444
Always in trouble with the police and has been since the school.

561
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:41,281
In his Jewish neighborhood, most of the children studied.

562
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,658
Many became doctors or lawyers.

563
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,911
But not all. Some Jews became bullies.

564
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,581
Harry Cantor owes me $ 6,000.

565
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,000
Grab them, you will have the third.

566
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:56,004
If it is this week, eat a good steak at Duffinetti.

567
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:00,842
He refused to chain, like his father, menial tasks.

568
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:05,096
His buddy Abe touched 20 cents an hour for lugging heavy boxes.

569
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:09,517
Him $ 50 "maintenance" fur in the neighborhood tailors.

570
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,770
Tony Rondalino taught them to steer craps players.

571
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:16,316
Being illegally, they never wore complaint.

572
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,610
Ben shared the winnings with Tony.

573
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,197
One evening he was in his car with Tony.

574
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,115
He had been able to afford it!

575
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:26,409
A guy can not calm

576
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,287
put his gun through the window and killed Tony.

577
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,540
The statement, in the street, passing by violence.

578
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,251
He eventually buy the club La Terra.

579
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,045
He wore beautiful costumes,

580
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:41,132
but basically it remained Benny, the street urchin.

581
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,553
Welcome back.

582
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,515
I envy you. New York miss him a lot.

583
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,644
Without me, my agency may decline.

584
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,478
I have no doubt about it.

585
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,146
Good luck to all.

586
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,149
She comes to my house to cook spaghetti this week.

587
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,734
I tell stories ...

588
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:03,029
If I need wine, music, candles ...

589
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,074
Oh, she loves you if she sees you as much.

590
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,825
Steve and I are with you.

591
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,994
- Add new. - You too.

592
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,980
Bobby, I can not come tonight.

593
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,442
Because of an unexpected emergency. Let go.

594
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:47,323
But I had prepared everything, opened the wine to breathe.

595
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,994
I'll catch up, I promise.

596
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,621
My gift to our first year.

597
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:36,956
Look ...

598
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,877
A letter written and signed

599
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,670
Rudolph Valentino.

600
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,049
This is paper.

601
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:48,468
The first year of paper.

602
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,513
I found an incredible gift shop.

603
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,808
I can not, Vonnie.

604
00:32:58,436 --> 00:32:59,479
What?

605
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:02,774
To leave Karen.

606
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,739
It was you who wanted to ...

607
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,616
We should no longer see.

608
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,874
I'm sick.

609
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,377
I thought I could tell him ...

610
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,963
But we've been married 25 years, we have children.

611
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,093
You do not have to justify yourself.

612
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,346
I want to stop this double life, you do not deserve that.

613
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,556
Karen non plus, moi non plus.

614
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:36,933
Okay.

615
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,395
It's not that I do not love you ...

616
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,147
This is too difficult.

617
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,403
And why continue ...

618
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,989
I understand. You were going to tell me that, right?

619
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,702
Something like that.

620
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,205
Look, I know ...

621
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,624
neither of us can do ...

622
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,085
forget what happened.

623
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:09,173
I will keep the secret, if that's what worries you.

624
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,175
I never talk to us ...

625
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,315
My God ! You're okay ?

626
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,234
It's too late for dinner, right?

627
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,277
Having dinner ?

628
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:30,862
It's okay ?

629
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,906
I do not want to abuse your kindness.

630
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,868
You do not abuses. What is it ?

631
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,703
I not stop crying, it's silly.

632
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,079
Tell me.

633
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,791
My boyfriend left me down.

634
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,254
Sorry. It's certain ?

635
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,173
Yes, it's all over.

636
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,592
I sympathize. What happened ?

637
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:58,264
I offered a gift to celebrate our year paper.

638
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:02,226
A letter from Valentino, gorgeous,

639
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,562
signed and written by Valentino.

640
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:05,730
This is adorable.

641
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:09,734
He can not leave his wife. I know I did.

642
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,112
- It could not last. - I did not know he was married.

643
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,074
- You give me a glass of white wine? - Of course.

644
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,661
If it has not evaporated. He breathes for hours.

645
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,332
Sorry, that happens in this motel. It will come back.

646
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,251
I had no idea he was married, but ...

647
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,796
I never feel those things.

648
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,674
This is one of your charming qualities, your naivety.

649
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:34,801
Thank you.

650
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,511
You had to really love it.

651
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,429
He was wonderful.

652
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:39,972
I'm sure.

653
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,518
I will forget.

654
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,604
To be honest...

655
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,148
I'm torn.

656
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:52,985
I pity you, but I'm glad you're free.

657
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,112
But by pure selfishness.

658
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,450
I always knew what you felt for me,

659
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,118
and it flatters me.

660
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:04,163
I fell in love when I saw you.

661
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,165
A real movie star.

662
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,127
I do not want to fall in love.

663
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,505
It just happened, let yourself time.

664
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:15,925
I'll get over it. I am less fragile usual.

665
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:19,095
But I was not expecting it at all.

666
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,973
That is the risk, with a married man.

667
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:24,016
That's what my roommate.

668
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,227
But chamboulait me.

669
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,437
It is incredibly alive ...

670
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,731
and really exciting.

671
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:34,235
You made imaginative, for this gift.

672
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:37,113
A love letter to Rudolph Valentino, touching.

673
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,614
I was too.

674
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,409
Next year, I will offer you perhaps a letter

675
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,078
of your favorite actress Barbara Stanwyck.

676
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,124
It's cute.

677
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:55,089
Vonnie was saddened by the end of his story,

678
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,633
but Bobby was not at all.

679
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,261
He had set a wonderful mission

680
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,889
try to make him forget his lover.

681
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,807
And she put hers.

682
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,976
They were going every weekend to the sea

683
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:09,186
and cinema almost every night.

684
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,856
- I'll be there.
- Go on then, I trust.

685
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:15,484
They frequented the big cinemas in Hollywood

686
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,570
awesome, beautiful,

687
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,697
and not too expensive.

688
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:21,866
With time,

689
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:26,787
Vonnie succumbed to the charm of Bobby and his touching attentions.

690
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:30,917
And what began as a good-friendship

691
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,045
morphed into true love story.

692
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,809
Going to live in New York.

693
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,603
Pardon ?

694
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,440
Here: wife and me are going to live in New York.

695
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,610
We will have a nest in Greenwich Village.

696
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:00,404
I will find a job, I spoil you.

697
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:03,491
It will be wonderful. Frankly,

698
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:06,410
I am disappointed with what I saw here.

699
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:10,831
Like you, I dreamed of a house with swimming pool, fascinating stars,

700
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:15,127
but it is a boring, hostile, fierce.

701
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:18,422
Come on, we got married and we will live in New York.

702
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,134
Greenwich Village, with poets and painters?

703
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,930
It would perhaps not rich, but we would be together.

704
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,432
My brother wants to associate myself with his nightclub.

705
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,435
I know nothing, but Ben's a good guy.

706
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,104
And I learn quickly.

707
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:36,107
A night club, it's better than depressing office.

708
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:40,277
And even with your boyfriend, you had feelings for me.

709
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:41,570
That is true.

710
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,031
We'd pair in New York.

711
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,370
It makes you want, really.

712
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:51,789
Approach.

713
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,882
What is it ? You seemed annoyed on the phone.

714
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,509
You want a drink?

715
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:05,761
No thanks. What's on your mind?

716
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,179
Wait a second...

717
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,560
You're feeling good ?

718
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,562
Why this question ?

719
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:17,606
Lately, more you smoke, you drink more.

720
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,067
You're irritable even at the office.

721
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,653
I do not feel good.

722
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,489
I hope you are not ill.

723
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,118
I need to talk, Bobby ...

724
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,413
to someone you trust.

725
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,583
You can talk to me.

726
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,001
We are family.

727
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,920
So what does it happen to you?

728
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,965
I decided to leave my wife.

729
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:50,431
I changed my opinion many times but the conclusion is:

730
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,351
I love another woman and I can not live without it.

731
00:39:56,395 --> 00:40:00,107
I'm not expert but these things happen.

732
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,193
Not to me, usually.

733
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,652
I had never deceived.

734
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:06,197
Never looked at another woman in 25 years.

735
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,616
You know Karen, she's great!

736
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:09,950
Formidable !

737
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,203
It's true, I agree.

738
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,246
Mais il ya un an,

739
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,749
this apparition, the angel ...

740
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,251
fell from the sky.

741
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,212
I was spellbound.

742
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,547
It is a commonplace, I know,

743
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:27,259
but when it's the right person, you know, I swear.

744
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,011
Yes, that is correct.

745
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,347
It's the right one !

746
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,766
And this woman love you, I suppose?

747
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,392
I think so.

748
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,687
Although I have mistreated for a year

749
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,315
telling him that I was leaving Karen,

750
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,443
but I could not, and then and then if not.

751
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:48,239
I will not repeat the same thing and give it

752
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,074
false hopes.

753
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:52,576
I have to act. Provided that it has none.

754
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,495
No, if she loves you ...

755
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:57,039
She is much younger than me.

756
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,875
So what ? Regardless, if there is love.

757
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:04,547
I am consumed with guilt towards Karen, who has never disappointed me.

758
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,883
She is bright, cheerful, faithful.

759
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,219
- It worked well in bed - Very good.

760
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,388
But with the other, it's fantastic!

761
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,973
Good, but ...

762
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,685
people go through crises and rely.

763
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:20,062
I'm sure she also.

764
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,231
Yes.

765
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:24,233
Karen will want for nothing.

766
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,735
She will have half of my goods!

767
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,947
If I can do anything ...

768
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,741
I needed to talk.

769
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
It oppresses me a long time.

770
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:39,165
Sorry it has weighed you. Do not hesitate to talk to me.

771
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,249
Thank you.

772
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,587
So is it true?

773
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,505
You homesick?

774
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:52,094
Yes, I need to leave Manhattan to feel how I am in New York.

775
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,345
I can... ?

776
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,267
This is understandable. Many people arrive here

777
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,436
and decide to leave.

778
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,563
You have a girlfriend there?

779
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,900
I hope, and if it works, get your 10%.

780
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,276
Why ?

781
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,903
I have presented Vonnie.

782
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,906
I think she'll marry me and come to Manhattan.

783
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:17,578
Phil Stern could not believe his ears.

784
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,623
He worried that Vonnie do meet someone,

785
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,292
but would never bet on his nephew.

786
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,670
He was in love with his secretary from the beginning.

787
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:27,963
Veronica Sybel.

788
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,633
I have a degree in literature and theater.

789
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,551
And yes, I type in the machine.

790
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,511
He was crazy about her face,

791
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,096
and, fascinated

792
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:39,600
by his charm and his ability to take things in hand.

793
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,603
The following month, he was very eager

794
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,146
and even take risks.

795
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:46,482
I want to send fifty roses.

796
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:48,943
That's fifty ...

797
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,569
Fifty

798
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:51,820
percent.

799
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,491
Yes, fifty red roses.

800
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,826
And on the map, write ...

801
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:01,247
"Thanks for a wonderful weekend.

802
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:05,000
"I told you you would not get seasick, with me.

803
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:07,211
"I love you. Philip."

804
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:10,547
Instead, send a hundred red roses.

805
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,741
You are amazing.

806
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:40,160
- No it's you. - Thank you.

807
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,704
I really wanted.

808
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:47,626
We imagine in a nice apartment in the Village ...

809
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,713
Who would have thought when I arrived ...

810
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:51,714
I know.

811
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,341
Everyone's life is so unpredictable.

812
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,634
It's funny,

813
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,387
my Uncle Phil, your ex-employer,

814
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,891
so dynamic, confident, confided to me.

815
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:06,186
It is extremely unfortunate, these days.

816
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,148
He had an affair and is very loving.

817
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,568
But he could not leave his wife.

818
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,821
However, as it is very in love with each other,

819
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:18,115
he decided to leave Karen

820
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,576
and think marry his mistress.

821
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,037
He suffered tremendously

822
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:27,374
because he loves and respects his wife but can not live without the other.

823
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,589
I did not ask if it was a star.

824
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:41,930
- What is it ? - He left his wife ...

825
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:48,354
He tried and given up a dozen times, but now,

826
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:51,940
he can not live without the other, he said.

827
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:55,569
What is certain is that it is very much in love.

828
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,447
What are you thinking about ? You look...

829
00:44:58,781 --> 00:44:59,865
elsewhere.

830
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:01,950
Sorry. No, nothing.

831
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:04,745
What are you thinking about ?

832
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:08,791
To nothing.

833
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:10,626
Oh no ...

834
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:14,838
I jostles you, with my old song about marriage and New York.

835
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,006
That's it ?

836
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:17,591
That's it.

837
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,176
It is a sacred project.

838
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:20,302
That is true.

839
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:21,470
Pardon.

840
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,282
Very good evening.

841
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,415
We talked about it a thousand times.

842
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:50,999
Everything changed.

843
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,918
Will talk elsewhere.

844
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:56,505
Or ? Our dark bar? No way I work.

845
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:58,215
I said to Karen.

846
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:01,844
You got an early, given the situation, right?

847
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,387
What do you mean ?

848
00:46:03,554 --> 00:46:06,682
You're really living in New York with my nephew?

849
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:07,850
You are aware ?

850
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,976
Who told you ?

851
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:11,019
Secrets do not last here.

852
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:12,354
Ours, though.

853
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,189
You changed your mind ?

854
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:15,566
Hello, Louis.

855
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:19,445
- What's new for the MGM? - Surely this weekend.

856
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,578
I love you. Our history is worth nothing?

857
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:32,583
I do not know what to think, I am lost. Is it any wonder?

858
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:33,500
Non.

859
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,377
And you can send me packing.

860
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,005
It will kill me, but at least it will be clear.

861
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,508
You leave her, then no, then so, then impossible.

862
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:45,053
I never pushed it to you or even asked to leave.

863
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,722
And that's it, you did it?

864
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,182
How to react ?

865
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,976
I lacked guts, but the thought of losing you ...

866
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:54,313
It is a white ermine.

867
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:58,734
The studio makes us wear fur in this weather!

868
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,488
That's right. Thank you.

869
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:06,074
It was not easy. But if it is so difficult,

870
00:47:06,283 --> 00:47:07,326
why should ...

871
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,830
You've forgotten to Bill Powell.

872
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:14,583
- Sorry ? - William Powell, Paramount.

873
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,045
He does not seem interested but I raise tomorrow.

874
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,881
I do not want you to work here.

875
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:24,134
I want to marry you and take care of you for life.

876
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:26,428
You took your distance so fast!

877
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,764
And who the hell? My nephew ?

878
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,807
It's nice, but no future.

879
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:35,020
You said yourself that you could love two people.

880
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:37,189
You also love? I do not believe it.

881
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:38,857
Believe it. I love it.

882
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:39,942
You love me, me.

883
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:42,110
I do not know. I believe.

884
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,404
I do not know anymore. I'm really lost.

885
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:47,366
- We always have lunch on Thursday? - Absolutely.

886
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:49,826
I'll take Judy Garland. An adorable kid.

887
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,454
It could represent.

888
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,206
That is true ? Take her so.

889
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,000
I met with Billy Wilder, I know.

890
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,210
On Thursday.

891
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,838
I will not beg you. I love you.

892
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,466
I love you for over a year.

893
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:07,761
I acted like I could, sometimes awkwardly.

894
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:11,473
But when the c ?? ur talking about, we sometimes made mistakes.

895
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:16,311
Think of my proposal. I want to marry you. Now.

896
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,730
I will die if you refuse.

897
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:21,316
I go talk to Karen.

898
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,985
You did not tell him?

899
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:28,031
I told him that we would speak of an important topic this evening.

900
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,077
Charlie, we need to talk of John Ford film.

901
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,788
Vonnie was perplexed.

902
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:36,540
Two men loved him.

903
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:39,334
One was dynamic, prosperous, tireless.

904
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:42,462
The other, younger, obviously adored.

905
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,048
She opened by her roommate, Rosalind,

906
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:48,677
who raced in favor of marriage with Phil Stern,

907
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:51,847
then hesitated, finding Bobby endearing

908
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:54,391
and passionately in love with Vonnie.

909
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,479
Sorry, I thought there was nobody.

910
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,481
- Drink a glass. - No thanks.

911
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:04,484
We are family, we can drink together.

912
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:05,652
You have problems ?

913
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:09,197
I do not have a lot of family, since I left Karen.

914
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:12,409
That's it ? It was not too painful?

915
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,620
Nice going, with Vonnie?

916
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:15,787
It's okay.

917
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,999
But she's a little anxious lately.

918
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,084
She said why?

919
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,462
Marriage, New York ...

920
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:25,922
So I do not insist.

921
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,884
But she loves me, I know,

922
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,011
and she wants to marry me,

923
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:33,889
because there is no better matched than we are.

924
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,143
Do not look so dejected.

925
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,103
I'm sure it will work out.

926
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,148
But you could have been more careful with Karen.

927
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:46,068
Do not give me a cautionary tale!

928
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:50,072
I know act at the right moment is vital.

929
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:53,075
In business, do not act too soon.

930
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,327
- I know ... - Remember well!

931
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:58,497
If you marry him, I rely on my 10%.

932
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,290
Okay, done deal.

933
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:04,670
I'm not asking you who is elected. A beautiful movie star?

934
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,046
Not at all.

935
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,674
I'm not superficial.

936
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,386
Not attracted to the chic junk.

937
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:15,138
I appreciate the background, righteousness. What do you think?

938
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:19,685
I have not hinted of such. I thought about Hedy Lamarr, she loves you.

939
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,270
Like all your clients.

940
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:25,065
This is what makes your brilliant success.

941
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,986
A gift. I have it framed.

942
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:33,615
A love letter to Rudolph Valentino.

943
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:36,993
In our first year, that of paper.

944
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,048
What a surprise. What are you doing here ?

945
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,176
Marry me me, or my Uncle Phil?

946
00:50:58,348 --> 00:51:00,100
I'm marrying Phil.

947
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:21,037
How nice to be together for the Seder.

948
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,832
I admit, selfishly,

949
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:27,002
it is that you came back to Hollywood.

950
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:29,171
Here we are together again.

951
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,715
Your brother has taken under his wing!

952
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:35,719
Phil reached out her hand. But he did not like, there.

953
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:36,845
I was sure of it.

954
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,266
If only Phil was in New York. It would come tonight.

955
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,310
I would like to know his new wife.

956
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:44,686
Not you, Martin?

957
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:48,273
Not really. You know what I think of your brother.

958
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,275
It is not Jewish, this man!

959
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:54,696
What kind of man sold off his wife after 25 years

960
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:57,657
to fall in love with a secretary 25 years?

961
00:51:57,824 --> 00:52:02,204
Unfortunately, many men choose their secretary.

962
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,414
Bobby says she is superb.

963
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,291
The physical is not everything!

964
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,169
And righteousness? And faithfulness?

965
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:14,633
You're not a Miss but I stayed.

966
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,884
You drank enough.

967
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:17,427
Love is an emotion.

968
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,137
The emotions are not rational.

969
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,264
We "fall" in love.

970
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:22,641
foot is lost.

971
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:25,101
I have known many wonderful women,

972
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:28,980
but the moment I saw your daughter, I knew that it was made for me.

973
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,482
A stroke of luck!

974
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:34,486
If my taxi had not broken the glass wall of a restaurant,

975
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:36,613
I would never have known Leonard.

976
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,032
He drank coffee. It was dark on him.

977
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,116
I have nothing spilled.

978
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,452
Bobby, you met.

979
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:44,412
It is so extraordinary?

980
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,082
She is adorable.

981
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,418
Once these pimbêches stars?

982
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:53,338
She grounded. You appreciate it.

983
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:54,798
It is suitable for Phil.

984
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:56,758
Dad was right.

985
00:52:56,925 --> 00:53:01,096
A woman, not a car that trade against the latest model.

986
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:04,516
Our neighbor turned his wife for a vulgar stripper

987
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:06,268
then broke his teeth.

988
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:07,394
It's crazy.

989
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:10,313
We live near a maniac. I'm afraid of him.

990
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,648
He pushed Leonard.

991
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:13,108
Not pushed.

992
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,902
He is angry, he pushed me.

993
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:18,238
I told him that he was blocking the driveway.

994
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,240
Some are dipping not the blows.

995
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:23,869
This is not the style of Leonard. He prefers to reason with people.

996
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,830
Accept the postulate of a common humanity,

997
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:29,457
otherwise the jungle and wild animals.

998
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,127
What is needed is the first bump.

999
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:33,420
Before the other.

1000
00:53:33,587 --> 00:53:35,630
You like working for your brother?

1001
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:37,883
I am very lucky. Thank you.

1002
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:41,720
On your return, you were like a lost soul.

1003
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,472
I like working at night club, it's animated.

1004
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,685
He's like a fish in water, customers love it.

1005
00:53:48,852 --> 00:53:50,186
Not like the one before.

1006
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,315
That scoundrel who eventually steal.

1007
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,650
Seen no more.

1008
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:10,457
Bobby found his worldly friends Rad Taylor and her husband Steve.

1009
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:15,420
They came to the club and boasted with beautiful mannequins Rad.

1010
00:54:15,587 --> 00:54:17,422
She persuaded Bobby to redecorate

1011
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,258
and rebrand the club in addition prissy.

1012
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,177
The Tropics? I just love it !

1013
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:25,472
It's stylish, cosmopolitan and trendy.

1014
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:27,223
It's thanks to you.

1015
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:33,146
Soon the club was known to have the driest martinis

1016
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:35,565
and the prettiest women in Manhattan.

1017
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:39,611
The beauties attracted celebrities and sportsmen in sight.

1018
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:42,364
Socialites mingled with politicians.

1019
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,950
These people drew Press

1020
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,494
and a flourishing reputation.

1021
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:51,998
Bobby was increasingly at ease among the rich and famous.

1022
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:55,085
He discovered the workings of the Café Society,

1023
00:54:55,251 --> 00:55:00,548
which included some central figures in the underworld of New York chic.

1024
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:07,389
The Rhinebeck, almost every evening, commanded the best wines.

1025
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:09,557
In appearance, the ideal couple.

1026
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,477
But he slept with ?? s heart of his wife.

1027
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:18,066
Crowned heads came from all over Europe.

1028
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:22,112
Count Henrick Van Goren millions playing backgammon.

1029
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,239
His wife, the Countess Van Goren,

1030
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:27,993
Chickie was actually Sherman, of Passaic, New Jersey.

1031
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:30,620
And the ring finger of Suzy Bancroft

1032
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:32,831
was only 41 carats.

1033
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:36,501
And who says elite scandals said to newspapers,

1034
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:39,129
as Tom Price, genius of Wall Street,

1035
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:43,341
married to the very large and wealthy heiress Linda Ray Harmon.

1036
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:46,511
He squandered his fortune in horse racing and dancing.

1037
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:48,471
But one day, hunting,

1038
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,432
she took him for a deer.

1039
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:55,603
Bobby knew all shook their hands, joked,

1040
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,897
listened to their stories, sad or gay,

1041
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,817
on magnums background Piper-Heidsieck.

1042
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:02,402
He discovered life

1043
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:06,322
and finally, Rodgers & Hart were right.

1044
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:11,369
It's beautiful here, and you have done so much for me.

1045
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:14,956
Come on, do not be suddenly Schools ?? urante of sentimentality.

1046
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:17,709
She hates affection.

1047
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:22,088
But your friendship meant a lot to me.

1048
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,300
And you brought me a great financial advisor.

1049
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:27,802
You juggle with millions, I am far

1050
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:31,598
but at this rate, I'll apply to your golf club.

1051
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:34,851
To register, you must be a lawyer or broker,

1052
00:56:35,018 --> 00:56:36,770
and uncircumcised.

1053
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:39,522
Anyway, I owe you everything.

1054
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:42,692
I can not thank you enough for introducing me

1055
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:44,986
the wonder of wonders ...

1056
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:46,112
my wife.

1057
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:47,614
What synchronicity!

1058
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:51,284
He would even compare you with an air of Gershwin, and there you are.

1059
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:52,368
Stopped !

1060
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:54,412
Hello dear. So that martini?

1061
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,663
Excellent! I was talking about you.

1062
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,499
Bobby had found a wife.

1063
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:01,461
After all kinds of flirtations and disappointing adventures

1064
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:04,672
a night club, a group came on.

1065
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:07,342
He noticed a young stylish blonde.

1066
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:09,135
Is Veronica Hayes.

1067
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:10,845
Just divorced.

1068
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,640
Her husband left her for her best friend. A shock.

1069
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:14,474
Gosh ...

1070
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,059
She's great.

1071
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,144
It made us so much trouble.

1072
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:20,772
Go back to her morale. You introduce me?

1073
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,149
- Veronica, you look beautiful! - You too.

1074
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:24,734
- Delighted to see you. - Likewise.

1075
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,570
I present Bobby Dorfman. This is his club.

1076
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,864
Effectively. First visit?

1077
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,951
Yes. The press is right, there is electricity in the air.

1078
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:33,952
Is not it ?

1079
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:35,912
- Welcome. - Thank you.

1080
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,414
Gosh ... Single?

1081
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,375
- Yes ! - It's a crime.

1082
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,043
So it goes ...

1083
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:43,795
Excuse me.

1084
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,089
What are you doing later?

1085
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:47,215
Later ?

1086
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,843
It is already late, it is 1 hour 30 minutes.

1087
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,928
I finished in half an hour.

1088
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:54,430
Usually I'm in pajamas at 2 am.

1089
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:56,432
I love pajamas.

1090
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,184
What side of the bed?

1091
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,936
Calm down!

1092
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:02,021
It is more insistent than you.

1093
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:04,941
Come on, you two ...

1094
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:09,445
Like jazz music?

1095
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:10,613
At 2 am?

1096
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,782
At any hour of the morning.

1097
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:15,034
Your first name is Veronica?

1098
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:17,620
Do you ever called Vonnie?

1099
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:18,788
Not really.

1100
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,290
It's a nice name.

1101
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,293
But you like jazz?

1102
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:25,837
I really like.

1103
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:27,463
It's fate.

1104
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:29,716
Who does not like jazz?

1105
00:58:29,883 --> 00:58:31,467
A woman I knew.

1106
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:32,594
It's horrible.

1107
00:58:48,193 --> 00:58:49,485
It's divine.

1108
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,322
I would take a good scotch.

1109
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,950
I have one regret: not playing an instrument.

1110
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:58,995
- I knew a musician. - Oh yes ?

1111
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:01,664
Saxophonist, very talented.

1112
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:05,001
He played sad songs with such feeling.

1113
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:06,669
As you draw tears.

1114
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:08,129
It's a beautiful gift.

1115
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:10,506
I would have married without the drug.

1116
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:13,259
I do not like drugs, plug it into the air.

1117
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:15,637
I tried a little with him.

1118
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,765
We smoked hashish and I tasted opium.

1119
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,976
So say ! How does it do to you?

1120
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:25,563
I did not like. I'm not prone to addiction.

1121
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,981
It was.

1122
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:29,442
Yet not as m'émoustillait.

1123
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,694
- Kif? - Hashish.

1124
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:34,530
- You say "kif"? - It was him.

1125
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:36,366
You married a musician?

1126
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,868
A stock broker.

1127
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:40,203
You divorced.

1128
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,331
It's him. My best friend was better in bed

1129
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:44,874
- Really ? - I imagine.

1130
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,668
Had to keep the kif.

1131
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:50,964
I learned too late that he was enough of a few drinks.

1132
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:54,092
And what do you do in life?

1133
00:59:54,259 --> 00:59:56,261
I work in the mayor's office.

1134
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,346
- In what ? - Public relations.

1135
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,223
Nothing against the Democrats?

1136
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:04,060
My family is a Democrat. We are Jews. It goes with.

1137
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:05,353
Very folk!

1138
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,689
That touches my rebellious side.

1139
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:11,234
In Oklahoma, we were forbidden to attend.

1140
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:12,735
You are usurers!

1141
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:14,529
We control everything, actually.

1142
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:17,282
I had never seen a Jew before living here.

1143
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:18,700
I do not have horns.

1144
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:22,078
I find exotic Jews mysterious.

1145
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:23,871
It would not bother me, your horns.

1146
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:25,081
That is true ?

1147
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:28,084
Come on. We're going to my house.

1148
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,420
I will not sleep with you.

1149
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,672
Jewish or not, one hardly knows.

1150
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:34,924
Take a drink or two.

1151
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:39,012
No thanks. You have to be patient. But finally !

1152
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:43,933
It's true what they say! You are more insistent.

1153
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:46,060
It makes our charm.

1154
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,612
- I spent a great evening. - Me too.

1155
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,990
You call me?

1156
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,116
Without fail.

1157
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:01,909
I'll call you tomorrow.

1158
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:04,871
As is tomorrow, I call you in 15 min.

1159
01:01:05,038 --> 01:01:06,831
So I'm going home.

1160
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,293
Good night.

1161
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,431
Throughout the season, they saw every day.

1162
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:25,641
It was a great summer.

1163
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,518
Thank you, Rad. It is the last.

1164
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:31,105
Then one Saturday afternoon, a few months later,

1165
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,565
she told him ...

1166
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:33,941
I am pregnant.

1167
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:39,781
You are collapsed?

1168
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:43,618
No, it's wonderful.

1169
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:46,120
What is next?

1170
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,206
I would like to keep this baby.

1171
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:52,835
If you do not, I'll go to Mexico, they do it better.

1172
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:55,213
Vonnie, we will not go to Mexico but ...

1173
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,924
Niagara Falls, on the contrary.

1174
01:01:58,508 --> 01:02:01,386
- You sure? - Yes of course.

1175
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,972
When we treat of the little bastard, he can deny.

1176
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,641
You called me Vonnie.

1177
01:02:06,808 --> 01:02:08,393
You never do not say that.

1178
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:11,979
If I did, it's the champagne.

1179
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,899
This is the name of your ex-girlfriend.

1180
01:02:16,526 --> 01:02:18,152
Is. Two Veronica.

1181
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,196
What about you? I'm lucky.

1182
01:02:20,363 --> 01:02:21,781
Marry me or not?

1183
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:23,616
- Yes of course. - Good.

1184
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:24,992
Right answer.

1185
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:26,869
- We have a baby! - I love you.

1186
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:27,870
The wedding,

1187
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:32,208
who just stood for mayor two months later,

1188
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,793
was a joyous moment.

1189
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,131
But as the saying brother Bobby: life does as its head.

1190
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,384
What do you want ?

1191
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:46,389
Could you turn down the radio, just a little?

1192
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:50,184
No need to turn it off, but my wife has a headache.

1193
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:53,646
I do what I want with my radio. Give me a break !

1194
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,232
She has only occasionally.

1195
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,109
Turn down.

1196
01:02:58,401 --> 01:02:59,986
Call a doctor!

1197
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:04,198
He gave her a cure migraine but is tenacious.

1198
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:08,453
I work hard, and I listen to my radio, whether you like it or not!

1199
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,662
You misunderstand.

1200
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:13,749
I ask you to turn off. Tone down the volume a bit.

1201
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,460
I will not call the police.

1202
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,504
You think I'm afraid the police?

1203
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,715
I have the right to listen to the radio!

1204
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:23,468
What can I do? It has the law on his side.

1205
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:25,761
I'll tell Ben to talk to him.

1206
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,265
Ben is angry, I do not want any trouble.

1207
01:03:29,432 --> 01:03:31,225
Do not escalates things.

1208
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,935
It is he who is poisoning.

1209
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,313
Someone has to lift her braces!

1210
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,815
Forget it, it's not so serious.

1211
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:40,401
It is not you who have migraine!

1212
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:45,281
Bobby called Veronica and baby Susan.

1213
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:48,826
In the fall, they found the perfect house on the Hudson.

1214
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:50,953
The police came to talk to him

1215
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,290
and last week, drunk, he damaged our car.

1216
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:57,335
When Leonard speaks in him, he threatens.

1217
01:03:57,502 --> 01:03:58,461
Oh yes ?

1218
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:00,379
I'll say two words.

1219
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,298
Leonard does not want trouble.

1220
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:06,177
But this must imply that we will not let us do

1221
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:09,222
and must stop poisoning us life.

1222
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:12,016
He accuses us of imaginary things.

1223
01:04:12,475 --> 01:04:14,519
He threatened to shoot our dog.

1224
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:15,853
He is a mad !

1225
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,982
My husband even imagine that it will eventually listen to reason,

1226
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:21,651
but it is endless!

1227
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,486
Shoot the dog?

1228
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,112
I think he is armed.

1229
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,657
There is a guard in a sawmill.

1230
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:30,034
Joe Wojehowitz.

1231
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:49,512
- Joe Wojehowitz? - Who ask for it ?

1232
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:51,097
You are Joe Wojehowitz?

1233
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:52,306
Yes. What?

1234
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,477
Joe, rising. We are going for a walk.

1235
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,479
- Why ? - We want to discuss.

1236
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:00,481
- What? - Monte!

1237
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,234
What are you doing ? Let me go !

1238
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:46,027
It was the Café Society, and Bobby Dorfman there was deep:

1239
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:49,488
the millionaire playboys like Buddy Winslow Fain,

1240
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,198
who offered what he wanted,

1241
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:55,328
luxury models of the cover of every magazine

1242
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:58,789
The best seats for shows and sporting events.

1243
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:00,541
The politicians,

1244
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:04,462
who cleaned the streets, the quadrilles and taxes

1245
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:07,423
As donations poured in.

1246
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:13,304
Norton Lockerbee and minor fiancée, dancer Cherry Grace.

1247
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:15,765
And Remsen, which it was said

1248
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:19,226
they had stayed in Berlin with Adolf Hitler.

1249
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:22,938
And of course, many senior associates Ben color,

1250
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:27,193
some would inevitably one of the tabloids,

1251
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,238
their blood drenching the pavement following a cranial ventilation.

1252
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:35,242
Bobby knew the All-Manhattan.

1253
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:37,912
His wife Veronica rarely accompanied,

1254
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:40,498
having succumbed to the joys of motherhood.

1255
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:41,749
Then one evening,

1256
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,043
the past made her entrance.

1257
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,221
Can I help you?

1258
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:59,350
Yes. My nephews should be there, it is the owners.

1259
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:00,476
Monsieur Dorfman ?

1260
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:01,936
Bobby, yes. Or Ben.

1261
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,522
Bobby is there. I moved you?

1262
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:05,731
Please.

1263
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:08,734
I signed a big contract.

1264
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,946
Champagne! Then we will drink for good.

1265
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:14,448
Fred, glad to see you.

1266
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,117
You know Vonnie.

1267
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:19,036
We stay a few weeks. Do we see.

1268
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,542
This is a golden share. During his skyrocketing.

1269
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:26,794
Enjoy. I did not tell you.

1270
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,254
- Say what ? - Here.

1271
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:29,588
Thank you, Marvin.

1272
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,007
People say about you.

1273
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,050
Oh yes ?

1274
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:34,135
Table 4.

1275
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:35,761
Everybody knows me.

1276
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,980
Robert! How are you ?

1277
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:47,606
You know Vonnie.

1278
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:51,152
And I want you and Gloria Craig Bennett.

1279
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,697
Sit with us.

1280
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:58,325
I would, but I have in the world.

1281
01:07:58,492 --> 01:07:59,535
I see it !

1282
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,163
Your club is known throughout the country.

1283
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,164
Come on.

1284
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,915
Five minutes. You're going to offend us.

1285
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,208
Five minutes.

1286
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:12,631
- Hey! - What a look!

1287
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:13,924
That is true.

1288
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:18,053
The contract that I signed for Irene Dunne at Universal.

1289
01:08:18,304 --> 01:08:19,054
I love it.

1290
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:20,848
How is she ?

1291
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:23,058
It is amazing, I assure you.

1292
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,270
It has a good, Irene Dunne. Sorry, honey.

1293
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,314
- Tell. - No, go ahead.

1294
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:31,859
We met Irene at Cocoanut Grove.

1295
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:35,696
We were with Errol Flynn and one of his sublime "discoveries"

1296
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:37,406
as he calls them.

1297
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:39,033
And so...

1298
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,327
His reputation is not famous,

1299
01:08:41,494 --> 01:08:43,537
but we love it, it's lovely.

1300
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:47,208
He welcomed us off Catalina on his yacht, a dream.

1301
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:49,293
Irene, is ...

1302
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,544
a bit stilted,

1303
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:54,381
very properly. Divine, but as it should.

1304
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,258
We were at Busby Berkeley.

1305
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:59,053
It is proposed to Irene a cigarette puff.

1306
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,889
She looked like she was undressing.

1307
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:03,974
She was mortified.

1308
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,894
Then Errol present her little starlet.

1309
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:09,939
Irene asks her if her daughter.

1310
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:12,525
As dry, Errol looks at her and says:

1311
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:13,651
"Not.

1312
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,028
"This is my granddaughter."

1313
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,073
I almost died.

1314
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,367
In London, he was mobbed.

1315
01:09:21,534 --> 01:09:24,370
I did not know, but that's a hero to the English.

1316
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,747
- I love London. - A city so refined ...

1317
01:09:26,914 --> 01:09:27,748
Is not it ?

1318
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:29,750
I prefer Paris, as you know.

1319
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:33,254
And Venice. We dream to buy a pied-a-terre.

1320
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,256
Bob Montgomery and his wife did.

1321
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:36,674
You know them ?

1322
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:40,052
They are charming. A wonderful couple.

1323
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,346
Little Bobby ...

1324
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:44,974
Great success, Robert.

1325
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:47,601
I always knew you'd make.

1326
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,772
I formed this kid to be agent and he preferred New York.

1327
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,774
I understand perfectly.

1328
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:58,779
Please excuse me. It's packed tonight.

1329
01:09:58,946 --> 01:10:00,823
We stay 4 or 5 weeks.

1330
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,492
And congratulations, young dad!

1331
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:04,910
Absolutely!

1332
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,455
Frank, serve me a scotch.

1333
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:12,585
- And your wife? - She's fine, thank you.

1334
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:13,961
We can not see it.

1335
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:16,380
She's a homebody, since our daughter.

1336
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:17,756
A classic.

1337
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:20,426
Once mothers, while the indifferent.

1338
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,261
You see what I mean.

1339
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,138
Because hormones.

1340
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:25,931
It does not always come back.

1341
01:10:26,098 --> 01:10:28,976
Now I see all the layers.

1342
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,271
Listen.

1343
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,816
I deny that it is I who have told you.

1344
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,445
The prosecutor's office is seriously considering

1345
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:41,030
If your brother

1346
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:43,532
... and its associates.

1347
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:44,867
That is to say ?

1348
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:46,994
I do not know yet,

1349
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:50,247
but it is possible that the situation is complicated.

1350
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,041
I wanted to warn you.

1351
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:54,501
Thank you. Can you intervene?

1352
01:10:55,628 --> 01:10:58,005
Alas, the mayor is incorruptible.

1353
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:00,549
What Does the accused?

1354
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:05,262
Racketeering, extortion, tax evasion ...

1355
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:08,015
Perhaps worse for Ben.

1356
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,559
My advice to your brother:

1357
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:13,187
slip away some time.

1358
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,564
He loves Havana.

1359
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:18,651
I will tell him, thank you.

1360
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,402
Thank you for letting me know.

1361
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,866
Are you searching something ?

1362
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:28,369
You. I wanted to say hello.

1363
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:30,746
Are you kidding me ?

1364
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:32,206
What do you mean ?

1365
01:11:32,665 --> 01:11:34,458
You hear what you say?

1366
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:39,004
You've become everything you laughed you, that you hated.

1367
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,673
You know...

1368
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:45,636
time goes on, life goes on.

1369
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:46,845
On change.

1370
01:11:47,096 --> 01:11:49,139
Your sales pitch on simple living ...

1371
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,267
It would be comical if it were not sad to cry.

1372
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:57,773
You're not really the same either.

1373
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:01,402
No, you're right.

1374
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,320
Life goes on ...

1375
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:04,905
it grows.

1376
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:06,949
Lunch with me.

1377
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:11,161
For you drink of me names, sumptuous evenings of stories?

1378
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:14,456
No, I will silence the Hollywood wife

1379
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:18,168
if you promise not to reproach myself for choosing Phil.

1380
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:22,381
Go back in time and let us walk.

1381
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:23,924
There's nothing stopping us.

1382
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:25,759
I have free time.

1383
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:28,554
I really want to know what you're getting.

1384
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:32,307
Anyway, you still

1385
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:34,101
staggering beauty.

1386
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,985
I have not seen our neighbor for a while.

1387
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:44,361
It must be on the move.

1388
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:48,282
Normally it watered his lawn. She abyss.

1389
01:12:48,449 --> 01:12:50,409
And his mail piled up.

1390
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:52,119
There would be a problem?

1391
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:54,788
He may have had a heart attack.

1392
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,917
It would not be bad. He deserves to die!

1393
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,253
Take that back immediately.

1394
01:13:01,462 --> 01:13:03,297
I call the police?

1395
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:06,008
I think not. It does not concern us.

1396
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:07,468
Of course yes.

1397
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,595
It is responsible for his neighbor,

1398
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:11,388
even the worst marmoset.

1399
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,474
I would drop in your place.

1400
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,517
What are you talking about ?

1401
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,228
You're hiding something ?

1402
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:22,149
I'm worried, Leonard.

1403
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,109
Why, Evelyn?

1404
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:26,820
There are things going on that I do not?

1405
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:30,532
I may have made a mistake.

1406
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:32,743
What are you hiding from me?

1407
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:36,163
When we saw the baby Bobby,

1408
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:39,249
I told Ben that the neighbor bothering us

1409
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:41,460
and the police did nothing.

1410
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:42,586
At Ben?

1411
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:45,172
I was afraid of him!

1412
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:46,799
We have a child.

1413
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:48,342
He was quick-tempered,

1414
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:50,928
he drank, he was mean.

1415
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:55,099
He was looking for us to mess it was guardian, so armed.

1416
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:57,684
He could explode anytime!

1417
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:01,438
You did not tell Ben to threaten?

1418
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:02,940
Or hurt them?

1419
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:05,484
I asked Ben to talk to him.

1420
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:09,154
You had tried, but ... you're so well behaved!

1421
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:13,408
I was hoping Ben tells him that if he did not calm down ...

1422
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:15,077
What?

1423
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:16,912
He tabasserait?

1424
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:17,871
He beat up?

1425
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:21,083
I just asked Ben to tell her to stop.

1426
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,251
Otherwise what ?

1427
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,129
Ben is a thug, a gangster.

1428
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,381
He sent him to the hospital?

1429
01:14:27,548 --> 01:14:29,299
I do not know, Leonard.

1430
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:30,717
And I do not want to know.

1431
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:32,010
It's immoral.

1432
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,262
Immoral !

1433
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:36,014
Is it fair that this poor guy

1434
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:38,767
finds himself in the hospital, all messed up?

1435
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:47,192
It is delicious.

1436
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:49,027
And I love this place.

1437
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:52,906
It reminds me of our Mexican greasy spoon.

1438
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:53,824
That is true.

1439
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:57,452
This is not the Brown Derby or a rout in Busby Berkeley.

1440
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:00,247
You do not croiseras Fred Astaire.

1441
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:04,001
Tell me about your wife. It intrigues me.

1442
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:06,128
She is adorable.

1443
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:07,546
What is her name ?

1444
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:08,922
Veronica.

1445
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:10,924
- No ! - I assure you.

1446
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:13,844
- Stopped. - She say otherwise.

1447
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:17,306
- I'm flattered. - You can.

1448
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,099
Life is a comedy

1449
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,602
written by an author sadistic.

1450
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:24,146
I loved you and you married my uncle,

1451
01:15:24,313 --> 01:15:26,398
what makes you ... my aunt.

1452
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:28,942
Tante Vonnie.

1453
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:32,362
I still have a crush on you, Vonnie aunt.

1454
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:35,782
I'm here.

1455
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,117
Sweetheart !

1456
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:40,662
What is that ?

1457
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:43,540
Flowers ?

1458
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,085
- I can not believe it. - Why ?

1459
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:48,378
In what honor ?

1460
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:51,924
I had not offered you flowers for a long time.

1461
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:55,010
You're all perky, this week, and flowers?

1462
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:57,387
You won the lottery? You feel guilty?

1463
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:00,641
A husband who spoils his wife is suspect?

1464
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,392
No. I love them.

1465
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:03,685
You did well.

1466
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:04,853
I love you.

1467
01:16:05,646 --> 01:16:06,563
Thank you.

1468
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:13,820
Phil is busy, Bobby seized any excuse to see Vonnie.

1469
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,907
He made her visit Manhattan, Coney Island.

1470
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:21,453
And when she spoke dinner she had promised him to Hollywood,

1471
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,789
he found him in a city kitchen.

1472
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:26,541
I hope I have. This is my recipe,

1473
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:30,254
but I'll have so much vaunted, I hope it will be good.

1474
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,591
If this is not successful, you will go again in the kitchen.

1475
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:36,677
Or you drown them in cheese.

1476
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:40,305
This will be impeccable. I know the Pugioni in a while.

1477
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:42,015
- Long time. - How many ?

1478
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:43,183
Long time.

1479
01:16:43,517 --> 01:16:47,813
For me, forever. Glad you finally cooked for me.

1480
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,147
Good wine.

1481
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,191
What a great idea.

1482
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:52,401
Tastes.

1483
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:54,736
Do not lie.

1484
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,154
It was scrumptious.

1485
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:57,447
Absolutely delicious.

1486
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:58,699
Vito, tell him.

1487
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,742
- Delicious. - Thank you. Would he lie?

1488
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,244
- Would I lie? - Without no doubt.

1489
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:05,205
Where are we going now? Not want to go.

1490
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:06,581
Vito, any advice?

1491
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:08,583
You can play craps in Brooklyn.

1492
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,168
You are in luck?

1493
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:13,630
Unbelievable !

1494
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:15,382
The dice are loaded!

1495
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:17,092
This is a false beginner.

1496
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:18,802
I continue like this?

1497
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:20,387
Yes, if it works.

1498
01:18:14,191 --> 01:18:16,443
New York is really great.

1499
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:19,988
And I know. I travel a lot.

1500
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:21,406
I know you've talked about.

1501
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:24,993
Why live elsewhere? Hollywood does not lack spice,

1502
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,955
but nothing equals Broadway or cheesecake home Lindy.

1503
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:32,167
You then ...

1504
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:38,090
Sipping wine in Central Park, we did not sleep.

1505
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,218
You always had a poet side.

1506
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:43,845
I am not with everyone.

1507
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:49,601
It was necessary that I choose.

1508
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:54,898
Looks like my brother: "The alternatives are mutually exclusive."

1509
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,735
Yes, I loved you and I loved Phil.

1510
01:18:58,944 --> 01:19:01,154
I was with him for a year and a half

1511
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:02,656
and you were ...

1512
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:06,660
left but adorable,

1513
01:19:07,452 --> 01:19:08,620
manic,

1514
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:12,082
young, romantic, a little lost.

1515
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:14,334
Next to a large man.

1516
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,877
It was hard.

1517
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:22,467
Our future was uncertain, I do not want to lose you.

1518
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:24,010
I thought

1519
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:28,390
if your career is not taking off, you'd like me and would be unhappy.

1520
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:29,516
How to know ?

1521
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:32,686
I never stopped thinking about you.

1522
01:19:32,853 --> 01:19:34,396
Not a single day.

1523
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:37,107
I always dream of you.

1524
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:40,485
More...

1525
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:44,114
I am the wife of Phil.

1526
01:19:45,323 --> 01:19:49,703
It is wonderful to me, he loves me, he messed up his life for me.

1527
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:52,831
I am loyal to him.

1528
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,375
Yet you dream of me.

1529
01:19:58,295 --> 01:20:00,839
You're happily married, you have a child.

1530
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:03,550
- You said it. - I know.

1531
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:07,012
But we are alone in Central Park.

1532
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:09,723
The light reflects off this building.

1533
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:28,575
Satisfied?

1534
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:02,192
As part of the investigation into Ben,

1535
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,111
evidence and spies abounded,

1536
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:08,823
resulting in the charges, including premeditated murder.

1537
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:12,452
I am appalled. It's such a horror!

1538
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:15,038
I am against any form of execution.

1539
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:17,624
Thank God, the body of the neighbor was not found.

1540
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,417
What does it change ?

1541
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:22,754
We are unassailable, but what moral weight!

1542
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:24,881
Ben had to talk to him, that's all.

1543
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:27,175
Come on, you wanted it the threat.

1544
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:28,176
He warns.

1545
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:30,762
He warns, not let him do evil.

1546
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:32,347
What's the difference ?

1547
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:34,057
"Hello bro?"

1548
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:35,725
Leave me peace.

1549
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:38,395
He had to deal with this maniac ...

1550
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:40,272
It was becoming intolerable.

1551
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:44,109
You do not kill a man because he listens to his radio too loud.

1552
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:48,280
She did not realize. Ben and other crimes to his name.

1553
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,823
This is another problem.

1554
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:53,034
Meanwhile, we have blood on their hands.

1555
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:54,536
Good God !

1556
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:56,079
Keep your biblical morality.

1557
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:58,623
Calm down. Take an aspirin.

1558
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:01,751
Here is the name of a good criminal lawyer,

1559
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:03,003
Jake Murray.

1560
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:04,129
It is a Cador.

1561
01:22:04,296 --> 01:22:05,297
Thank you very much.

1562
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:08,800
She is devastated. It will crack.

1563
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:10,760
She gets on my system.

1564
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:12,429
I did not need that.

1565
01:22:12,596 --> 01:22:16,808
What did you think, Rose? It was a notorious mobster.

1566
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:19,477
It is not capable of killing.

1567
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:23,732
My father knew that it was a schemer, but the truth is much worse.

1568
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:27,694
We have an excellent criminal lawyer, and I know one:

1569
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:28,987
my old friend Peter Bryce.

1570
01:22:29,154 --> 01:22:30,530
No Jake Murray?

1571
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:33,992
Bryce never loses, but we also take Murray.

1572
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:39,331
Bryce did not acquit perhaps, but avoid his chair.

1573
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,127
The trial took place as planned.

1574
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:47,088
The evidence against Ben Dorfman was overwhelming.

1575
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,799
He was found guilty of all charges,

1576
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,010
including premeditated murder.

1577
01:22:52,344 --> 01:22:55,055
Despite the efforts of two lawyers overpriced,

1578
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:58,767
he was sentenced to die in the electric chair at Sing Sing.

1579
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:13,031
The Brolian father taught me Christianity.

1580
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,076
Today we talked about the Six Ps.

1581
01:23:16,368 --> 01:23:19,621
"Lord, do not rebuke me in your wrath.

1582
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:22,040
"Do not chastise me in Thy wrath."

1583
01:23:22,207 --> 01:23:23,041
That's right ?

1584
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,709
I am stunned.

1585
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:28,588
We did not care about that crap but when the end approaches, it helps.

1586
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:31,925
You do not want to be buried in a Jewish cemetery?

1587
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:34,386
For Jews, no life after death.

1588
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:38,014
Maybe, but I do not believe my ears.

1589
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:41,768
I need to know that everything does not end there.

1590
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:45,939
I need to believe that a part of me remains.

1591
01:23:46,106 --> 01:23:47,941
We all have a soul.

1592
01:23:48,108 --> 01:23:49,192
That's right ?

1593
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:54,614
First assassin.

1594
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,534
And now, Christian.

1595
01:23:57,826 --> 01:24:00,120
What have I done to deserve this?

1596
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,287
What's worse?

1597
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:02,580
There you explained.

1598
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:05,125
The Jews have no life after death.

1599
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,877
We all fear of death.

1600
01:24:08,128 --> 01:24:11,798
But it does not abandon the religion that we were born.

1601
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,758
I'm not afraid to die.

1602
01:24:14,426 --> 01:24:17,679
You're too stupid to understand what it means.

1603
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:20,140
I'm not saying that I like the idea.

1604
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:23,143
And I repulse death with all my strength.

1605
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:27,605
But when the Angel of Death will take my last breath,

1606
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:28,898
I will go.

1607
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:31,234
I complain.

1608
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:32,652
I swear.

1609
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:33,945
You hear me ?

1610
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:35,989
I will go complaining to me.

1611
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,657
Whose ?

1612
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:41,327
You will do what, idiot? A letter to the Times?

1613
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,456
I will complain of silence.

1614
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:48,585
Because all my life I prayed tirelessly

1615
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:50,503
and I never got an answer!

1616
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:55,467
What are you talking about ?

1617
01:24:55,884 --> 01:24:58,803
No answer is also an answer.

1618
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:03,808
It's stupid that Judaism does not offer life after death.

1619
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:06,686
They would have a lot more customers.

1620
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:11,733
In late July, Ben was executed at Sing Sing.

1621
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:15,695
Converted to Christianity, he wanted to be cremated.

1622
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:19,449
Ben wanted his ashes scattered in Manhattan.

1623
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,285
Bobby scattered them to an institution

1624
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:25,538
where Ben had spent many evenings of fun.

1625
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:38,676
Bobby's friends, Rad Taylor and her husband,

1626
01:25:38,843 --> 01:25:40,386
came to his aid

1627
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:44,057
that he bought the club and directs.

1628
01:25:44,224 --> 01:25:46,392
The scandal and the aura of gangsterism

1629
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:49,646
did not inflame the passion for the club.

1630
01:26:12,544 --> 01:26:15,380
Investors sent him to California

1631
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:18,883
to consider opening a club in Hollywood.

1632
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:22,220
This time he could afford the luxury hotel

1633
01:26:22,387 --> 01:26:24,722
where Rad and Steve liked to stay.

1634
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:26,558
Of course, he contacted Vonnie.

1635
01:26:29,978 --> 01:26:33,189
It is precisely here that I took your hand

1636
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:36,776
and you told me about your little journalist friend, Doug.

1637
01:26:37,527 --> 01:26:38,778
I remember.

1638
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:43,825
Then, you open a club here?

1639
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:46,286
No, Hollywood already has great clubs.

1640
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,913
No way to measure me at Cocoanut Grove.

1641
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:53,209
Phil and I will make a brief stay in New York, returning from London,

1642
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:55,670
to spend Christmas with Willie Wyler.

1643
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:58,089
They want Christmas Eve together.

1644
01:26:58,256 --> 01:27:00,049
I guess I will not see you.

1645
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:04,387
It is perhaps better that way do more.

1646
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,140
Each time...

1647
01:27:07,682 --> 01:27:09,517
it stirs emotions

1648
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,352
I start to dream ...

1649
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:14,147
You too, no doubt.

1650
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:15,982
And dreams ...

1651
01:27:17,859 --> 01:27:19,027
remain dreams.

1652
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:23,823
Some feelings never die.

1653
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:25,783
Is it good or bad?

1654
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:31,831
While a beautiful twilight enveloped New York,

1655
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:34,250
the year came to an end.

1656
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,839
What do you say ?

1657
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:41,758
Superb!

1658
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:44,010
We see that I'm pregnant?

1659
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:45,219
Not at all !

1660
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:49,641
In fact, you always kept your silhouette girl.

1661
01:27:50,183 --> 01:27:51,184
That is true.

1662
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:52,560
You help me ?

1663
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:59,067
Can I ask you a question ?

1664
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:03,947
You ever been wrong?

1665
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:08,952
Why do you ask me this ?

1666
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:14,457
I dreamed that when you were in Hollywood,

1667
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:17,835
you had sex with your ex-girlfriend that bears my name.

1668
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:22,465
The dreams remain dreams.

1669
01:28:33,977 --> 01:28:36,604
This is the most united couples I know.

1670
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:40,066
It is the perfect harmony. Indulge your secret.

1671
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:42,318
Our secret ?

1672
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:44,070
Tell them.

1673
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,114
We have common interests,

1674
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,991
like the same movies,

1675
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,575
and children.

1676
01:28:50,076 --> 01:28:52,161
- Those of others. - Here !

1677
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:55,081
Time flies, a new stage

1678
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:58,042
in this bewildering journey to where?

1679
01:28:58,209 --> 01:28:59,711
Or ? Why ?

1680
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:02,547
We had a terrible year.

1681
01:29:02,714 --> 01:29:04,632
Turn the page, move on.

1682
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:06,384
You're right, yes.

1683
01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:10,096
I thought of the relentless nature of time.

1684
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:14,684
Socrates said: "An unexamined life is not worth living."

1685
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:18,021
But when examined, it is no picnic.

1686
01:29:29,407 --> 01:29:30,116
10 !

1687
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:31,159
9 !

1688
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,160
8 !

1689
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:40,710
Happy New Year !

1690
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:57,685
- Happy New Year. - You too. I love you.

1691
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:00,938
Happy New Year. Good evening.

1692
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:05,151
Happy New Year, Bobby!

1693
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:11,199
You have a faraway look.

1694
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:13,743
- Really ? - What are you thinking about ?

1695
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:16,662
In anything, just the fact ...

1696
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:19,040
we change this year.

1697
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:20,666
It's certain !

1698
01:30:44,107 --> 01:30:46,109
Happy New Year my love.

1699
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:49,946
With you, every year is new and happier.

1700
01:30:51,531 --> 01:30:53,199
Thank you, that's really sweet.

1701
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:54,617
What are you thinking about ?

1702
01:30:55,952 --> 01:30:57,537
In anything, all is well.

1703
01:30:58,204 --> 01:30:59,956
You look pensive.

1704
01:31:00,123 --> 01:31:01,165
That is true ?
