1
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,795
I want that shoulder.

2
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:08,994
You want more?

3
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,954
All right.

4
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,219
Pat's waiting down there.

5
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,857
Your brother can wait.

6
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,831
He gets to see you
this entire holiday.

7
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,163
I told you, Hope.

8
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,634
I'll drive up
to Marin Christmas Night.

9
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,536
Okay? Promise.
Nothing will stop me.

10
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,814
Like every Christmas story...

11
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,115
this one's about new life
in the dead of winter...

12
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,188
but I didn't know that
at the time.

13
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,816
I was just a college kid...

14
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,589
coming home for vacation
with my brother Pat.

15
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,562
It was 1977.

16
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,825
My hometown of Placerville...

17
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,129
is up in the foothills
of the High Sierra.

18
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,227
It's not that far from Berkeley
as the crow flies.

19
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,239
It was just another world away
for me.

20
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,063
You see, Christmas
in Placerville never changed.

21
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,263
Every year, I painted the
scenery for the church pageant.

22
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,669
And every year,
Mom took the children's choir...

23
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,003
up to the mountains to listen
to the wind in the trees.

24
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,106
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,511
Oh, my beautiful boys.

26
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,896
Our neighbor, Mr. Rosa...

27
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,736
knew every shred of gossip
in town.

28
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,465
Jupiter!

29
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,037
He's German, you know!

30
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,878
Jupiter, stop kissing Tom.

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,117
Hi, Mr. Rosa. Thanks.

32
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,952
Tom. Here, Pat.

33
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,355
How are ya?

34
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,881
I'll get that thing
running yet, Maryanne.

35
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,791
I'll go look at it.

36
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,861
You should know,
that big Thanksgiving rain...

37
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,422
my house weathered fine.

38
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,797
I keep it in mint condition.

39
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,199
It's all in the upkeep.

40
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,704
But your mom, the roof
leaked something terrible.

41
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,069
Then the water pipe froze.

42
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,733
It burst and...

43
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,002
Water damage, huh?

44
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,566
She didn't tell us.

45
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,079
Maryanne wouldn't have told you.

46
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,512
You know how your mother is.

47
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,641
Yeah. You know what?
Thanks for sharing, Mr. Rosa.

48
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,674
You know,
with you boys off at school...

49
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,812
and then she's all alone...

50
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,321
but she still teaches
the kids how to sing...

51
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,517
and she sews all the Christmas
pageant costumes...

52
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,651
and, oh,
she's got pep, your mom.

53
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,183
Yeah, mucho pep.

54
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,856
You boys should get
on the stick for her.

55
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,262
She doesn't spill her own beans.

56
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,529
So you spill them for me.

57
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,968
Well, it needs oil
for one thing.

58
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,062
You know, Mr. Rosa...

59
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,970
if you ever did get
the truck fixed...

60
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,998
you wouldn't have anything
to gossip about, would you?

61
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,273
Come on, guys. I gotta
get supper over to Glen.

62
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,870
- Thanks, Mr. Rosa.
- See ya, Mr. Rosa.

63
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,482
Sometimes life
moves in mysterious ways...

64
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,785
and sometimes
there's no mystery at all...

65
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,984
like when Glen Wesman
built his studio...

66
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,015
across the field from us.

67
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,992
Having a famous artist
next door...

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,397
was like God's finger
pointing me toward painting.

69
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,798
All through high school...

70
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,802
Glen taught me what it means
to be an artist.

71
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:05,926
Glen?

72
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,032
Close the damn door.

73
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,676
Glen, it's Tom.

74
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,009
It's cold in here.

75
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,483
Why would you leave
the door open?

76
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,007
Where on earth are you?

77
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,384
In the corner...

78
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,753
like Little Jack Horner.

79
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,950
What?

80
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,549
Come in.

81
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,292
I'm learning Latin.

82
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,629
A dead language...

83
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,133
for the dead.

84
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,963
Maleficent crap, eh?

85
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,564
They're not done.

86
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,510
Some things are
better left undone.

87
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,109
I can't capture her.

88
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:56,050
Can't paint the loss.
My hands won't cooperate.

89
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,115
Don't get old.

90
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:05,526
That's the sum of my wisdom
at this advanced age.

91
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,931
Don't get old.

92
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,632
Don't...

93
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,101
get...

94
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,802
Oh, damned hand.

95
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,335
Nothing works
the way it used to.

96
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:23,838
Let me get that.

97
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,645
- Write.
- Yup.

98
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,950
"Don't get old."

99
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:30,978
Pin it up.

100
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,724
How's your work?

101
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,195
I'd like to see what
you've been painting.

102
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,289
I feel lost, really.

103
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,162
Here.

104
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,357
'Cause I've been doing
a lot of, uh...

105
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,569
a lot of
expressionistic stuff lately.

106
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,733
That will get you lost
very quickly.

107
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,734
Don't reduce art to something
that's about the artist.

108
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,337
Art isn't about the artist.

109
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,312
It's about life.

110
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,677
Life...

111
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,677
beauty...

112
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,085
Iove...

113
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,146
emotion.

114
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,388
Art should bring emotion
that can topple tyranny.

115
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,589
I haven't forgotten, Glen.

116
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,561
Are you gonna try
this one again?

117
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,667
We were in Paris
before the war.

118
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,667
And we would picnic
along the Seine.

119
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,041
You and Nicole?

120
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,674
A little wine, some bread
by the water.

121
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,446
She liked the simple things.

122
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,453
I lay back on the grass
and looked up.

123
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,688
The light played
through the trees...

124
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,354
touched her.

125
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,700
You must see
the summer light in Paris.

126
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:53,467
It surrounds the leaves,
holds them somehow.

127
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,098
If there were a God...

128
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,575
that light
would be like his hand...

129
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,841
holding the whole world
together.

130
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,041
If I could paint that...

131
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,141
Yeah, I bet that art dealer
in San Francisco...

132
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,310
would be very happy.

133
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,183
Sidney.

134
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,122
You know, a new Glen Wesman
would be worth a lot of money.

135
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,287
Sidney always tries
to inspire me.

136
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,624
"Call Sidney.

137
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:27,138
"Tell him to go to hell."

138
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,502
You like Sidney.

139
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,770
Do I?

140
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,783
You always said you did.

141
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,149
What was I writing?

142
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,155
You know, don't even...

143
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,884
Don't even bother
writing it down, Glen.

144
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,058
I bet you'll remember
to tell him to go to hell...

145
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,083
when you see him.

146
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,356
Yes.

147
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,794
I shall recline here
like an Oriental potentate...

148
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:03,840
and then try once again
to capture Nicole...

149
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,237
record the loss.

150
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,712
Nicole...

151
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,396
Want to top things off
with tea?

152
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,592
Fresca?
Some other fine beverage?

153
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,622
No.

154
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,029
FINAL NOTICE

155
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,363
Mom, what is this?

156
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,440
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

157
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,208
Bank says they're
foreclosing, Mom.

158
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,547
Tom, this is my business,
not yours.

159
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,779
Let me see.

160
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,382
I'll figure it out.

161
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,890
I have until New Year's...

162
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,221
to come up with
the back payments.

163
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,387
$3,151...

164
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,521
and 39 cents.

165
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,258
This is due in two weeks.

166
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,426
How can they do this?

167
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,268
They have already
extended me countless times.

168
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,602
I've spoken to them.

169
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,904
There's nothing more
they can do.

170
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,342
Mom, how could you
fall this far behind?

171
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,868
Why didn't you tell us, Mom?

172
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:14,743
Stop.

173
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,544
You are my boys.

174
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,143
I'm supposed
to take care of you...

175
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,813
not the other way around.

176
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,614
We're gonna lose the cottage.

177
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,862
Tom?

178
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,897
Oh, I was so close
to being asleep.

179
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,368
No, you weren't.

180
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,176
Okay. I wasn't.

181
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,249
You know how
I used to fall asleep?

182
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,521
It was looking
at that drawing of Dad...

183
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,261
and dreaming about
when he'd come back.

184
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,264
Babies.

185
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,262
On her own.

186
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,006
I remember Mom told me
I was the man of the house.

187
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm not gonna go see Hope.

188
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,957
I'm gonna stay here
and get a job...

189
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,289
and work over the break.

190
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,754
You and Hope are like...

191
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,287
pretty serious?

192
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,457
She'll have to understand.

193
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,192
We can't leave Mom like this.

194
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,467
Yeah, okay.

195
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,064
Me, too.
I'll find something, too.

196
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:49,938
Some job.

197
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,107
Yeah. Good.

198
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,846
Trade ya.

199
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,755
You're on vacation.

200
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,282
You shouldn't be getting jobs.

201
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,885
Yeah, but, Mom, you have a job.

202
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,954
You go to work every day.
Why shouldn't we?

203
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,362
This isn't right.

204
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,923
Living like this?

205
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:15,956
You need help.

206
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,767
No. Your job is
to focus on school...

207
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,796
and when you come home,
you're on vacation.

208
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,532
So...

209
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,544
relax. Enjoy yourselves.

210
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,314
Pancakes, anyone?

211
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,794
Blue box.

212
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,434
Thanks for the job, Big Jim.

213
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,026
I don't know much
about electricity...

214
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,128
but I'm gonna work real hard.

215
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,638
Well, we're gonna
have to, Pat...

216
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,641
because these people
over here never sleep.

217
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:01,237
I gotta tell ya, they've been
trying to top me for 25 years.

218
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,887
Your move, Big Jim.

219
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,393
You're pathetic, Gunderson!

220
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,696
You and your uptight,
beady-eyed wife!

221
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,566
You think you can top me?

222
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,867
I'm Mr. Electricity
in this town.

223
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,134
Watch this.

224
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,608
I built this myself, Pat.

225
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,285
Does that go any faster?

226
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,248
No.

227
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,096
Don't give in to him.

228
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,225
He called me beady-eyed
in front of the neighbors.

229
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,274
Right there,
that's why I need your help.

230
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,388
They're bitter,
ugly people, Pat.

231
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,086
Sadists at heart.

232
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,220
Keep your cat off my yard!

233
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,823
I found a hairball
in my manger!

234
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,163
You don't have a manger!

235
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,259
Yeah, you don't have a manger.

236
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,428
I hate that cat.

237
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,598
Come on, let's go
blow up Mrs. Claus.

238
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,433
I do too have a manger.

239
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,943
I got everything.

240
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,727
Ernie, hey.

241
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,600
Hey.

242
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,828
Little Thomas Kinkade...

243
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,362
all the way from college.

244
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,339
Look at you.

245
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,772
Jeez.

246
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,071
Take a seat.

247
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,476
Give this man
a Pepsi-Cola, will ya?

248
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,501
Sure.

249
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,537
Thanks. You know, um...

250
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,571
I was actually
looking for you...

251
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,141
because I wanted to talk to you
about finding a job.

252
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,880
You know, just something
over the holidays.

253
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,979
A job, huh?

254
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,320
- Yeah.
- Right, work.

255
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,824
- Yeah.
- Employment.

256
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,885
You're in Placerville, son,
and I can tell...

257
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,396
you're digging for gold,
aren't ya?

258
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,929
Let me tell you something.

259
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,331
I'm digging for gold, too.

260
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,135
Tourist gold.

261
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,503
Who do you think's gonna buy
the Haggar slacks...

262
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,666
at the Round Tent?

263
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,302
Who's gonna buy
the cowboy hats at Arian's?

264
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,107
Any thoughts?

265
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,545
Tourists.

266
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,411
Tourists, exactly.

267
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,350
But tourists who are
gonna be coming...

268
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:57,845
to the Christmas tree
capital of the world, baby.

269
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,585
Yeah, sounds good. So...

270
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,717
Sounds good? No, no, no.

271
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,987
It sounds great.

272
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,120
I got KRGA coming in
from Sacramento.

273
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,393
They're gonna cover the pageant
and the tree lighting.

274
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,831
We're gonna be on TV screens...

275
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,731
from the capital all the way
to the foothills.

276
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,998
We're gonna be going on
around 4:30 in the afternoon...

277
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,368
so it'll probably
still be a little light out.

278
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,565
But that's okay.

279
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,868
We're gonna be the lead-in
to "Match Game."

280
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,739
So one minute, people
are gonna be watching me...

281
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,074
and the next minute, they're
gonna be watching Gene Rayburn.

282
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,478
It's almost gonna be like
Gene and I are friends.

283
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,842
And, if that goes well...

284
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,682
next year, we're prime-time.

285
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,154
Wow. So...

286
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,213
Hello there.

287
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,886
Oh, hi, honey.
It's nice to see you again.

288
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,622
It's nice to see you.

289
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,492
Thank you.

290
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,088
Ernie.

291
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,156
Tanya.

292
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,269
Such an exciting time
of year, isn't it?

293
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,169
Yes, it is. Lovely.

294
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,697
I just can't wait to run
for Miss Placerville again...

295
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,643
and throw the switch
on that Christmas tree.

296
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,574
Tanya, you ran in 1974,
and you won.

297
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,445
I know.

298
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,809
You can't run again.

299
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,614
You gotta give
somebody else a shot.

300
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,851
But no one ever did
turn on a tree...

301
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,621
the way I turned on a tree,
now, did they...

302
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,651
Ernie?

303
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:12,829
You know, Tanya...

304
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,159
when those photos came out...

305
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,398
as president
of the Chamber of Commerce...

306
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,871
I got phone calls
night and day...

307
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,272
not to mention the organized
protests in the street.

308
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,105
I really don't think we want
to go down this road again.

309
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,702
I'm just telling you.

310
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,406
That was art...

311
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,642
and this is discrimination.

312
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,979
I'm sorry.
You just can't run again.

313
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,714
You are not the boss of me.

314
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,119
Yes, but I'm president
of Chamber of Commerce.

315
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,181
Yeah, well, I've got friends
in this town, too.

316
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,215
I'm not some
Little Orphan Ernie.

317
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,158
I mean, Annie...

318
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,721
Ernie.

319
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,993
You know what I mean.

320
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,364
I don't...

321
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,606
Goodbye, sunshine.

322
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:02,945
Tommy... everybody wants
a piece of this action.

323
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,449
So, do you have any jobs open?

324
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,717
No, I do not.

325
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,055
It's been very slow.
No tourists here.

326
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,584
That's exactly why
we gotta promote this place.

327
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,993
Like with this mural?

328
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,861
Yes. Yes, exactly
like with this mural.

329
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,994
Oh, Placerville
at Christmastime.

330
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,065
If Charlie could
just get it finished.

331
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,472
And if he could learn
how to paint.

332
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,908
You know,
he's a damn good letterer...

333
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,809
but other than that,
you really can't ask...

334
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,711
It's Main Street,
the Christmas tree?

335
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,009
I can paint this.

336
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,941
Really?

337
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:39,814
Yes.

338
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,212
Well, now, you know...

339
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,481
I want it like Norman Rockwell.

340
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,457
I mean, I want this to make us
proud of our hometown.

341
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,392
That's a tall order.

342
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,758
Oh, now, come on,
you're not gonna get...

343
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,423
all high-tone Berkeley
on me, are you?

344
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,092
None of that social
commentary stuff, right?

345
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,192
I mean,
this is the back of a store.

346
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,169
This is not a museum.
You understand that?

347
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,568
Of course.

348
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,936
Yeah?

349
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,907
- Yeah.
- All right.

350
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,604
Well, let's say 500 bucks
if it's done by Christmas Eve.

351
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,839
You got a deal.

352
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,710
Yeah? Deal?

353
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,404
All right.

354
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,610
How was work?

355
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,122
Oh, it was fine.

356
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,591
Filing claims is filing claims.

357
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,116
How about you guys?
Any luck?

358
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,129
We are both on the job.

359
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,393
All of us Kinkades
are workin' Joes now.

360
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,864
Oh, that's great!

361
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,697
That is great!

362
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,234
How about we go home
and celebrate...

363
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,569
with some leftover spaghetti?

364
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,436
All right.

365
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,308
Little Joe's.

366
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,337
Hi, Dad.

367
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,509
T-Bone!

368
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,314
How's it hangin', son?

369
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,786
Good, Dad. So, listen...

370
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,949
it looks like I'm gonna be in
Placerville the whole holiday...

371
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,185
and I thought you
might like to come up.

372
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,286
Kinkade! Is that
half-pepperoni done yet?

373
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,318
Comin', Skip.

374
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,421
Dad...

375
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,364
It'll be right up, sir.

376
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,891
- Dad...
- I'm gonna get that kid.

377
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,801
I've seen managers
come and go, son...

378
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,828
but Big Bill sticks.

379
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,465
Someday I'll own this joint.

380
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:14,275
Cash in my U.S. war bonds,
and I'll buy this place.

381
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,746
And I will watch with glee...

382
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,477
as that pimply-faced jerk
falls to his knees...

383
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:22,476
as dear old Dad is anointed with
the Little Joe's pizza crown!

384
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,988
Dad, he's nineteen.

385
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,785
He's wet behind the ears.

386
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,530
Hey, so, you can really come up?

387
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,963
It's kind of an emergency.

388
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,125
Chick problems, huh?

389
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,532
You need a pinch-hitter, son?

390
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,968
Look, I can explain it all
when you get here, okay, Dad?

391
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,666
Hey, I'll be there for you.

392
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,699
Don't you count out
your old Pops. No, sir.

393
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,386
500 bucks is 500 bucks.

394
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,716
Did you ever do a painting
you didn't believe in?

395
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,079
It's kinda funny you ask.

396
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,055
Actually,
I just took on a job...

397
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,955
doing this ridiculous Christmas
mural of Placerville...

398
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,325
for 500 bucks.

399
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,090
Ridiculous.

400
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,224
Yeah, I know.

401
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,564
A mural of Placerville.

402
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,131
It's your chance
to illuminate where you live...

403
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,505
to inspire your neighbors.

404
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,942
Do you think because
they aren't sophisticated...

405
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,412
they don't deserve
your best art?

406
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,436
No, it...

407
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,781
That mural can record the people
you love for posterity.

408
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,310
It could change
the way they see themselves.

409
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:09,617
Art crosses all borders,
surpasses all languages.

410
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,825
It's a place
where we are one family.

411
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,595
And if you are willing,
really...

412
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,570
to see with your eyes
and your heart...

413
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,334
one image can change lives.

414
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:27,203
You can introduce men
to their souls.

415
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,752
You can bring that
to this town.

416
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,418
You have that power.

417
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,852
Give your very best always.

418
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:48,228
Always the finest
your heart has.

419
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,631
Okay.

420
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,403
It's the only way
an artist knows.

421
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,269
Okay, Glen.

422
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,990
Humpty-Dumpty
sat on a wall.

423
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,327
Humpty-Dumpty
had a great fall.

424
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,002
All the king's horses...

425
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,571
and all the king's men...

426
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,572
couldn't put Humpty...

427
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,545
Humpty-Dumpty.

428
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,128
Glen wasn't
the only one grieving.

429
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:58,262
My mother was always there
to comfort everyone.

430
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,294
Like Butch, the owner
of the Hangtown Saloon.

431
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,932
Are you gonna go
over there before Christmas?

432
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,574
Yeah.

433
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,946
Well, his pine tree has shot up
another couple of inches.

434
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,319
I love the smell of that tree.

435
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,289
And the air today,
it's just so fresh and so clean.

436
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,096
That war,
it's still taking its toll.

437
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,960
Wars never end.

438
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,303
Just...

439
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,770
Just the lives of the soldiers
who fight them.

440
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,856
She's panting awfully hard.

441
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,555
She does that all day long.

442
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,291
Bulldogs have
respiratory problems.

443
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,923
You should really
have her checked out.

444
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,332
Problems, really?

445
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:04,801
Well, I will.

446
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,429
Thanks, Maryanne.

447
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,002
I owe you a beer.

448
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,876
I owe you more than that.

449
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,121
Stay, boy.

450
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,057
Stay, Jupiter. Down.

451
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,183
I'm sorry, Tom.

452
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,196
I always forget
the German word for "sit."

453
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,322
It's "sitten sie" or something.

454
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,299
He'll respond to German.
Sitten sie.

455
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:41,936
Jupiter...

456
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,863
sit.

457
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,975
Come on, Jupiter.

458
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,524
I know you think
I'm a busybody.

459
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,928
Am I okay with you?

460
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,897
Yeah.

461
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,506
Of course you are.

462
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,303
Okay.

463
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,542
Come on, Jupiter.
<i>Schnell.</i>

464
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,579
No, no, no, no, no!

465
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,449
Stoppen sie!

466
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,989
Stoppen sie! Come here!

467
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,825
Stoppen sie!

468
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,738
"And it came to pass
in those days that"...

469
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,683
No, no. More bass.

470
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,347
"And it came to pass
in those days...

471
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,516
"that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus...

472
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,584
"that all the world
should be taxed"?

473
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,458
Wow.

474
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,559
Psst. Hey, that's
too much spirit gum.

475
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,293
The bottle says "generously."

476
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,391
Yeah, but...

477
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,423
Oh, yeah?

478
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,130
Who died and made you
Max Factor?

479
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,001
Please let her do it, Evelyn.

480
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,372
Ernie won't let her be
Miss Placerville again.

481
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,899
She'll be fine in the role...

482
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,504
especially
with your brilliant direction.

483
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,542
Why doesn't Mary
have any lines?

484
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,179
She's the key role, Tanya.

485
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,452
Without Mary,
there'd be no Jesus.

486
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,959
Mary was
a beautiful woman, Tanya.

487
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,927
You'll be great.

488
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,454
Besides,
we need your star power.

489
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,139
- Hey, Pastor.
- Oh.

490
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,004
Guess what.

491
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,808
I'm gonna be Mary.

492
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,343
The Vir... The Vir...
The Blessed... Well.

493
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:10,051
Evelyn!
Did you want two humps...

494
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,385
on the camel?

495
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,086
You know what? I'll...

496
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,590
"And so it was that
while they were there...

497
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,893
"the days
were accomplished...

498
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,399
"that she should be delivered.

499
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,561
"And she brought forth
her firstborn son...

500
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,035
"wrapped him
in swaddling clothes...

501
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,436
"and laid him in a manger...

502
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,269
"because there was
no room in the inn."

503
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,639
Joy to the world

504
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,373
The Lord is come

505
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:41,113
Let Earth receive her king...

506
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,586
- Oh, damn it to hell!
- What?

507
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,919
Break's over, everyone.

508
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,449
Let's get started.

509
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,485
Places, please. Come along.

510
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,190
- Come on, kids.
- Come along.

511
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,528
Come along, hurry up now.

512
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,534
Madeline,
don't forget your staff.

513
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,695
Okay, great. Great.
Coming in?

514
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,466
Good, good, good.
Very good.

515
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,234
Vesta, we'll start
with "Silent Night."

516
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,365
What?

517
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,672
We'll start with "Silent Night"!

518
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,341
No, Vesta. I want to
change the order.

519
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,549
You can
never change the order...

520
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,178
of the pageant music with Vesta.

521
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,586
You'll have to wait
until she dies.

522
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,283
That could be arranged.

523
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,313
I'm serious.

524
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,020
Whoever is mooing,
please stop it.

525
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:25,995
Cut the cow!

526
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,563
Sawdust for brains,
this one.

527
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,999
Okay. If we could just start.

528
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,097
Okay. Stand.

529
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,035
Evelyn.

530
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,873
Oh, my God, Lloyd.
What happened?

531
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,003
It's an allergy.

532
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,070
I think
I'm in anaphylactic shock.

533
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,376
You're in ana-who?

534
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,179
I've read about this.
I know all the characteristics.

535
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,482
I've got the hives. I've got
the swelling of the neck.

536
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,489
I've got the cramping
little tummy pains.

537
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,785
It's the spirit gum.

538
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,519
I told you
you were using too much.

539
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,753
I was the one who said that.

540
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,852
Shut up, okay?

541
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,954
Wheezing,
throat closing down...

542
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,055
inability to breathe.

543
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,999
Oh, my God, we've gotta
get to a hospital.

544
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,524
I need a broncho-dilator.

545
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,295
Let me just...
I can help you with this here.

546
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,500
There's your broncho-dilator!

547
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,566
That really hurt.

548
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,976
You could say thank you.

549
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,173
Are you okay, honey?

550
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,479
I don't know. It was like...

551
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,506
an assault!

552
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,918
Oh, you're welcome.
What a jerk.

553
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,012
I can't work with him.

554
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,352
Yeah?
That makes two of us!

555
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,414
All right, all right, come on.

556
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,692
Come on, guys. Let's, uh...

557
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,217
Let's try to keep
our eyes on the prize, okay?

558
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,524
Those TV cameras out there...

559
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,054
they're gonna wanna
see happy faces.

560
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,295
Yeah, well, then why is
his ugly mug centerstage?

561
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,461
I'll tell ya why.

562
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,137
Because his wife is
the big kahuna here!

563
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,140
You take that back,
you big giraffe.

564
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,106
Why, you little...

565
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,033
You can't do that!

566
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:46,907
Watch me!

567
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,651
Stop it! Both of you!

568
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,156
In front of the children,
no less.

569
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,623
Some great Christmas pageant.

570
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,889
I can't be a wise man,
not with these two fools.

571
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:04,917
I'm turning in my beard.

572
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:05,952
Oh, no.

573
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,357
Ow.

574
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,631
We need a wise man.

575
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,037
Does he have a line?

576
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,970
I know the perfect person.

577
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,136
I'll be right back.

578
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,248
I haven't seen Butch
here since...

579
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,329
Nine years.

580
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,193
The funeral.

581
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,336
It can't be.

582
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,926
- Ho ho ho!
- Pop!

583
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,985
- Paddy boy!
- How are ya?

584
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,859
T-Bone!

585
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,353
Oh, my.

586
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,095
Man, couple of fine young
California redwoods.

587
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,035
Yeah! Dang!

588
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,198
Hey, boys, I got your Christmas
presents right back here.

589
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,504
Just what the doctor
ordered, yes, sir.

590
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,210
There it is, boys.
There it is.

591
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,234
Christmas classic.

592
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,247
Go ahead, Paddy-whacker.

593
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,509
Get 'em out here, huh?

594
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,880
I been collecting 'em
for a long time.

595
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,943
Many years now.
That's vintage gold.

596
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:36,817
First-class merchandise.

597
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,455
Go ahead. Open 'em up.
Don't be bashful.

598
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,685
Yes, sir. They're worth
many, many drachmas.

599
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,458
That right there,
100% made in America.

600
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,295
That's hot stuff. Turn it.

601
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,392
These are great, Dad.

602
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,868
Well, boys, I got
this puppy all tuned up...

603
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,172
for our invasion down
Mexico way. Yes, sirree.

604
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,507
I've been saving my pennies...

605
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,410
and I got myself
a pretty little pile...

606
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,211
because
we are going to Mexico...

607
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,211
where the beer is cold
and the señoritas hot.

608
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,781
Boys, we gotta go soon,
huh? <i>Olé!</i>

609
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,694
Wait, Dad, don't you
want to stay for a little bit?

610
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,356
Stick around? You mean
like park the carcass...

611
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,887
- chew the fat a while?
- Yeah.

612
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,662
Or no, but...

613
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,369
It's actually
kinda serious, Dad.

614
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,702
Look, why don't you
just come inside?

615
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,970
See, some stuff
happened, and...

616
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,773
I'll tell ya, Thomasito,
stuff happens.

617
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,438
You remember
what Confucius say:

618
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,913
"Life's a bitch...

619
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:37,937
"and then you die."

620
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:38,971
Right, but, Dad...

621
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,645
And you will be dead
a long, long time.

622
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,711
Dad, don't you wanna come in
for just a minute?

623
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,350
Well, not at this momento.
No, thank you.

624
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,950
I got a noose
waiting for me...

625
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,085
down at the Hangtown Saloon.

626
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,391
But you could
stick around, right?

627
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,900
We really gotta talk, Dad.

628
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,730
What's the matter, boy?

629
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,761
Ain't you gettin' any?

630
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,569
- Incoming!
- That's not the problem.

631
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,836
I mean, that is...

632
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,036
This is about something
totally different, Dad.

633
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,639
Okay, I'll stick around
a little while.

634
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,211
Whatever the problem is,
all you gotta do...

635
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,015
is just grab your ass
with both hands...

636
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,146
and never let go.

637
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,553
Yes, sir.

638
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,526
I can hear them señoritas
right now.

639
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,587
Oh, hey, boys.

640
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,622
I got you guys a couple
of stocking stuffers...

641
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,293
on my last trip to Mexico.

642
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,165
<i>Olé!</i>

643
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,118
Bitchin', Tom.

644
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,494
Hold on, Butch.

645
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,967
Stay right like that.

646
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,481
Cool.

647
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,714
Say, Rembrandt...

648
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,524
would you like
to take a walk with me?

649
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,592
I'm gonna go see my kid.

650
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,723
Sure.

651
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,773
I can't sleep.

652
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:55,784
They say that time heals,
but I...

653
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,853
I still can't sleep.

654
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,850
And, uh...

655
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:09,128
it hurts the same,
year after year.

656
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,563
Why doesn't it get easier?

657
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,369
I miss you.

658
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:30,180
Son, I miss you very much.

659
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,915
Merry Christmas.

660
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,270
You gotta be still, okay?

661
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,868
It's our final
dress rehearsal...

662
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,573
and I want it
to be perfect.

663
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,104
Okay, stand up.

664
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:33,647
And...

665
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,920
I told you not
to change the order.

666
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,330
"We Wish You
a Merry Christmas," Vesta.

667
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,068
I may not be
Miss Placerville...

668
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,098
but I can still
turn on a tree.

669
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,345
You want Placerville to look
its very best on TV, don't you?

670
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,370
Of course I do.

671
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:10,411
Well, who is the only nationally
recognized personality...

672
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,751
this town has to offer?

673
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,821
Okay.

674
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,022
We'll give it a shot, okay?

675
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,553
I knew that you'd
see it my way.

676
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,793
Ooh, make a wish.

677
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,095
I just did.

678
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,835
Evie, honey, I'm sorry.

679
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,930
I can't keep this beard
on anymore.

680
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,201
This spirit gum,
it's killing me.

681
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,609
Perfect. That was great.

682
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,375
Now Lloyd says he's quitting.

683
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,007
He's quitting?

684
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,416
Lord, we need
another wise man.

685
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,578
Oh, he can't quit.

686
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,588
Don't worry.
I'll be right back.

687
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,554
Just keep singing.

688
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,123
Them damn Krauts...

689
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,328
they circled us
here and here.

690
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,235
And that's why
they called it the Bulge.

691
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,966
We were like fish in a barrel.

692
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,464
Ol' Bill was a big walleye,
believe you me.

693
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,137
Hello, Bill.

694
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,074
I heard there was
a drifter in town.

695
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,255
Hi, sweetie.

696
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,416
It's been a while.

697
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,755
Not long enough.

698
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,353
That's not
a very kind thing to say.

699
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,486
Want a drink?

700
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,021
Not really...

701
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,126
but I figured you did.

702
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,158
So I do.

703
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,172
So I do, my dear.

704
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,936
I read once that drinking
was dangerous...

705
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,067
so I gave up reading.

706
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,449
Still killing time, huh, Bill?

707
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,715
No one ever kills time,
honey.

708
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,584
But you can hold it captive.

709
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,149
You told me that one
about a hundred years ago.

710
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,925
Feels like a hundred years,
that's for damn sure.

711
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,765
Lot of water
under the bridge.

712
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,535
Rivers under the bridge.

713
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,404
Oceans.

714
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,707
We were young once,
sweet Maryanne

715
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,749
Couple of crazy kids
had a wedding.

716
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,090
My mother threw rice.

717
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,921
You threw firecrackers.

718
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,826
You sure were beautiful.

719
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,732
Still are.

720
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,569
If I may say so myself...

721
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,370
I was quite a handsome
young lad once upon a time.

722
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,012
You used to call me
your knight in shining armor.

723
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,943
I see you've gotten
some dents over the years.

724
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:04,724
Yeah, well...

725
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,859
all that armor...

726
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,895
got a little heavy.

727
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,072
I just couldn't, uh...

728
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,915
Back then, we sure
were on the merry-go-round...

729
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,685
chasin' that brass ring.

730
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,316
I'm still goin' for it.

731
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,122
Yeah, while you're
grabbing that brass ring...

732
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,925
I'm trying to scrape together
a living to raise two boys.

733
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,401
And they are
damn fine young men.

734
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,595
Thank you.

735
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,674
Bill, I've never asked
you for anything.

736
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,938
Ever.

737
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,904
But the church
needs your help.

738
00:41:59,049 --> 00:41:59,981
Hold on, darlin'.

739
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,982
Usually people put that
the other way around.

740
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,045
I need you to perform
in the pageant.

741
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,283
Whoa, Nellie.

742
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,728
Bill, after this year's
pageant, I'm...

743
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,592
Well, things change...

744
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,102
and you never know
what's gonna happen.

745
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,537
The boys may not make it
home again for Christmas.

746
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,600
I just want this Christmas
to be really special.

747
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,975
Memorable.

748
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,743
Please.

749
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:36,184
Well... things aren't always...

750
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,246
as memorable as they used
to be, darlin', you know.

751
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,715
At least I don't
have Alzheimer's.

752
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,519
I have some-heimer's.

753
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,394
I remember some things.

754
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,331
I remember everything.

755
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,902
Do it for Pat and Tom.

756
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:57,999
You owe them.

757
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:05,144
Sugar, I don't owe
anybody anything.

758
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,082
Oh, you do.

759
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,083
You owe me.

760
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,439
Not this contraption.

761
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,505
I want my staff, my rod.

762
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,143
I don't use a walker,
a walker!

763
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,880
It turns you
into an old woman.

764
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,012
It walks you.

765
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,683
But a staff, a rod.

766
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,249
Give me something I can
assault the enemy with!

767
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,294
Hello, Glen.

768
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,862
Sid.

769
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,631
Sid?

770
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,702
In the too, too solid flesh.

771
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:18,670
Hey, boy-o.

772
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,879
There was something
I was supposed to tell you.

773
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,449
Nice to see you, Tom.

774
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,855
Thanks for coming,
Mr. Marvin.

775
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,188
Oh, now I remember, yes.

776
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,284
Go to hell.

777
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:32,955
I've already been there.

778
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,428
How's my market, Sid?

779
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:41,370
It's been a while since I've had
a new Glen Wesman to offer.

780
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,208
I need a great painting.

781
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,176
He needs a great check.

782
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,508
He's in rare form today.

783
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:49,842
What did you put
in his coffee?

784
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,711
I will not pander.

785
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,309
I won't put crap
out on the market.

786
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,649
No, no, no, no.
Glen, Glen...

787
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,712
I know you've had
some pain.

788
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,122
I've known pain all my life.

789
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,558
What I'm feeling now is rage.

790
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,654
Rage that you'd like
to calculate my suffering...

791
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,689
and translate it
into dollars and cents.

792
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,099
I'm through
with the whole business.

793
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,434
I'm done, I'm finished.

794
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,200
I've heard that speech before.

795
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,401
You think you're the only one
who's ever suffered?

796
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:23,436
Every year, Marc Chagall
yelled at me, huh?

797
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,004
Said he'd never paint again.

798
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:29,007
But he always came up
with a new piece from inside.

799
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,919
And you can do the same.

800
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,927
I've been trying
for months to do it, Sid.

801
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,323
To capture Nicole...

802
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,665
so the world would
never lose her.

803
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,904
It's not there.

804
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,142
I may not live
to see Christmas.

805
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,091
Get to work.

806
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,455
As you leave...

807
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,525
I'm leaving? I just got here.

808
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:22,061
Your inspiration
has exhausted me.

809
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,970
As you leave...

810
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,976
would you please
bring me my staff?

811
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,477
My rod.

812
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,742
I'll do that.

813
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:34,410
Somehow this walker
has appeared by my bed...

814
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,316
and I don't want
the damn thing.

815
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,850
Uh, Your Worship.

816
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,817
Now you can go to hell.

817
00:47:58,976 --> 00:47:59,806
Nicole...

818
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,808
Nicole...

819
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,647
Those pictures
are unsaleable.

820
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,674
They're not finished.

821
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,984
They are finished.

822
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,750
He won't go back
and finish them...

823
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:18,920
and he knows it.

824
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,692
He's been depressed
ever since Nicole died...

825
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,499
and it's gotten
in the way of his genius.

826
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,237
It's worse than that.

827
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,139
He's been getting
confused lately.

828
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,342
He has one more painting in him.

829
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,217
I'm sure of it.

830
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,552
That would make your bank
account very happy, I'm sure.

831
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,658
I know you think
I'm some kind of mercenary.

832
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,528
That's my job.

833
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:59,695
I love Glen.
I love his art, too.

834
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:03,502
And I've done right by him
for a long time.

835
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,271
And he's done
a hell of a lot for you.

836
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,136
So...

837
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,975
how's life treating you?

838
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,081
Have you got a minute,
Mr. Marvin?

839
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:28,489
My family...

840
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,567
we're...

841
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,229
We're in a bit
of a financial pinch.

842
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,732
Do you think maybe...

843
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,209
Do you think maybe
there'd ever be a buyer...

844
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,404
for any of these?

845
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,125
I don't think so.

846
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:08,168
Your teachers at Berkeley
do this kind of thing better.

847
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,435
These are pale imitations.

848
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:11,463
I'm sorry.

849
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,644
You might have something
inside you.

850
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,744
I don't think
you've found it yet.

851
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,686
But you sure as hell
can draw.

852
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,701
It's beautiful.

853
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,376
It's this little town and...

854
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,144
these people
I've known all my life.

855
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,517
There's so much love here.

856
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,288
It's beautiful, Tom.

857
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,351
Don't ever doubt that.

858
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,794
Nanette was my first love.

859
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,561
I hadn't seen her
in almost a year.

860
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,826
Funny how my heart jumped.

861
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,297
Five...

862
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,430
four...

863
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,735
three, two...

864
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:18,763
one.

865
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,670
Oh, that's so tacky.

866
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,409
Take that, Gunderson.

867
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,053
Keep them lights
a-coming, Patrick.

868
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,583
You're doing great there, boy.

869
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,033
What do you want
to do today, Vesta?

870
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,269
Look, there we are.

871
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,901
Hi, Butch.

872
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,775
Mother's milk.

873
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,770
Right back at ya.

874
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,384
If we could just start.

875
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,018
Mr. Chang.

876
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,323
Gunderson...

877
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:19,897
the wind is blowing down
your elves.

878
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,403
What wind?

879
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:24,805
And your flocking stinks.

880
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:28,242
Your flocking is outstanding.

881
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,877
You can bring love
into our church pageant...

882
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,114
but you have to hear it
and feel it first.

883
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,229
Am I beautiful?

884
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,126
I thought so.

885
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,002
It's coming along, huh?

886
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,174
Gunderson.

887
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,979
Yeah.

888
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,186
Merry Christmas there, Butch.

889
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,492
January 5th.

890
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,201
I don't know, Kinkade.

891
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,760
I mean, it's, uh...

892
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,101
Well, it's interesting.

893
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:30,964
No, it's not.

894
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,337
It's not gonna work.

895
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,972
Hey. There's my store.

896
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,983
Wow. Very beautiful.

897
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,144
I like that very much.

898
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,710
See? He hates it.

899
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:45,778
Oh, well.

900
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,346
That's me...

901
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,380
with Jupiter.

902
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,519
You see how friendly he is?
I told ya, Tom.

903
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,654
Look how skinny I am.

904
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,165
You know,
it was actually my idea...

905
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,996
to have him paint the people...

906
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,127
that make Placerville
so special.

907
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,637
I may not know much
about artwork...

908
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,798
but I do know
what the public wants.

909
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,305
Very beautiful.

910
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,175
You ready to take
a break there, Tom, huh?

911
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,941
A break? No.

912
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,573
Day after tomorrow's
Christmas Eve.

913
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,914
This has to be ready
for the TV cameras.

914
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,715
No, you can take a break
after Christmas. Yeah?

915
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,355
Listen, fifty bucks...

916
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,824
if you can find a spot
to put me in there, huh?

917
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,350
Fifty? Yeah?

918
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,760
Forty-five. Just paint me in.

919
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,086
Okay, great.

920
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,257
Wonderful.

921
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,102
Big Jim gave me some overtime.

922
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:40,843
And I'll have 500,
assuming I can finish the mural.

923
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,706
Then there's about 200
in my savings account.

924
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,807
I must have a hundred or so.

925
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,176
That leaves us short.

926
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:00,585
Hello.

927
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,530
I'm looking at you right now.

928
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,827
Hi.

929
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,027
At one of your paintings.

930
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:06,891
Hope.

931
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:10,099
I miss you so much, Thomas.

932
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,836
Yeah, me, too.

933
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,572
And I decided,
if you can't come to me...

934
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:17,907
I'll come to you.

935
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,058
Dad.

936
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,398
Number one son!

937
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:42,735
Park yourself right there.

938
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,400
Join me at the altar, Tommy.

939
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,406
What I'm most proud about you,
T-Bone...

940
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,905
T-Boneus Rex...

941
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,053
is that you
never took up smoking.

942
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,288
I'm really proud about that.

943
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,787
Look, Dad, I have
to talk to you about Mom.

944
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,923
Right, yeah. I remember.

945
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,762
You mentioned the, uh...

946
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,092
The money.

947
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,641
See, Mom got behind.

948
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,975
Oh, she got behind, did she?

949
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,240
Well, there's the switch.

950
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,078
She was always and forever
grinding my gears...

951
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,448
about getting behind.

952
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:31,283
Now she's behind.

953
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:37,851
That, number one son,
I find a regular laugh riot.

954
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,225
Well, it's not funny.

955
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,156
We're gonna lose
the cottage, Dad.

956
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,730
We gotta come up with $3,000.

957
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:49,160
Three grand.

958
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,498
Big spender, your mother.

959
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,942
Look, Dad, she...

960
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,741
She loaned people money, okay?

961
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,940
She gave people things.

962
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,506
She never gave me a dime.

963
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:02,776
Well, couldn't...

964
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:05,847
Couldn't you for me?

965
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,588
For Pat?

966
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,224
Well, you see, kiddo...

967
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,161
number one son...

968
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,561
I ain't got it.

969
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:32,672
I'm livin' paycheck
to damn paycheck.

970
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,851
What about the Mexico money?

971
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,012
Poof.

972
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,183
I'm livin' week to week...

973
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,695
hand to damn mouth.

974
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,497
Let me tell you something.

975
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,401
That's the only way to live.

976
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,303
Week to week, day to day...

977
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,968
hour to hour, minute to minute.

978
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,672
Each day in the moment, son.

979
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,872
Enjoy the hell out of life.

980
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,345
One day, you wake up...

981
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,016
and it's gone.

982
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,237
What happens if you're about
to lose everything...

983
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,800
that's made you who you are?

984
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,113
Your home, your teacher...

985
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:48,714
your hopes and dreams?

986
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,188
When that all goes,
what's left?

987
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:22,507
I'm not sure
about the speaker system, Tom.

988
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,543
I don't think
they have it anymore.

989
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,214
Well, just ask him, Mom.

990
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:27,517
Look, Ernie swears it's in
there...

991
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,320
and he says he needs
it for the pageant.

992
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,519
And you know how Ernie is.

993
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,255
He's not gonna let me alone
until he gets an answer.

994
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:34,752
Okay.

995
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,322
Mom, what about the speaker?

996
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,798
I couldn't ask him, Tom.

997
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,891
Why not?

998
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,834
Because I don't work there
anymore.

999
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,731
What?

1000
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:20,368
I got laid off in September.

1001
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,936
Business was slow.

1002
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,446
Oh, my God.

1003
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,248
You should've told us.

1004
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:28,807
No, I didn't wanna
worry you kids...

1005
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,081
interfere with your school.

1006
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:36,456
Mom, you come down here
every day, all day long.

1007
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,154
No, I sit on the bench,
or I go over...

1008
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,493
and I visit at the hospital,
or I, um...

1009
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,964
I help out at the church.

1010
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:49,336
And I look for work every day,
but there's nothing out there.

1011
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,469
We're going to lose the house,
Tom.

1012
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:56,867
We're gonna lose everything.

1013
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:57,971
No.

1014
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,445
No, Mom, hey, it'll be okay.

1015
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,545
I'm not so sure anymore.

1016
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,456
How will we live?

1017
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,857
Oh, God.

1018
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,293
I'll move.

1019
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:16,230
I'll leave Placerville,
and I'll get a job in...

1020
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,462
No. We'll figure it out, okay?

1021
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,663
You have so many friends here
in town. They'll help.

1022
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,262
- I'll go talk to everybody in
town.
- No!

1023
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,001
No, you won't.

1024
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:30,001
Maryanne Kinkade
does not ask for charity.

1025
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:34,881
I couldn't endure the shame,
humiliation.

1026
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,350
I will suffer this alone.

1027
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:43,719
The last thing that I still have
that is mine is my pride.

1028
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,460
You understand.

1029
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,738
Shouldn't I be in the center,
and shouldn't I be bigger?

1030
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,615
You're plenty big, Tanya.

1031
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,116
Can you fix it?

1032
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,919
I'll see what I can do.

1033
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,822
And you messed up my nose.

1034
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,554
I know, I hate that.

1035
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,027
I love your nose.

1036
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:26,665
Guess who.

1037
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,400
Hey, you made it.

1038
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:33,966
Well?

1039
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:40,940
Well, it pays the rent, right?

1040
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,451
All of a sudden,
Hope was there...

1041
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,250
with all her big city dreams
for me...

1042
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:49,281
and my two worlds collided.

1043
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,721
Hey. Get ready to go.

1044
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,128
That's it, that's it.
Smile. Smile.

1045
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,294
Oh, that's it.
Oh, good. Okay.

1046
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,201
This is so great.

1047
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,535
Ernie, look this way.

1048
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,771
Come on. That's it, That's it.

1049
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:11,075
Oh, good, Cheryl.
Stand back there.

1050
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,347
How'd the skank weasel her way
back in, Ernie?

1051
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,476
What's she got on ya?

1052
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,918
Nothing. Nothing!

1053
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,353
Yeah, and if birds could fly.

1054
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:22,016
Yes, birds can fly.

1055
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,821
Suck an egg, '77.

1056
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,828
Hey, come on, ladies.
Please, zip, zip.

1057
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,261
All right.

1058
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,930
And now from Placerville...

1059
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:34,164
the official Christmas tree
capital of the world...

1060
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:36,802
here to light
our town twee...

1061
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:42,707
our town tree is a veteran
Miss Placerville.

1062
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,682
So here she is now
to turn it on.

1063
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,852
Hello, Sacramento.

1064
01:04:54,924 --> 01:05:00,157
I'm Tanya Kapinski,
Miss Placerville, 1974.

1065
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,130
You know, I've worked
as a professional model...

1066
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,426
for many years.

1067
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:04,797
And in fact,
if you happen to have...

1068
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,564
the April 1974 issue
of "Easy Rider"...

1069
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,833
I'd be more than happy
to sign that for you...

1070
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:12,170
- right after the ceremony.
- That's good, huh?

1071
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,545
But there's no place like home.

1072
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:23,407
I mean, really,
home is just the best place...

1073
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,044
that a person could be from.

1074
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,157
And so it is with my great
honor...

1075
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,717
that I'm here to light up
Placerville...

1076
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,526
the Christmas tree capital
of the world.

1077
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:44,934
Okay, in five, four,
three, two, one.

1078
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,048
What?

1079
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,290
Just 'cause I wired it?

1080
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,950
It wasn't my fault, okay?!

1081
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,539
Nicole.

1082
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:32,648
Give me your hand.

1083
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,921
Hi, Glen.

1084
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,119
It's me.

1085
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,524
Sorry, I'm a little behind. I...

1086
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,265
What a day.

1087
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,797
There's a beautiful moon
coming up.

1088
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,976
A crescent moon for Christmas.

1089
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,438
I brought you something.

1090
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,608
It's icy on the bridge.

1091
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:05,385
Don't fall.

1092
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,388
Your fingers in mine, Nicole.

1093
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,064
It's Maryanne.

1094
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,262
I brought you
some hot chocolate, Glen.

1095
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,238
I don't want to lose you.

1096
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:28,537
Give me your hand.

1097
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,101
Here, let me help you up.

1098
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,740
Stubborn woman.

1099
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,416
Lean on me.

1100
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,417
We'll cross the Pont Neuf.

1101
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:49,323
Glen, we're not in Paris.

1102
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:51,823
We're in your studio.

1103
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:00,439
My studio?

1104
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,540
My easel, my paints?

1105
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,277
They're all here.

1106
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:15,823
Nicole?

1107
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,189
It's 1977, Glen.

1108
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,973
You've made me an old man.

1109
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,310
I was young a moment ago.

1110
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,547
Here, look at this.

1111
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,393
Smell this.

1112
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,564
Isn't it beautiful?

1113
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,698
Let me take you on a walk.

1114
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:06,538
You haven't been outside in...
in weeks.

1115
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,503
Let me take you on a walk.

1116
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,172
Let me take you
to the Christmas pageant.

1117
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,246
I respectfully decline
your invitation.

1118
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,879
My next visit to the church
will be for my funeral.

1119
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,092
There's still life
out there for you, Glen.

1120
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,924
You need to touch it
and taste it and see it.

1121
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,294
I see more than you think.

1122
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,905
Maryanne, you're killing
yourself with pride.

1123
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,918
That night, Placerville
had its chance to redeem itself.

1124
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,555
The Christmas pageant
seemed like a sure thing.

1125
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,994
I mean,
how can you go wrong...

1126
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:36,793
with little kids
and some wise men?

1127
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,801
I figured wax-based paint would
really make the scenery shine...

1128
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,666
under the TV lights.

1129
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,207
Showtime.

1130
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:07,356
"And it came to pass
in those days...

1131
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:10,593
"that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus...

1132
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:13,033
"that all the world
should be taxed.

1133
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:18,597
"And Joseph went up from Galilee
into Bethlehem with Mary...

1134
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:20,404
"his espoused wife.

1135
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:28,173
"And she brought forth
their firstborn son...

1136
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,353
"and she wrapped him
in swaddling clothes...

1137
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,877
"and laid him in a manger...

1138
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,583
"for there was no room
for them at the inn."

1139
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,034
What's wrong?

1140
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,914
What's happening
to the scenery?

1141
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,848
Oh, my God.

1142
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,153
We must've used too much wax.

1143
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,392
Under these lights...

1144
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:13,417
It's melting.

1145
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,864
Oh, look, the donkey's peeing.

1146
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:28,442
"And, um, there were in that
same country shepherds"...

1147
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,070
That's not good. That's not...

1148
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,139
"watching over their flock."

1149
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,752
Stop laughing.

1150
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,988
Oh, well, looks I'm gonna be
on riot control any minute.

1151
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,152
Let's walk off.
Come on, Sweetie.

1152
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,721
Let's walk.

1153
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,232
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

1154
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:52,631
No, no, no. Mary, sit down.

1155
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:53,930
What's going on?

1156
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,199
No, no, no, no, no,
don't stop the show.

1157
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:57,262
It is not the end
of the world.

1158
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,330
Yes, it is the end of the world.

1159
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,671
You don't understand.

1160
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,302
This was supposed to be
a beautiful Christmas pageant.

1161
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,675
It was supposed
to be a light, airy...

1162
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,644
Get back there.

1163
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:07,441
There was supposed to be
a lighted Christmas tree...

1164
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:08,745
in the town square.

1165
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:12,676
No.

1166
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,416
Huh, great.

1167
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,651
And now the final humiliation.

1168
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,683
Thank you, Tommy.
Thank you.

1169
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:19,887
This is all your fault.

1170
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,862
For goodness sake.

1171
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,865
You don't have
to listen to this, Thomas.

1172
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:24,888
Let's get out of here...

1173
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,161
back to where
they appreciate you.

1174
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,998
Oh! Oh, wonderful.

1175
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,664
Okay. Well, the TV people
are packing it in...

1176
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:33,641
and, great,
the audience is leaving, too.

1177
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:35,734
Well, Tommy,
you painted the scenery.

1178
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,678
You're the one that screwed up!

1179
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,078
Now, now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1180
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,014
Just cool your jets there,
Captain Kangaroo...

1181
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,038
and back off.

1182
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,352
Tommy Boy didn't screw this up.

1183
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:49,889
He gave this town
a great Christmas gift.

1184
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,393
Look at that mural.

1185
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,626
He gave you the heart
and soul of this place.

1186
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,891
Yeah, it looks
pretty good to me.

1187
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,000
This old town...

1188
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,339
you don't need
to impress anyone.

1189
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,513
You're A-okay
just the way you are.

1190
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,445
Aren't we all here
celebrating...

1191
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,578
someone who was born
in a garage?

1192
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,746
Stable.

1193
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:20,914
Or a...

1194
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:21,980
- Stable.
- Stable.

1195
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,013
Stable?

1196
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,519
He never had much money, either.

1197
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:31,457
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

1198
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,935
Thanks, Dad.

1199
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:42,365
We'd love to share...

1200
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:45,278
our Christmas candle lighting
ceremony with you.

1201
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,009
The children are ready.

1202
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,038
Come on, children.

1203
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,380
Let me help with you that,
darlin'.

1204
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,445
Hope.

1205
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,988
You don't belong here.

1206
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,253
I don't know where I belong.

1207
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,730
Don't give up on yourself.

1208
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,392
I'm not giving up.

1209
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,616
Will you read, Maryanne?

1210
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:51,444
"For unto us a child is born,
unto us a son is given.

1211
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:56,516
"And the government
shall be upon his shoulder...

1212
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:01,812
"and his name shall be called
Wonderful, Counselor...

1213
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:06,590
"the Mighty God,
the Everlasting Father...

1214
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,327
"the Prince of Peace."

1215
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,530
You know, I don't know a lot
about scripture.

1216
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:22,806
I'm not a scholar,
and I'm not a preacher...

1217
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,880
but when I look out
and I see the faces...

1218
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,816
of these young children
in the candlelight...

1219
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,820
so full of hope...

1220
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:37,319
I feel the presence
of God right here...

1221
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:43,528
like little angels
telling us all...

1222
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:47,831
to, "Fear not, I bring you
tidings of great joy."

1223
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:54,199
You are the light of the world
in a...

1224
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,410
a very dark winter.

1225
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:03,441
And we could all use a little
bit of extra light right now.

1226
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,521
Excuse me, angel.

1227
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:25,365
I light this candle as a symbol
of sharing God's love...

1228
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,432
with all of his children.

1229
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:35,648
That Christmas Eve, I realized
that in a vast, black night...

1230
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,879
even a little light
shines brightly...

1231
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,821
and all we can do is
our best to find that light...

1232
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,620
and share it with others.

1233
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,449
Ernie.

1234
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,034
Okay. And...

1235
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,930
Merry Christmas.

1236
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,799
Happy holidays.

1237
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:34,203
Bless you.

1238
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,698
It's Christmas Eve, Glen.

1239
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:10,930
How are you?

1240
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,281
Remember when you told me...

1241
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,758
this was the one night of the
year when animals could talk?

1242
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:41,901
You said when the animals talk,
it wasn't magic.

1243
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,167
It was holy...

1244
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,100
a glimpse of the sacred.

1245
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:57,141
You said it was a moment
where we could understand...

1246
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,982
the heart of every living thing.

1247
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:06,822
I always thought
it was a miracle...

1248
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,228
when you built your studio
in the field by my house.

1249
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,998
It was like God's gift to me,
bringing you here.

1250
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:21,908
You always told me you weren't
gonna teach me how to paint...

1251
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,509
but why to paint.

1252
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:32,451
And I'll be forever grateful
to you for that.

1253
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,221
I wish I could give you back
something...

1254
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,694
but I have nothing.

1255
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,201
We're losing the cottage, Glen.

1256
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,178
A year from now, I have no idea
where we'll be.

1257
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,242
This may be
our last Christmas together...

1258
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,117
and I have no gift for you,
Glen.

1259
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,555
I have no way to thank you
for everything.

1260
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,195
No money, nothing.

1261
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:22,563
Just love.

1262
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:29,533
I love you, Glen.

1263
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,413
Don't give up, please.

1264
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:37,577
That's the first thing
you taught me...

1265
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,349
about being an artist:
you never give up.

1266
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:42,322
Don't give up, Glen.

1267
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,318
There's a light in you still.

1268
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,033
The snow stopped falling
by Christmas morning.

1269
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:45,476
It had blanketed Placerville...

1270
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:46,537
Thank you.

1271
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:50,608
deep and crisp and even.

1272
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:51,710
Now it's your turn.

1273
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,617
There you go. Open it up.

1274
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,391
Thank you, Tom.

1275
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:10,161
Now I have the cottage forever.

1276
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,576
No, no, no, no, no.

1277
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,278
Don't say no, Mom.

1278
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,552
It's not much, but it's a start
of a new life for us.

1279
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:32,689
We gotta stick together.

1280
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,688
We're all we've got.

1281
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:39,355
Thank you, Pat.

1282
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:41,626
Thank you.

1283
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:45,829
It looks
like a million dollars to me.

1284
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:54,804
Good morning.

1285
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,979
We've come to help you
fix this place up.

1286
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,648
Then maybe you could sell it.

1287
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:04,954
It's about time somebody
gave you a gift for Christmas.

1288
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,523
But how did everybody know?

1289
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:11,425
I spilled the beans.

1290
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,629
We know this probably
won't solve all your problems...

1291
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,968
but we had to do something.

1292
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:20,438
It was kind of my idea.

1293
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:23,410
I mean,
after all you've done for us.

1294
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,935
Maryanne, for you.

1295
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,471
For good fortune and happiness.

1296
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,280
I don't know what to say.

1297
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,246
Say merry Christmas.

1298
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:37,647
Merry Christmas.

1299
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,161
Okay, son,
that ought to do it.

1300
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,329
Let's give her a shot.

1301
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,634
All right, come on, baby.

1302
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:56,439
Come on now! Come to Big Bill.

1303
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:58,877
Start that truck!

1304
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:00,107
Attaboy.

1305
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:05,477
Please sweep the dust back in.

1306
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,782
What?

1307
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:10,382
You are sweeping the good luck
out of the house.

1308
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:11,653
Let go of broom. Go, go.

1309
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,856
Yes. Do it. Do it.

1310
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,159
Very good. Yeah.

1311
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:26,803
I never knew.

1312
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,043
Knew what?

1313
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:32,878
That you matter to everyone?

1314
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,413
Well, you do.

1315
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,041
Tom, can you get that, please?

1316
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,092
Glen, what are you...

1317
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,424
Come here. Come in.
Oh, my God.

1318
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:21,450
What are you doing here?

1319
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,020
How'd you get over here?

1320
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:24,224
My staff.

1321
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,127
My rod.

1322
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:28,726
Are you okay?

1323
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:33,969
It's the light, Tom,
that's what lasts.

1324
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:36,636
The leaves are transient.

1325
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:40,774
They grow, turn green,
turn red, and die...

1326
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:45,582
but behind them,
the light lasts forever.

1327
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,986
Glen, please, come sit down.

1328
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,582
Paint the light.

1329
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:56,554
Christmas gift.

1330
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:04,570
Remember how Sidney hoped
I had one more painting in me?

1331
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:07,201
I did.

1332
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:10,204
Just one.

1333
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,952
Latin.

1334
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:29,656
Good old Latin.

1335
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,525
"The Last Leaf"...

1336
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,160
is my last painting, Tom.

1337
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:43,368
No, Glen, no.

1338
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:47,211
I had been trying
to paint my sorrow...

1339
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:50,581
to show the bleakness of a world
without Nicole.

1340
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:55,253
But then you came
with a candle last night...

1341
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:59,953
and I knew what
Nicole's memorial should be.

1342
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:04,328
Not darkness, no, but light.

1343
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:12,965
Sometimes we can barely see
beyond the forest to the sky.

1344
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,845
I was painting the leaves
of the forest...

1345
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:21,212
and never saw the light
of the sky behind it.

1346
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,679
Now I see it.

1347
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,390
That's all I need to see now.

1348
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,822
I'll treasure this forever,
Glen.

1349
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:36,386
No, you will not.

1350
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:37,989
You will take it
to Sidney Marvin...

1351
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:39,056
and you will sell it.

1352
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:44,060
The last Glen Wesman
should bring you enough...

1353
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,972
to keep this cottage forever.

1354
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:49,306
Oh, Glen. Thank you.

1355
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:54,709
No, thank you. Thank you.

1356
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,444
What for?

1357
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:03,389
You managed to put Humpty-Dumpty
back together again.

1358
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:31,916
Those were the last brushstrokes
Glen ever painted.

1359
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:35,314
He sat at our table
for Christmas dinner.

1360
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:40,427
- There, Tom. You'll carve it.
- Of course.

1361
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:44,658
All right.

1362
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:52,298
Holy Father,
bless this meal...

1363
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:55,400
and all who are gathered here.
Amen.

1364
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:57,666
Merry Christmas.

1365
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:00,638
Merry Christmas, Glen.

1366
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:35,510
My mother made sure
Glen was well-fed.

1367
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,575
After dinner, we sang carols.

1368
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:41,046
The old favorites,
with words like...

1369
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,579
"the hopes and fears
of all the years"...

1370
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:47,060
and "God rest ye merry,
gentlemen."

1371
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:53,963
Then I helped Glen walk home.

1372
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,573
Big Jim stayed up all night...

1373
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,439
fixing the wiring
on that tree...

1374
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:05,240
and Placerville turned on
its real lights that year.

1375
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,113
I always thought it was the year
we found Christmas...

1376
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:09,138
all over again.

1377
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:23,258
Wow.

1378
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,703
When I went to see Glen
the next evening...

1379
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:40,613
he had gone home for good.

1380
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,278
He was back where the light
burns brighter...

1381
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,750
than we could ever imagine.

1382
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:48,914
<i>Pacem,</i> Glen.

1383
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:51,117
Peace.

1384
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,193
You showed me the light...

1385
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,460
a light that has filled my life
ever since.

1386
01:33:57,498 --> 01:34:03,095
You have that power holding
the whole world together.

1387
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:08,200
Now I see it.

1388
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,542
That was thirty years ago.

1389
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:21,950
Today, Big Jim still puts up
just one star, nothing else.

1390
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:26,792
And he and the Gundersons
finally became friends.

1391
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:30,557
Vesta's buried in that
little cemetery near our house.

1392
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:33,624
Butch is there, too...

1393
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:36,000
finally resting peacefully
next to his son.

1394
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:39,368
Glen's painting
took a journey, too...

1395
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:42,134
and is now owned
by a museum in New York.

1396
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:48,448
Mr. Rosa retired, but he still
keeps track of all of our lives.

1397
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:52,248
Tanya kept entering
the Miss Placerville contest...

1398
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:54,686
until she was well into her 50s.

1399
01:34:54,722 --> 01:35:00,354
And to this day, Ernie still
promotes Placerville... quietly.

1400
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:02,823
Pat stuck with his schooling...

1401
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:05,161
and became a well-known writer
and professor.

1402
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,424
Nanette?

1403
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:11,494
Well, that's a story
for another day.

1404
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:16,475
And Mom,
thanks to Glen's gift of love...

1405
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:20,639
well, she never had to worry
about a mortgage payment again.

1406
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:22,911
She got a job she loved
with the county...

1407
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,747
and retired several years later.

1408
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:27,647
And Bill?

1409
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:32,881
Well, my dad
kept leading his crazy life...

1410
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,828
driving his old heap
in search of new adventures.

1411
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:44,669
As for me,
I'm still trying my best...

1412
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:46,605
to use the lessons Glen
taught me.

1413
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:53,669
Lessons about art, about life,
and about light.

1414
01:35:55,382 --> 01:36:01,007
In the end, love is the
brightest light of all.

1415
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:17,034
FOR GLEN

1416
01:41:17,035 --> 01:41:18,035
