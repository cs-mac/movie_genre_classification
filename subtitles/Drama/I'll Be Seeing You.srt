1
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,578
- A package of gum, please.
- No gum.

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,913
- Then give me a chocolate almond bar.
- Chocolate almond bar?

3
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,338
No chocolate almond bars and no gum.
Where have you been?

4
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,219
- Made up your mind yet, soldier?
- Yeah.

5
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,008
<i>All aboard.</i>

6
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,673
- How much?
- Which one?

7
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,138
<i>Los Angeles Westbound Express. Track two.</i>

8
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,595
- This one.
- A quarter.

9
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,356
<i>Temple, Pinehill...</i>

10
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,818
<i>Greenwood, and points west.</i>

11
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,853
<i>All aboard.</i>

12
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,451
<i>Los Angeles Westbound Express.</i>

13
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,739
- Hey, soldier.
- Me?

14
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,786
Forgot your magazine.

15
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,458
Excuse me, miss. Is this seat taken?

16
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,251
Do you mind if I sit here?

17
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,967
Are you riding alone,
or traveling with luggage?

18
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,386
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

19
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,509
Going my way?

20
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,476
Are you trying to start
a conversation with me?

21
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
Hi, everybody!

22
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,899
- Hi.
- Hi, Mac.

23
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,444
You at Guadal?

24
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,661
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if I was
in the force that moved you in there.

25
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,037
Could be.

26
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,879
We sure caught it
for the first couple of weeks down there.

27
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,382
Hiya, pal.

28
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,107
What are you crying for, dope?
The sailor said hello to you, that's all.

29
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,447
The kid must have
some beef against the Navy.

30
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,116
Say, that's quite a layout out there.

31
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,570
I don't like prisons.
They give me the creeps.

32
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,370
You got nothing to worry about.

33
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,623
If you get into a jam
and wind up in the clink...

34
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,909
I got a friend
who can give you a low number.

35
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,954
Hot coffee. Get it while it's hot. Coffee.

36
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,296
Rock breaks scissors.

37
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,883
- Don't I ever win one of these?
- You'll catch on to it.

38
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,810
- Scissors cuts paper.
- Holy cats!

39
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,768
- Once more. Let's go.
- Let's try it again.

40
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,815
- Rock breaks scissors.
- Come on.

41
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,444
Paper covers rock.

42
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,065
Scissors cuts paper.

43
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,949
I've been waiting for this.

44
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,616
No matter how this works, I lose out.

45
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,160
- Do you want to try it?
- Too rich for me.

46
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,667
- How about you, miss?
- I'm afraid I couldn't take it.

47
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,172
What do you say we get something to eat?

48
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,093
I'm loaded.
I'll buy everybody coffee and sandwiches.

49
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,425
No ifs, ands, or buts. The treat's on me.
Papa's on leave.

50
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,099
<i>- I'll be back in a flash with the trash.
- I'll help you carry it.</i>

51
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,313
- Are you going home on furlough?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,068
Yeah, I'm on furlough.
They gave me a furlough.

53
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,864
Is this your first time home since...

54
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,909
Well, I haven't got
any regular home or family.

55
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,119
I'm just going to visit.

56
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,406
You traveling on business, or...

57
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,247
No, I'm on vacation. Christmas vacation.

58
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,172
What kind of business are you in?
I mean, what sort of work do you do?

59
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,541
Well, I...

60
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,507
I travel.

61
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,056
I'm a traveling saleslady.

62
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,769
I never heard any jokes
about traveling salesladies.

63
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,721
I guess there aren't many.

64
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,940
I never would have guessed
that's what you did.

65
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,602
What would you have guessed?

66
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,236
That you were...

67
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,981
I don't know...

68
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,324
a secretary or a model maybe...

69
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,454
or schoolteacher.

70
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,036
Well, I once was a secretary...

71
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,660
and I wanted to be a model.

72
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,667
So that would have been
pretty good guessing.

73
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,044
You're going all the way to L. A.?

74
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,507
No, I haven't much farther to go,
as a matter of fact.

75
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,717
I'm getting off at Pinehill.

76
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,927
Pinehill your home?

77
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,398
No. I'm just visiting my uncle.

78
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,483
That's funny. I'm going to Pinehill, too.

79
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,284
Really?

80
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:38,539
Yeah. I'm visiting there.
My sister lives in Pinehill.

81
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,997
<i>- I'll bet she'll be very glad to see you.
- I hope so.</i>

82
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,709
Maybe we'll run into each other there.

83
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,464
Yes.

84
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,642
Bye.

85
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,648
617 North Elm Street.

86
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,021
Oh, wait. if...

87
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,439
If anybody tried to telephone you,
how could they get you?

88
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,989
Well, my uncle's name
is in the telephone book.

89
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,574
- Henry Marshall.
- Henry Marshall?

90
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,534
- What's your name?
- Mary Marshall.

91
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,873
Mary Marshall. Goodbye.

92
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,080
Wait a minute.

93
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,170
If somebody calls and says
it's Zachary Morgan, that's me.

94
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,590
Glad to meet you.

95
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,635
Merry Christmas.

96
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,587
If there's anything you want, just holler.

97
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,873
We like to do whatever we can.

98
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,537
<i>Don't get worried, Zach.</i>

99
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,915
<i>That bayonet wound is all healed...</i>

100
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,873
<i>but the wound in your mind
is going to take a little more time.</i>

101
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,624
<i>That's why the doctors gave you
this 10-day leave from the hospital...</i>

102
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,463
<i>to prove to you
that you can go out in the world again...</i>

103
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,469
<i>and find a place for yourself.</i>

104
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,409
<i>It's going to take a little while
to get your timing back.</i>

105
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,663
<i>You'll still drop things and be a
little slow, but you'll get well.</i>

106
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,755
<i>They told you you would.</i>

107
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,550
<i>The important thing is not to
get too tired, not to give in.</i>

108
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,969
<i>Then you won't get any of those...</i>

109
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,556
<i>Those things that wind up
with a shot in the arm, or a tub...</i>

110
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,434
<i>or that little room with a barred window.</i>

111
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,523
<i>You can fight those things off, Zach,
if you'll believe that you'll get well.</i>

112
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,897
<i>Stop thinking about yourself, Zach.</i>

113
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,484
<i>You'll get well.</i>

114
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,975
- Here you are.
- Aunt Sarah.

115
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,274
- Welcome home, dear. Come on in.
- Thank you.

116
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,652
- How was your trip?
- It was fine.

117
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,901
You haven't changed, Mary, not at all.

118
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,948
Thank you, Aunt Sarah.

119
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,651
<i>It's so good to be here.</i>

120
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,988
I'm so glad to have you with us, dear.
Awfully glad.

121
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,324
Barbara, come on down.

122
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,328
You can share Barbara's room.

123
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,459
- I don't want to disturb anybody. I don't...
- Nonsense. Barbara will love to have you.

124
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,086
Here, for Heaven's sake, give me your coat.

125
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,257
Anyway, it's the guest room,
or it was before Barbara was born.

126
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,304
Besides, I think it'd be
a very good thing for Barbara. She's 17.

127
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,593
Seventeen?

128
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,854
And she's pretty, spoiled, and at an age...

129
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,351
You know.

130
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,484
I think an older girl will be a very
good thing for her right now, like you.

131
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,270
Yes, like you.

132
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,524
There's a million things to talk about,
but first you want to wash up.

133
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,994
Hello, Mary. I'm awfully glad to see you.

134
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,330
Hello, Barbara.
Why, I never would have known you.

135
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,913
- She's grown into a beauty.
- Welcome home.

136
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,996
- Take Mary up to your room, dear.
- Follow me, lady, to my boudoir.

137
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,212
Although it's small,
not much bigger than a cell.

138
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,837
I'm sorry, Mary.

139
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,214
Look, there's just one thing.

140
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:52,474
We all know that I've been in prison,
and that I'm going back in eight days.

141
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,347
And there's no use pretending it isn't so.

142
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,147
It just won't be any good
unless everybody says what he thinks...

143
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,777
and doesn't try to cover up.

144
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,277
You're a fine girl, Mary.
Now go up and see your room.

145
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,409
That's Mom's room.

146
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,750
I don't remember, Mary.
Were you ever here before?

147
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,707
Only once, when you were just a kid.

148
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,375
Here we are.

149
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,000
All the comforts of home.

150
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,088
It's nice, Barbara.

151
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,420
We even have our own bathroom.

152
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,382
This is where I sleep?

153
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,957
I was just thinking,
that's a nice suit you have on, Mary.

154
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,789
Thank you, Barbara.

155
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,133
You were thinking of something else, too.

156
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,591
As a matter of fact, I was.

157
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,719
<i>- Where can I put this?
- I'll take it.</i>

158
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,639
You may as well tell me,
so we can both get it off our minds.

159
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,769
Well, I just... Well, you see...

160
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:25,150
I hadn't known that they gave
these vacations, or furloughs...

161
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,860
to people that...

162
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,659
You don't have to be shy about it.
I didn't know about it either...

163
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,204
till the warden told me that in this state,
and in a few other states...

164
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,457
they give special furloughs to people
for good behavior.

165
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,503
I think it's wonderful
that they have that confidence in you.

166
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,587
Yes. I think so, too.

167
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,482
The soap in the dish is mine,
yours is on the shelf.

168
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,612
- Mary?
- Yes, I heard you.

169
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,481
You must have been
looking forward to it, Mary.

170
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,851
I was looking forward to seeing you,
Aunt Sarah.

171
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,769
That's sweet of you, dear.

172
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,614
As a matter of fact, selfish.

173
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,570
I've been doing a lot of thinking
in the past three years, Aunt Sarah, and...

174
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,201
What sort of things
were you thinking, Mary?

175
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,875
Coming out into the world and...

176
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,667
Even coming here, I had a feeling that...

177
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,757
Honey, you've got to stop being afraid.

178
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,553
You've got to stop feeling that you're
branded like people were in the old days.

179
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,932
You've done something,
you're paying your debt to society.

180
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,434
Most people are willing
to let it go at that.

181
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,562
I know, but coming out into the world...

182
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,436
and seeing everybody in uniform,
everybody doing something...

183
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,816
I just don't belong, I don't fit in.

184
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,025
And dreams that I've had for the future...

185
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,033
are just impossible.

186
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:43,284
Most dreams are, Mary.
It's just the dreaming that counts.

187
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,461
Nobody gets
exactly what he wants out of life.

188
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,591
One of the first things you learn
is to make compromises with your dreams.

189
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,720
But I'm not talking about palaces
and rainbows, Aunt Sarah.

190
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,881
I'm talking about a home.

191
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,888
A home like this,
with a kitchen and a stove and an icebox...

192
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,021
and a husband, and a child.

193
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,773
Yes, I have all that.

194
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,314
Yet I used to dream
about palaces and rainbows.

195
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,403
<i>But you're happy.</i>

196
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,940
Of course.
Because I didn't hold out for too much.

197
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,323
I accepted what I thought was second best
and made that do.

198
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,780
It's something that everybody learns
sooner or later.

199
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,751
We have to get used to accepting
what you think is second best, and then...

200
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,082
you find out it's first best after all.

201
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,004
No, I don't see how that could...

202
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,639
Yes, this is Mr. Marshall's home.

203
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:40,891
Who is it?

204
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,434
Just a minute.

205
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,141
- It's for her.
- And why not?

206
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,555
Mary, it's for you.

207
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,016
Barbara, come and help me set the table.

208
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,522
Thank you.

209
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,773
Hello?

210
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,656
Yes, Zach, this is me.

211
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,191
Of course I meant it.

212
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,071
I'd love to, but what about your sister?

213
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,494
That's too bad.

214
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,203
I'd love to, Zach, but...

215
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,413
Wait just a minute.

216
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,757
Aunt Sarah...

217
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,427
this is a soldier I met on the train,
and he's really very nice.

218
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,181
He came here to visit his sister,
and finds that she's gone to California...

219
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,809
and he wants me to go to dinner with him,
and I was wondering if...

220
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,138
A soldier?
Well, why not ask him here for dinner?

221
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,728
- May I, Aunt Sarah?
- You ask him this instant.

222
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,650
And tell him not to be late.

223
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,314
Hello, Zach.

224
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,069
You're to come over here to dinner, Zach.

225
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,575
But we all want you.

226
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,322
Yes, and Aunt Sarah says not to be late.

227
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,826
It's 617 Elm Street. That's right.

228
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,994
All right, goodbye.

229
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,506
- How did you ever happen to meet him?
- Well, I...

230
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,634
- Was he good-looking?
- Why, I don't know.

231
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,211
Didn't you notice?

232
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:03,265
No more lollygagging. Hurry and set the
table. Your father'll be here any minute.

233
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,183
A soldier for dinner!

234
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,645
- Hello, Babs.
- Hi, Dad.

235
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,899
- Mary get here yet?
- Yes. She's in there.

236
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,074
Good.

237
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,536
Thanks.

238
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,282
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.

239
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,289
- Welcome, Mary.
- Hello, Uncle Henry.

240
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,167
- You're looking fine.
- Thank you.

241
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,424
I'm happy to have you here, Mary.
I mean it.

242
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,755
Hey, you must have behaved really well
for them to give you this vacation.

243
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,173
I think that's fine.

244
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,144
Well, it's just that they don't exactly
look upon me as a criminal.

245
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,478
No, of course not.
I don't think of you as a criminal, either.

246
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,105
Otherwise I'd never have put up
the lawyer money.

247
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,482
- I think you would, Henry.
- Now, Sarah.

248
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,158
What's done is done.
Let's think no more about it.

249
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,910
I want you to have a good time
while you're here.

250
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:06,991
Thank you.

251
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,243
I want you to feel just like any one of us.

252
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,455
She's going to, Henry.
We've invited a soldier to dinner for her.

253
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,204
You did?

254
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,083
Well, that's fine.

255
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,723
I'm sorry.
I thought this was the Marshall house.

256
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,890
It is.

257
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,095
- Is Miss Marshall here?
- I'm Miss Marshall.

258
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,396
I mean your... Mary Marshall.

259
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,974
- Well, she...
- Barbara, stop teasing that young man.

260
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,355
- I'm Mary's aunt. You're Zachary?
- Yes.

261
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,646
This is Barbara, my foolish daughter.

262
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,072
- Hello.
- Hi.

263
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,782
- May I take your coat and hat?
- Thank you.

264
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,160
- Hello, Zach.
- Hello, Mary.

265
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,365
You were quick.

266
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,290
Take Zachary into the living room.
Make him comfortable.

267
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,449
Thank you.

268
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,672
Henry, dinner.

269
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,345
- Is it on the table?
- In a minute.

270
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,803
- Barbara, come with me. I need you.
- Oh, Mother.

271
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,603
This is swell.

272
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:19,018
I haven't been in a real home like this
in almost as long as I can remember.

273
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,775
It's too bad about you missing your sister.

274
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,069
Well, Mary...

275
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,904
I'm in this house under false pretenses.

276
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,036
I haven't any sister. I
just made all that up.

277
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,333
When you said you were getting
off the train at Pinehill...

278
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,541
I had to make up some sort of excuse
so I could get off with you.

279
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,927
Good evening.

280
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,932
Uncle Henry, this is Zachary Morgan.
My uncle.

281
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,932
- Happy to have you here, Sergeant.
- Thank you.

282
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,685
Make yourself at home. Happy to do
whatever we can for the armed forces.

283
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,189
A man always feels, these days,
he's not doing enough.

284
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,271
How about a drink? Have some bourbon.

285
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,823
No, thank you, I'm not drinking just now.

286
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,325
Well, let you in on a little secret.

287
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,111
Neither am I.

288
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,368
It's a funny thing.
People that have it don't want it.

289
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,869
Oh, fine.

290
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,959
People that can't get it...

291
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,872
you ought to see the act they put on
in my drugstore to get that stuff.

292
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,084
Supper's ready. Come and get it.

293
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,511
Hungry?

294
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,687
- Mary, you sit over here. Zach, down there.
- Thank you.

295
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,813
We thank you, God, for our daily bread.

296
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,991
We will do our best to deserve it.

297
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,078
We know that you are
present here with us...

298
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:57,078
that you are smiling upon our two guests,
Mary and Zachary.

299
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,330
Please look after all our dear ones...

300
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,630
and all the boys
who are fighting for our country.

301
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,173
Amen.

302
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,419
You're not very used to saying grace,
are you, Zach?

303
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,179
No. In the Army I guess
you don't have time.

304
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,516
Didn't you even say it when you were a kid?

305
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,849
When I was a kid I did,
it was just sort of routine.

306
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,515
- You say it as if you meant it, sir.
- I do, Sergeant.

307
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:25,937
Makes me want to say that I am grateful,
too, for being here and everything.

308
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,729
Thank you, Zachary.

309
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,442
- You must be quite a soldier.
- I wouldn't say that.

310
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,907
The Good Conduct Medal,
two campaigns in the South Pacific...

311
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,784
and the Purple Heart.

312
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,784
For Heaven's sake, Barbara,
where'd you learn all that?

313
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,912
A girl gets to know medals
like she does boogie-woogie.

314
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,714
But the Purple Heart,
that means you were wounded.

315
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,760
Barbara, stop asking questions.
I'm sure Sgt. Morgan doesn't like it.

316
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,304
Come on, Zach,
tell us how you got to be a hero.

317
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,180
After dinner, you go upstairs
and take off some of that lipstick.

318
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,560
Looks as if you fell in a pot of red paint.

319
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:05,192
Go on, eat your soup, Sergeant,
before it gets cold. That's orders.

320
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,816
You must have been disappointed
not to find your sister.

321
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,442
Well, Mrs. Marshall...

322
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,946
She took a defense job in California.

323
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,827
Didn't she?

324
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,658
Are you mad at me, Zach,
for asking all those questions?

325
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,745
No.

326
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,162
I'm not mad. You mad?

327
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,374
No, I'm not mad.

328
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,438
Dad.

329
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,017
- Dad, I want to ask you a question.
- Fine. Fire away.

330
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,112
You know,
you never told me anything about Mary.

331
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,570
I mean, why she was sent to prison,
and why she...

332
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,578
You can find out about that some other
time, when you're a little older.

333
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,660
But it can't be so secret.
I don't see why I shouldn't know.

334
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,618
Barbara, you can find out about that
some other time.

335
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:08,331
It's just that Mary made a little mistake,
and that's all there is to it.

336
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,292
But they don't send people to prison
for just doing nothing.

337
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,302
Look, I'm trying to listen to the radio
and work this puzzle.

338
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,258
I can't take on another job at the moment.

339
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,182
What if my friends ask me about her?
What'll I tell them?

340
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,515
- They'll want to know...
- Just tell them that Mary is your cousin.

341
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,971
From that point on,
they can mind their own business.

342
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,308
And it seems to me that your business
might be helping your mother.

343
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,019
Dad, sometimes the way you talk to me...

344
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:34,106
you make me feel like
I'm an adopted daughter or something.

345
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,638
Sighted Jap, sunk same.

346
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,890
Franklin, behave yourself.
Get up from that pavement this instant.

347
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,901
You'll all catch your death of cold.
Now, now.

348
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,187
I'll tell your father.

349
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,116
I'll tell your father, that's...
Not one Christmas present for you.

350
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,369
- Is the war really like that?
- I guess so.

351
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,617
- That's funny.
- Why?

352
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,324
I mean that you should only guess so.

353
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,294
They have experts making those pictures.

354
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,831
I guess that's the way they see the war.

355
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,423
A beach a mile long...

356
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,719
and thousands of soldiers and tanks
and machine guns and everything.

357
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,967
I guess that's the way it is.

358
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,391
But it wasn't that way for you?

359
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,927
It's just a difference in size.

360
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,972
To a guy that's in it,
the war is about 10 feet wide...

361
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,890
and kind of empty.

362
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,278
It's you and a couple of fellows
in your company, maybe...

363
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,781
and maybe a couple of Japs.
It's all kind of mixed up.

364
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,286
Sometimes it's all full of noise,
and sometimes it's quiet.

365
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,410
It all depends on
what you're thinking about, I guess.

366
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,992
It depends on how scared you are...

367
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,579
how cold you are, and how wet you are.

368
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,999
I guess if you asked a hundred guys
what the war is like...

369
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,759
they'd all give you a different answer.

370
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,098
- You know what?
- What?

371
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,134
I mean...

372
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,972
usually you don't like to talk about it.

373
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:34,272
I never said anything about it before,
not to anybody.

374
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,603
- I'm sorry, I...
- No.

375
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,822
No. I feel kind of good.

376
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,572
Let's go have a drink or something.

377
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,459
All right if we sit back here?

378
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,637
Had that booth reserved for you.
Nothing's too good for the Army.

379
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,804
No offense, sailor.

380
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,725
- Okay, my friend.
- You see, I'm an old Army man myself.

381
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,929
Yes, sir.

382
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,641
What'll you have, Mary?

383
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:12,973
A cup of coffee.

384
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:17,561
Come on, it's Christmas. The sky's the
limit. Have a piece of pie with it.

385
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,775
No, I'll just have a cup of coffee.

386
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,611
- Two coffees.
- Coming up. Two cups of java.

387
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,321
Sure you won't have anything else?

388
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,370
Not after that wonderful dinner
Aunt Sarah prepared for us.

389
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,449
They're nice people.
You're nice people, too.

390
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,249
Hot java for the Army.

391
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,798
Social error. There you are.

392
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,794
Hey, soldier, you certainly been places.

393
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,096
- Would you like some cream?
- No, thanks.

394
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,636
You know, I was just a boy of 18,
over in France, in World War I.

395
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,515
They're kidding themselves.
This is the same kind of war.

396
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,441
- Sure you won't have some cream?
- No, I don't use it.

397
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,981
The Navy, Marine, Air Force, they're okay.
This one's gonna be just like the last one.

398
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:06,819
A soldier like you or me, walking out
on his own two feet and slugging it out.

399
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,029
I took off some weight since my time.

400
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,866
Used to be heavyweight champion
of the regiment.

401
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,044
Got a couple of funny medals.
Here they are.

402
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,131
When this thing starts,
I try to sign up again.

403
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,426
I tell them I want a chance
to knock a couple of Jap heads together.

404
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,304
Could still do it, too.
Squash them like eggs, I could.

405
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,093
They won't let me fight.

406
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,226
Why? On account of this tick in my face.

407
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,556
Nothing touched me in the last war.
I got a bit of shell shock.

408
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,687
It left me with this.
Nobody ever notices it.

409
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,778
But that young doctor squirt,
not dry behind his ears...

410
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,277
he turns me down. I don't get it.

411
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,879
Thank you, Mary.

412
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,193
Mary, I...

413
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,065
I think you ought to know something.

414
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,738
What is it, Zach?

415
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,456
I wish I could tell you.

416
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,621
You probably think...

417
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,971
I bet I could do better than that.

418
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,163
Hello.

419
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,123
Hello.

420
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,835
- I thought you were asleep.
- No, I've been burning the midnight oil.

421
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,086
Here's my morale list.

422
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,017
It's fun to think I'm the pinup girl
for at least five fellows.

423
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:44,021
And it's part of the war effort.
I keep up their morale, maybe.

424
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,479
It must be nice to be able to keep up
somebody's morale.

425
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,738
I imagine you could write to a lot of them.
They just like to get mail from anybody.

426
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,488
I mean, you don't have to know them
awfully well to...

427
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,704
What I mean is...

428
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,546
When I was 17, I had a little trouble
finding the right words, too.

429
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,966
Is Zach stationed here, or...

430
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,311
Barbara, what I'm in prison for
isn't catching.

431
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,446
I'm sorry, Mary, I...

432
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,362
I keep hurting you and...

433
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,616
I really don't want to.

434
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,328
I guess it is uncomfortable for you...

435
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,877
to meet somebody who's been in prison.

436
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,755
Maybe when you get to know me,
you'll feel differently.

437
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,505
I want to know you, Mary. Really, I do.

438
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,676
- How much do you know about me?
- Not much.

439
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,726
Mother and Dad still treat me like a child.
Everything's a big secret.

440
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,355
I don't think it would hurt for you to know.
As a matter of fact, I think it might help.

441
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,356
- When I was your age, my mother died.
- I remember her.

442
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,312
Way back when I was young.

443
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,357
She used to make clothes
for my favorite doll.

444
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,281
Yes, she was wonderful with her hands.

445
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,324
And some time after that,
my father went north on business.

446
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:27,086
And then, when he died, I was on my own.

447
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,124
<i>Got a very good job as a secretary...</i>

448
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,086
<i>and my job brought me in contact
with a lot of nice men...</i>

449
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,221
<i>one of whom might have turned out,
I thought, to be the one...</i>

450
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:41,600
<i>who would give me all the things that
you dream about when you're 20 and lonely.</i>

451
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,479
<i>One day, when I was called
into my boss's office...</i>

452
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,358
<i>he invited me to a party in his apartment.</i>

453
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,818
<i>He was single, and I started dreaming.</i>

454
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,397
<i>Bosses do marry their secretaries.</i>

455
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,159
<i>I took what money I'd saved,
and I bought an evening dress.</i>

456
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,822
<i>I thought it was very fancy. I wanted to look
good in front of his high-class friends.</i>

457
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,242
<i>He'd sent me an orchid, a white orchid...</i>

458
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,001
<i>the first one I'd ever had.</i>

459
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,750
<i>I was wearing it.</i>

460
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,843
<i>When the door opened, I walked
into the biggest apartment I'd ever seen.</i>

461
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,345
<i>I thought it was rich and elegant.</i>

462
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,265
<i>I'd wanted to impress him,
so I got there a little late.</i>

463
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,302
<i>I'd wanted to make an entrance
all by myself...</i>

464
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,391
<i>but nobody else was there.</i>

465
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,517
<i>I should have had sense enough then
to get out, but I didn't.</i>

466
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,526
<i>He'd been drinking a long time before
I got there, I guess, and he kept right on.</i>

467
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:40,034
<i>He told me
that he hadn't invited anyone else...</i>

468
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,161
<i>and that the white orchid and all that
was just his way of getting me up there.</i>

469
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,878
<i>I tried to talk my way out...</i>

470
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,546
<i>and then when that didn't work,
I made a break for it.</i>

471
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,509
<i>I didn't scream.</i>

472
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,964
<i>I was too frightened, I guess.</i>

473
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,890
<i>I tried to get away from him, but I
couldn't. He seemed to be everywhere.</i>

474
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,306
<i>It was all mixed up,
like some terrible kind of a dream.</i>

475
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,102
<i>Once, I almost got away
when he fell over a chair.</i>

476
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,733
<i>But he caught me again
and dragged me back.</i>

477
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:21,318
<i>Then I pushed him as hard as I could,
and he fell back through the window.</i>

478
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,244
His apartment was on the 14th floor.

479
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,710
<i>Mary...</i>

480
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,588
how awful.

481
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:40,010
- Maybe I shouldn't have told you.
- No, I'm glad you did.

482
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:45,011
But it's wrong.
They shouldn't have sent you to prison.

483
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,804
If I'd been lucky enough to get away
before he was killed...

484
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,605
then there wouldn't have been any crime.

485
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,026
But after all, a man was dead.

486
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,649
The jury said manslaughter.

487
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,776
Guilty.

488
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:08,243
Well, that meant six years.

489
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,232
Please forgive me, Mary.

490
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,198
Mary, see who that is, will you?

491
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,122
Hello?

492
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,003
Good morning, Zach.

493
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,590
If it's important, of course I can see you.

494
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,171
Do you want to come here?

495
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,433
I'd rather not. I hate to keep barging in
on your uncle's house.

496
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,804
Mary, I want to talk to you about
last night, and I need some time.

497
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,233
Well, I have the time, plenty of time.

498
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,108
Where do you want to meet?

499
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,774
I asked about here, and they say
there's a bus that goes up to the lake.

500
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,655
It's pretty out there,
and there aren't so many people.

501
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,555
- Not so bad, is it?
- No.

502
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,555
I told you there was no use wasting any
gas. It's only a short walk from here.

503
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,888
I know. You're trying to wear me out
before we tee off. I got you.

504
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,556
Hi, Chuck, how've you been?

505
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,642
- Hi, swell day?
- Fine.

506
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,899
It's so pretty.

507
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,738
- Hi.
- Hello.

508
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,589
You born in this part of the country?

509
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:35,470
I was born in Maryland. You get used to
Christmastime being cold and snowy.

510
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,141
This seems more like Christmas to me
than the kind they have back east.

511
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:45,071
I mean, this is more like the country
where they celebrated the first Christmas.

512
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,613
This reminds me of a lake I used to go to
when I was a kid.

513
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,287
Every spring,
I had a job repairing the boats.

514
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,125
<i>Mary...</i>

515
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,965
I want to tell you why I got mad at that
man in the coffee shop last night...

516
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:16,302
and why I walked away after I threw
that rock at the lamppost and missed it.

517
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:20,356
I knew there must be some reason,
but you don't have to tell me.

518
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,644
Look, I was brought up in a home,
an orphan's home.

519
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,438
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

520
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,946
I'm not. It's not like being in prison,
or anything like that.

521
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,697
No.

522
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,489
In the home, there was a janitor.

523
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,826
This fellow had been in the last war.
He was a young guy.

524
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,292
He was a shell shock case.

525
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,378
Whenever we could get our hands
on any firecrackers, we'd bang them off...

526
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,758
and laugh at him when he jumped.

527
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,686
That fellow in the coffee shop
reminded me of the janitor.

528
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:04,066
They both made me think of myself,
and what I'd be like in a few years.

529
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:09,397
Only difference is that now in the hospital
they have a fancy name for it:

530
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,065
neuropsychiatric.

531
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:16,571
The doctors must know more about it now
than they did during the last war.

532
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,871
Maybe.

533
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,784
They don't know something about me
that I know.

534
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,202
You see...

535
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,164
before I became an engineer...

536
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,715
I was an athlete, a pretty good one.

537
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,218
I know what my timing used to be,
they don't.

538
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,049
And it's gone, Mary.

539
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,889
Before this happened to me,
I could have hit that lamppost all day.

540
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,685
I don't know why
I'm bothering you with all this.

541
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,026
Yes, I do. I know why I'm bothering you.

542
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,780
Because I feel so much better
when I talk to you. I like to be with you.

543
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,281
I like to be with you, too.

544
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,577
Mary, I want to talk about you.
Listen, tell me...

545
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,240
- What?
- Well...

546
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,910
For instance, how did you become a
traveling saleslady, and what do you sell?

547
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,253
As I told you,
I started out wanting to be a model...

548
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,089
and after that...

549
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,760
I got a job
with a dress manufacturing company...

550
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,096
and now I travel for them.

551
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,560
Where do you travel?
After your vacation, where do you go?

552
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:30,729
I go back to Dallas,
and from Dallas I go to New Orleans.

553
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,363
New Orleans? I've been there.
It's a swell town.

554
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,525
You've been to New Orleans?

555
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,993
- Have you ever been to Florida?
- No.

556
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,866
I go from New Orleans to Florida.

557
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,452
- New Orleans to Florida?
- Palm Beach.

558
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,962
Mary, can you make me believe in myself
the way you believe in yourself?

559
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,389
- What makes you think I do?
- I can tell.

560
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,847
The way you talk, the way you walk...

561
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,100
the way you look,
the way you hold your head.

562
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,979
Maybe that's just make-believe.

563
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,732
Why don't we go down here by the rock?

564
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,198
Like boats?

565
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,333
Do you?

566
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,207
Some kid probably owned that boat.

567
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,835
Thought it could take him
all around the world and back.

568
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,415
Wish it could.

569
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:36,631
I wish we could get on
it and sail away to...

570
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,717
Where would you like to go?

571
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,549
Not Florida or New Orleans.

572
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,228
Some place like the moon, maybe.

573
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:51,149
With a good breeze and a good compass,
maybe we could find a place.

574
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,730
Well, if it were a real boat,
and the moon a real place...

575
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,615
would you go?

576
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,866
There's no harm in dreaming. I'd go.

577
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:20,179
I'm not going to have you
run out on me again.

578
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,892
Thank you, one and all.

579
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,770
I never could figure out
why the pudding never gets burned.

580
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,149
I've never been able to, either.
Must be the alcohol in the brandy.

581
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,187
I think.

582
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,819
I think it's a shame to burn a good brandy.

583
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,735
That quart I brought home last week
was imported cognac.

584
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,200
Don't worry, Henry.
I didn't burn up the whole quart.

585
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,490
I wouldn't trust Mom with it, Dad.

586
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:51,707
Maybe you're right. Remember last year,
how Mom got going on a glass of sherry?

587
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,791
I'm not going to listen to that again.

588
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,294
You may not believe this
about your dear Aunt Sarah...

589
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,001
but last year she got high as a kite.

590
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,088
If they're trying to drag out
a family skeleton...

591
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,388
I won't listen to them.

592
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,517
It's just one of those little things
that happen, people start exaggerating.

593
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,350
Exaggerate, my eye. It's
as true as I sit here.

594
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,766
Last year, Mother and I had a glass
of sherry to bring in the New Year.

595
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,274
And then we went to a little gathering.
All the way across town it was.

596
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,280
And Mother had her skirt on backwards.

597
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,859
If you're in such good voice,
how about a Christmas carol?

598
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,120
Aunt Sarah, something tells me
you're trying to change the subject.

599
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,873
Nothing of the sort.
Christmas carols go with plum pudding.

600
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,658
And we're eating plum pudding.

601
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,119
Sarah, you don't have
to work so hard at it.

602
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,047
I'm a pretty good baritone,
and I don't need much urging.

603
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,123
What'll it be?

604
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,884
<i>I think I like best Come All Ye Faithful.</i>

605
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,386
Fine. Come All Ye Faithful it is.

606
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:51,137
<i>O come, all ye faithful</i>

607
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:54,933
<i>Joyful and triumphant</i>

608
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,896
<i>O come ye</i>

609
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:01,814
<i>O come ye to Bethlehem</i>

610
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,534
<i>Come and behold him</i>

611
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,413
<i>Born the King of angels</i>

612
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,452
<i>O come, let us adore him</i>

613
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,373
<i>O come, let us adore him</i>

614
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,679
<i>O come, let us adore him</i>

615
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,430
<i>Christ the Lord!</i>

616
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:35,181
It feels pretty comfortable to have another
man's voice around here at Christmastime.

617
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,517
I'm sure Barbara's doing her best
to arrange that for you, Henry.

618
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,818
Mother.

619
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,026
Maybe family jokes are in bad taste.

620
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,237
- They make the guest feel out of place.
- No, ma'am.

621
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,819
I haven't felt so easy in a long time.

622
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,371
This is the best Christmas
dinner I ever had.

623
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,782
Yesterday I was a stranger here.

624
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,328
I mean, I felt like a
prisoner inside myself.

625
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,504
Now...

626
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:03,800
just to be in a home like this
with people like you...

627
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:09,807
maybe someplace I can come back to,
next month, or next year...

628
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,688
- Did I say something?
- No, Zach.

629
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,726
- It's just that Mary's sentimental or...
- It's Christmas...

630
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,240
Mary, what's the matter?

631
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,902
Is it anything I said?

632
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,031
Anything to do with this afternoon?

633
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,829
No, it's just...

634
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,413
a combination of things.

635
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,586
The pudding, and the singing...

636
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,427
and the very nice things you said.

637
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,423
First time my singing
ever brought anybody to tears.

638
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,885
Maybe I'd better get out of here.

639
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,097
It isn't polite to eat and run.

640
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,270
I mean Pinehill. I ought
to leave you alone.

641
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,567
You're just fishing.
You want me to ask you to stay.

642
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,447
Well, ask me.

643
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,037
Please, stay.

644
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:23,922
Sarah, this is silly.
We can't just sit here all night.

645
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,084
They've got to have
a couple of minutes to talk things over.

646
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,044
They've had a couple of minutes.

647
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,338
Come on, Dad. Let's go on in.

648
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,425
We'd better give them a warning first.

649
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,099
Well, that's all the
plum pudding I can eat.

650
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,805
Can't eat another bit.

651
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,520
Let's play the radio.

652
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,818
Fine.

653
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,438
Come, darling.

654
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,572
It's present time.

655
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,489
Henry's going to act as Santa Claus.
Come on.

656
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,827
- Here you are, Mother dear.
- This is for you, dear.

657
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,914
Is that for me? Thank you, dear.
Look at the size of it.

658
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,579
- Can I have one?
- No, you can't have one.

659
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,339
I know what it is.

660
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,168
Henry, you darling, you
did get it after all.

661
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,469
My goodness! Look what I got.

662
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,258
- Here you are, darling.
- Thank you, Uncle Henry.

663
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,767
- Did Zach get his?
- Zach.

664
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,179
- Thank you, Aunt Sarah.
- I hope you like it, dear.

665
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,389
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

666
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,241
I understood, Mary.

667
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,829
When Zach said he was a stranger...

668
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,458
you felt as if the words
were coming from your own lips.

669
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:46,872
Might have happened to any girl.

670
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:50,175
Could have been just Christmas sentiment.
Good night, Mary.

671
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,711
- Good night, Uncle Henry.
- Good night.

672
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,764
- Don't forget to turn out the lights, Sarah.
- All right, dear.

673
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,342
So don't worry about making a scene.

674
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,223
I'm not worrying about that, Aunt Sarah.

675
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,734
I was just wondering
if I shouldn't tell him about me.

676
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,063
- Not for the world.
- You don't think so?

677
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,898
Well, why?

678
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,402
He trusts me...

679
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,029
and it doesn't seem fair.

680
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:23,325
There's no reason for it, Mary.
He'll only be here for a few days.

681
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:27,045
He's lonely,
and you're making things pleasant for him.

682
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:30,712
That's not the reason I'm seeing him,
Aunt Sarah.

683
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,464
Because I like him.

684
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,509
I like him a lot.

685
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:41,222
Of course you do, dear, but it isn't
as if you were gonna marry him.

686
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,893
No.

687
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,433
It isn't as though I was
going to marry him.

688
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,735
I didn't mean it like that, dear.

689
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,188
I know.

690
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,364
Have fun, Mary.
See Zach every day, if you like.

691
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,654
Act like any other girl.

692
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,199
I try, Aunt Sarah, but I...

693
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,832
I can't seem to make myself
feel like any other girl.

694
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,127
I just feel like me.

695
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,132
And that's pretty darn good.
Now you have fun.

696
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,925
Hey, you two. What's cooking?

697
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,389
Remember, Mary, I don't think so.
Good night, dears.

698
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,563
Good night, Aunt Sarah.

699
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,562
She doesn't think so, what?

700
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:38,609
She doesn't think
there really is a Santa Claus.

701
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,084
Mother, look. It just fits. I love it.

702
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,798
Do you think a long skirt?

703
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,092
It's for New Year's Eve. It has to be long.

704
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,680
Isn't it a little old for you, dear?

705
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,184
For Heaven's sake,
I'm going out with a lieutenant.

706
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:11,267
Yes, I'm quite aware
of the responsibility of the occasion...

707
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,560
- but that neckline.
- So that's it.

708
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:17,523
For your information, mother,
this neckline's a morale builder.

709
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,108
How would you like to try on this?

710
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,619
- That's lovely.
- Yes, it's one of the best designs we have.

711
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,202
No, Mommy, please. I want this one.

712
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,700
All right, dear.

713
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,834
- It fits you perfectly.
- It feels perfect, too. I'll be right back.

714
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,131
- You like this one, don't you, Mary?
- It's lovely.

715
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,716
- Then you're going to have it.
- No.

716
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,555
Now you listen to me, Mary.

717
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:51,140
You can't wear the same clothes every day.
Your soldier boy's gonna get tired of them.

718
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,353
I've been fooling him well enough so far.

719
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,440
I've been wearing one blouse after another.
I don't need a dress.

720
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,902
Zach's made a big thing of inviting us all
to this New Year's Eve party.

721
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,483
You can't wear a suit.

722
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,943
I'll manage.

723
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,246
Henry and I have talked it over.
We want you to have a dress.

724
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:10,288
Henry will be so disappointed
if you don't accept it.

725
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:15,206
Darling, I'll only be able to wear it once.
It'll be out of style in three years.

726
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,373
Then we'll burn it.

727
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,503
- Miss?
- Yes.

728
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,715
- My niece would like to try on this dress.
- It will be fine on you.

729
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,720
Go on, dear. Try it on.

730
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,173
Well, all right, I'll try it on.

731
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:31,771
- How about you, Mrs. Marshall?
- Thank you, my lavender is still good.

732
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,226
Mother, it's just going to be swell.
Thank you.

733
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,108
Now, you run along,
pick up your father at the store.

734
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,900
Okay. Thanks again. You're so wonderful.

735
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,491
You know how impatient your father is.
Now run along.

736
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,127
- How much is this dress?
- $69.

737
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,086
Would you take the tag off, please?

738
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,138
Look, here's $30.

739
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:11,728
And when my aunt asks you the price,
you tell her it's $39, instead of $69.

740
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,309
- It's a bargain.
- Thank you.

741
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,894
Miss...

742
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,569
- how much was that dress?
- $39.

743
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,322
I'll give you $20.

744
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,156
When I ask you again how much it was,
you tell me it's $19.

745
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,788
- Do you like it?
- It's darling on you.

746
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,424
- Isn't it sweet?
- It was made for you.

747
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,675
Miss, how much is this dress?

748
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,384
$19.

749
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,266
That's a wonderful buy.

750
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,974
What are you laughing at?

751
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,615
- How do you like my dress?
- Swell, isn't it?

752
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,249
Some hep chick, huh?

753
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,541
- Hello, Zach. Do come in.
- Hello, Barbara.

754
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,716
- Don't you notice anything, Zach?
- Where?

755
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,353
- About me.
- Got on too much lipstick again.

756
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,310
- Hello, Zach.
- Hello, Mr. Marshall.

757
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,402
Lt. Bruce, this is Sgt. Morgan.

758
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,735
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- How do you do?

759
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,662
Isn't a sergeant
supposed to salute a lieutenant?

760
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:56,241
Only on the street. Anyhow, from
the decorations the Sergeant's wearing...

761
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,496
I ought to do the saluting.

762
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,126
That's not what it says in the book.

763
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:02,047
- My coat, Lieutenant.
- Sure, Your Majesty.

764
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,499
Henry, are you ready?

765
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,544
No, Sarah, I'm down here in my bathrobe,
working on this puzzle.

766
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,633
Don't be impatient, dear.
We'll be right down.

767
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,762
- Fine.
- Good night, Pa.

768
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,886
Good night, baby.
Take care of her, Lieutenant.

769
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,560
Why does everybody treat me like a child?
I can take care of myself.

770
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,938
We won't be late. Good night, Mr. Marshall.

771
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,974
Good night, sir... Sergeant.

772
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,604
Good night, sir.

773
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,611
Here's a nice big piece of sky for you,
Mr. Marshall.

774
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,192
Henry, get your hat. We're ready.

775
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,484
Well, let's get going, Zach,
before they change their minds.

776
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,820
Got my bag, and my gloves,
and my purse, and...

777
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,455
Sarah. Now where is she?

778
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:43,956
- Sarah, are we going, or...
- Henry, you left the scullery light on.

779
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,641
Mrs. Marshall, this is for you.
I hope you like camellias.

780
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,229
This is for you, Mary.
I hope you like white orchids.

781
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,557
Thank you, Zach.
I haven't had a corsage in years.

782
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:06,186
- Henry, did you lock the kitchen door?
- Let's go, Sarah.

783
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,859
There's some mistake.

784
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,028
I knew I'd do it.

785
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,328
That's what happens when a man
gets mixed up in things he shouldn't.

786
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,159
The orchids are for you, Mary.

787
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,990
That's all right, Aunt Sarah.

788
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,288
Sarah, are we going tonight?

789
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,295
The camellias were promised to me,
and I'm going to have them.

790
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,923
- It really doesn't matter.
- These were intended for you.

791
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,030
Sarah.

792
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,702
Darling, just give me a minute.
Look at that.

793
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:01,332
- We're gonna be late.
- Flowers make you feel so like a party.

794
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,119
- Wasn't that sweet of Zach?
- Sarah!

795
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,498
Oh Henry.

796
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,377
You're always so impatient.
Have you got the key?

797
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,007
Never mind.

798
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,890
Tell me, Johnny, are you sure it's all
right for a girl to go into the YMCA?

799
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,896
Change your partners, do-Si-do.

800
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:13,063
- Fine.
- Fine, fine.

801
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,701
I don't know how it is, but every year
at New Year's, I get so excited and...

802
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,203
- sort of upset.
- I know what you mean.

803
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,707
It's like being in on something big,
something important.

804
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,743
That's it exactly.

805
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:35,127
Back to your partners,
with a right and left grand.

806
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,462
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Mary, that was...

807
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,593
- Thank you, Uncle Henry.
- Swell.

808
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:45,512
I'll be seeing you

809
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:50,479
<i>In every lovely summer's day</i>

810
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:55,655
<i>In everything that's light and gay</i>

811
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,992
<i>I'll always think of you</i>

812
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:02,154
Two weeks ago,
if somebody had told me I'd be dancing...

813
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,364
with a girl like you,
know what I'd have said?

814
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,040
What would you have said?

815
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:10,211
I'd have said that I wouldn't be dancing
with a girl like you.

816
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,165
<i>I'll be looking at the moon</i>

817
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:19,008
<i>But I'll be seeing you</i>

818
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,303
- Cutting in. Hello, Mary.
- Hello.

819
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,518
Maybe you don't recognize me
in the outfit Uncle Sam gave me.

820
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,517
- I'm sorry, I don't.
- Charlie Hartman, Accounting Department.

821
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,145
Yes, I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten.

822
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:35,278
This is Sgt. Morgan.
This is Charlie Hartman.

823
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,029
How about a dance?

824
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,149
Boy, am I surprised to see you, Mary.

825
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:03,010
I didn't think you were trying
to give me the brush. What happened?

826
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,467
- I thought you were still...
- Well, I am.

827
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:11,473
- They gave me a 10-day Christmas vacation.
- Good. You gonna be around?

828
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:13,520
Yes.

829
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,690
Charlie, the fellow I'm with...

830
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:20,907
he doesn't know about me,
and I'd appreciate it very much...

831
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,405
you know, if you wouldn't...

832
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:25,407
Sure, Mary. Forget it.

833
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,991
Thanks, Charlie.

834
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,253
Wait a minute, Mary.
Excuse me, could I have a light, please?

835
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,087
Here, Sergeant. Have a cigar.

836
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,678
- Thank you, sir.
- You've been in the South Pacific?

837
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:46,886
Yes, sir.

838
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,767
Just the kind of man we want to talk to.

839
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,725
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Senator Hugh D. Emmett.

840
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:54,649
- How do you do, sir?
- This is my friend, John Tombes.

841
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,942
Glad to know you, Sergeant.

842
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,526
Executive chairman of the committee
that raised the funds for this party.

843
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,190
- Thank you, sir.
- Sergeant...

844
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:05,952
we would like to get the point of view
of the soldiers about several things.

845
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,369
- Soldiers?
- Yes.

846
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,619
We would like to know from you
what the soldier thinks.

847
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,952
- Thinks about what?
- Thinks about political issues.

848
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,957
Senator, I don't know.

849
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:21,634
What gives you the idea that because
a fellow puts on a soldier's suit...

850
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,591
he thinks any differently
from anybody else?

851
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,761
What does the soldier think?

852
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,517
I tell you...

853
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,722
last time some of us voted for Roosevelt,
and some of us didn't.

854
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,732
Some of us weren't old enough to vote.

855
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,103
Some soldiers think
labor's got a right to strike...

856
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,985
and some soldiers think
labor's got no rights at all.

857
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:47,448
A lot of soldiers have got one idea
about what should happen after the war.

858
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,487
A lot of soldiers have other ideas.

859
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:53,621
Me? I haven't the slightest notion
what a lot of soldiers think.

860
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,292
Senator, thanks for the cigar.

861
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,092
Unless somebody gypped me
with this watch 15 years ago...

862
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,423
it's New Year's.

863
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,888
We've got to find Mary and Zach. Excuse us.

864
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:36,785
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

865
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:41,839
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

866
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:46,628
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

867
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:51,300
<i>And days of auld lang syne?</i>

868
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:56,104
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

869
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:01,230
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

870
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:06,280
<i>We'll take a cup o' kindness yet</i>

871
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:12,529
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

872
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,823
Happy New Year.

873
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:06,503
What was that, that that poet said
about the deep-throated dog?

874
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,303
- He's just barking in the New Year.
- That's not what he said.

875
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,797
I didn't mean that.

876
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,180
Do you believe that saying,
a barking dog never bites?

877
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,640
I believe anything you say.

878
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,145
The thing about a dog is...

879
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,645
you must never let him know
you're afraid of him. That makes him angry.

880
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:27,399
You've got to treat him like an old friend.
Here, boy.

881
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,791
See what I mean?
I'd hate to run into him in a dark alley.

882
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,952
What do you think this is?

883
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,140
Zach!

884
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,350
Stay away, Mary. Stay away.

885
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,668
Duke!

886
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,989
- Are you hurt?
- No.

887
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,698
- No, but he could have been.
- I'm sorry.

888
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,541
Are you all right?

889
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,761
- You know something?
- What?

890
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:19,424
The doctors are gonna be very surprised
when they see you.

891
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,930
They'll probably send you back
to active duty.

892
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,890
That lemonade must have been spiked.

893
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:27,056
No, I really mean it.
Do you realize what you did tonight?

894
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,976
- You couldn't have done that a week ago.
- Why?

895
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,686
I've watched you all evening.

896
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:36,358
When you were dancing,
you never hesitated for words...

897
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,150
and your eyes didn't blink.

898
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:42,158
And then when that dog attacked us, I've
never seen anyone so fast on their feet.

899
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,958
- I didn't think about what I was doing.
- Exactly. You were so alert and keen.

900
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,161
And your timing was perfect.

901
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,464
I hope you're right. I believe you are.

902
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:57,387
Mary, you told me that in eight days
you can do a lot of believing.

903
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,759
You see, I'm the fellow
that's on the radio that says:

904
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,390
- "Life can be wonderful."
- You're wonderful.

905
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,851
You're saying that
because I've got lots of money.

906
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,148
You're wonderful.

907
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,601
Because you know
I've got very influential friends.

908
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,610
Because of my social position.

909
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,994
Mary, I know I'm going to get well.

910
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,959
I've got plans, too, lots of them.

911
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:33,168
I know I'm going to stay well, too,
because you figure in all my plans.

912
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,091
You've got to figure in them because...

913
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:40,262
without you, I'm back where I started.
I'm sunk.

914
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,350
Let's don't talk about it tonight.
I'm kind of sleepy.

915
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,060
Okay.

916
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,182
Tomorrow, before I go,
I've got a lot of things to tell you.

917
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,601
Good night, Zach.

918
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:56,236
Happy New Year.

919
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,153
I love you very much.

920
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,881
Is that you, Mary?

921
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,887
Are you all right?

922
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,721
Aunt Sarah, I love him so.

923
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,683
What are you going to do?

924
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,851
I don't know.

925
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:42,567
He's going to ask me to marry him. He
would've asked me tonight if I'd let him.

926
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,485
- Did you tell him?
- No.

927
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,997
Are you going back on the train
with him tomorrow?

928
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,500
No. I'm going to catch a later train
tomorrow night.

929
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,913
Why don't you give yourself
that extra time with him, Mary?

930
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:58,750
Because I'm afraid to be alone with him.
I mustn't tell him.

931
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,671
I lied to him, I told him I was going
to stay here a couple of extra days.

932
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,932
Don't you think he's strong enough yet
to know about you?

933
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:10,765
I can't take that chance, Aunt Sarah.
He's getting well.

934
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,769
And I want him to go back to the hospital
sure of himself...

935
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,812
and sure of me.

936
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,027
Remember, what you have to do
may seem to be second best...

937
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,989
but it may work out to be first best.

938
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,991
Aunt Sarah, I hope so.

939
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,133
Happy New Year, Mr. Lincoln.

940
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,549
Happy New Year, Zach.

941
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,182
May I have this dance with you, Sergeant?

942
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,266
Happy New Year.

943
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,546
<i>Hold on, Zach. Hold on.</i>

944
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,085
<i>You're just a little tired, that's all.</i>

945
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:29,385
<i>There was a lot of excitement. That fight
with the dog took a lot out of you.</i>

946
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,559
<i>That's why you're sweating.
It doesn't mean anything.</i>

947
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,932
<i>Sit down, Zach, sit down.</i>

948
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,868
<i>That's it. Sit down, take it easy.</i>

949
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,961
<i>Don't get scared, Zach.</i>

950
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,379
<i>Maybe it is one of those things.
They told you it might happen.</i>

951
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,921
<i>Hang on, Zach, hang on.</i>

952
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,849
<i>You know
what you're going to have to go through.</i>

953
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,457
<i>It's sure banging away.
It doesn't sound that loud.</i>

954
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,626
<i>You're just thinking it does, that's all.</i>

955
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,427
<i>The doc told you
there's nothing wrong with your heart.</i>

956
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,260
<i>Beating fast like that
doesn't mean anything.</i>

957
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,303
<i>This is it. You thought for a minute
it wasn't, but it is.</i>

958
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,184
<i>You're in for it now.</i>

959
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,601
<i>You know the next step.
You know what's coming now.</i>

960
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:48,270
<i>It's tough to get hold of yourself, Zach.</i>

961
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:53,442
<i>Better call for a doctor and let him
get the hypo ready, or maybe a tub.</i>

962
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,096
<i>Zach.</i>

963
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,770
<i>Zach, you've got eight days to believe.</i>

964
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,603
<i>Eight days. You must believe.</i>

965
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,588
I made it.

966
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,945
Barbara!

967
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:59,493
Barbara, that's awful stuff
for a man to wake up to!

968
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,945
How can you stand it
so early in the morning?

969
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:06,454
Dad, it's beautiful music, a lovely day,
and a wonderful New Year.

970
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:09,081
That's the trouble with young people.

971
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,338
They're so doggone young.

972
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,260
There you are. I was beginning to think
I'd have to bring breakfast to you in bed.

973
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,842
It's not a bad idea, Sarah.
I might try it sometime.

974
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,177
That was the best part
of having my appendix out.

975
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:25,261
- Please, Henry. One egg or two?
- Three. I'm hungry.

976
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,892
- Good morning, Mr. Marshall.
- Hello, Zach. Happy New Year.

977
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,524
- Come on in.
- Had a good time last night?

978
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,902
Fine. Best party I've been to
since last New Year.

979
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,818
- Have you had your breakfast yet?
- Yes, sir. Early.

980
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:44,287
Here's the paper. Make yourself at home.
Be with you in a minute.

981
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:47,870
Drive you down to the station. Hope
you enjoy Barbara's melodious concert.

982
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,080
- Who were you babbling to?
- Zach.

983
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,125
Good morning, Mary.

984
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,712
- Good morning, Zach.
- Good morning, Mrs. Marshall.

985
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,258
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Zach.

986
01:15:57,303 --> 01:16:00,421
I was just fixing some sandwiches
for you to take with you.

987
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,886
Shouldn't you get ready
to go down to the station?

988
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:06,347
Yes, I'll go get my hat and things.
I'll be back in just a minute.

989
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,519
Mary's fixing up a little box lunch for
you. I want a string to tie it up with.

990
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:13,146
It's difficult to get anything to eat
on the train.

991
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,568
- Very nice of you.
- Hello, Sergeant. Happy New Year.

992
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:18,647
- Happy New Year. How was your party?
- Solid.

993
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,034
- You going back to active duty, Zach?
- Not for a while yet.

994
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:24,240
You look a lot better than you did
a week ago.

995
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,038
- Feel a lot better.
- Was it the Marshall food that did it?

996
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,451
Must've helped.
I think it was mostly your cousin Mary.

997
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,327
She's awfully nice.

998
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,962
I've noticed that, too.

999
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,045
You know what? I think I'll marry her.

1000
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,882
- Are you kidding?
- Not as far as I'm concerned.

1001
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,555
- Of course, I don't know about her yet.
- Won't you mind waiting?

1002
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,847
That's up to Mary, really.

1003
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:51,562
Things have worked out so well, I may
not have to wait as long as I thought.

1004
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,891
That's what the folks
have always hoped for...

1005
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,317
that she won't have
to serve her full term now.

1006
01:16:56,362 --> 01:17:00,231
But the fact that they let her out of
prison for Christmas is a pretty good sign.

1007
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:04,284
You know, it wasn't until the other night,
when she told me how it all happened...

1008
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,862
that I realized it really isn't her fault.

1009
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,623
She's not a criminal.
I mean, not like real criminals.

1010
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,541
It's too bad that you two can't go back
on the train together.

1011
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,923
But then, Mary isn't due in Easton
until 9:00 tonight.

1012
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:21,676
She wants to spend as much time with us
as she can.

1013
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,088
You can't blame her,
after being locked up for three years.

1014
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,762
Come on, Zach. We're gonna be late. Mary?

1015
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:34,435
Goodbye, Zach.
Have a nice trip, and come back real soon.

1016
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,266
I hate to say goodbye, Zach.

1017
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,273
- Come on. We're gonna be late.
- Thank you again, Mrs. Marshall.

1018
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,479
Good luck.

1019
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,940
Have you got the box? I'll get it.

1020
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,289
I hope you like chicken sandwiches.

1021
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,719
Zach, is there any special address...

1022
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,380
or do I write to you in care of
the hospital at Easton?

1023
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,265
Yeah, care of the hospital.

1024
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:11,768
You can write to me in care of
Uncle Henry's address.

1025
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,429
They'll forward it
to wherever I happen to be.

1026
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,315
Because I won't know what hotels
I'll be able to stop at.

1027
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,816
I understand.

1028
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,201
Board!

1029
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:46,507
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Goodbye, Zach. Here.

1030
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,053
Thank you.

1031
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:51,216
- Zach, will you write to me?
- Sure. I'll write.

1032
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,927
Zach, what's the matter? What's wrong?

1033
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:56,016
- Board!
- Nothing. Bye, Mary.

1034
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,273
- Bye, Zach. Goodbye.
- Bye.

1035
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,818
What's the matter with Zach, Mary?
He acted kind of strange.

1036
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,619
I think I know.

1037
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,714
- Mother.
- Look out, don't break any of those globes.

1038
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,592
Mother, if you'd been in Mary's place...

1039
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,394
wouldn't you have gone along with Zach?

1040
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,563
Never mind, dear.
Don't ask so many questions.

1041
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,266
As long as Zach's willing
to wait for Mary...

1042
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,402
- till she gets out of prison, I...
- Prison? Barbara!

1043
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:48,611
- You didn't tell him?
- Wasn't Zach supposed to know?

1044
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:50,571
No.

1045
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,991
Why didn't anybody tell me?
Why didn't you tell me, Mother?

1046
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:02,997
I'm sorry, dear. I should have told you.

1047
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,587
Mary's always treated me like a grownup.

1048
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:09,169
I didn't want to hurt her.

1049
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,847
I've done something terrible.

1050
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:26,733
Mary, I told him.

1051
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,448
I didn't want to hurt you.

1052
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,113
I didn't know.

1053
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,946
I told him.

1054
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,774
We're so sorry.

1055
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:50,023
Mary, I'm so ashamed.

1056
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,071
Please, forgive me.

1057
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:58,615
I love you, Mary.

1058
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:01,702
I wouldn't want to hurt you,
not for anything.

1059
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,295
I understand something...

1060
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,712
I understand something now
that I never knew before...

1061
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:19,932
that you can make a mistake,
do something dreadful...

1062
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,926
without meaning to.

1063
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,190
Mary.

1064
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,692
It's all right, Barbara.

1065
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:22,112
Mary, I didn't want to make you cry.

1066
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:27,458
There's nothing wrong with crying
at a time like this.

1067
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:31,045
The minute I got on the train,
I knew why you didn't tell me.

1068
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:34,382
Nothing matters, except that you're here.

1069
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:37,586
I'm terribly ashamed of
walking out like that.

1070
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,213
I need you, Mary.

1071
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:43,391
I want to feel that you need me.

1072
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,809
I do.

1073
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,012
I'll be right here.

1074
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:53,522
I'll be right here waiting.
I'll be all well by then.

1075
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:57,647
Ready to make a new start, too.

1076
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:02,740
Zach, I love you so much.
