1
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,332
How far back do you want me to go?

2
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,462
College?

3
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,269
I was totally outgoing.

4
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,433
A real people person.

5
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,413
In high school, I felt like that mouse

6
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,284
that gets dropped into the snake cage
and just kinda sits there,

7
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,354
frozen, trying to blend in.

8
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,258
I guess I remember being happy
when I was a kid.

9
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,295
Back when you just naturally expect
good things to happen.

10
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,492
Before my mom died.

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,462
Now I just expect the worst

12
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,372
and try not to get my hopes up.

13
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,444
Which is why I'm here.

14
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,343
Does that answer the question?

15
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,318
Usually people just say where they're from
and where they worked before.

16
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,388
Great. I'm already overqualified.

17
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,447
So, in your previous experience,

18
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:35,325
can you give me an instance
in which you went above and beyond

19
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,296
the call of duty for a customer?

20
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,353
No.

21
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,460
I get it.

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,304
You think you're too good for this.
Why are you even here?

23
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,239
No, I'm sorry...

24
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,446
I really need the money.

25
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,474
I live at home,
I work my ass off at this internship.

26
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,348
- I just...
- Yeah, it's not gonna work out here.

27
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,255
I can tell your type.
You're just not a quality hire.

28
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,437
Wazzup?

29
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,425
No, I don't want the prepubescent look.
I want a woman.

30
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,491
We don't retouch at Seattle Magazine.
We're journalists.

31
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,260
No, not there. An intern.

32
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,366
Yeah.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,468
That's what I'm saying. We respect women.

34
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,238
Don't put that there.
That goes in the utility closet...

35
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,397
- I know...
- And then refresh all the bathrooms.

36
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,428
I was just giving you this change.

37
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,475
Yeah, this is my job now.

38
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,240
It's like spelling things out for interns.

39
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,486
Fuck! Okay.

40
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,453
Writers, ideas.

41
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,397
It's idea time again. It's that time.
What have you got?

42
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,361
Does anybody have an idea? Or a story?

43
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,475
Are you guys here?
Can you hear me? Anyone?

44
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,369
- Top 10 dog parks in Seattle.
- No.

45
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,413
Summer activities for winter people.

46
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,506
Not interested. Jeff?

47
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,444
All right. How about this time travel ad?

48
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,508
What have you got?

49
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah, somebody e-mailed it in
from the classifieds.

50
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,260
He's looking for somebody to go
back in time with him.

51
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,362
Do a little tongue-in-cheek investigation.

52
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,399
Find this guy, see if he 
thinks it's real or if it's a prank.

53
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,433
Not bad.

54
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,332
The guy says, "You'll get paid
when you get back.

55
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,461
"Bring your own weapons.

56
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,398
"Safety's not guaranteed."
And he's only done this once before.

57
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,443
See if maybe he believes in this stuff.
I don't know. I think it could be funny.

58
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,412
You wanna do it? All right. You got it.

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,504
Can I get a couple interns?

60
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,407
- Help me with the research?
- I'll do it.

61
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,442
- Do some heavy lifting...
- Me, too, please. Me.

62
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,387
All right. Give me the lesbian and 
the Indian, and I got a story.

63
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,414
We sent a letter to the address in the ad
and asked them to get back to us.

64
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,256
And I called the local paper,

65
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,388
but they're really uptight about giving 
out information on people that take out 
ads, so...

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,419
I fucked Bridget.

67
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,492
Yeah. You know, sometimes
somebody pisses you off so much

68
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,332
that you just wanna get in there with...

69
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,271
Did she like criticize your technique
the whole time?

70
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,468
Like boss you around? She did, right?

71
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,241
Maybe a little.

72
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,505
All right, we should go.
Let's go to Ocean View.

73
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,476
We can just find whoever put up the ad
and stake him out.

74
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,417
We? What do you mean "we"?

75
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,386
I mean we, the three of us.
Nowyou don't wanna go?

76
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,446
- That place sucks.
- That place does not suck.

77
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,391
I had the best summer of my life
in Ocean View.

78
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,289
I'm not going.

79
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,261
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

80
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,357
It seemed like I was asking,
but I'm actually telling as your boss.

81
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,264
You're coming.

82
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,461
Dad, I'm going out of town for a few days.

83
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,503
- Out out?
- No, it's just this work thing.

84
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:15,345
Yeah, I think it'd be great if you went 
out, did a little social stuff.

85
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,505
Get out of your funk.

86
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,410
I have no funk. I'm totally funkless.

87
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,286
Going out and being with your friends.
I think it's a great idea.

88
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,320
What's wrong with me?

89
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,318
Well, you're sad.
I don't know how to describe it.

90
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,489
It's like there's a cloud following you.

91
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,504
- You're antisocial, and you're a virgin.
- What?

92
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,533
I don't ever see you with any guys.

93
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,468
I don't remember the last time
you brought a guy home.

94
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:47,337
Yeah, well, how do you know I'm not
on Craigslist having casual encounters?

95
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,347
Or when I was away at the dorms?
You weren't there.

96
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,439
I talked to Amy.

97
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,313
Why are you talking
to my college roommate?

98
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,374
We're Facebook friends.

99
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,346
Oh, my God! How do I eject?

100
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,267
Why do you have flames on your laptop?

101
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:14,303
It's a gaming laptop. It's really fast.

102
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,338
What time would you go back to?

103
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,281
- If you could?
- I don't know.

104
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,518
- I'm fine here.
- I would definitely go back.

105
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,360
Everything cool is gone.

106
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,360
The Aztecs.

107
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,457
People killing themselves for each other.

108
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,229
You wouldn't wanna see the dragons
and the elves

109
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,237
fight each other in the magical forest?

110
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,467
- Come on!
- No. That wasn't a time.

111
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,505
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,315
Get in, retards.

113
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,392
So, here's what I'm thinking.
We're budgeted for two rooms,

114
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,486
but if we share a room,

115
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,463
we can use that extra money
for some other shit.

116
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,396
- What, drugs?
- That's exactly right.

117
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,402
Easy, Arnau, we're messing with you, pal.

118
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,495
We're talking about using it
for buffets and shit.

119
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,432
You never done coke or anything
when you're studying for an exam?

120
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,334
Cocaine? Are you crazy?

121
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,472
- What is it you study?
- Biological and life sciences.

122
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,512
Makes sense. So what are you doing
interning at a magazine?

123
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,344
Diversity looks good on an application
for grad school.

124
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,413
We got to get you laid on this vacation.
That's what needs to happen.

125
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,317
- Vacation?
- All right, work trip, whatever.

126
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,494
It's freezing here.

127
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,239
It's got bite, don't it?

128
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,298
Reminds me of going back to school.

129
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,503
Yes. It's all one long school year now.

130
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,440
No start, no finish.

131
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,472
Except for this guy.

132
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,315
How many years till you graduate, Arnau?

133
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,479
Total, including doctorate
orjust undergraduate?

134
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,387
Forget it.

135
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,490
How're we doing the beds?

136
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,266
We'll do me in one, interns on the other.

137
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,426
- Okay.
- No.

138
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,470
Cool. Me and Darius.

139
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,269
Fine. I hope you moisturize, Arnau,
'cause I cuddle.

140
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,470
Tomorrow morning first thing,
we hit the post office.

141
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,378
Let's hope our boy checks
his P.O. Box every day.

142
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,278
There she is.

143
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,374
What?

144
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,254
"Wanted, someone to travel
back in time with me,

145
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,293
"this is not a joke.

146
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:26,329
"P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, Washington.

147
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:31,232
"You'll get paid after we get back.
Must bring your own weapons.

148
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,337
"Safety not guaranteed."

149
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,337
Hey, here we go.

150
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,341
No way. He's too old to be time traveling.

151
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:49,218
Come on. That's the time traveling demo.
White beards, spectacles, pipes.

152
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,317
- Close.
- Wait, what about this one?

153
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:58,329
Yeah. She wants to stop whoever
gave her that haircut from being born.

154
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,422
Yo! Yo! It's him. It's the guy.

155
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,399
Him? Are you sure?

156
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,402
Yeah, I'm sure. Box 91. Get in.

157
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,404
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Following him.

158
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,406
What about Jeff? You should call him!

159
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,431
That's pretty amazing stuff, man.

160
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,408
I'll tell you about the cat in the 
box theory, it'll blowyour mind.

161
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,276
It's like I'm the only one who 
really gets it. You know?

162
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,508
I started this dialog with some
big shot theoretical physicist online,

163
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,383
and I'm like, "Do the rules of quantum
mechanics allowfor alternate histories?"

164
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,512
And he just blasted me.

165
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,256
You know, people are just so convinced
it's a fixed thing,

166
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,316
but they're just, like, looking
at this little sliver of time,

167
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,360
that's all people can see.

168
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,261
It's not a fixed thing, Shannon.
You know, it's on and on in both directions.

169
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,424
It's like a "V," you knowwhat I mean?

170
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,297
I gotta do a bathroom check, brother.

171
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,232
Yeah, you knowwhat I'm saying.

172
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:23,307
I'd like to fill out a comment card
on one of your employees, Kenneth.

173
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,433
What's his last name?

174
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,345
Sorry, ma'am, he's a little...

175
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,405
No, no, it's a positive comment.
It's like complimenting him.

176
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,215
Good. Kenneth Calloway.

177
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,284
Calloway.

178
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,418
Thanks.

179
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,400
Hit the thing that says I have 
a new message.

180
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,494
"Liz confirmed you on Facebook."

181
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,365
Here. No photos, that's a drag.

182
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,335
Okay, good. She still lives here.
She lives in this town.

183
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,435
Who is Liz McHollis?

184
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,439
She was a girl I had a fling with

185
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,449
when my family used to come here
over the summers.

186
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:08,419
She was this really smokin' hot blond.
She was my first blowjob.

187
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:13,323
If there's one girl
that I still think about, honestly.

188
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,297
Here she is. Look at you, 
you went all rogue.
What did you get?

189
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,492
- Got his name, where he works.
- Great.

190
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,359
What did you guys get?

191
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,364
She accepted, but no photo,
so I'm not really sure.

192
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,396
What?

193
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,376
He came here to hook up
with an old high school girlfriend.

194
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,502
Seriously? That's what you've been doing?

195
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,306
Well, I've been doing other stuff too, but

196
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,442
maybe this will change your attitude
a little bit.

197
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,413
That's her when she was 18,
I used to see her naked.

198
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,421
So?

199
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,457
So I'm coming back
to try to see her naked again.

200
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,255
I'd be weirded out if some guy tried
to track me down after 20 years.

201
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,230
I'd be weirded out too
if some guy tried to track you down.

202
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,457
- Why?
- Who would do that?

203
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,459
Tomorrow morning, I'll go in.

204
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,436
You know, go undercover,
pretend to answer his ad

205
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,235
and get the scoop on this yo-yo.

206
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,375
- 991 Mallory. This is definitely it.
- What a piece of shit.

207
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,256
All right, I'm goin' in.

208
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,325
- How do I look, Arnau? Good.
- Good.

209
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,259
- Can I go in?
- No, you did good last night,

210
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,455
but I'm gonna handle this.
I don't wanna overwhelm the guy.

211
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,226
All right? Wish me luck.

212
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,464
So...

213
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,437
Do you go out a lot back home,
like clubs and stuff?

214
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,312
Not really.

215
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,350
You know those really tight leggings
that girls wear,

216
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,478
do you ever wear those?

217
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,280
No.

218
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,288
I think you would look nice in them.

219
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,301
Hello?

220
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,514
Kenneth?

221
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,296
Kenneth? Kenneth Calloway, right?

222
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,488
Is that right?

223
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,235
My name is Jeff.

224
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,505
Look, I sawyour ad in the classifieds.
I wanna know if you need a partner.

225
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,217
- What's your mission?
- What do you mean what's my mission?

226
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,510
What's your reason for going back?

227
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,486
Well, who wouldn't want to go back?
It's an amazing opportunity.

228
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,459
To go back in time, you know?

229
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,429
See gladiators and watch dinosaurs
with my own eyes.

230
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,525
Have sex with a pilgrim.

231
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,428
Fun stuff, that's all I want.
I wanna go back. It's neat.

232
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,266
Who wouldn't want to go back, Kenneth?

233
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,499
You wanna go back.
Why do you wanna go back?

234
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,504
Well, do you need a partner?

235
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,290
- Can you look fear and danger in the eye?
- That's an odd question.

236
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,384
Have you ever stared
fear and danger in the eye

237
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,452
and said, "Yes"?

238
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,324
- Sure.
- Get off my porch.

239
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,492
Let's start over. 
Come on, we could be pals.

240
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,398
Let's go back in time.

241
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,333
Man, that smile...

242
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,279
What is that smile?

243
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,313
- You don't know pain.
- I don't know pain?

244
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,342
- You don't know regret.
- Yeah. All right.

245
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,388
- You don't know...
- Okay.

246
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,322
Well, it was really nice to meet you.

247
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,402
That's what I thought.

248
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,401
So, what'd he say?

249
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,376
Well, he's the real deal. 
That ad is no prank.

250
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:30,314
He's not like retarded,
but there's something wrong with this guy.

251
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,476
Definitely didn't like my ass, 
I'll tell you that.

252
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,318
- So, what, that's it?
- Oh, no, this just got good.

253
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,320
What makes you think
he won't slam the door in my face, too?

254
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,349
'Cause you gotta be sincere
and charm him, okay?

255
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,260
He's used to assholes like me
coming and making fun of him.

256
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,294
Also probably none of the other people
were beautiful girls.

257
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,334
- Easy, Arnau.
- What?

258
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,269
But he's right. Use that, too.
There's something off about this guy, okay?

259
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,499
So you gotta go slow,
like you're trapping a skittish animal.

260
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,502
You know, lure him, play coy.
Girls know how to do that shit.

261
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,380
You're dangling my vagina
out there like bait?

262
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,472
What if this guy's a murderer?

263
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,274
What if he cuts me up into little pieces
and eats me?

264
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,319
Then the story's even better.

265
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,410
Do you sell guns here?

266
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,414
- What kind of guns?
- I don't know.

267
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:48,258
Something sexy and affordable
with killing power.

268
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,228
You should try C&R Guns in Wilkins.

269
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,297
The state of Washington does not allow

270
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,497
the sale of firearms in the business 
premises of a grocer.

271
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,397
What about those thingies

272
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:08,380
with the spiky ball
at the end of the chain things?

273
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,348
You know, with the... Do you have those?

274
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,281
What exactly is the intended use?

275
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,287
Is there a pest problem, or hunting?

276
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,258
Well, if your ad had been written properly,
I may have a better idea of what I need.

277
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,327
- My ad?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,465
- It's pretty sloppy.
- Excuse me?

279
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,228
You heard me.

280
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,392
I hope you worked harder
on your calibrations.

281
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,473
My calibrations are flippin' 
pinpoint, okay?

282
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,469
There are people after me.
How do I knowyou don't work for them?

283
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,339
Because I've never worked
for anybody in my life.

284
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,404
You ever faced certain death?

285
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:48,215
If it was so certain,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

286
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,387
This is a bad place to talk.

287
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,334
I get off in like 15. Rendezvous?

288
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,292
See you in eight.

289
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,413
- Get down!
- What's going on?

290
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,424
- Just get down! Don't let him see you.
- Wait, is he coming?

291
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,426
- Yeah.
- What the hell is he doing?

292
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,291
I don't know. He's all freaked out.
He thinks people are following him.

293
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,491
We're gonna rendezvous.
He's taking me to a secure location.

294
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,290
Get down!

295
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,270
If this guy's taking you to some 
sex bunker, he's gonna be freaked out

296
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,273
when me and Arnau pull out of this thing
like it's a clown car.

297
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,418
- Hey, what's going on out there?
- Get down!

298
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,352
Shit! He's coming!

299
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,253
Don't let him see me,
it'll blow everything for you.

300
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,419
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know! Do something!

301
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,432
We're being followed!
Go! Get in your car! Go!

302
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,309
What the hell is this?

303
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,479
- Oh, shit!
- Git! Git! Go! Get out!

304
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,306
- What the fuck?
- He's got a gun!

305
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,388
- Just get out.
- Where are we?

306
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,484
I don't know. Just get out.
I'll come get you when I'm done. Come on!

307
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,431
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Fuck that.

308
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,492
- Are you guys racist?
- It's complicated.

309
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,506
- Hello?
- It's too hot here right now. Can't talk.

310
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,476
Look, my gut tells me you're not with them,
but I have to be absolutely certain.

311
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,210
I'm gonna do
a quick background check on you.

312
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,407
If everything is good, 
I'll be in touch, okay?

313
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,375
Yeah, okay.

314
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,419
All right, over and... Good night.

315
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,223
Hi, is Liz around?

316
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,493
And it's not necessarily...

317
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,432
It's not a false relationship,
but she's so charismatic.

318
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,502
She's such a beam of light.

319
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,512
All the reporters are saying that.
Also, what I'm reading from...

320
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,286
I don't know. She was big, and like...

321
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,324
And like your age? Yeah. Gross.

322
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,359
It was more like...

323
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:20,330
I don't know, like the years
have not been kind to her, you know?

324
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,424
They pretty much took a shit
all over her face.

325
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,203
- So, did your dude call yet?
- No.

326
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,499
Maybe we should do a background check
on this guy,

327
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,233
you know, make sure he's not a psychopath.

328
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,245
- He seems pretty harmless.
- Don't worry, Darius, he'll call.

329
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,339
I'm sure your weird mojo clicked with
his weird mojo and you got it in the bag.

330
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,478
- C'mon!
- Ready, hike!

331
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,287
Hi.

332
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,495
- Thanks.
- Listen, I'm sorry about the noise level here.

333
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,402
But we need to maintain cover.

334
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm certain I'm being recorded,
I'm certain I'm being followed.

335
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,241
So, who are we dealing with here?

336
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:11,305
I'm not sure yet.
Government agents maybe. Probably.

337
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,440
But the joke's on them.

338
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,453
The technology I've invented
can't be understood by the average mind.

339
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:20,313
So, what are the means of transportation?

340
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,453
Just hold it in your holster
for a second, okay?

341
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,495
I'm still making up my mind about you
as a potential partner.

342
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,254
I have to be absolutely certain
that I can trust you

343
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,268
before I include you in certain 
information.

344
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,302
Well, I just don't wanna be jerked around.

345
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,272
You know, jerking around is forjerks.

346
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,311
God, I remember this smell.
The smell of grass.

347
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,475
I used to play a little bit, 
back in the day.

348
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,345
- I think you should give Liz 
  another chance.
- Oh, you do?

349
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,413
That sucks to spend all that time
thinking about her,

350
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,255
and you're finally here
and you don't follow through with it.

351
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,262
I think it's sad that you're a 22-year-old 
virgin with those creepy glasses,

352
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,388
but I don't bring it up.

353
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,358
You knowwhat? Actually, Arnau,
there are lots of hot chicks here, man.

354
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,334
You could kill in a place like this.

355
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,303
You should run game.

356
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,340
Arnau, Arnau, Arnau, be cool, run game.

357
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,436
- She's in high school.
- I know!

358
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,311
I know she's in high school
and you're in college.

359
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,373
Who do you think that girl wants to fuck?
You!

360
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,474
- Could you, please!
- What?

361
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,282
So what's the year? Where are we going?

362
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,220
- 2001. Is that gonna work for you?
- It's perfect.

363
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,258
I will need to know the timetable, though.

364
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,418
There's a critical step soon.

365
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,431
I need to obtain certain materials
to facilitate the travel.

366
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,296
I plan to execute this step
within the next week.

367
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,336
Why 2001? What are you going back for?

368
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,399
Like I said, certain information
will have to wait.

369
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,441
Knock him on his ass, he's a bum!

370
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,343
- Right there, these two.
- All right. Let's go.

371
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,313
Why? Sit down. We're not going anywhere.
Tell me why. Why?

372
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,280
You're drinking alcohol
at a high school game.

373
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,515
You're damn right I am.
United States ofAmerica.

374
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,313
Drinking a beer at a football game.

375
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,260
Don't get tough on me, big guy.
Let's not do this.

376
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,261
Wait a minute, I know him.
He came to my house.

377
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,421
I think that guy
is recording our conversation.

378
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,490
Is there somewhere else we can go?

379
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,224
Let's get out of here. Come on.

380
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,239
- Stay close. Yeah.
- Are you okay?

381
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,303
I really would have messed that guy up
if I wasn't trying to keep such a 
low profile.

382
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,381
I'm glad I got to see your qualities, 
though.

383
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,417
I think you're ready for the next step,
some basic training.

384
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,283
The heat's moving in. 
That's all for tonight.

385
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,520
I'm leaving. I'm walking out!

386
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,525
I'm leaving by choice. By choice.

387
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,368
- Seriously?
- This place is a dump. 
  Let's get out of here.

388
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,239
Fuck.

389
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,505
Pretty good. You might be a one 
arm shooter.

390
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,217
- Okay, I'll try it.
- Let's just loosen it up.

391
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,445
- You ready?
- Yeah.

392
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,417
- Yeah! You smoked him!
- I smoked him.

393
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,518
Come on!

394
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,360
I think I'm getting better than you.

395
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,323
Hey, let's not get ahead of
yourself here, okay?

396
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,297
It's one thing to hit a target
that's standing still,

397
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,239
but think about it when the 
heat's moving in.

398
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,370
Smoke it!

399
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,387
Double smoke!

400
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,515
- How are your hamstrings holding up?
- Real good.

401
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,225
You're pretty impressive with a handgun.

402
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,227
It's a superlative performance
under simulated pressure.

403
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,321
Our chemistry is starting to build.

404
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,391
I really like your intensity.
You're, like, no-nonsense.

405
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,336
There's no sense in nonsense.
Especially when the heat's hot.

406
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,496
Exactly.

407
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,268
I like your intensity, too.

408
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,336
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You've got good moves.

409
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,482
Nobody's seen my moves before.

410
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,246
Haven't brought a candidate
this far into the training process.

411
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,343
Really?

412
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,421
We'll be learning from each other
from now on.

413
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,380
Good.

414
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,264
We still have to discuss your reason
for going back.

415
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,263
That's classified information.

416
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,370
I can appreciate that, I respect that,

417
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,304
but I have a certain responsibility to 
keep as the leader of this mission.

418
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,299
Then I have to tell you that it's personal.

419
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,404
Darius, sometimes I think we are 
progressing in this mission,

420
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,417
and then other times, I'm not so sure.

421
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm going back to stop my mother
from dying when I was 14.

422
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,365
How'd she die?

423
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,464
She was killed by some guy.

424
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,308
Just some guy at a gas station
took her and killed her.

425
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,446
- Oh, man. Just some random thing?
- Yeah.

426
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,484
Well, no, actually.

427
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:59,224
She was driving home. It was really late,

428
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,232
and she called me to tell me
she was coming home, and I...

429
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,230
I asked her to stop
and get me chocolate milk.

430
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,243
Because I had to have chocolate milk.

431
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,280
So like five minutes later, she called me

432
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,344
to tell me that she got the chocolate milk
and she was coming home.

433
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,289
And her voice was like,

434
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,293
really excited, like she was really happy.

435
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:37,266
And I was, like, okay, whatever.
I wasn't even nice.

436
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,466
That was the last time I talked to her.

437
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,342
That's not your fault.

438
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,472
Yeah. That's what they tell me.

439
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,384
All right, Darius.

440
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,417
I think you're ready. I trust you.

441
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,450
Good.

442
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,456
You should.

443
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,401
- Jeff! Hey!
- Hey. Liz, it's great to see you.

444
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,403
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

445
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,304
- So, this is where you live.
- This is my house.

446
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,331
Well, look, I wanna say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

447
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,276
I was gonna come,
but work's getting crazy and...

448
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,405
I was sad 'cause you got me
thinking about you on that Facebook.

449
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:02,285
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- I never thought I'd see you again.

450
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:06,380
Oh, God, excuse me. Would you come in?

451
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,418
I'd love to.

452
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,227
Your hair's red.

453
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,265
Yeah.

454
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,390
It's different.

455
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,233
Yeah. I changed it.
It's just about the only thing 
I've changed.

456
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,302
- Really?
- Yeah.

457
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,377
Kind of. What about you?

458
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,412
A lot has changed. Almost, like, 
everything.

459
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,373
- Tell me.
- The car... I got an Escalade.

460
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:36,317
And my job's going really well.
Got a great condo.

461
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,518
Tell me about your life.

462
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,417
I just did.

463
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,258
- I've got to read this magazine of yours.
- Oh, don't.

464
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,288
- That is so exciting.
- It's not that exciting.

465
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,459
You knowwhat?

466
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,394
I always thought you'd do something
special with your life.

467
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,429
If you knewwhat it was really like,
you wouldn't say it was special.

468
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,440
Oh, come on. What...

469
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,239
- What's wrong with your neck?
- Sorry I'm doing that.

470
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,303
It's just I got this shooting pain.
I have to share a bed with a male intern.

471
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,316
And I don't feel like
rubbing asses with him, so...

472
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,318
- Let me see.
- You don't have to do that.

473
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,290
- You need to put some heat on that.
- I do?

474
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,361
- I have pies in the oven.
- You make pies?

475
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:23,389
I made some pies.
I made peach, apple, strawberry rhubarb.

476
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,231
Which one do you want?

477
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,428
Yeah.

478
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,234
Liz, that is unbelievable.

479
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:39,313
You bake pies, you give these massages,

480
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,252
and you're not married?

481
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,251
I don't get it.

482
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,391
I was married. He was a ball player.

483
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,489
And I was the good little wife,
baking cookies for the team.

484
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,456
Oh, my God, you bake cookies, too?

485
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,260
Cameron got traded,

486
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,359
and when he went up to the Marlins,
he started making money

487
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,268
and started messing around
with those Miami girls.

488
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,403
Well, I can say this honestly,
Cameron's an idiot.

489
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,536
Yeah, well, we were young.

490
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:13,215
Hey, do you have one free night
while you're in town?

491
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:17,220
Because I would like to make you
a homemade dinner.

492
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,322
I wanna eat that homemade dinner.

493
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,360
I'm just gonna press "record." Okay.

494
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,322
So, Kenneth,
why are you looking for a partner?

495
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,331
I feel like

496
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,372
the world is mostly full ofjankholes,

497
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,373
but I believe that there are 
purists out there,

498
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,240
and that's why I put that ad in the paper.

499
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,437
It's my hope that
if you're watching this video,

500
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,509
something incredible has happened.

501
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,378
I do believe that martial arts
are for self-defense only.

502
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,389
While I would like to maneuver through
this world with an open heart and mind,

503
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,482
sometimes that doesn't gain you favor.

504
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,254
So I just need to be equipped
with the necessary skill sets,

505
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,386
guns, training, weapons, fighting,

506
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,296
in case I encounter any obstacles
that need to be defeated.

507
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,232
- The area is clear.
- Oh, my God!

508
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,325
Mission accomplished.

509
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:08,327
- Wow! Man, that was intense.
- Task completed.

510
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,441
The mission has to do with regret

511
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,274
and the mission has to do with mistakes.

512
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,247
The mission's also about love.

513
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,444
I'm already saying too much.

514
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,282
Aren't you interested in some of
this equipment or something?

515
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,419
Can we talk about something else?

516
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,456
So it's very important that you and I
do not abuse the power

517
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,263
that will come with our knowledge
of the future.

518
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,463
No matter how tempting
it will be to gain personal fortune

519
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,235
or notoriety by say,
being the first person to list

520
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,435
the Contra code for up, up,
down, down, left-right, 
left-right, B-A-start.

521
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:50,311
Or to say, "Hey, leave your Star Wars
figurines in the box

522
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,475
"'cause they'll be worth like hundreds 
more if they are super pristine."

523
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,480
But what about if it's, like,
for the betterment of future society?

524
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,481
Absolutely not. 
We have to stick to the plan.

525
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,386
So when do you fill me in on the plan?

526
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,364
Pretty soon. The action's getting hungry.

527
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,230
I can't eat here.

528
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,304
- Why?
- See that kid? He's like a mutant kid.

529
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,298
Hey, there's something on your ear.

530
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,274
- It's fine, it does...
- Are you okay?

531
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:25,248
- It looks like it's falling off or something.
- No, no, no. It's fine. Don't worry about it.

532
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,410
Shit! Sorry. It's off.

533
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,357
- Kenneth!
- The mission's off, I'm sorry.

534
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,257
Forget it. You're not the right one.

535
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,511
Hey, what's wrong?

536
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,411
It's fake.

537
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,449
- What's fake?
- My flipping ear is fake.

538
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,453
They used to make fun of me,
all the other kids.

539
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:22,428
My parents could only afford one prosthetic,
so I had to wait until I was fully-grown.

540
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,433
- You know that's not a big deal, right?
- Yes, it is!

541
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,309
No, it isn't.
People used to make fun of me, too.

542
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,438
Yeah, right.

543
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,284
I shave my arms and wax my upper lip, okay?

544
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,248
- You're saying that to make me feel better.
- I'm serious.

545
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,313
I had a freaking mustache until I was 14.

546
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,299
Okay, we can still do this,
but you have to promise me

547
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,460
we're never, ever gonna talk about
my ear ever again

548
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,471
for as long as you and I both shall live.

549
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,406
- Okay. Okay.
- Forever.

550
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,243
- But can I say something?
- What?

551
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,302
I think it's kinda cool.

552
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,406
- Get in.
- Okay.

553
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:25,300
So then, what did you tell him your reason
for going back to 2001 is?

554
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,268
I just made up some story.

555
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,307
Yeah? What's the story?

556
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,465
I told him that I was gonna go back

557
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,443
and stop my parents from getting divorced.

558
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,481
Arnau, you son of a bitch. Smash him!

559
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,278
What are you doing?

560
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,376
Whatever I'm doing,
I'm feeling fan-fucking-tastic doing it.

561
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,380
Did you just have sex with that girl
you came here to stalk?

562
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,448
No, I didn't, actually.
We shared a nice conversation.

563
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,483
And you know the truth is, 
she's not that fat.

564
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:55,364
I don't know, a girl's beauty, 
it's in the eyes, you know?

565
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,458
And that doesn't go away with age.

566
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,402
So, anyway,
can we please just focus on the article

567
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,305
and figure out what's wrong with this guy,
like low I.Q.,

568
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,367
or emotional disorder, or whatever it is?

569
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,242
What makes you think there's something
wrong with him?

570
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,277
'Cause he thinks he can go back in time.

571
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,373
Was there something wrong with Einstein
or David Bowie?

572
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,405
Not the same.

573
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,475
Just because the guy's
trying to do something new

574
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,508
doesn't mean he's a freak show.

575
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,286
So you think this is normal?

576
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,450
I don't know. Is it normal that your 
interns do all your work for you?

577
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,356
- Is that normal?
- Right.

578
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,418
Is that how all your articles get written?

579
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,491
It's him. I have to go.

580
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,441
Okay, this is it.

581
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,445
There's technology inside this building

582
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,219
that I need to complete the machine
that will take us on ourjourney.

583
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,317
I'm gonna breach the outer perimeter,
gonna disable their security measures,

584
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,488
penetrate the target,
locate and secure the package,

585
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,425
then we'll rendezvous at the getaway point.
You got it?

586
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,297
Rendezvous at the getaway point.

587
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,494
- I've been watching this place for weeks.
- Yeah, got it.

588
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,297
- The security's full of holes. 
  We'll be fine.
- Okay.

589
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,334
- Fuck!
- Stay focused.

590
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:25,288
What am I doing? Why am I doing this?

591
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,398
Let me see those keys.

592
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,261
Shit!

593
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,365
Okay.

594
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,481
Come on!

595
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,319
Excuse me?

596
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,390
Hey! Hey! What is that? What are those?

597
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,298
- Lasers.
- Lasers?

598
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,495
- Those are real lasers?
- The mission's been compromised.

599
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,398
Hey. Where are you going?

600
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,305
Let's get out of here! Drive!

601
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,370
- Floor it!
- Sorry.

602
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:10,478
What do we do with the van?

603
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,356
Leave it. I stole it from the lot.

604
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,484
Hey, you didn't hurt anyone, did you?
Like, you didn't...

605
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,489
No, no, no, no. Look, it's a fake.

606
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,394
- No casualties. Here. Take it.
- Okay.

607
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,398
- You okay?
- Yeah.

608
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,490
Take this. It'll make you feel better.

609
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,265
You're shaking.

610
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,306
It's just adrenaline from the infiltration.
It's good.

611
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:32,271
- You ready? Come on, let's go. Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,376
Go. Go.

613
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,469
We gotta stick to the back roads,
we can't be seen out here.

614
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,507
Oh, my God! Okay.

615
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,384
- Damn it! We're getting off the road.
- Why?

616
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,253
Those are government employees.
They'll blow our cover.

617
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,256
We gotta wait it out.

618
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,419
Kenneth, it's fine. They won't tell.

619
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,400
No. We can't have any witnesses
that will connect my car to the van.

620
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,399
The people that are after me
are gonna be on full alert.

621
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,494
They'll put the pieces together.

622
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,364
Totally unprofessional!

623
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,401
It's okay.

624
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,339
It's just...

625
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,379
It's a girl.

626
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,325
My reason for going back is a girl.

627
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,491
- Who was she?
- She's my first girlfriend.

628
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:36,263
Her birthday was the exact same day
in April as mine is in October.

629
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,408
We ended up working at the same restaurant.

630
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,469
She was just so nice to me.

631
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:46,245
She would make me special food

632
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:51,276
and after work, while all her friends
were getting ready to go out,

633
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,248
she would just hang out and talk with me.

634
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,323
She was really pretty.

635
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,420
What happened to her?

636
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,492
She died.

637
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,431
Some jerk,

638
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,278
some a-hole jerk in a band got drunk

639
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,284
and crashed his car into her living room.

640
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,313
I should have been there, you know.

641
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,262
People tell you that

642
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,333
there are other girls out there, 
you know, and

643
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,401
it's not just about a girl, it's about...

644
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,432
It's about a time and a place.

645
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,469
Do you have a favorite song?

646
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,450
Would you tell me what it is?

647
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,317
- It's stupid.
- What is it?

648
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,314
Over the Rainbow.

649
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,357
It's a really beautiful song.

650
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,455
It's that time and that place 
and that song,

651
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,268
and you remember what it was like
when you're in that place,

652
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:13,394
and then you listen to that song,

653
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,396
and you knowyou're not in that place
anymore and it makes you feel hollow.

654
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,402
Can't just go find that stuff again.

655
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,480
I like your reason for going back.

656
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,352
It's really nice.

657
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,256
Thanks.

658
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,367
- Fucking lasers?
- What kind of lasers?

659
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,378
I don't know, 
I'm not a frickin' Stormtrooper.

660
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,244
This guy's awesome.
He's over there right now

661
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,510
thinking he's building
a frickin' time machine.

662
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,275
Hey, Arnau, what are the chances
he can do that with these lasers?

663
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,377
- Howwould I know, I'm not a...
- He doesn't know.

664
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,420
He's not a frickin' Stormtrooper either.

665
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:08,220
Stormtroopers don't know anything
about lasers or time travel,

666
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,486
they're blue-collar workers.

667
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,318
I gotta see this shit.

668
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,395
- Isn't this like violating his privacy?
- Don't worry about it.

669
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,374
I can't see much. Looks like an engine.

670
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,411
What are you building in there, Kenny?

671
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,353
Who's this asshole?

672
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,390
Oh, my God, there are people 
following him.

673
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,391
There are really people following him.

674
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,292
We're doing this.

675
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,385
Stay back. Don't spook him.

676
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,254
- Stay back. Don't scare them.
- This is fucking intense.

677
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,417
We're going fifteen miles an hour.

678
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,332
Shit. He saw us.

679
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:28,429
Oh, shit, they're onto us.

680
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,240
Onto what?

681
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,385
Shit.

682
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,514
Don't let him see you! Duck!

683
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,255
Stay down!

684
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,327
What the hell, did you see those guys?

685
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,355
They look like government agents
or something.

686
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,459
- He's really being followed.
- Holy shit! Is this guy for real?

687
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,430
- Kenneth? Are you okay?
- I can't talk right now, okay?

688
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,408
- Just watch your back.
- Okay.

689
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,377
- Stay low and lay low.
- Yeah.

690
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:11,347
Go to the beach, I'll pick you up.
It's almost time, Darius.

691
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,378
This is totally crazy.

692
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,319
- Who do you think those guys are?
- I have no idea.

693
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:24,225
Maybe he's not totally insane, maybe he
really thinks he's doing something and...

694
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,352
I don't know.

695
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,263
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

696
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,459
I don't know. You got a thing for this guy?

697
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,269
What?

698
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,270
No! I'm talk...

699
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,334
You saw those guys.

700
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,269
Can I ask you a question?
Do you mind, as a reporter?

701
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,439
What?

702
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,279
What is it that you two weirdos
do when you're off alone?

703
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,282
I'm getting information.
What are you doing when you're off alone?

704
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,412
I'm seeing an old friend.

705
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,314
Just take me to the beach. I have to meet him.

706
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,333
All right, this is it.

707
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,303
It's pretty obvious they see a threat in 
me possessing this kind of power.

708
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,430
It's not clear yet what entity 
they represent.

709
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,340
Their presence here
definitely accelerates the plan, though.

710
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,275
They're gonna
have one of their guys at every door,

711
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,338
but you should be okay.
I don't think they've ID'ed you yet.

712
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,212
- Got it.
- Good luck.

713
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,247
Wait!

714
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,412
Go! Go!

715
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,292
Shannon?

716
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:45,433
I'm supposed to give this to you.
This is from Kenneth.

717
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,252
Kenneth said to give this to me?

718
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,451
My wife, she's...

719
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,360
You tell him...

720
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,494
Tell him I hope he gets wherever 
he's goin'

721
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:17,405
and it all works out like he wants.

722
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,273
I'll tell him.

723
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,416
All good?

724
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,517
Yeah.

725
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,197
What?

726
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,355
Nothing.

727
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,354
Yeah, we're getting
some really great stuff, Bridget,

728
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,221
I'm gonna need a couple more days.

729
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,261
Bridget, I'm doing an interview right now.

730
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,488
Yeah, I'll send you an e-mail
with all the information,

731
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,290
and I'll paint you a real picture.

732
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,494
Okay. I have to go right now.

733
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,497
That all seems so dangerous.
Her running around with this guy...

734
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:27,233
She'll be fine. You got any more of 
that leftover pie? That was pretty good.

735
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,278
I was thinking about you
and the time we spent together.

736
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:35,282
I was pretty ripped back then.
Top of my game back then.

737
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,478
- You were not ripped.
- Yes, I was.

738
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,378
Why don't you feel me now?

739
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:51,257
You look great.

740
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,505
- Are you familiar with cryptography?
- Yeah. Of course.

741
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,477
Yeah. Well, I prefer
the St. Goodnight code and cipher

742
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,281
for sending messages
that can't be compromised.

743
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,483
It's just 4-4-3-1-4 and then you 
just reverse the whole thing, okay?

744
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,286
Yeah. Got it.

745
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,453
Learn it. Practice it.

746
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:20,429
Hey!

747
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,325
If I showyou something, will you promise
not to tell anybody else about it, ever?

748
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,401
Yeah.

749
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:32,305
When we go back in time,
if anything bad happens,

750
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,501
if somebody gets hurt,

751
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:39,443
or if you mess up, or if the guys
who are after me find me and catch me,

752
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,508
put a note inside this tin.
I'm gonna do the same thing.

753
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,483
If anything goes wrong,
we go back and we fix it.

754
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,286
Okay.

755
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,289
So far so good.

756
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,299
So that's been there since 2001?

757
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,367
Since I was a kid.

758
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,294
I used to come up here

759
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,466
and camp with the Boy Scouts
near here when I was little.

760
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,334
Do you knowwhat Star Wars is?

761
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,241
- Yes.
- Yeah.

762
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,307
So, when I was younger, I used to 
bring my Star Wars figures up here,

763
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:17,285
'cause I didn't wanna leave 'em back 
at the house 'cause they'd get lonely.

764
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,279
And some of the more cynical kids
would make fun of me,

765
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,425
- they would throw them in the fire 
  and stuff...
- Really?

766
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,485
This was before my martial arts training,
of course.

767
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,523
But I found this hiding spot

768
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,391
and sneak out here at night,

769
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:36,237
and put 'em in the tin, take them out,
then put them back in the morning and...

770
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,262
Anyway...

771
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,440
I wish I could see you
when you were a little kid.

772
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,302
I was not as impressive as I am now,
I can assure you.

773
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,276
- What?
- Yeah.

774
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,407
Okay.

775
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,484
- Wanna see something cool?
- Yeah.

776
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,345
Come on.

777
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,531
That was the best sex I've ever had.
And I've had a lot of sex.

778
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,237
That's what you said about the 
roast chicken.

779
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,311
That was the best roast chicken 
I ever had.

780
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,311
You don't know
how long I've thought about this.

781
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,251
You've become this, like, character

782
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:27,288
in my head that's like,
it feels like you're from a fairy tale,

783
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,383
and you're like this purity
that's just not in my life.

784
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,423
You are so cute.

785
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:40,367
Hey. This is gonna sound crazy.

786
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,331
I want you to come to Seattle with me.

787
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,537
- What?
- Yeah.

788
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,437
It's crazy, but I want you to come...

789
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:54,541
Jeff, the minute you drive out of this 
place, you are not going to want to 
be with me.

790
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:58,243
That's just not true. That's what I'm 
saying, I mean, do you not feel this?

791
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,516
- You're not in your right mind right now.
- I'm absolutely in my right mind.

792
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,282
This is the clearest I've been 
in a long time.

793
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,388
I've done this before.

794
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:12,231
- You haven't done it with me.
- No, I've done this before 
  and I'm too old.

795
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,462
We're the same damn age.

796
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,318
That's perfect.

797
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,415
That's unbelievable.

798
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:40,352
Unbelievable. Okay. Great. This is good.

799
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,523
This is perfect. I'm glad you said that
'cause this was a mistake.

800
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,461
You're right. You knowwhat?
I open up my heart to you and...

801
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,498
Thank you,
because my head was turned around...

802
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,339
- Jeff...
- But it ain't anymore.

803
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,335
I think you're being a little 
crazy about this.

804
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,413
Yeah. I think you're crazy for saying no.

805
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,406
Please go.

806
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,355
I'm goin' by choice.

807
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,408
Why are you sitting here?

808
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,434
Why would you be sitting on your computer?
You are a young man.

809
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:31,242
You got the whole world ahead of you.

810
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,478
I'm asking you to be a man and try.

811
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,252
Are you ready to have a crazy night 
with me? 'Cause I'm ready.

812
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,347
- Say you're ready. Say you're ready.
- I'm ready.

813
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,516
My man. Good answer.

814
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,350
Let's do something stupid!

815
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,386
Stay here.

816
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,239
You guys ever partied in an Escalade?

817
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,434
Here we go. Here we go. Drink. Drink.

818
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,414
You drink. Open that up and start drinking,
I didn't buy it for nothing.

819
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:06,472
Good girl.

820
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,284
Go. Go.

821
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,420
Drink, drink, drink.

822
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,324
Arnau!

823
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:30,238
This guy's getting laid tonight.
He's my best friend!

824
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,444
Arnau! Pay the son of a bitch!

825
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:56,489
You warm enough?

826
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,293
This is all your stuff?

827
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,271
Well, I just kind of set up here,

828
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:06,503
the Boy Scouts don't really
come up here after September, so

829
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,245
it's kind of like having a second home,

830
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,448
come to spend some nights

831
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,247
and clear the head.

832
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:20,388
Okay. This is for you.

833
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,254
I circled the location on the map,

834
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,262
this way you'll always know
where to find the truck and this campsite.

835
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,330
- Don't get lost.
- Okay.

836
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,337
What's that? Is that a guitar?

837
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,498
No, it's called a zither.

838
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,433
Can you play this?

839
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,273
Not very well at all.

840
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,337
My dad had one, he was really good.

841
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,406
Belinda really liked music, so...

842
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,283
I always wished I could have
played her something,

843
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,254
so I've been writing her this song
for when I see her again.

844
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,446
Will you play it?

845
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,449
- It's...
- Please?

846
00:59:56,492 --> 01:00:01,259
No, it's not finished
and it's really just not very good, so...

847
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,288
Well, I'll tell you if it's good or not.

848
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,392
Okay.

849
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,461
It's only halfway done, so it's just like...

850
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,417
Stand straight

851
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,519
Fall back in line

852
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,364
Comb your hair

853
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,301
Get to work on time

854
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:46,298
Everyone in the big machine

855
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,504
Tries to break your heart

856
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,471
And pull you underneath

857
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,343
Maybe I'm wrong

858
01:00:56,386 --> 01:01:00,447
And all that you get is what you see

859
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,288
Maybe I'm right

860
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:08,296
And there's something out 
there to believe

861
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,400
Everybody's talking in their sleep

862
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,364
They push a lot of air around

863
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,467
But don't say much of anything

864
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,303
Except when they laugh at me

865
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,339
Like ghosts under a sheet

866
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,316
Everybody's talking in their sleep

867
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,453
I messed up a bunch of parts,

868
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,296
- but that's basically what it is.
- No, it's so good.

869
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:46,359
Shut up.

870
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,260
So good.

871
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,300
Thanks.

872
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:58,441
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Anyway, you cold?

873
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,347
Trust me. Trust me.

874
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,326
Now, feel this.

875
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,228
It works, right?

876
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,296
What are you doing in the lobby?

877
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,354
Are they still in there?

878
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,499
Yeah, that's the point. 
She's still in there.

879
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,400
- You go.
- What do you mean I go?

880
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,238
I didn't want to hang out with these three.
I did it for you!

881
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,432
I don't think so. It's fine. You go.

882
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:00,400
- Are you gay?
- What? No...

883
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,411
- Is that what this is?
- No.

884
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,412
I'm asking you seriously,
I'm not judging you.

885
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,438
You don't know this about me,
but I don't care about that stuff.

886
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,382
No, Jeff, I'm not gay, no.

887
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,475
This is set up perfectly.
Do you not think she's hot?

888
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,488
- You're acting like it's so easy.
- Because it is so easy.

889
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,383
- No, Jeff. It's easy for you, not for me.
- Why not?

890
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:19,394
Because I'm not you, Jeff.
Do you just wanna see me get embarrassed?

891
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:21,396
No!

892
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,424
Arnau, come here, man. Come here.

893
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,469
Fucking come here.
I'm not pranking you, man.

894
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:31,268
You're not gonna get this opportunity
very much longer.

895
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,273
You're not always gonna be 21, young man.

896
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,375
I promise you fucking that.

897
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,305
I don't know. I don't knowwhat to...
How do I start?

898
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,417
First of all, take these pedophile 
glasses off

899
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,386
and don't wear these,
they make you look like a weirdo, man.

900
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,321
I'm gonna put these on you. Holy shit!

901
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,225
Look at that killer.

902
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:51,419
That dude right there crushes chicks.

903
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,422
I would take a photo of you and showyou
how good you looked right now,

904
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,487
'cause you look fantastic.

905
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,291
- You look like a damn pilot.
- Okay.

906
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,426
Like a cool pilot who drives jets.

907
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,235
Pop this shit.

908
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,333
Act like you've been there before.

909
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,341
You're not gonna be your age forever.

910
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,343
One day, you're gonna be the old dirtbag.

911
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,314
All by yourself.
This is the moment you live for.

912
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,318
- Okay.
- Okay?

913
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,282
Okay.

914
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,291
Hey, Halloween, you smoke?

915
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,441
- Yeah.
- Jeff, what the fuck?

916
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,443
It's so early, Bridget.

917
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,448
Yeah, I'm working here.
Isn't that what you're doing down there?

918
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,291
Yes. That's what I'm doing.

919
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,319
I've been going over the notes
that you've been sending in.

920
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:11,489
This Belinda St. Sing, the 
ex-girlfriend he said died in an accident.

921
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:13,425
Is that her name?

922
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,498
Yeah, that's right. Why?

923
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,352
You're past curfew.

924
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,518
- Were those girls with you?
- 100%Arnau.

925
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,420
Hey, you know that girl your boyfriend
was going back in time to save, Belinda?

926
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:39,428
Yeah?

927
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,493
Well, she's alive and well.
Lives about an hour away.

928
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,396
How? What do you mean?

929
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,337
Bridget called and set up an interview.

930
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,305
I think your little boyfriend 
is seriously nuts.

931
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,285
Yeah, I know, he's totally nuts.

932
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,255
He's completely crazy. I know.

933
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,354
So she's alive. Okay.

934
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,428
- I wanna do the interview.
- That's fine.

935
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,396
You sure you got this, kiddo?

936
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,366
Yeah?

937
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,454
- Darius?
- Hi.

938
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:51,261
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

939
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,458
Come on in.

940
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,404
I've never been interviewed
by a magazine before.

941
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,264
He worked at Anderson's,

942
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,469
which was the restaurant I waited at
all throughout college,

943
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,444
and he was really nice.

944
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:08,348
Different just than the typical guys, 
I guess.

945
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,249
So how long were you guys together?

946
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,354
Well, we were never really together, 
together.

947
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:18,384
You never dated?

948
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:22,361
I mean, I wouldn't call it dating. He was...

949
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,523
He was one of those guys, who

950
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,264
you kind of know has a crush on you,

951
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:31,501
but he's really nice
and so you're really nice back.

952
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:37,208
But he wasn't the type of guy
who you could easily

953
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:42,215
fit into your life, you know,
with your friends and everything.

954
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,409
He was

955
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:48,447
weird, I guess we've all
had one of those guys, right?

956
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,487
Yeah. Yeah, I knowwhat you mean.

957
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:58,456
So, then what happened?
Do you guys still talk?

958
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,497
After that, I started dating Rob,

959
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,263
who was my last boyfriend
before I met my husband,

960
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,332
and then Kenneth quit the restaurant.

961
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:11,243
I didn't see him for a while after that.

962
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,248
Then there was the accident.

963
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,406
Accident?

964
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:21,414
Kenneth ran his car
into my boyfriend's house.

965
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,448
There was a big dent
under the kitchen window.

966
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:24,493
My God!

967
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:28,396
So I convinced Rob to just let him go
and we...

968
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,323
We told the police it was a hit and run.

969
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:35,465
I haven't seen him since then.
But you said you've seen him recently.

970
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,463
How is he?

971
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,399
He's good.

972
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,353
Excuse me. Darius?

973
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,423
Can we have a moment of your time?

974
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,456
Nothing to be alarmed about.

975
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,232
We'd just like to ask a few questions
about Kenneth Calloway.

976
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:12,365
Guys? We're from Seattle Magazine.

977
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,341
We're just here doing a story on this guy.

978
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,435
We're not involved
with what he's involved with.

979
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,467
What do you want with him?

980
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,380
He's been contacting government 
scientists on the Internet,

981
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:24,216
asking questions about 
our particle accelerator in Berkeley.

982
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,378
We've been investigating Calloway

983
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,389
for a couple of years now
and we suspect him of being an agent.

984
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,445
He can't be a spy.

985
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:32,324
He was arrested in Colorado for breaking 
into a nuclear physics laboratory.

986
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:35,396
And then there was the recent robbery
at a medical research center here.

987
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,488
Oh, yeah? And what did he take?

988
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,494
Are you sure it was him that 
broke into the medical research place?

989
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,226
You have evidence?

990
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,496
We're confident.

991
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,432
He hasn't been back to his house
in the past 24 hours.

992
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,265
Give us a call if you hear from him?

993
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,411
Will do.

994
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,347
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

995
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,319
So, what's your story about?

996
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,445
The story.

997
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,324
I don't know anymore, actually.

998
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:09,521
You all right?

999
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,395
You sure?

1000
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,303
Yeah.

1001
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,248
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

1002
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,264
Kenneth?

1003
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,405
Kenneth? I'm coming in.

1004
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,416
Darius?

1005
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,318
Hey. What are you doing here?

1006
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,329
Everything's set.

1007
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,233
We move the machine to the launch site.
Departure is at 5:00 p.m.

1008
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,260
How'd you get in here anyway? The spooks
are all over me. It's crazy out there.

1009
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,363
I had to sneak in through the back.

1010
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,330
Hey, we need to talk.

1011
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,437
About last night. I know.

1012
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,245
Last night

1013
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,445
was a thunderbolt.

1014
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,422
But I realize

1015
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,425
our working relationship
became complicated,

1016
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:22,294
so for now, maybe we just
re-focus and concentrate on the mission.

1017
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,388
Whose house is this?

1018
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:28,236
It's my house. My parents left it to me.

1019
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:30,338
Where are the lasers?
Can you show me the lasers?

1020
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,263
What's wrong with your voice?

1021
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,367
- Where's the time machine?
- The time machine is at the launch site.

1022
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,276
Oh, right, it's at the launch site.

1023
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:39,371
Darius.

1024
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,509
What are you doing?

1025
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:46,283
I talked to those guys who are 
following you.

1026
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:49,380
And they told me
that you stole those lasers because

1027
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,292
you're some kind of spy or something.

1028
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:57,488
That's perfect. Let them think that,
it works in our favor. It's better. 
Seriously.

1029
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,297
I also talked to Belinda.

1030
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:03,497
- What?
- Yeah.

1031
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,431
- You did not talk to Belinda.
- Yeah, I did.

1032
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,409
I talked to Belinda. 
I was just at her house.

1033
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,207
No! No!

1034
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,339
What are you doing?

1035
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:22,314
She's alive! She's alive! Okay.

1036
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,425
This is good. Okay.

1037
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:29,420
This means the mission must have
been successful, and we have saved her

1038
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,399
- and we've come back to the present...
- Hey, hey...

1039
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,369
Hey, you can be honest with me, okay?

1040
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,335
- I really like you.
- Okay.

1041
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,307
Yes. But this is the thing.

1042
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:43,470
It's a complicated science
and cannot be measured by our brains...

1043
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:45,376
You can't time travel!

1044
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:49,248
This is all crazy. Okay, you lied to me.

1045
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,376
- Listen to me.
- What else are you lying about?

1046
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,454
Hey, hey, listen to me.

1047
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:57,487
You come to that launch site at 5:00 p.m.,

1048
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:02,457
you take my hand
and I'll showyou who can't time travel.

1049
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,403
Oh, shit!

1050
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:14,209
All right?

1051
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:17,276
Darius! They're right behind the house!

1052
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,209
- Wait...
- They're right behind me.

1053
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,406
Wait, you're with that guy?

1054
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,441
- Are you...
- No.

1055
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,278
- Were you making fun of me?
- No, I would have never...

1056
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,413
Nobody was making fun of you, Kenneth.

1057
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,220
We are writing an honest piece
about you for a magazine.

1058
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,485
Magazine? Darius, don't...

1059
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,262
- We're not making fun of you.
- Get out of my house!

1060
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:37,264
- We're on your side. We're here to help.
- No, I'm leaving tonight!

1061
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,404
So is he really building
a time machine or what?

1062
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,504
Why did you make me do this?

1063
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,307
I didn't make you do this.
You wanted the story.

1064
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,409
You don't care about the story!
You don't care about him.

1065
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:59,352
You just came here
to hook up with old girlfriends.

1066
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:01,480
- What's going on?
- Hey, guys, check this out.

1067
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:03,252
It's open.

1068
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,429
Watch your head.

1069
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:23,274
I knowwhat they were looking for.
I saw it, it was like a,

1070
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,245
like a jet engine or something.

1071
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,483
It's gone!

1072
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,422
Darius, have you seen this stuff before?

1073
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,373
What the hell was he building in here?

1074
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,369
I don't know.

1075
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,213
You don't think he actually built it, 
do you?

1076
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,286
Holy shit!

1077
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,192
Move!

1078
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,493
Darius!

1079
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:35,401
Kenneth, I'm sorry.

1080
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,472
Were you making a joke of me
the whole time?

1081
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,471
No.

1082
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,246
I promise.

1083
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:47,388
I lied about the story, but everything 
else was real, okay? That was really me.

1084
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:57,520
Then get on.

1085
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,330
Come with me.

1086
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:28,523
The mission's been updated.

1087
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,228
I'm going back for you now.

1088
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,238
All right. You trust me?

1089
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,468
Come on.

1090
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:50,309
Take my hand. I knowwhat I'm doing, okay?

1091
01:19:56,324 --> 01:20:00,226
Flip that switch. Do it. Flip it down.

1092
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,308
Are you ready?

1093
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:52,403
Go!

1094
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,308
...to go it alone or to go with a partner.

1095
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,416
When you choose a partner, you have to
have compromises and sacrifices,

1096
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,475
but it's the price you pay.

1097
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:34,346
Do I wanna follow my every whim and desire
as I make my way through time and space?

1098
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:35,389
Absolutely.

1099
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:39,359
But at the end of the day, do I
need someone when I'm doubting myself,

1100
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,395
and I'm insecure and my heart's 
failing me?

1101
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:44,489
Do I need someone who,
when the heat gets hot, has my back?

1102
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,234
- So, do you?
- I do.

1103
01:22:00,275 --> 01:22:10,445
THE END
