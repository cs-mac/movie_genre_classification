1
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:31,089
Children, all of you: sit or stand up straight!

2
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,495
This way! Look at the camera!

3
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:38,450
Children! Come on!

4
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,043
Children, turn forward and stand still, if you please!

5
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,572
This way! Straight! The two of you who are fighting......

6
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:51,483
At school our teacher gave us a funny essay topic...

7
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:58,777
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

8
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,679
Come on, Nicolas, it is not difficult.

9
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:13,331
It's difficult, if you don't know what you want to be.

10
00:01:13,902 --> 00:01:15,601
The others knew...

11
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:20,664
Alceste, for example, wants to be a minister...

12
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:24,133
Alceste is my best friend. He's a fatty who's always eating.

13
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:28,894
That is blood sausage, this is thymus,
those are kidneys...

14
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:31,971
And that is liver pate.
That seems yucky, but it's really tasty.

15
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:35,220
Why does he want to be minister?

16
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:39,258
Because you often get to go to banquets.

17
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:49,584
On Christmas Eve we're having Grandma,
Aunt Dorothe, and Uncle Eugene.

18
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:53,882
We're having liverwurst, stuffed turkey, and chestnuts.

19
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:58,817
Geoffroy will be working with his father.

20
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,164
Geoffroy lives in a large house, with a huge garden.

21
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,897
He even has a swimming pool in the form of an onion.

22
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:21,000
Geoffroy's Pop is very rich, and buys him whatever he wants.

23
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:25,002
You should not get involved with Geoffroy while he's dressing.

24
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:36,348
Because his father is rich,
Albert the gardener brings him to school.

25
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:41,601
That's Clotaire. He loves bikes.

26
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:47,471
It is an ultra fast racing bike!

27
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:54,666
~ Why's it got saddlebags?
~ For quick errands.

28
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:02,128
Clotaire wants to be a champion bike-rider.

29
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:10,597
~ Clotaire, what did I just say?
~ Clotaire is the class dunce.

30
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:15,678
~ Scaffold?
~ What is a scaffold?

31
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:19,763
Something for them to shave wood?

32
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,657
Go into the corner.

33
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:29,181
He always gets everything upside down.

34
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,688
Thanks to his report card he can't watch TV anymore,...

35
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,947
and he gets no dessert.

36
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:43,052
The Director tells him this:

37
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:46,971
Your parents have a good education...why not you?

38
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:52,551
The report card ceremony is hardly fun for anyone.

39
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:57,269
Nicolas: "Often distracted, could do better."

40
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,054
The only one who doesn't care is Eudes.

41
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:04,469
Eudes: "Bully in the classroom and in the playground,...

42
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,191
"with adequate grades."

43
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,599
My father never says anything. You know why not?

44
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,128
I look him straight in the eye.

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,228
Then he looks at the report card, and says nothing.

46
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:29,069
What an awful report card! No dessert tonight!

47
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,043
Given his father's eyes, the trick isn't likely.

48
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,994
Eudes says he wants to be a bandit.

49
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,154
But that's not a job, bandit?

50
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:42,406
Sure it is! If there were no crooks,
there were no policemen.

51
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:45,050
And then your father would be out of a job,
and you'd live in a shack.

52
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:47,714
~ What did you say?
~ I said, in a shack!

53
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:51,932
Rufus wants to be a policeman, like his father.

54
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,653
But when it comes to mischief, he's the best!

55
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:01,521
Guys, look, who am I?

56
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,242
~ Frankenstein?
~ Dracula?

57
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,475
~ The Phantom of the Louvre?
~ A werewolf?

58
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,809
No, guys! It is Mr. Bouillon!

59
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,054
Mr. Bouillon, the playground guard.

60
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,824
We call him that because he always says: "Look into my eyes."

61
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:24,440
Bouillon soup and staring eyes.

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,707
I don't actually understand it myself, but the big guys have told me.

63
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,623
He loves to give lines.

64
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:34,002
Write 100 times: "I can not stab the dragon,...

65
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:36,226
"with the invigilator, in such a grotesque way,...

66
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,884
"that definitely is  not the reality upon which the object is based."

67
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,671
He's never bothered Agnan.

68
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:46,657
Agnan is the best in the class, and the teacher's pet.

69
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,011
But his specialty is as a dirty snitch.

70
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,464
Miss, Miss! They're talking.

71
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:56,424
We can hate him, but we can't beat him up...

72
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,351
because he wears glasses.

73
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,713
Agnan doesn't know what he wants to do.

74
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,530
Miss, he's trying to copy!

75
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,957
At my age, my dad knew what he wanted to be.

76
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,878
He often says that if he weren't married to Mom,...

77
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:19,107
then he would have been a star footballer.

78
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,449
Or maybe a swimming champion.

79
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,032
~ Or:...
~ Cycling champion.

80
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,805
A Gossip-champion, you could be sure. World-class, even.

81
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,580
That's Mr. Blediole, our neighbor.

82
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:46,952
Have you nothing better to do than eavesdrop?

83
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,389
I listen without prejudice, I enjoy it. Just like the rest of the neighborhood.

84
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,447
~ You've been warned.
~ Why, what you gonna do?

85
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,662
He and Daddy really like bickering.

86
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,993
He's a champion gossiper at the drop of a hat?

87
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,753
And then there's Mom...

88
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:11,550
My mother always wanted to be just a mother.

89
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,754
I think they have everything they want.

90
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,688
I do not know why I would want anything different later...

91
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:26,008
because my life is now just super-fantastic.

92
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,899
I definitely would not want that to change.

93
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:11,623
Who can me tell the story of Tom Thumb?

94
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:14,681
~ Eudes?
~ ...He was small?

95
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,356
Yes, OK. But more?

96
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:21,638
~ Rufus?
~ He's small enough to break into places easily?

97
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:24,212
Not quite.

98
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:31,784
~ Alceste?
~ He's small because he doesn't eat enough.

99
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:35,430
~ Not quite.
~ Miss, Miss, Miss!

100
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:39,830
Nicolas?

101
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,758
~ Miss, Miss!
~ Well, go ahead, Agnan.

102
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:51,103
He was called Tom Thumb, Tom Thumb,
because he was as small as a thumb.

103
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:53,942
He was the youngest son of a poor woodcutter family.

104
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:59,062
His parents decided that they were too poor to keep their kids and left them in the forest.

105
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:00,740
Then...

106
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:19,781
Joaquim! Congratulations!

107
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,675
News Flash: Joaquim has a new brother!

108
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:41,027
Silence!

109
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,629
Clotaire, what are you doing?

110
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:59,443
I was having a nice sleep. Then my dad woke me up.

111
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,484
He had dressed quickly, and hadn't shaved --- then he said I had a brother!

112
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:07,619
And then?

113
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:10,156
Then my father brought me to my mother.

114
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:13,291
She lay in a hospital bed, and was as happy as my dad.

115
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:16,862
And beside her...sigh...My brother.

116
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:21,347
~ And you aren't happy?
~ Why should I be?

117
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:24,133
He screams all day, which my father says is cute.

118
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,800
But when I try it, he slaps me on the head.

119
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,301
Just get near the cradle, and I get another one to the head.

120
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,124
~ How big is the baby?
~ Maybe so big...

121
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,102
Pretty soon he'll be up to here.

122
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:39,709
Yes, and then you'll have to share your room with him!

123
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,789
Never! It's MY room!

124
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,953
~ Well, he could still sleep in the garden?
~ We don't have one.

125
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,044
~ Then make a garden?
~ Or in the garage?

126
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,519
This is the pits. I wanted a bike, not a brother.

127
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,831
You're doomed. He'll eat up all your candy.

128
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,895
And you can't complain, because they'll think you're jealous.

129
00:12:56,496 --> 00:13:00,092
Yeah, exactly, they say you're jealous and you get your head bashed.

130
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,350
~Before you know it, you'll be sleeping in the garage.
~ I tell you, you're doomed.

131
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,431
~ But did they say anything, though?
~ No.

132
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,636
~ Although, my father was acting strange lately.

133
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:19,692
~ How?
~ He was super-kind to my mother.

134
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:23,721
For example, he carried a lot of heavy shopping.

135
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,034
And then he said: "No, honey, don't tire yourself out."

136
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:32,743
He even took out the trash without grumbling. Weird.

137
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,755
~ Mama?
~ Yes, darling?

138
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:40,579
How are babies made?

139
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,134
~ Ah, look, your father's home!
~ Surprise!

140
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,574
"For Nicolas, son of a hard working father.

141
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,594
"Signed: Roger Moucheboume."

142
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,871
Mr. Moucheboume is Daddy's boss.

143
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:05,295
Sir, have you already read the letter I had placed on your desk?

144
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,101
What letter?

145
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:09,730
That letter about my salary increase. I thought since we last discussed...

146
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,524
This can wait. Besides, I have a job for you.

147
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,453
My parents often fight over his job.

148
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:17,469
He exploits you, and you do nothing about it!

149
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:20,934
OK, I'll hand in my resignation! Nicolas, pack your suitcase.

150
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:22,482
We'll live in a caravan.

151
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,657
Super! I'm packing...

152
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,940
Dad and Mom often argue anyway.

153
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:34,054
~ What have you brought home?
~ A trifle, really. It was a bargain.

154
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,301
Where will we put it? Anyhow, we'll soon truly poor, is that what you want?

155
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,407
We'll find somewhere. Maybe that round table?

156
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,089
But I thought Mr. Moucheboume had said...

157
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,140
It's not certain. So where do you want this?

158
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,973
It's not certain? We can’t really pay for a TV,

159
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:47,424
The car isn't even paid off yet.

160
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:50,194
Should I bring it back? What do you want me to do?

161
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:53,182
Boil me in oil, but I can't stand this!

162
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,620
But eventually they always cooperate.

163
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:58,007
Well...Put it over there.

164
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,905
Well, almost always...

165
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,852
~ Nicolas?
~ Yes?

166
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,462
~ Don't ever get married.
~ OK.

167
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,942
Nicolas, maybe you should write a letter,...

168
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:26,921
a thank-you note to Mr. Moucheboume.

169
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:29,361
Dear sir... no...Moucheboume Dear sir,

170
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,626
No... Dear Mr. Moucheboume...Wait...Dearest?

171
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:37,855
Dear, Dear or Dear Mr. Moucheboume?

172
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:40,190
I hear nothing while I'm in the kitchen.

173
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,614
Dear, Dear or Dear Mr. Moucheboume?

174
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:46,154
~ Dear Mr. Moucheboume.
~ No, that is too conventional.

175
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,929
If you know things that well, why ask me then?

176
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:54,347
Well then...Moucheboume Dear Sir, Space...

177
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:57,764
I was very surprised by your surprise...no.

178
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:03,372
I was very pleased with your happy...no, surprise. I was surprised by your impressive...no.

179
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:05,681
I was pleasantly surprised by your huge surprise...

180
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:08,270
Oh, yes...make it gargantuan.

181
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,570
Well...the big surprise...your beautiful gift received...

182
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,882
~ Your...
~ Super-gift?

183
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:16,546
No...your wonderful gift.

184
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,130
The kid is right, "super" sounds much more sincere...

185
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,008
How can we write if you keep interrupting us?

186
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,372
Well, your beautiful gift, the following sentence.

187
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,561
Sincerely Yours...no.

188
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:36,815
Sincerely, or Yours?

189
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:46,402
Write it...my love...and ready. Give me.

190
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,281
Nicolas, please.

191
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:08,500
Nicolas!

192
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,456
Stop that God-forsaken thing!

193
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,891
So I never get that better job.

194
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,877
Maybe if we ask the Moucheboumes over for dinner?

195
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,032
"He even took out the trash without grumbling."

196
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:50,491
~ No, Honey, I'll go...
~ How sweet of you.

197
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:56,293
~ Where are the cups?
~ Oh wait, I'll get them.

198
00:18:56,772 --> 00:19:00,436
~ No problem, relax.
~ Oh, let me do it.

199
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,496
~ I'm getting a little brother!
~ Where?

200
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,288
No idea, but it went exactly as Joaquim said!

201
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,868
Where is Joaquim, anyway?

202
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:20,037
Children.

203
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,809
No lessons today, the school doctor is here for your checkups.

204
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,110
Miss, Joaquim isn't here yet.

205
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,066
I already know, his parents called.

206
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:37,523
Follow me in silence.

207
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:42,244
~ Strange about Joaquim.
~ Maybe it's his brother!

208
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:45,262
Maybe his parents left him in the woods,...

209
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:46,955
like Tom Thumb!

210
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,059
~ Did it hurt?
~ A super lot of pain.

211
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,559
So bad they had to tie us down.

212
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,463
I don't want to! Mama!

213
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:04,821
What is going on? Calm down.

214
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:10,935
If you're good at the doctor, then I'll call on you more often.

215
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:16,067
~ Even during recess?
~ Yes. ~ Yes!

216
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:22,498
Come on, let's go.

217
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,317
I'm going to show you pictures, and you say what you think of.

218
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,092
Ready?

219
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:47,518
What do you see?

220
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:49,955
My father's car.

221
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:54,173
My father's boat.

222
00:20:58,244 --> 00:20:59,797
My father's airplane.

223
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:01,017
Cough again.

224
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:02,050
Fine.

225
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:06,242
~ Cough again?
~ That's fine.

226
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,970
Cough again?

227
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:14,850
Go ahead.

228
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,580
I do not know how, I haven't studied for this.

229
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:21,174
Say just what you think.

230
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:24,307
It looks like a date.

231
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:27,489
A date. You see a date?

232
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:33,197
~ I don't know.
~ A date.

233
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:40,722
~ That wasn't me.
~ Not you. OK.

234
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:46,716
And this?

235
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:51,610
~ That's not fair, I didn't draw these.

236
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:56,094
Take your glasses off and tell me what you see.

237
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,522
Take your glasses off, I said.

238
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:08,664
~ And this? Something from your father?
~ No, this is my mom's fur coat...

239
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,348
the fur coat my father bought.

240
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,583
Next. No, no bread.

241
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:25,508
It's a boy who finds a bean.

242
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,869
He plants it but it grows into a baby,...

243
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,067
getting bigger and bigger...

244
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:38,311
and finally it's giant, that the boy attacks.

245
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,373
He kills it and eats it.

246
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:52,742
So I said: Why not come over for a cozy dinner...

247
00:22:52,742 --> 00:22:54,683
together with Mrs. Moucheboume?

248
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:58,725
~ And what did he say?
~ He thought it's great. I consult with you and we pick a date!

249
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,956
I'm so happy, honey! But tell me,...

250
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:04,519
what kind of woman is Mrs. Moucheboume?

251
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,187
No idea, a boss's wife, that sort of thing I guess?

252
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:11,264
~ But she is very cultivated, or...
~ No idea, we've never met.

253
00:23:19,184 --> 00:23:20,910
~ Anyway, if they come, then everything must be perfect!
~  Of course.

254
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:25,487
And what about Nicolas? He stays here?

255
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:31,451
~ No, that's impossible.
~ I'm afraid you're right.

256
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:50,767
~ Nicolas, won't you eat? To grow up big and strong!

257
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:55,982
And next weekend, if we agree, how about a nice walk in the woods?

258
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:08,251
You've got to get a handle on this.

259
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:11,221
Exactly, you just give a gift to your mother.

260
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:13,700
A ham for example.

261
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,916
Then she'll see that you're good, and she won't leave you.

262
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:20,241
No, you have to buy her a ring! My dad always does.

263
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:22,839
That always works.

264
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:25,559
I have only 3 francs.

265
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,309
Hello. Can I help you?

266
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,560
Hi, I would like to buy some flowers for my mother.

267
00:24:34,914 --> 00:24:36,740
How sweet! She's lucky, your mother.

268
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:39,049
Then they won't leave him in the woods.

269
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:43,589
~ How much are those roses there?
~ 3 francs.

270
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:46,393
Super, I'll take that!

271
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:50,846
No --- 3 francs per flower.

272
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:55,248
Can I borrow some money, I'll pay you back.

273
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,692
I'm sorry, I've just got enough for my lunch.

274
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,253
~ How about you?
~ I don't have any.

275
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,551
~ Why, you still have your pocket money, right?
~ Yeah, so? That's my money!

276
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,522
~ Some friends!
~ It's for your mother!

277
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:07,240
If I wasn't holding these flowers, I'd clobber you!

278
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,106
Calm down, kids!

279
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:11,280
~ I'm keeping them down here.
~ Here, take this!

280
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,920
Murderer!

281
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:07,590
What a beautiful rose, Darling!

282
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,974
Clotaire was right. The tactic had worked nicely.

283
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:16,312
Over the next few days, I did everything I could to please Mom.

284
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:19,976
I even wore my itchy blue suit...

285
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:25,226
to go along with Mom for dinner at Mrs. Court-Plaque's.

286
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,892
~ And he's so handsome!
~ Here's a kiss.

287
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:34,249
Ah, there's Marie-Edwige!

288
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:46,131
This is Marie-Edwige. Quite attractive, but she's a girl, so she's not so interesting.

289
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,824
Show Nicolas your room!

290
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,518
What'll we play?

291
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,697
We could play "nursing sister".

292
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:05,732
It is wartime, and you're injured and frightened. I take care of you.

293
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,213
I'd rather play cards.

294
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:13,532
~ OK, what can you play?
~ War?

295
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,773
I know a better game.

296
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,559
It was very complicated., Marie-Edwige won the game.

297
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:22,598
She always had good cards because she took mine.

298
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:25,275
Now she had them...

299
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,014
and I did not.

300
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,294
Even the cards had a different value.

301
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,454
So she took a my king with a 3.

302
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:39,044
~ But...
~ What?

303
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:41,381
And then there were the tricks...

304
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,380
And I always lost.

305
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:48,425
~ It's sticky.
~ Quit squirming!

306
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:54,090
Later on the girlfriends
of Marie-Edwige dropped by.

307
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:01,141
And we played fine.

308
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,694
But after a while...

309
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,470
Maybe I could change schools.

310
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:26,371
~ Good bye, Nicolas!
~ Bye, Nicolas!

311
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:33,519
That was a nice day.

312
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,405
Good bye, Marie-Edwige, I had a good time.

313
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,891
I think you're very cute, and hope to see you again soon.

314
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,836
But I finally said...

315
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:55,370
~ I am very proud of you, Nicolas!
~ Mom was very happy...

316
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,596
But all the effort was for nothing.

317
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:03,003
Tomorrow...we were walking in the woods!

318
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,783
Nicolas, what are you doing? Come on, open up.

319
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:53,538
Get with it! Ha-ha, very funny...now open up!

320
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:56,724
Open the door immediately!

321
00:29:57,704 --> 00:30:00,227
This is unacceptable! You open that door now!

322
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:05,128
What are you afraid of? I'm your Mom!

323
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:06,452
Open up.

324
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:11,493
And how are we going home, if you don't open the doors?

325
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:41,363
The rest of the afternoon Mom and Dad were fighting.

326
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:48,665
I really didn't want to leave my mom.

327
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:52,562
But I knew that Daddy would eventually win her over.

328
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,282
We're setting up a secret group to help Nicolas.

329
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:00,753
What's a secret group?

330
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:03,006
We're heroes who come together to help people.

331
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:05,740
And our group is called: "El Cid - Children"!

332
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,713
The we have to have a place to hang out.

333
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:09,768
Good idea, but we also need a password.

334
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:11,551
"Undaunted Courage"!

335
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:14,795
Only those who know the password can enter.

336
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:19,052
Children, time to line up!

337
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:28,401
Here's a note from my parents.

338
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,440
"Excuse our son Clotaire for not finishing his homework."

339
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,319
Who wrote this?

340
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,018
"Daddy"

341
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:55,518
~ Excuse me, Miss?
~ Yes?

342
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,995
If we can't see the apple, can we stand up?

343
00:31:58,213 --> 00:31:58,791
Of course.

344
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:00,894
Sit!

345
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:04,689
Stand up!

346
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:06,023
Sit down.

347
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:10,391
Children, I can tell you with joy,...

348
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:12,932
that the Minister of Education is coming to visit our school.

349
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:19,952
I trust you will give him a memorable reception.

350
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:22,236
And I invite your teacher,...

351
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:24,401
who will craft a display with you...

352
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:29,818
of a spectacle, in which culture and education go together.

353
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:33,484
It will make a deep impression.

354
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,622
But our teacher was not so very pleased with a spectacle.

355
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:42,388
She already tried something already with us: a play.

356
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:53,118
But Geoffroy, what the hell is that costume for?

357
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:55,412
A close-order drill.

358
00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:03,954
Alright...but what are you doing, away?

359
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,741
Pay attention! And left and right and left...

360
00:33:07,547 --> 00:33:10,796
Bunch of amateurs! Are you the pride of France?

361
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:21,999
And even a choir...But it was beyond us.

362
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:25,762
Sorry, that's all I can do.

363
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:31,325
It may well slow down the curriculum.

364
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:39,355
~ Someone could recite a poem?
~ Very well.

365
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,777
~ "The Raven and the Fox" or something.
~ Yes, fine.

366
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:49,592
You, little friend, can you recite for me "The Raven and the Fox"?

367
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,142
I do not know it by heart,...

368
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:54,138
but it was a raven with blue cheese in its mouth.

369
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:55,767
No, really it was Camembert!

370
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:59,867
Not, Camembert melts in your mouth out, and it's totally yucky!

371
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:08,586
Enough, enough! Everyone quiet down!

372
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:12,934
Go on drawing.

373
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:34,319
~ Password:
~ "Undaunted Courage".

374
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:38,782
~ Password:
~ "Undaunted Courage".

375
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:42,271
"Undaunted Courage".

376
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:45,224
"Undaunted Courage".

377
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,955
~ Password:
~ "Terrible Courage"?

378
00:34:52,928 --> 00:34:54,251
Password, or you can't enter.

379
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,540
"Many Courage"?

380
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:58,544
"Super Courage"?

381
00:34:59,548 --> 00:35:02,610
Well, first we need a boss. That's me.

382
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,874
~ And why you?
~ Because I'm a natural leader.

383
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:09,542
~ The strongest is the Boss!
~ No, the oldest is the Boss...so it's me.

384
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,777
No, Clotaire's the oldest, he was left back.

385
00:35:12,096 --> 00:35:15,170
We didn't come here to fight.

386
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,336
We can do that at school.

387
00:35:19,169 --> 00:35:21,892
Hello? Just a moment, I'll check...

388
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:27,662
Sir? The Minister --- he wants an appointment with you.

389
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:32,499
~ Here, see for yourself here in the agenda.
~ Very well, sir.

390
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,995
~ Your shirts are ready, Sir.
~ Thank you, lay them down.

391
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,424
I also polished your shoes.

392
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,399
~ Do you hear what I say?
~ Huh?

393
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:53,494
I said I changed my mind.

394
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:56,239
I don't want to have dinner with the Moucheboumes after all.

395
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,366
What? Why not?

396
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:01,583
Because I have no dress, no jewelry, and I can't drive.

397
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:07,823
Honey, what do you mean?

398
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:10,608
I don't want to look like a boring housewife in front of Mrs. Moucheboume.

399
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,902
What's boring?

400
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:21,601
Do you think her husband stops Mrs. Moucheboume from driving?

401
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,150
No! Do you think she takes the bus? Absolutely not!

402
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,644
~ So she can drive but I can't?.
~ Seems logical.

403
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:30,739
Do you think Madame Moucheboume doesn't have a nice dress to go out?

404
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:33,902
~ Of course she does.
~ But I don't.

405
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:36,560
~ How about that mint-green dress I bought for you, then...

406
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,345
~ I can't wear that old thing every time!
~ You don't.

407
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,443
She does pretty often, though.

408
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:45,583
Do you think Mrs. Moucheboume is only concerned with only her family, her home?

409
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,408
No, she's a modern woman.

410
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:51,668
Classy, independent, and I'm only a hausfrau.

411
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:55,112
All I can do is cook, I am not going to humiliate myself for the entire evening.

412
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:57,221
So let's cancel the dinner.

413
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:04,827
Well, then. I do not want my wife to feel humiliated.

414
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:07,505
Tomorrow we'll go buy a dress at Galerie Lafayette.

415
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:10,426
~ With jewelry?
~ With jewels.

416
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:14,707
~ And driving lessons?
~ That, too.

417
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,851
How expensive can it be?

418
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:30,234
~ "Courage... " Well?
~ "Inflamed"!

419
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:36,408
So, everyone is the Boss of his own group.

420
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:42,907
For example: Geoffroy is the boss for Eudes, Rufus, and Alceste and me.

421
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:47,062
Rufus is the boss of Eudes, Clotaire, and me...

422
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:51,050
Eudes was the boss of Geoffroy,
Rufus, me, and Alceste.

423
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,521
And I have you all in my group. Agreed?

424
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:59,156
~ Yes.
~ OK, now what?

425
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,203
Eureka, I know!

426
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:11,007
We'll clean your house. Your parents will be so happy that they'll love you.

427
00:38:11,286 --> 00:38:12,737
So be nice, Nicolas.

428
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:16,047
We'll be back in about two hours if your mother cooperates.

429
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:18,987
Why did you say that? "If your mother cooperates?"

430
00:38:18,987 --> 00:38:24,676
~ Simply that I do not know.
~ Well, then just say that.

431
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:34,738
We have two hours.

432
00:39:53,884 --> 00:39:55,619
~ Accelerator...
~ Stop it!

433
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:57,296
I'm doing my best!

434
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:02,411
Brake!

435
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:16,182
Now what? Don't give up too soon.

436
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:27,862
I was very curious how my parents would find the house...

437
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:32,003
OK, the first time was not all...

438
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:59,602
I would never succeed in making them like me.

439
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,732
So I decided to run away from home.

440
00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:09,115
I took everything I thought I'd need.

441
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,799
So I went on the road.

442
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:19,474
I wanted to go far away,
far away to China or someplace.

443
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:26,298
Mom and Dad would miss me.
and I would just return,...

444
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:31,132
if I was captain of a warship, and could earn lots of money.

445
00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:34,758
With my money, I'd take them to the cinema,...

446
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,196
and everyone would say: Look! It's Nicolas!

447
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:40,732
He has heaps of money and even pays for the cinema for his parents...

448
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,004
even though they don't much care for him!

449
00:42:01,774 --> 00:42:03,097
So you gave up?

450
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:04,509
No, I've been thinking.

451
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:07,653
I'm not the one who should leave.

452
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:09,586
After all, I was here first.

453
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:11,619
The person who's got to go is the baby.

454
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,615
So if the baby shows up...

455
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:16,056
we get rid of it.

456
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:19,855
How?

457
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:21,274
We bring him to the shelter!

458
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:23,587
That won't work, they'll know he's not an animal.

459
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:25,677
I know! We leave him behind in the jungle.

460
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:27,295
Then he'll be raised by wolves!

461
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,197
I've read something about that, it's terrible.

462
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:30,918
No, the jungle is too far away.

463
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:33,853
We'll hide him in a hut, and he'll be our secret.

464
00:42:34,174 --> 00:42:35,332
We'll bathe and feed him.

465
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,600
~ I can only help on Thursdays.
~ Yeah, me, too...

466
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,168
And me, just Thursdays.

467
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:43,291
Me too, unless I'm grounded, but that's almost all the time.

468
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,283
Well, he could hunt. Like my grandma's cat.

469
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,963
Very funny, babies aren't cats --- they can't feed themselves.

470
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:54,422
I heard everything.

471
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,518
What have you heard, Tattletale?

472
00:42:57,984 --> 00:43:01,048
You want the Nicolas's baby brother to live in a hut in the jungle...

473
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:04,144
and you're going to make him eat a cat.
I'm going to tell the teacher,...

474
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:06,628
and also the Director! You'll be severely punished!

475
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:09,783
~ Unless...
~ Unless what?

476
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,071
~ Unless you back my idea for the spectacle to the teacher.

477
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:15,622
And what's your idea?

478
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:38,174
We have a good idea,...

479
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:40,023
but we can not kidnap the baby ourselves.

480
00:43:40,023 --> 00:43:42,127
When the police catch on, we'd be doomed.

481
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,379
The only solution:

482
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,202
The baby has to be abducted by a gangster.

483
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:49,611
A gangster? But where do you get that idea?

484
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:14,180
Pssst! Sir!

485
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:22,072
Come here!

486
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:42,615
Who can tell me what river passes through Paris?

487
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:46,209
Clotaire?

488
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:49,956
Clotaire, did you hear the question?

489
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:52,259
Which river runs through Paris?

490
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:54,333
Yeah, what's that river?

491
00:44:58,598 --> 00:45:01,602
~ Come on!
~ It is...

492
00:45:18,524 --> 00:45:20,453
~ Clotaire?
~ Yes, Ma'am?

493
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,587
Have you ever been with your parents on a boat before?

494
00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:26,104
~ Yes, Ma'am.
~ And where was that?

495
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:27,803
Along the Seine.

496
00:45:30,485 --> 00:45:31,450
You see?

497
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,430
Underlying the litteratie is the counting of syllables...

498
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,131
If the accentuation, which is found in the Icelandic poetry...

499
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:47,184
such Snorrisn SNN... ...uh

500
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:50,199
I can't really comment.

501
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:51,131
Then you simply sit.

502
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:53,585
Help me or give me some feedback?

503
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,589
Snorri Sturluson

504
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,986
Snorri Sturluson who has laid the basis,

505
00:45:57,986 --> 00:46:01,859
by the noun to replace...

506
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:03,452
a paraphrase or a metaphor.

507
00:46:04,642 --> 00:46:07,730
~ One more thing...music!
~ Ah no, Darling...

508
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:10,211
I do not think Mrs. Moucheboume wants to talk about music,...

509
00:46:10,497 --> 00:46:13,121
especially after everything you've said about Scandinavian poetry from the 13th century.

510
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:16,487
I think she is a happy, cultivated person to meet...

511
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:19,086
who enjoys interesting conversation...

512
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,262
while their men talk business.

513
00:46:21,897 --> 00:46:23,685
~ Come on.
~ The Baroque-style.

514
00:46:24,008 --> 00:46:27,952
This arises from the Portuguese word Barocco...

515
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:34,517
Guys! Look!

516
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,915
Francis Leborgne!

517
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:40,791
Him we must have!

518
00:46:42,252 --> 00:46:46,523
Recess is over? Come on, you brats!

519
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:58,919
Children. Your teacher is away a few days.

520
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:01,152
She will be replaced Mrs. Navaranne.

521
00:47:03,008 --> 00:47:04,149
There she is.

522
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:17,494
Geography: Rivers of France.

523
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,398
Sit down.

524
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,631
Silence!

525
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:42,393
Well, today's lesson is about rivers.

526
00:47:43,266 --> 00:47:46,641
I know you know all about this subject.

527
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:55,017
But first we must hang up the map. Who'll do that?

528
00:47:55,602 --> 00:47:56,951
Sit!

529
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,480
I decide who hangs up the map.

530
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:06,663
You there, in back...Your name?

531
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:10,065
Clotaire, Ma'am.

532
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:13,275
You seem more disciplined than the others.

533
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:15,733
Go and hang up the map.

534
00:48:18,122 --> 00:48:21,400
~ But Miss...
~ Silence!

535
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:29,599
I see a stubborn fellow.

536
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:35,306
And stubborn little guys, I break. Clear?

537
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:43,231
You there. Tell me about the Seine.

538
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,901
The Seine flows from the Plateau of Langres.

539
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:48,691
And has a length of 776 km.

540
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,671
It extends into the English Channel.

541
00:48:51,318 --> 00:48:52,592
Very good. And you?

542
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,354
The famous rivers: they are
the Aube, the Loing, the Oise, and the Loing.

543
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:57,442
Excellent!

544
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,688
And you, Joker? Yes, yes, you.

545
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:05,014
If I ask you something, you'll have something to say about the Seine?

546
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:12,227
I guess not. Into the corner.

547
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:14,568
That will teach you not to be the class clown.

548
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,057
What's the matter?

549
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:19,721
He is not used to it, Ma'am.

550
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:27,349
~ Come on, I'll show you.
~ Very thoughtful of you.

551
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,588
~ There is no yellow-pages for gangster!
~ Search Leborgne.

552
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,410
Francis Leborgne! Got it.

553
00:49:52,477 --> 00:49:53,987
~ Hello?
~ Francis Leborgne?

554
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:56,702
Just a moment. Francis, for you!

555
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:01,520
Ask if he can handle the new teacher.

556
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,577
~ Yes?
~ Francis Leborgne?

557
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:07,601
~ Yes, I am.
~ I've got a clean-up job for you.

558
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:09,967
A clean-up chore? Wouldn't it better to bring it here?

559
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,528
~ Why come there?
~ I can do it in detail here.

560
00:50:13,898 --> 00:50:21,030
~ No, we just want something solved.
~ Well, that costs money.

561
00:50:24,715 --> 00:50:27,880
If I come, callout costs at least 500 francs.

562
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:29,407
We'll call you back.

563
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:33,641
~ What did he say?
~ Tell us!

564
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,235
He wants 500 francs.

565
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,010
What a con, a real gangster!

566
00:50:41,941 --> 00:50:43,767
And for the new teacher, how much?

567
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:53,692
Hey, whose are all those old chocolates?

568
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,369
Do not eat from that, Honey, they've gone off.

569
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,654
"Staff room"

570
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:11,756
~ Yes?
~ Here, a present for you!

571
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,748
Oh...that's nice of you. Thank you.

572
00:51:18,448 --> 00:51:20,928
~ A housekeeper?
~ Yes, I want us to hire a housekeeper.

573
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:24,871
I won't always have to get up from the table to get food.

574
00:51:25,644 --> 00:51:26,888
And it IS more stylish.

575
00:51:29,304 --> 00:51:32,531
And the menu: "Homard à la mayonnaise".

576
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:35,259
You know what that would cost?

577
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,560
80 francs per kilo!

578
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:44,419
We can just do something else with mayonnaise?

579
00:51:45,328 --> 00:51:47,610
And the rest, perhaps, simpler?

580
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:49,068
A simple meal?

581
00:51:49,364 --> 00:51:52,970
We can also try ham sandwiches in front of the TV if you just want to eat.

582
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,312
I spent the night wondering...

583
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,951
how my friends and I could come up with 500 francs.

584
00:52:05,249 --> 00:52:09,839
Geoffroy brought something special to school.

585
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:13,294
How does that work?

586
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:17,930
Got a coin? You choose a number, e.g. 6...

587
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:21,558
You put the coin on the grid, I crank the roulette wheel,...

588
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:23,150
And drop the ball...

589
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:28,378
And you've lost.

590
00:52:29,602 --> 00:52:31,583
Thus we'd get 500 francs as the house cut.

591
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:34,324
We'd have to play against adults, for their money.

592
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:39,766
What are you doing? Playing roulette? And for money?

593
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:41,426
This takes the biscuit!

594
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:45,382
Do you know where this leads? Prison!

595
00:52:46,536 --> 00:52:53,433
Hand it over. What a great gift from your parents!

596
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,766
And now, everybody into the classroom.

597
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:07,464
Bad news for you...

598
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:13,253
Your replacement has suddenly become ill.

599
00:53:14,614 --> 00:53:17,412
"He murders his teacher!"

600
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:22,820
The accused is found guilty!

601
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,032
And he is a dirty snitch.

602
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,909
Agnan, what is it?

603
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,906
You can't beat me up, I wear glasses.

604
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:44,722
Julie the teacher just has a cold, and she's staying home today.

605
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,027
You'll stay in the classroom, under the supervision of a fellow student.

606
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:51,444
I need someone I can trust.

607
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:02,316
Well, today we do arithmetic.

608
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,028
Open your workbooks, we'll go with some exercises.

609
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:07,508
Silence, I'm the boss.

610
00:54:07,864 --> 00:54:09,052
Shrink your head, Tattletale!

611
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:10,920
Eudes, into the corner.

612
00:54:11,138 --> 00:54:12,916
You gonna eat arithmetic.

613
00:54:13,747 --> 00:54:16,185
~ I'm wearing my glasses!
~ Not for long!

614
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:22,244
Geoffroy! We'll get you back the roulette wheel!

615
00:54:22,665 --> 00:54:23,539
OK, but how?

616
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,457
~ "Death to the teachers"?!
~ No, the profiteers!

617
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:56,988
Let's go tell that to Mr. Director.

618
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:07,115
Seldom have I seen something so shameful!

619
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:10,311
I will not spare you, my young friend.

620
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,723
What punishment do you propose, Mr. Bouillon brouileur... ...er...?

621
00:55:14,786 --> 00:55:18,890
300 times: "I can not write outrageous things,...

622
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:21,124
"the buildings belonging to the school,...

623
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,633
"education and leading me to providing service to the Republic."

624
00:55:26,962 --> 00:55:29,179
As far as "school" seems sufficient.

625
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:33,690
And don't leave school until you've handed it in!

626
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,477
Understood, little friend?

627
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,721
Do you want a go, Ma'am?

628
00:55:53,342 --> 00:55:55,892
I'll try it, it looks like fun!

629
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,675
~ How much can I bet?
~ 10 francs!

630
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:06,778
~ And on what number?
~ Anything you want.

631
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,271
~ Four, for example.
~ Come on, then, four.

632
00:56:10,684 --> 00:56:13,076
Ten on number four...in it goes!

633
00:56:18,744 --> 00:56:21,196
I won!

634
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:58,895
But...is that everything you did in one hour?

635
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:10,674
Like this.

636
00:57:34,547 --> 00:57:36,583
But where is she?

637
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:46,192
~ Honey, can you tie this?
~ I'm tied up myself!

638
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:49,200
I spent the whole day slaving in the kitchen and now she's not here.

639
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:50,941
Where is she?

640
00:57:55,064 --> 00:57:56,916
~ Calm down...
~ Why calm, tell me that?

641
00:57:57,147 --> 00:57:59,461
The Moucheboumes are almost here, and I have no one to serve!

642
00:57:59,718 --> 00:58:01,168
Ah, there she is.

643
00:58:03,778 --> 00:58:08,047
Here, put that in back in the trash...! Hup hup hup!

644
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:14,073
~ What's this?
~ That's "Homard à la mayonnaise".

645
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:19,040
This is great for guests, but you get delicious ravioli!

646
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:22,951
~ I don't want it, I want lobster.
~ Nicolas, stop it!

647
00:58:26,288 --> 00:58:28,342
But where is she now, that klutz!

648
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:36,370
~ Good evening Mr. Moucheboume!
~ Good evening, Madam.

649
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:38,801
My wife isn't here?

650
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,743
I had sent her on ahead, while I parked the car!

651
00:58:42,988 --> 00:58:43,673
She's disappeared.

652
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:52,912
Oh, Mrs. Moucheboume! What a mistake, sorry!

653
00:58:53,713 --> 00:58:58,662
Come with me...We are all...

654
00:59:07,382 --> 00:59:08,464
Nicolas, go get your dad.

655
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:20,708
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Moucheboume.

656
00:59:21,022 --> 00:59:23,299
Ah! Here's the famous Nicolas!

657
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,233
Are you happy with your humming top?

658
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:28,208
You bet! But Dad does not want me playing with it,...

659
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,871
because the bitch makes such a racket.

660
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,387
The next time I'll give you something else.

661
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:34,532
What would you like?

662
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,931
If you could give me 500 francs, that would be super.

663
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:43,577
What would you do with 500 francs?

664
00:59:44,744 --> 00:59:46,249
I can only whisper.

665
00:59:49,288 --> 00:59:53,132
I'll get my new brother kidnapped, so my parents don't throw me away.

666
00:59:59,354 --> 01:00:05,313
Nicolas, listen, if you want to earn money, you must work hard.

667
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,521
You'll have the money then.

668
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,560
If you give it to me now, I'll thank you immediately.

669
01:00:11,202 --> 01:00:12,507
Nicolas, go to the kitchen!

670
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:16,380
Oh, he's just a child.

671
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:20,108
~ I told them goodbye.
~ Very well, here.

672
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:24,521
And you can start eating.

673
01:00:43,421 --> 01:00:45,923
Do you fancy Scandinavian literature, Mrs. Moucheboume?

674
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,508
Personally, I prefer poetry from the 13th century.

675
01:00:52,062 --> 01:00:56,678
Replacing the personal pronoun, a metaphor...

676
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,383
That is very interesting.

677
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,000
Erm...

678
01:01:07,849 --> 01:01:09,962
I have a particular weakness for...
Snorrie-verses.

679
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:12,311
Snurkie-Snuf...

680
01:01:13,366 --> 01:01:16,886
Mustache... ...Storkie Stor-sleeve.

681
01:01:18,122 --> 01:01:19,611
Smeurkiestuf

682
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,752
Did you know that the word "baroque" comes from Portugal?

683
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,659
The city Barocco, known for its oysters.

684
01:01:37,981 --> 01:01:40,898
And by Luly and the chocolate with the same name.

685
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:58,052
~ Are we hungry?
~ Yes!

686
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,096
It will be a simple meal.

687
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:04,365
That's lucky. I hate people...

688
01:02:04,783 --> 01:02:06,582
who try to impress us with things like,...

689
01:02:06,582 --> 01:02:08,524
"Homard à la mayonnaise".

690
01:02:11,036 --> 01:02:12,655
One small moment...

691
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:30,567
Voilà!

692
01:03:04,229 --> 01:03:07,302
"WELCOME TO THE MINISTER"

693
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:14,401
We can sing in the streets!

694
01:03:14,632 --> 01:03:16,519
Or sell things on the street!

695
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:20,623
No, we have to find something quickly --- it's a lot of  money.

696
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,262
Wait! My dad told me how he became rich!

697
01:03:24,236 --> 01:03:28,153
He found an apple on the street, and sold for 1 franc.

698
01:03:28,612 --> 01:03:29,071
And then?

699
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,970
With the franc, he bought 2 apples, which he sold for 2 francs.

700
01:03:32,157 --> 01:03:32,468
And then?

701
01:03:33,538 --> 01:03:35,520
Then his aunt died, and he got all her money.

702
01:03:36,823 --> 01:03:37,711
And then?

703
01:03:38,503 --> 01:03:39,722
Guys, the girl is back!

704
01:03:54,395 --> 01:03:55,062
There they are!

705
01:03:57,313 --> 01:03:58,969
I want exemplary behavior.

706
01:03:59,452 --> 01:04:01,617
The first one who gives kicks up gets a life sentence.

707
01:04:01,936 --> 01:04:03,124
Is that clear?

708
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:10,454
OK, good.

709
01:04:28,018 --> 01:04:29,344
Sit, children.

710
01:04:35,232 --> 01:04:40,834
Say, how is your school? Well?

711
01:04:43,718 --> 01:04:45,770
They need to relax, these children.

712
01:04:47,272 --> 01:04:50,910
I have a riddle for you. Listen up.

713
01:04:51,168 --> 01:04:57,143
What is yellow, very small, and it says krok krok.

714
01:05:02,456 --> 01:05:05,648
A chick that eats chips.

715
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:19,484
~ What have you learned this year?
~ Rivers.

716
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:25,644
~ I'll try that.
~ Well, just stand up, Agnan.

717
01:05:25,644 --> 01:05:29,739
No, the boy in back.

718
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:36,661
~ What's your name, boy?
~ Clotaire, Sir.

719
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,703
Well. Say...

720
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:42,898
Which river flows through Paris?

721
01:05:50,732 --> 01:05:54,619
I think...the river, which flows through Paris.

722
01:06:09,164 --> 01:06:11,523
"Have you ever been with your parents on a boat before?"

723
01:06:21,471 --> 01:06:22,437
The Seine.

724
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:34,382
Good, Clotaire!

725
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:38,064
Was it a tough question?

726
01:06:44,697 --> 01:06:45,858
How are the negotiations going?

727
01:06:46,493 --> 01:06:47,302
I would stand firm.

728
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,541
And about what percentage are we talking?

729
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,378
Minimum 10.

730
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:53,061
Draft a summary for me of the file.

731
01:06:58,872 --> 01:07:00,647
~ Hello?
~ It's me.

732
01:07:01,134 --> 01:07:03,530
Did Mr. Moucheboume say anything about the food?

733
01:07:14,252 --> 01:07:17,429
I know how to get the money together! Look!

734
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,334
Hey, Guys, are you, like, invincible?

735
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,400
What are you talking about?

736
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:56,407
Come to the swampy vacant lot --- you know it!

737
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:03,585
OK, then?

738
01:08:04,058 --> 01:08:06,233
We have the formula of this potion!

739
01:08:08,605 --> 01:08:10,669
Drink it, and you'll get really strong!

740
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:12,381
It costs 5 francs.

741
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,098
And how do we know it works?

742
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,457
You there. Come here.

743
01:08:35,287 --> 01:08:38,340
And now go push on that bus.

744
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:37,900
~ Next! Pay first.

745
01:09:42,218 --> 01:09:42,949
Paid.

746
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:59,770
~ Do we have enough?
~ We might just.

747
01:10:19,702 --> 01:10:22,752
All together, then...

748
01:10:24,482 --> 01:10:25,794
530 francs!

749
01:10:27,111 --> 01:10:30,352
What have you done with my son?

750
01:10:31,684 --> 01:10:33,081
I want to talk to your parents!

751
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:35,230
Bunch of crooks!

752
01:10:39,622 --> 01:10:44,153
You guys are in for a hiding!

753
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,474
We have money for the cleanup chore.

754
01:10:56,803 --> 01:11:01,017
~ Well, where is the car?
~ Uh, we'll call you back.

755
01:11:02,431 --> 01:11:04,028
Now he wants us to have a car!

756
01:11:25,747 --> 01:11:26,993
What flavor, sir?

757
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:31,889
~ Pardon?
~ Strawberry-Chocolate!

758
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:33,113
Very well, sir.

759
01:11:50,447 --> 01:11:52,243
The others are waiting at the telephone.

760
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:56,834
~ What?
~ I don't know how to drive.

761
01:11:57,312 --> 01:11:59,678
~ You have to use the key.
~ He took it with him!

762
01:11:59,891 --> 01:12:01,724
Then you have to jump the cables.

763
01:12:01,724 --> 01:12:03,210
I remember that from a movie.

764
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:36,187
Turning: reasonable. Maneuver in the city: moderate.

765
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:39,508
Let's see how you park.

766
01:12:41,882 --> 01:12:43,157
Let's head down town.

767
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:51,983
Come on, follow that car!

768
01:12:52,519 --> 01:12:55,555
Faster, come on, pedal to the metal!

769
01:13:11,879 --> 01:13:13,642
Go down there!

770
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:21,777
I need a confidant in this company.

771
01:13:22,477 --> 01:13:24,160
You know, I don't plan to live forever.

772
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,523
I must think of a successor.

773
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:28,747
Look out!

774
01:13:34,696 --> 01:13:37,592
Say, good thing you were there.

775
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:42,238
By the way, what do you think about internationalization?

776
01:13:43,033 --> 01:13:44,642
You can not deny Europe.

777
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:46,892
Exactly, I think that now.

778
01:13:47,364 --> 01:13:48,371
~ But...
~ Shut up.

779
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,719
Parking is also OK.

780
01:14:23,394 --> 01:14:24,200
Thank you.

781
01:14:47,103 --> 01:14:48,654
Your ideas never work out!

782
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,481
Will we get to the phone in time?

783
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,635
I don't know.

784
01:14:56,677 --> 01:14:59,481
~ Huh?
~ How did we end up here?

785
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,816
~ Hi, I would like to talk with Francis Leborgne.

786
01:15:07,157 --> 01:15:08,198
I'll hang on.

787
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:13,220
~ Hey, that's Joaquim!
~ Hey, Guys!

788
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,461
But...you're not gone?!

789
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:19,221
No, I only had the chickenpox.

790
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,419
See, here's my brother. Look how nice he is!

791
01:15:27,531 --> 01:15:29,564
Don't touch him or he'll get sick.

792
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:31,300
Babies are very sensitive.

793
01:15:34,533 --> 01:15:36,117
Hear that, he said my name!

794
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,419
But you didn't want a brother!

795
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:39,835
No, but that was before.

796
01:15:40,342 --> 01:15:41,364
Why?

797
01:15:41,742 --> 01:15:44,280
Before I knew it was super being a big brother.

798
01:15:44,508 --> 01:15:46,881
I can teach him all sorts of great things.

799
01:15:47,352 --> 01:15:48,814
Soccer, or cycling.

800
01:15:49,364 --> 01:15:50,976
And I will always be an example.

801
01:15:51,358 --> 01:15:54,123
"At your age, Joachim could already..."

802
01:15:54,571 --> 01:15:56,188
And he will be super impressed.

803
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,218
I can give him orders, and he'll do what I want.

804
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:03,270
Well, bye, Guys.

805
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:17,974
Yes? Hello? Hello!

806
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:24,542
I'm never going to drive a car again in my entire life!

807
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,947
~ But you got your license!
~ NEVER!

808
01:16:28,976 --> 01:16:30,581
Mommy! Daddy!

809
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:32,893
Thanks. I'm so happy!

810
01:16:33,183 --> 01:16:34,168
Why, Baby?

811
01:16:34,168 --> 01:16:36,394
~ I'm going to have a brother!
~ What did you say, Nicolas?

812
01:16:36,394 --> 01:16:39,259
~ What brother?
~ The baby that Mom gets!

813
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:45,101
You're not getting a brother --- how did you get that idea?

814
01:16:46,092 --> 01:16:49,506
But...I want a brother!

815
01:16:50,109 --> 01:16:51,609
That would be great, a little brother.

816
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:54,987
Why can't I have one?

817
01:16:56,931 --> 01:16:59,045
You never get me anything!

818
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:52,782
That evening, my parents went overboard continuing with their jokes.

819
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:56,624
One day, when I came home,...

820
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:05,015
they had big news to tell me.

821
01:19:07,425 --> 01:19:09,283
I do not know how long it takes,...

822
01:19:09,606 --> 01:19:13,107
but a baby takes longer than waiting for Christmas.

823
01:19:13,781 --> 01:19:16,098
~ Day after tomorrow, then?
~ Afraid not.

824
01:19:18,478 --> 01:19:21,763
Life was back to the old ways.

825
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:28,512
Geoffroy was in trouble for stealing the car.

826
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:33,532
Now he must walk to school.

827
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:37,462
I saw Marie-Edwige again.

828
01:19:37,462 --> 01:19:39,085
They invited me to her birthday.

829
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:43,797
Thursday? I'm busy then, but I'll make time on Friday.

830
01:19:45,289 --> 01:19:47,417
Somehow that didn't sound right...

831
01:19:51,247 --> 01:19:52,864
And we got a new neighbor.

832
01:19:54,484 --> 01:19:58,383
Dad and he have been bickering, too.

833
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:04,354
And I keep on waiting...

834
01:20:04,753 --> 01:20:05,906
~ Tomorrow?
~ No.

835
01:20:06,517 --> 01:20:07,583
But soon.

836
01:20:07,952 --> 01:20:11,347
I could not wait to teach my brother things.

837
01:20:25,193 --> 01:20:26,312
And then one morning...

838
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:29,155
We all went to the hospital.

839
01:20:31,074 --> 01:20:33,111
And then my little brother finally arrived.

840
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:37,305
~ It's a girl!
~ WHAT?

841
01:20:39,482 --> 01:20:40,677
Well, give it a kick!

842
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:49,401
Look!

843
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,356
She's so sweet, a real angel!

844
01:20:58,722 --> 01:21:01,262
She looks exactly like her father.

845
01:21:01,581 --> 01:21:03,603
No, she's the spitting image of her mother.

846
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,450
And Nicolas, are you happy with your sister?

847
01:21:15,123 --> 01:21:15,944
Hard to say.

848
01:21:17,574 --> 01:21:20,611
She is not finished yet, they still  have to install the hair and teeth.

849
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:23,112
~ But she's cute anyway?
~ Cute?

850
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,081
She's bright red and wrinkled like roasted peppers.

851
01:21:28,247 --> 01:21:31,407
She sees nothing with her eyes, but she's mastered drooling.

852
01:21:32,378 --> 01:21:36,406
Everyone says she laughs, but she's just blowing bubbles.

853
01:21:39,365 --> 01:21:43,092
I wanted a brother, but Mom had that there instead.

854
01:21:43,685 --> 01:21:44,812
I'm not sure why.

855
01:21:47,242 --> 01:21:51,528
She looks like a shaved cat.

856
01:21:54,724 --> 01:21:58,008
If I had known, I'd have asked for a dog instead.

857
01:22:07,019 --> 01:22:14,131
It's crazy, but at that moment I knew what my essay should be on.

858
01:22:28,136 --> 01:22:29,779
What did I want to do when I grew up?

859
01:22:30,065 --> 01:22:31,741
Make people laugh.

860
01:22:39,656 --> 01:22:42,254
Look at me. Look at me.
