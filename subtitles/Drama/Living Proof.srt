1
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,450
- Dr. Slamon? Hi.
- Hello.

2
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,223
It's Jamie MacGraw. Work-Study sent me.

3
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,128
My student assistant. Right, right.
I'm right up here on the left.

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,998
- Okay.
- Come on in.

5
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,898
- What are you, biology, chem?
- No. English lit.

6
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,739
- You're not a science major?
- No.

7
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,477
- No offense...
- Jamie.

8
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:55,505
Jamie. Right.
But I'm doing scientific research here,

9
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,212
and I kind of need an assistant
who understands what I do.

10
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:06,386
Well, this wasn't my first choice, either,
and no science majors wanted this job.

11
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,053
- What? None?
- No.

12
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,732
Well, tell me you at least
read science fiction.

13
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,073
Dr. Slamon's office, I mean, lab.

14
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:26,377
Jamie. Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Slamon.
Hold on.

15
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,446
- Here.
- Hi.

16
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:34,245
No, I didn't forget. 6:30 at the latest, right?
Okay. Me, too. Bye-bye.

17
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,224
Could you hand me that splicer
over there, please?

18
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,124
No, no, no, to the left, to the left.
Left, left, left, left.

19
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:45,029
- Right there. Thank you very much.
- Well, thanks anyway.

20
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,531
You know what?
I don't really need a science major.

21
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,595
I just need someone to handle my calls,
do the paperwork.

22
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,836
Whatever it takes so I can concentrate
on my patients and HER-2.

23
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:55,932
HER-2?

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,379
Yeah, it's a growth gene I'm using to try
and create a drug to treat breast cancer.

25
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:04,646
- Like chemo?
- No. No, no, no. It's nothing like chemo.

26
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:08,519
See, chemotherapy works
on the principle of killing cancer cells,

27
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:13,390
and almost the patient, with poison and just
hoping the new cells grow back cancer-free.

28
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,553
That doesn't make sense to me.

29
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,063
What I'm trying to do
is something that's never been done before.

30
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,565
Take a sort of super-protein from the body

31
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,035
and target the bad cells
and turn them off like a light switch.

32
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,938
It won't cure the cancer,
but it'll shut it off, which is almost as good.

33
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,670
- That sounds really...
- Crazy. Right, I know.

34
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:33,874
Everyone says that, but it's not.
If we can learn how to shut the bad cells off,

35
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,109
that will lead us to a cure.

36
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,984
And, just so you know,

37
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,850
I'm not gonna remember your birthday,
or National Assistants' Day.

38
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,653
Not because I don't try or
because I don't want to. Hold this, please.

39
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,784
I just won't.

40
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,124
And I'm gonna constantly be after you
to stay late and come early,

41
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,289
even if I can't pay you on time.

42
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,923
You are trying to talk me
into this job, right?

43
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,262
Yes. But I want to be clear.

44
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,498
200,000 women a year
are diagnosed with breast cancer.

45
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,235
Getting HER-2 to work
could save a lot of those lives.

46
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,936
200,000 a year?

47
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,047
Grams is here!

48
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,320
- Good morning, Samuel.
- You're going to sleep in my room.

49
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,847
Well. It's a very small bed for two people.

50
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,224
I'm going to sleep with my mom.

51
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:26,329
- Hi, Mom. Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course, dear.

52
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:31,171
Although, why Charlie chose to go
on the road this particular week,

53
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,599
and why you wouldn't come
and stay at my house remains a mystery.

54
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,567
You do still have a room there, you know?

55
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,479
I want to be home. So does Sam.
Could we not go over this again?

56
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:46,179
I was merely pointing out that
it would be less stressful for all of us,

57
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:52,386
you, especially, to be in a house
that has adequate space and amenities,

58
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,528
like air conditioning.

59
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,631
This will be fine.
I'll just put my things away.

60
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:07,106
And you, young man, should do the same
with that bicycle of yours.

61
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,843
Why does she have to be here?

62
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,543
Because she's my mother
and your grandmother.

63
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,520
And next to you and Daddy,
she's all I've got.

64
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,527
Oh, Kate, I love that you put that up there.

65
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,353
It's official.
Your own shop on Melrose Avenue.

66
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,564
I can't believe it. I'm a real designer.

67
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:40,903
You've been a designer. The only difference
is that now you're a designer with overhead.

68
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,505
Chartreuse, what was I thinking?

69
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,573
- Kate, if nobody buys anything...
- That's not gonna happen.

70
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,515
So, get over here and make a toast.

71
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:55,613
- We got to commemorate the day.
- You don't miss a beat. Champagne?

72
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,825
- A good year, too.
- What are we going to toast to? Let's see...

73
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,327
I got it.

74
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,761
- To good friends...
- Yes.

75
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,859
- Hard work and to kicking some retail ass.
- Amen, sister.

76
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,033
It's official. You make
the best cup of coffee in the world.

77
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,600
- Yeah. You say that every day.
- I mean it every day.

78
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,643
- You decided about summer school?
- Someone else can teach it.

79
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,414
I'm going to spend the summer
sleeping in and getting fat.

80
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,720
And cleaning out the sun room
for my studio.

81
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,387
Finally. With your talent you should
be making art instead of teaching it.

82
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,010
Lilly. What are you doing here?

83
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,311
I need an excuse to say hello?

84
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,952
- This is your lab? This little room?
- I know. The janitor's closet's bigger.

85
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:06,483
But the chances of him curing cancer
are slim to none, so I got him there.

86
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,791
Lilly Tartikoff, old friend,
Jamie MacGraw, new assistant.

87
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,230
- Hi.
- Hello.

88
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,200
How's Brandon? Is he okay?

89
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,465
A star, who shall remain nameless,
is giving him indigestion,

90
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,201
and the Dodgers are in a slump.
But other than that, he's fine.

91
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,833
How's Donna? I owe her a call.

92
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,970
She's good.
When you call her, say hi for me.

93
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,446
Poor Donna.

94
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:31,349
At least I can tell my husband he has to
come home. It's not like he's curing cancer.

95
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,819
Here, don't say I never gave you anything.

96
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,753
That is every episode of <i>Hill Street Blues,</i>

97
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,087
which you always miss
because you're always here.

98
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,217
You've got to be kidding me.

99
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,785
Being married to the president
of NBC Entertainment has its perks.

100
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,593
You didn't have to do this.
Thank you so much.

101
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,396
You saved my husband's life. Thank you.

102
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,202
I'm sorry, but I promised Donna
I would get him out on time,

103
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,937
- and we still have our rounds.
- Good for you. Keep on him.

104
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:01,237
And you, lives need to be saved.
Get back to work.

105
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,304
- Bye.
- Bye.

106
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,317
Bye, Lilly. Thank you.

107
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,853
All right.
You heard her, let's get back to work.

108
00:08:55,568 --> 00:09:00,165
- I'm sorry. I was trying not to wake you.
- That was thoughtful.

109
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,975
But I couldn't sleep after you promised to be
home five hours ago and never showed up.

110
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,535
The specimen refrigerator broke and...

111
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,013
- I am so not done.
- I'm sorry.

112
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,742
An hour-long recital.

113
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,516
I reminded you today, yesterday.
I even put Jamie on the case.

114
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,716
- I did everything but drive you there myself.
- I had to do the transfer myself.

115
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,351
- Your daughter was expecting you.
- There was no one I could call.

116
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,827
It's my work. If anything happened,

117
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,387
- I'd have to start all over.
- Start all over. I know.

118
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,434
I knew when I married you what I was in for.

119
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,230
But they just want their daddy there.

120
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,905
Not every time. But sometimes.

121
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,034
- I'll make it up to her on Sunday.
- That would be good.

122
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,280
Okay. I'm officially over it.

123
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,251
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,126
Because you know
I'm going to kiss you now.

125
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,769
You smell good.

126
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,134
You, wow, not so good.

127
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,642
So, how was she?

128
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:16,344
Honestly, she was the best sunflower
I think I've ever seen.

129
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,278
You know why? She gets that from you.

130
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,280
You weren't really waiting up for me,
were you?

131
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,258
No, I fell asleep reading.

132
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,420
And no offense,
but I really want to get back.

133
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,964
Then you won't mind if I go for a run?

134
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,363
'Cause I'm not gonna have time
in the morning.

135
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,801
- Yeah. That's not gonna happen.
- So not happening?

136
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,936
Okay. I didn't want to run anyway.

137
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,445
- You've done that a thousand times.
- Well, that's what science is.

138
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,006
But what exactly are you doing?

139
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,679
- I showed you the plan.
- No. You didn't.

140
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,955
That's the plan. Step one is discovery.
That's a one-in-a-million shot

141
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,222
linking the HER-2 protein
with cell growth in breast tissue.

142
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,092
I did that right here in this lab.

143
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,689
Step two is to create a drug from HER-2.

144
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,132
That's where we are right now.
I'm doing some of that work right here.

145
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,794
And they're doing the rest up at Genentech.

146
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,360
- And that's a drug company.
- Right.

147
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,635
- It's a biotech company up in the Bay Area.
- And biotech is...

148
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,973
Is looking for medicines
based on molecular biology.

149
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,275
Step three is the Mouse Protein Experiment.

150
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,180
I'll explain more about that
when we get a little bit closer.

151
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,811
Steps four, five and six
are the FDA clinical drug trials,

152
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,219
to see if the drug works
and how well it works.

153
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,056
Which would lead us to Step seven,
the Holy Grail, our drug is approved.

154
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,405
Hey, Blake. Blake.
You're not going to believe this new data.

155
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:51,069
I was trying to catch you before you got
on the plane. I've got some bad news.

156
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,010
Okay. How much are they cutting our budget
this time?

157
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,607
I'm sorry, Denny. The board has
decided not to continue with HER-2.

158
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,776
You did not just say that.

159
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,615
They think cancer research
just carries too much risk.

160
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,851
What? They're just deciding that now?
We spent six years on this!

161
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,358
Yeah. And they've been dragging their feet
every step of the way.

162
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,726
We're getting close. You know we are.
The board knows it, too.

163
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,923
Try to see their perspective.

164
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,024
Continuing will cost millions of dollars
and the drug might not work.

165
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
But it might!

166
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,595
- Take a look at the new data.
- I'm a believer based on the old data.

167
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,606
It's a hard pill, Denny,
but you got to swallow.

168
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,802
We can't stop.
Not until we know what we have.

169
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,533
- Dinner's ready.
- I need to finish.

170
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,203
What's going on?
You haven't said two words all day.

171
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,399
Genentech is dropping HER-2.

172
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,070
- So you'll take it to another drug company.
- I can't.

173
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,339
Genentech owns the rights.

174
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,847
- But you developed the drug.
- It doesn't matter, okay?

175
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,975
I did it using one of their genes,
so it belongs to them.

176
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:09,011
Honey, you have been in this position
before and you always work it out.

177
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,650
Really not in the mood
to be cheered up right now. Okay?

178
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,528
I don't care.

179
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:22,158
I don't. It's Sunday,
the one day of the week that's ours.

180
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,436
And on Sunday, I don't care about cancer,
HER-2 or Genentech.

181
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,601
Just our family.
That was our deal from day one.

182
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:36,310
So, stop feeling sorry for yourself,

183
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,220
put a smile on that cute face,
and come in for dinner.

184
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,559
Daddy!

185
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,582
You're just in time
for the 10:00 tune-up special.

186
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,977
Well, if I were staying, I'd take you up on it.

187
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,114
You should stay. It's his first birthday.

188
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,091
We can have another cake
at dinner tomorrow.

189
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,617
A yard full of screaming children
is not my cup of tea.

190
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,063
Come on, it'll be fun.
I hardly get a chance to see you.

191
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:30,399
- Really? And that's something you want?
- Just as much as you do.

192
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:38,138
- If she's sleeping, just let her.
- Sleeping? This hour?

193
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:42,371
She's tired. Taking care of two boys
is a lot of work, you know.

194
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,908
You mean three.

195
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,815
Yeah.

196
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,457
Your film looks fine. Lie down, please.

197
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,163
Lift your left arm.

198
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,432
Have you noticed any lumps
or anything unusual since your last visit?

199
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,029
- No.
- Right arm.

200
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,541
Are you doing your weekly self-exams?

201
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,600
- Like clockwork.
- Good.

202
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,168
You're fine. See you in six months.

203
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,381
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, to you, too.

204
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,127
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,325
I've been paging you and paging you.
You need to jump on a plane.

206
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,164
- Blake called and he said it's urgent.
- Good urgent? Bad urgent?

207
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,067
He wouldn't say. But it's gotta be good.

208
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,163
You're right.
I've got the smallest budget at UCLA,

209
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,437
the smallest lab and no Genentech money.
How could it be worse?

210
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,411
It's gonna be good. You're due.
See you soon.

211
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,175
I don't believe it! How in the world
did you get the board to change its mind?

212
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,210
- Oh, simple. Just committed career suicide.
- You committed what?

213
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,151
I can devote 20% of my time
to any project I want.

214
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:03,227
I chose HER-2.
It did not go over very well, believe me.

215
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,198
And if we screw this up,
I'm pretty sure I'll be free to leave.

216
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,063
We won't screw it up.

217
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,565
God help me for believing in you and this.
I'd sleep a lot better at night if I didn't.

218
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,871
But listen, you're going to have to take
that lead foot of yours off the gas.

219
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,105
We're going to have
a lot less lab time and money.

220
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,771
- Got it.
- I'm serious.

221
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,681
However slow it's going now,
ratchet that down by half.

222
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,413
You know what? It really doesn't matter.
I mean, we're still in the game, right?

223
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,423
Which is more than we could say
two days ago.

224
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,854
Realistically, though,
how soon till we get a bigger budget?

225
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,886
Get out. Get out.
Put the globe back and get out.

226
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,733
So, did you decide on the teaching job?

227
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:48,639
I'm too busy around here. The paycheck
would have been nice, though.

228
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,201
- Come on. You're a doctor's wife.
- A university doctor.

229
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,838
He gets a teacher's paycheck.
I'm not complaining.

230
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,612
It's just we're going to have to win
the lottery when it comes time for college.

231
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:03,054
Well, if you do win and you need
a bad influence, I know just the stores.

232
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,025
Maybe one spree.
I'd give the rest to Denny for his research.

233
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,325
No. Let Genentech pay for that.

234
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:13,958
I can't count on them. They're constantly
threatening to cut his funding.

235
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,764
But he's trying to cure cancer.
Who wouldn't support that?

236
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,203
Well, if they get behind the drug and it fails,

237
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,731
it could bankrupt the whole company.
They're terrified.

238
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,280
- Well, he never said anything to me.
- You know Denny.

239
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,441
He could break his arm
and you wouldn't know it.

240
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,584
He's really suffering.

241
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,825
- Don't say anything.
- I won't.

242
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,866
I've made a decision.
I'm going to raise money for your research.

243
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,375
You're going to what?

244
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,536
Last night
I was sitting in my Beverly Hills home,

245
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,046
with my wonderful husband
and my beautiful daughter,

246
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,481
and I was suddenly overwhelmed
with how much I've been given.

247
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,453
I need to start giving back.
And I'm going to do it through you.

248
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,821
Very, very generous of you, Lilly,
but I can't let you do that.

249
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:15,453
You need the money.
What, you're going to cure cancer in here?

250
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,555
Lilly, the fact that you would even think
about doing something like that for me

251
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,725
means more than I can say.

252
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,565
But I can't let you do that. We're friends.

253
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,332
Are you kidding me?

254
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,272
You spent
I don't know how many days and nights

255
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,833
away from Donna and the kids
with Brandon's chemo

256
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,277
and helping me get through it.

257
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,441
You saved him. That makes us
more than friends, Denny. We're family.

258
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,485
Yes. Which is why I can't take your money.

259
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,612
It's not going to be my money.
I'm going to raise it.

260
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,553
- No.
- No?

261
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,918
Look, Mr. "I Don't Care if I Work
in the Smallest Lab in the Universe,"

262
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,828
I'm offering you money for your research.

263
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,193
Now, if you don't want it, I'll go find
some other deserving doctor who does.

264
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,034
Great. Now can we be done
with this conversation?

265
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,038
You absolutely stink at accepting gifts.

266
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,004
Get over it!

267
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:10,277
You're this close to losing HER-2 because
some executives are running scared.

268
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:16,311
Well, screw them. The cavalry is here.
And you are going to have your own money.

269
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,618
It's a promise.

270
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,325
Goodbye.

271
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,207
Brandon, good to see you.

272
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,543
Hi.

273
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,355
Thank you very much.

274
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:01,791
- Wow, Brandon knows everyone.
- Yes, and if he doesn't, they know him.

275
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,304
But don't worry.
He'll be here before the appetizers.

276
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,467
- Is that an actor?
- No. Better. That's Ron Perelman.

277
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,672
- Who?
- Who?

278
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,406
He's one of the richest men in America.
He owns Revlon.

279
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,012
I'll be back in two minutes. Hopefully five.

280
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,093
- Ron Perelman?
- Yes?

281
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,495
We haven't officially met. I'm Lilly Tartikoff.

282
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,158
So you're Lilly. Is Brandon with you?

283
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,735
Almost. He's making his way to the table.
I thought I would take a minute to say hello.

284
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,204
Well, I'm glad you did.

285
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,434
These are my friends,
Peter and Bindy Hawn.

286
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,477
Lilly is on our Products Advisory Board

287
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:48,412
and for the past two years has been sending
me suggestions for our ad campaign.

288
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:52,942
I used to be on that board. But I don't recall
anyone ever sending in a suggestion.

289
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,578
No one did. Until Lilly.

290
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,656
Ask for my opinion, you're going to get it.

291
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,055
I don't want to take your time.
I wanted to ask a favor.

292
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,567
- Of course.
- Do you see the man at that table there?

293
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,298
That's Dr. Dennis Slamon.

294
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,806
He's on the verge
of discovering something very important.

295
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,708
It's a new kind of drug for breast cancer.
And he needs money.

296
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,238
I'm sure he does,

297
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,614
but this is neither the time
nor the place to discuss it.

298
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,950
All I want
is a chance to tell you about his work.

299
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:35,126
Call my office. We'll discuss it over lunch.

300
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,990
HER-2 is a growth gene that controls the...

301
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,660
- The...
- Growth of cells.

302
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,971
Give me that. Give it to me.
You don't need that.

303
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,976
Have you been here the last two hours?
I'm not a memorizer.

304
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,411
Well, I don't want you to memorize it.
I want you to understand the concept.

305
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,941
- Lilly, just be conversational.
- No one is more conversational than I am.

306
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:03,854
But this is the Revlon Foundation Board.
I get one shot to get you more money.

307
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:07,690
- I have to know what I'm saying.
- What you're saying is very simple.

308
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,059
HER-2 is a gene
that controls the growth of cells

309
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,155
in the breast tissue of a third of all women.

310
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:15,030
And when those women get breast cancer,
it's a very aggressive form.

311
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,537
And there's no treatment available,
not even chemo.

312
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:22,041
So most of them will die.
But if my drug is successful,

313
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:26,101
it's going to offer hope to these women
for the first time, saving 40,000 lives a year.

314
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,738
That's enough to fill the Rose Bowl
every other year.

315
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:33,419
Maybe if we gave you some lipstick
and a wig...

316
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,013
Lilly, you'll be fine. Just tell them
that I'm at a make-it-or-break-it point.

317
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,149
If I had more money,
I could do the work more quickly.

318
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,251
And if the drug works, and I think it will,

319
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:44,161
we can get it approved
and on the market five to six years faster.

320
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,668
Six years times 40,000 is
a quarter million lives potentially saved.

321
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,801
By Revlon.

322
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,864
Okay?

323
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,472
Okay. Once more, from the top.

324
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,720
Andy, just the man I wanted to see.

325
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,848
Denny, you know I'm a believer in HER-2
and one of your biggest supporters.

326
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,416
- But the answer is no.
- I haven't asked you anything yet.

327
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,122
Have you ever asked me
for anything besides more money?

328
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,528
Last week I asked you about your dog.

329
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,532
Right before you hit me up
for more equipment.

330
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,034
- Which I still need, by the way.
- And which you're not going to get.

331
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,331
That's not your call, Reinhart.

332
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,805
No. But I was in the meeting
and half the board members agree with me.

333
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,206
An antibody approach to cancer
is never going to work,

334
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:33,610
which makes HER-2
a terrific waste of time and money.

335
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,204
So half of them agree with me?

336
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,513
Wow. You see,
I thought it was way less than that.

337
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,643
Thanks for the encouragement, Carl.

338
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,947
We're late.
I promise next time we'll talk, okay?

339
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,017
I'll be back on Thursday.

340
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,189
You're going to be glad you kept this going.
You'll see.

341
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,333
You'll see.

342
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:00,635
- Matt spilled his cereal on Daddy.
- I did not.

343
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,369
How many times have I told you
not to play at the table?

344
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,741
A hundred.

345
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,542
- Could we please not fight?
- Two hundred.

346
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:15,783
That was Lilly.
She just finished the meeting at Revlon.

347
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,423
She did it.

348
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,222
You mean Ron Perelman said yes?

349
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,522
- Yeah.
- Honey, that's great!

350
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,597
How much is he gonna give you?
$50,000? 100,000?

351
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,172
No. $2.4 million.

352
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,738
It's the biggest amount ever given
to a researcher without restrictions.

353
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,408
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

354
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,580
Wait. You're sure?

355
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,185
They're just giving it to you?
There are no strings attached?

356
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,424
Lilly has to throw a fundraiser
every year to make more.

357
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,165
- More money?
- More money.

358
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,970
Nicole, sweetheart. It's me. Mom.

359
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,597
Where's Charlie?

360
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,666
He's downstairs
taking care of the paperwork.

361
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,338
The biopsy was malignant.

362
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:17,042
I know. I know, sweetheart.
But you're going to be fine.

363
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,516
Mom.

364
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,180
You just sleep now, sweetheart.

365
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:25,020
And when you wake up,
we'll get good news.

366
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,493
Mom.

367
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:34,196
Don't worry. I'll be right here
waiting for you. Charlie, too.

368
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,032
Lie down, please. Lift your left arm.

369
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,213
- Hello to you, too.
- Sit up, please.

370
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:55,645
The film shows a fast-growing mass
in your left breast.

371
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,122
From the looks of it, it's cancer.

372
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,855
- But I was just here six months ago.
- As I said, it's fast-growing.

373
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,656
How old was your mother
when she was diagnosed?

374
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,562
- 30.
- And you are?

375
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,028
30.

376
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,566
I'm referring you to an oncologist,
Dr. Banks.

377
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,170
Well, if it is cancer, what are my options?

378
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,644
Mastectomy, radiation, chemotherapy,
whatever Dr. Banks prescribes.

379
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,220
But that's what they gave my mom
15 years ago and she died.

380
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,657
They don't work for everyone.
But they're still the standard of care.

381
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:40,863
- There's got to be something else.
- Not yet. Good luck.

382
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,895
Honey, come in here.

383
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,896
What's up, baby?

384
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,608
I found a lump in my breast.

385
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,511
Are you sure?

386
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,744
- Yes, it's cancer.
- You don't know that.

387
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,983
Yes, I do.

388
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,656
Lilly, Lilly.

389
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,634
- This is surreal.
- I passed surreal a long time ago.

390
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,473
Good to see you both.

391
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:02,845
- Thank you for this.
- Tonight is just the beginning.

392
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,152
Hi.

393
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,558
- Hi.
- Hi.

394
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,256
Can you believe it? Everybody came.

395
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,459
I've been sick to my stomach
for five months worrying that they wouldn't.

396
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,731
- You look beautiful.
- You both look like movie stars.

397
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,827
Thank you.

398
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,669
Okay. I've got to work the room.
I will see you at the table.

399
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,072
- Great.
- Okay.

400
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:34,208
And tonight is making us $400,000 more,

401
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,043
so that ought to keep you in test tubes
a bit longer.

402
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,447
- And get you a bigger lab.
- Wow!

403
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,714
I'll see you. Hi.

404
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,760
I just got to say,
I'm really stoked to be working here.

405
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,594
- That's great.
- When does the HER-2 trial start?

406
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,830
After we do the Mouse Protein Test, which
we're waiting for Genentech to approve.

407
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,599
Mouse protein?

408
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,767
HER-2 is a protein and they grow it in mice
because it's illegal to grow in humans.

409
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,243
And mouse protein
is the most like human tissue.

410
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,715
So it adds another step, because
they have to test to make sure it's safe.

411
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,341
What if Genentech says you can't test it?

412
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,319
They won't. I'll be back at 2:00.

413
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:21,822
Don't mind him. We've just been
waiting to hear for six months.

414
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,198
If they say no, then it's over.

415
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,566
Could you go next door
and get the boys, please?

416
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,199
I was hoping we could have a cup of tea.

417
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:41,205
Maybe in the backyard. It's such
a beautiful day. Not too hot, not too cold.

418
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,984
- Okay. That would be nice.
- Excellent. You sit down. I'll get it.

419
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:57,090
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be silly.

420
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,389
How hard is it to make a pot of tea?

421
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,859
- That you're gonna lose someone again.
- I am not losing you.

422
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,038
I think it would be easier for everyone

423
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,476
if we just accept it
and enjoy the time we have left.

424
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,579
Oh, yes, by all means.
Let's take the easy way out.

425
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,414
It's just your life we're talking about.

426
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:26,015
- Since when did I raise a quitter?
- I have stage-four cancer, Mom.

427
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,886
We haven't run out of doctors yet.

428
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,267
No, we haven't.

429
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,705
Just tell me we're beyond the "K's," right?

430
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,270
- We're well into the "M's."
- Okay, good.

431
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,273
I'm going to go change and...

432
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,940
- Cream or lemon?
- I think it's cream today.

433
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,676
I hate chemo. I hate chemo.

434
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,141
<i>Your mom's on line two.</i>

435
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,182
Hey, Mom, what's up?

436
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,331
Hey, what's up?

437
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:27,241
I've been behind you and Denny for
a long time, so I'm going to ask you flat out.

438
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,305
Are we ready to take HER-2 to the next step?

439
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,950
100%.

440
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,755
Okay. I'm approving
the Mouse Protein study.

441
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:43,694
Call Slamon and give him the go-ahead.
Tell him he needs to hurry.

442
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,365
He'll be ready, Andy. Believe me.

443
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,628
Hey, you okay?

444
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,733
My mother was just diagnosed
with breast cancer.

445
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,442
I'm sorry.

446
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,251
Did you get Ricky to sleep?

447
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,320
Listen to this.

448
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,992
"UCLA is looking for volunteers
with advanced cancer

449
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,263
"to test an experimental drug."

450
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,833
It says to call a Dr. Slamon.

451
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,103
There's no harm in calling.

452
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,877
You do qualify for the study.

453
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,949
And I know your time is very, very precious,

454
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,149
so I want to thank you
for giving a week of it to me.

455
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,660
I'd be lying if I didn't tell you
I'm hoping for a miracle.

456
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,697
Hope is a good thing. I do it all the time.

457
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,001
I want you to remember
that this is only a test

458
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,799
to see if the drug that was grown in mice
can be tolerated by people.

459
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,067
Now, that means
I can only give you one dose.

460
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,236
But if it works like I think it will,
it might give you a little bit more time.

461
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:09,645
And we're talking about
the time you have left.

462
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,151
So I want you to take a day or two
and think about it.

463
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:18,117
And whatever you decide,
is the right decision. Okay?

464
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,857
I don't need to think about it.

465
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:31,899
Good morning, everyone.
Today is a historic day.

466
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,898
We're here to do something
that has never been done before.

467
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,809
To inject a drug that was grown
in mouse protein into people

468
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:40,971
to see if it's safe.

469
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,982
I have every faith
that it will not harm you in any way.

470
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:48,885
And hopefully, if the drug works
like I think it will, it'll give you more time.

471
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,848
- Good morning, Nicole.
- Good morning.

472
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,459
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

473
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,150
Congratulations. You just made history.

474
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,888
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

475
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,200
We've got a reaction. Nicole Wilson.

476
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,581
Miss Mouse Ears.

477
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,554
You just finished the Mouse Protein Test
four months ago.

478
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,121
In corporate time that's like five minutes.

479
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,064
Yeah. That's just long enough
for them to forget about us.

480
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,933
We have to start the Phase One Trial.
They have to say yes.

481
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,303
Truth? I think most of them wish
they'd never heard of you or HER-2.

482
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,501
Yeah? Tell me something I don't know.

483
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,005
- Hello.
- Denny, nice to see you.

484
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,639
Unnecessary. We have everything we need
to make our decision.

485
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:27,174
I just want to remind you
of a couple of things first.

486
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,450
HER-2 is the most promising drug
this company has ever seen.

487
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,291
I stood right here and I did something
that has never been done before.

488
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,456
I shrank a cancer tumor
with six drops of our drug.

489
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,399
No poison, no chemo. Just the antibody.

490
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:48,004
Well, it's a big leap from shrinking a tumor
in a dish to curing cancer, Doctor.

491
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,641
This isn't a cure. It's a treatment to shrink
cancer tumors and make them inactive.

492
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,680
Which is better than chemo and radiation
because it has no side effects.

493
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:58,148
I wish we could know without
an official study that the drug will work.

494
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,118
But if we test it and have a bad result,

495
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:04,122
it will be the Interferon disaster
all over again.

496
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:07,591
It's the only cancer drug we ever developed
and it almost ruined us.

497
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,252
You developed that
based on no hard evidence.

498
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,923
I have shown you real data.
Real data that HER-2 can work.

499
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,193
We can't base our decision
just on the science.

500
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,394
We have a responsibility to the company.

501
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:22,169
And spending millions on HER-2 means we
aren't spending it on more promising drugs.

502
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,076
When you put all the pieces together,
the potential downside is just too severe.

503
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,980
Well, clearly, you don't have anyone
with cancer in your life.

504
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:36,750
How lucky for you. Well, I do.

505
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:42,222
I speak to cancer patients
and their families every day,

506
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,922
and I hope for their sake that one day
there's a better treatment out there

507
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,626
than the current slash and burn
that exists at the moment!

508
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,640
When I was a kid,
I watched a doctor save my father's life

509
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,836
and I knew in that moment
that I wanted to do what he did

510
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,209
because when you save someone's life,
you're not just saving them,

511
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,009
you're saving everyone around them.

512
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:06,449
And now, when I look into a woman's eyes
and tell her that her cancer is terminal

513
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,010
and she tells me,
"What other treatments are available?"

514
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,613
and I tell her, "We don't have any,"

515
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,520
I know that we do.

516
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:20,898
- But you don't know HER-2 will work.
- I do know! I know!

517
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,829
Don't throw this chance away!

518
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:27,031
Maybe you've been sitting
behind a desk for too long.

519
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,506
Maybe I've been on the front lines
longer than I should have,

520
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:32,510
but for God's sake, don't forget who we are!

521
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,480
We're not businessmen.

522
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,278
We're doctors.

523
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,186
Approve the Phase One Trial.

524
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,198
- You guys are fast.
- We could still use some help.

525
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,606
I was working on my masterpiece.

526
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,439
You look beautiful.

527
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:13,679
Not too bad for someone who wasn't
supposed to make it till Christmas, huh?

528
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,883
- Let's put this right in the middle.
- Like that.

529
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,890
That's us!

530
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,931
So pretty.

531
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,548
What are you doing?

532
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,553
Loving you.

533
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:56,558
- But, Mom, I've got soccer.
- Mother's prerogative.

534
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:18,575
- Ellie?
- Hi. Do I know you?

535
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,615
- I'm Josh.
- Thank you.

536
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,553
- I'm meeting a friend.
- Yeah, me.

537
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,793
- Kate set us up.
- Oh, gosh.

538
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:37,634
- Look, I'm sorry. I don't date.
- You do eat?

539
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:43,068
- Look, Josh...
- We're here, so why not?

540
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:46,077
We'll eat fast. We don't even have to talk.

541
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,716
The cancer is back. I'm scheduling
another round of chemotherapy.

542
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,879
No.

543
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,387
No more chemo. We've decided.

544
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,989
It's a quality of life issue.

545
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,659
I understand. I'm very sorry.

546
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,429
There is an outside chance.

547
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,474
A colleague is going to be testing
an experimental drug.

548
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,737
I'd like to send your slides.

549
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,909
Whatever.

550
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:28,319
Hey. I've been waiting for you.
I got some news. The board voted yes.

551
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,855
- We're moving to Phase One?
- Yeah, but there's trouble.

552
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:33,482
- They put Reinhart in charge.
- Reinhart?

553
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,221
Why? He doesn't even believe in HER-2.

554
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,193
- But you know what, a go is a go, so...
- Let me finish, Denny.

555
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,962
He's bringing in these so-called
"thought leaders" to head the study.

556
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,527
- He's not including you.
- But it's my study.

557
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,574
It's Genentech's study
and they put Reinhart in charge.

558
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,439
I'm sorry. I went to bat for you,
but it's his call.

559
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,076
Hang on a second.
You have to change his mind.

560
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,740
They want superstars,

561
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,547
breast cancer specialists who've run
these big clinical tests before. You haven't.

562
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,647
Come on. You need me.
This isn't just me protecting my turf here.

563
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:09,155
This is me
protecting everything we've worked for.

564
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,698
There are three arms of the study.
San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles.

565
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,166
I'll go back to him,
see if I can get him to give you LA.

566
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:19,170
I've already set up a network of doctors
who're gonna refer their patients to me,

567
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:22,071
- so tell him that.
- Keep screening for participants.

568
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,041
I'll see what I can do.

569
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,440
- Hello.
- Barbara Bradfield?

570
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,111
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Yes, this is Dr. Slamon at UCLA.

571
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,916
I'd like to talk to you
about joining the HER-2 Trial.

572
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,616
What's HER-2?

573
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,251
<i>It's an experimental drug.</i>
<i>Dr. Brown sent me your slides.</i>

574
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,488
Right.

575
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:49,393
<i>Thanks, but we're leaving in the morning</i>
<i>for Mexico. I'm trying a food cure.</i>

576
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,961
- All due respect...
<i>- I'm not expecting a cure,</i>

577
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,063
just some quality time with my family.

578
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,674
Ms. Bradfield, if you'd just delay
your trip for a day I think I can...

579
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,679
Does this trial involve chemo?

580
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,840
- Some, yes.
<i>- I'm not interested.</i>

581
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:10,583
I refuse to die bald and throwing up.
Good luck with your study.

582
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:14,592
Good luck to you, too.

583
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:22,162
- Slamon.
- You're back in.

584
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,929
- LA is yours.
- Reinhardt signed off?

585
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,870
Yeah. Now, go home and get some rest.
You're going to need it.

586
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,938
Yes! Yes!

587
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:35,072
- Once again, Blake saves the day.
- Oh, God.

588
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,882
I owe him big time.

589
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,684
- How was your day?
- Good.

590
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:47,815
- Did you find anyone?
- One woman, best candidate I've ever seen.

591
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,352
She's not interested, though.
Going to Mexico for a food cure.

592
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,128
- There's a misnomer for you.
- Did you talk to her?

593
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,965
As much as I could.
She's looking at the end of her life,

594
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,596
so how she spends that time is her call.

595
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,699
But, you know, I can't get over the feeling
I might be able to help her.

596
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,904
And selfishly, it's bad for the study
because I get 15 women

597
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,279
and I need to make them all count.
So, I don't know.

598
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,178
Hey.

599
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,527
It's not always gonna be like this,
these crazy hours.

600
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:28,029
Yes, it will. But that's okay.

601
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,262
We just miss you.

602
00:44:56,961 --> 00:45:00,022
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Barbara, this is Dr. Slamon.</i>

603
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:04,159
I'm sorry to be calling this early.
Barbara, don't go to Mexico.

604
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,636
It's a death sentence.

605
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,770
<i>I think I can save your life.</i>

606
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,036
- They're all here.
- All 15?

607
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,768
All 15. So, as we say in show business,

608
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,935
- break a leg.
- I'll see you out there.

609
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:57,872
No. I have another ball to plan.
You can take this from here.

610
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:03,854
Hey, Lilly. I just wanted to say,
you know, without you, this would...

611
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:08,451
Thank you.
I really mean it. Thank you so much.

612
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,192
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

613
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,325
Welcome to the Phase One kickoff party.

614
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,667
- I'm very happy to see all of you.
- Not as happy as we are to see you.

615
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,138
So, the drug you'll be taking
finally has a name,

616
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,838
Herceptin, which is a combination
of "Her" from HER-2,

617
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:31,041
and "ceptin" from intercept,
which is what the drug is designed to do,

618
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:34,517
to intercept growth signals
from reaching the cancer cells

619
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,384
so they don't grow.
It's pretty simple when you think about it.

620
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,914
Now, for the next three months,
we'll be meeting here every Tuesday at 9:00

621
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,189
for the infusion
and a checkup to monitor your progress.

622
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,560
First two weeks,
you'll be receiving cisplatin,

623
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,724
a traditional chemotherapy drug.

624
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,995
Every third week, you'll get the Herceptin.

625
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,469
Now, since cisplatin is a chemotherapy,

626
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,507
you'll have the traditional side effects
like fatigue and nausea.

627
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:59,942
But on the weeks you receive the Herceptin,
you'll feel great.

628
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,239
No side effects.

629
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:05,147
Finally, I want to thank all of you
so much for coming here.

630
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:11,051
I appreciate your hope and your belief
and your sacrifice.

631
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:15,057
- Thank you.
- I don't take that lightly.

632
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,257
Okay, any questions before we begin?

633
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,197
Yeah, I do. Just one.

634
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,769
I hope everybody here is hungry.

635
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:34,710
I know. The baker was gay,
so he hadn't seen boobs in a while.

636
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:40,307
My nipples aren't black like that.
Well, they're not.

637
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,112
Dr. Slamon.

638
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:13,377
I'm late for a consult.
You'll have to call my office.

639
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,386
Please. I drove three hours to see you.

640
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,354
You'll have to make an appointment.
I'm sorry.

641
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:22,257
My daughter participated in the
Mouse Protein Experiment, Nicole Wilson?

642
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,489
Nicole, right. Miss Mouse Ears.
She was the very first one.

643
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:29,864
Yes, exactly. Well, her doctor
told us you're testing your new drug.

644
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,630
- Right.
- I'd like you to include her.

645
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,399
Believe me, I would if I could,
but she just doesn't meet the criteria.

646
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,407
Well, nonsense.

647
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,808
She's a perfect candidate.
One shot kept her alive for two years.

648
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:40,970
- I'm sorry, Miss...
- Aldredge.

649
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,605
Ms. Aldredge, right. But the eligibility
requirements are very strict.

650
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,173
Well, then don't put her in it.
Just give her the drug.

651
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,311
The FDA accounts for every dose.
I'm very sorry.

652
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:53,482
My daughter is dying!
You have the power to save her.

653
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,887
I don't.

654
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,955
I'm sorry, Mrs. Aldredge. I do understand
what you're going through, but...

655
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,557
Have you lost a child, Dr. Slamon?

656
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:09,001
Then don't presume to know
what I'm going through.

657
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:16,745
I promised my husband as he lay dying
that I would take care of our little girl.

658
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,677
For 24 years, I have kept that promise,

659
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,016
and you will not stand in my way
of keeping it now.

660
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,084
I can't help you.

661
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:30,394
Then get your superior
out here immediately.

662
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:34,023
There is no superior.
It's my study and I don't have a choice.

663
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:37,398
If I break the rules,
they're going to shut it down.

664
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:42,697
She's only 28. She has two little boys.

665
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,607
She's all I've got, Dr. Slamon.

666
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,844
Please don't take her from me.

667
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,948
Please help me. I can't lose her, too.

668
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,918
Dr. Slamon, we need you right now, sir.

669
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,320
I'm very sorry.

670
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:37,886
Hey.

671
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:41,694
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

672
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,869
Will you show me that picture
that you drew for me?

673
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:52,203
I just really want to see it.

674
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,978
Okay, Daddy.

675
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,048
You know, Barbara,
maybe this week will be better.

676
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,250
Maybe the chemo won't make you so sick.

677
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,021
Well, that would be nice,
but I don't think it's in the cards.

678
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,359
Hey. You never know.

679
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,796
If I could just get home, I wouldn't care.

680
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,428
Really? You don't like puking your guts out
into your purse at the mall?

681
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,063
Must you be so graphic?

682
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,598
Well, I'm just being real.
I mean, that's really what it is, right?

683
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:29,374
I mean, nothing's more real than this,
this and puking.

684
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,046
And it really does just cut through
all the crap.

685
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:38,647
Yeah, well, next week will be better.
We get the Herceptin. No side effects.

686
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,319
No, I am so ready.

687
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,129
Do you hear that, cancer?
You're going down.

688
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,330
You make this all worthwhile.

689
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,063
Sorry.

690
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,806
- Hold on a sec.
- What? Well, what are you doing?

691
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,982
It's been months. I want to see you.

692
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,847
You want to see a scar? You're a freak.

693
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:17,523
I love every inch of you,
including the breast that isn't there.

694
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:22,958
Sex with me in the dark,

695
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,264
or sex by yourself with the light on,
your choice.

696
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,312
How about a flashlight?

697
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,377
- Come here.
- Come here.

698
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,293
- Does that hurt?
- No.

699
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:00,169
I just, I don't know, like looking at it.

700
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:03,740
Just reminds you that you're sick.

701
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,770
I don't need a stinking tumor
to remind me that I'm sick.

702
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:12,249
Let's think good thoughts today, Tish.
Positive energy creates healing.

703
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:19,148
Wow. Is that what I've been doing wrong
my whole life?

704
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,824
Tina, do you have an herb for that
with some aromatherapy?

705
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,062
No, but we could do
some guided meditation.

706
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,531
That's just too complicated for me.

707
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,830
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

708
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:32,927
Okay, so after two weeks of chemo,

709
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,904
who's ready
for their first dose of Herceptin?

710
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,065
- I am!
- Me!

711
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,599
- Okay. All right, let's start with you, Sally.
- Sally?

712
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,206
- How's that cough?
- It's almost gone.

713
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,714
That's good.

714
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,319
- It's yellow.
- All right.

715
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,390
I'm gonna get more than you.

716
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:07,526
Hey, Dr. Slamon. It's Fran Visco,

717
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,869
President of
the National Breast Cancer Coalition.

718
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,034
Yeah, I remember you. You gave me a grant.

719
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,943
You were one of the very few.
Hey, do you mind walking?

720
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,504
- I have a patient.
- Oh, not at all.

721
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:21,279
Wow, you have a good memory.
That was over eight years ago.

722
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,115
You know, I've been getting a lot of calls,

723
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:29,593
and I know you can't really speak about it,
but how's Phase One going?

724
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,719
A lot of calls?

725
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:34,959
Yeah, the breast cancer community
is very tight-knit, and so they talk.

726
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:38,093
- Off the record, it's going well.
- So there will be a Phase Two?

727
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,228
Off the record, yes.

728
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:44,002
Good. Before you start
planning Phase Three, call me.

729
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,475
You're gonna need
a perspective that those scientists

730
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,035
who haven't been through that cancer mill
don't have themselves.

731
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,546
Thank you, Fran. And I will call you.

732
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:54,016
So, I bought this
to boost our immune systems.

733
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:59,387
You mix it once a day in hot water,
and you drink it down, just like tea.

734
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,687
- What is it?
- Dried sea horses.

735
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,324
- Sally's late again.
- Forget the cancer. This'll kill me right here.

736
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,791
You know,
I know I'm always joking with you,

737
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:14,238
but I swear to God, your tumor has shrunk.

738
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,604
- It has, hasn't it? It is, right?
- It has.

739
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:19,233
- Let me see. Let me see.
- Look.

740
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,744
Oh, my God. It's shrunk!

741
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:27,781
Now, Tina, I know you didn't
have time to leave the hospital

742
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:31,083
and go find some sea horses. What is this?

743
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,682
I mean, that came out of the back of a dog.
No, it did.

744
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,129
Sally passed away this morning.

745
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:46,335
Not from the drug,
but as a result of her advanced cancer.

746
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,932
Carol will be in to get you started.

747
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,993
- I'm all right.
- It wasn't your fault.

748
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,358
Her death, no.

749
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:22,194
- What happens next, though, that's all me.
- What's all you?

750
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,834
I put them all in one room,
so they wouldn't feel alone.

751
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:30,173
Now they'll know when one of them dies.
Great planning.

752
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:34,618
- You couldn't have known.
- But I should have.

753
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,720
Every single one of them
has stage-four cancer.

754
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:42,488
Some of them are lucky to be alive.
I chose the room, the chairs, the program.

755
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:49,294
I just spent so much time
trying to get it right.

756
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,426
You didn't know. Next time you will.

757
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,939
Tell that to the women
who are looking at the empty chair.

758
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,896
Kate! Turn down the music.

759
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,967
What are you doing here?

760
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,171
I was in the neighborhood,

761
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,744
thought I'd fall by,
see if you want to go to Vegas this weekend.

762
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:15,683
And while we're there,

763
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,088
get married.

764
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,152
- Ellie.
- Josh.

765
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:29,430
I told you,
marriage is about happily ever after,

766
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:33,698
- and I don't know that that applies to me.
- Maybe the cancer's gone.

767
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:38,801
Not the cancer, my cancer.
And, yes, it's gone,

768
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:42,702
- but it can come back.
- If it does, we'll deal with it.

769
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:51,418
I love you, baby, but I can't marry you.

770
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:04,857
- You really mean that.
- But it doesn't change anything.

771
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:12,607
For you. Me, I want a future.

772
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,781
No matter how long that might be.

773
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:37,432
I know it's bad news
or you would have told me on the phone.

774
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:40,399
Well, actually, the news is good.

775
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,099
Your response to the Herceptin
is more successful

776
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,074
than I ever thought possible.

777
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,943
It not only stopped your tumor
from growing, Barbara,

778
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,878
it made it disappear.

779
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,684
- My tumor's gone?
- Your tumor's gone.

780
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:00,622
Now, you still have cancer,

781
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,889
but this is an exceptional result,
amazing, even.

782
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:18,501
I'm sorry, I was...

783
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,905
I was expecting the worst.

784
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,872
Well, it's nice to get
some good news for a change.

785
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,042
Yeah.

786
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,219
Now, here's where we are.
We're almost done with Phase One,

787
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:32,620
and I'm inviting you
to continue treatment in Phase Two.

788
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,022
- Whatever you say, I'm there.
- Good.

789
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,654
Now, you're gonna have to sit tight
for about six weeks until we begin.

790
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:43,131
- But I'll still be getting my Herceptin?
- No.

791
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,969
I can't give it outside of the study.

792
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,303
That's FDA rules.
We have to apply to begin Phase Two.

793
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,138
Don't worry, now. It's just a formality.

794
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,707
What if my tumor comes back?

795
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:59,511
If it does, I don't think
it's gonna grow fast enough to be a danger.

796
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:03,782
And once you start the Herceptin again,
it'll shrink. It'll be fine.

797
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,257
I have to ask you not to tell the others.

798
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:15,287
Not all of them
are gonna be continuing to Phase Two.

799
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:20,194
- Who's not coming?
- I need to tell them first.

800
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:22,903
Yeah.

801
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,336
Yeah, of course.

802
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:33,441
Fresh from my garden. Echinacea, for colds.

803
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:36,419
- Works like a charm.
- Thank you.

804
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:42,756
I know I'm here for my official results,
but I already know.

805
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:48,021
- Dr. Slamon, I feel so much stronger.
- You are doing better.

806
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:52,928
But?

807
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,497
I'm sorry, Tina.

808
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,634
You won't be moving on to Phase Two.

809
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:04,271
Not moving on?

810
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:08,113
But you said last week I was improving.

811
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,720
And you are.

812
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:16,254
But for the study, for its ultimate success,

813
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,287
I've been given
a set of standards by the FDA.

814
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,458
I need to narrow the group down

815
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:28,665
to the ones who are having
the most clear and measurable response.

816
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:33,335
That's me. I've gained weight,
and I'm not in pain at all anymore.

817
01:03:33,777 --> 01:03:36,110
- You can see that.
- I know that.

818
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:41,782
But the goal, and we talked about this,

819
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,945
has been to get Herceptin approved.

820
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:51,618
Now, in my heart,
I want you to continue, Tina.

821
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:54,927
But in science,
it comes down to the numbers.

822
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:58,025
And for the next phase,

823
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:01,594
and I'm sorry, but your numbers,
they're not high enough.

824
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,937
Please. Please, Dr. Slamon.

825
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:10,537
I have three children and a husband.

826
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:17,879
Look, we'll pay whatever it costs,
and nobody has to know.

827
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:22,025
I wish I could do that.

828
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,457
I can't.

829
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,637
I've never begged for anything in my life.

830
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,304
But I'm begging you, Doctor, for my life.

831
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:47,011
I'm sorry, for you,

832
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,546
for your family, I'm sorry.

833
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:05,764
Sorry. How many... How many lucky ones?

834
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,597
Five.

835
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,103
Well, I am happy for them.

836
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,375
Thank you, Doctor.

837
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,636
- How could you do that?
- It's part of my job.

838
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,832
You just sent her home to die.

839
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,141
That's how it works.

840
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,745
- That's not fair.
- No, it's not.

841
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:59,120
- That's not right.
- It's not a question of right or wrong.

842
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:06,253
I don't think I can do this anymore.

843
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,924
But we will.

844
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,873
We have to stop meeting like this.

845
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,182
- Fran, what are you doing here?
- I was speaking to a group of nurses.

846
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:07,190
And you? Yeah, that's right. You work here.

847
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:10,694
Hey. You were supposed to call me
about Phase Three.

848
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,094
And I will, as soon as I hear
that we're moving on.

849
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:17,292
- We just finished Phase Two.
- Six months ago.

850
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,802
I told you. I'm watching. I'm listening.

851
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,135
Trust me.
When I get the go-ahead, I will call you.

852
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,368
I don't want to be notified.
I want to be involved.

853
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:28,502
- I hear you loud and clear.
- Okay. Call.

854
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,843
- Do I have a deal?
- We have a deal.

855
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:32,678
- Call! Okay.
- I will.

856
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,178
I called you five times.
When were you gonna call me back?

857
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,689
When I had an answer.
You just called me yesterday.

858
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,658
Yeah, and last week
and the week before that,

859
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,387
and the month before that,
and five months before that!

860
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,655
When are we gonna start Phase Three?

861
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:49,187
When Reinhart is done designing it
and when the board decides to pay for it,

862
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:52,565
<i>- which at this point is not a sure thing.</i>
- That is ridiculous.

863
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,867
Herceptin works.
We proved it in Phase One and Phase Two.

864
01:07:55,939 --> 01:07:57,237
Why do I sound like a broken record here?

865
01:07:57,307 --> 01:08:01,267
Yes, Denny, One and Two were successful,
but we still have not proven anything!

866
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:04,610
That is what Phase Three is for.
Acceptable clinical proof!

867
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,173
- That's my point!
<i>- Don't yell at me!</i>

868
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:11,512
Then get the board off its overly-cautious
ass and get us the go-ahead.

869
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,181
You know what, don't lecture me, either.

870
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,952
I'm not lecturing you, Blake.

871
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:19,689
For crying out loud, how many times
do we have to go through this? I have...

872
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,962
Barbara and Dean are waiting.

873
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,371
Sorry I'm late.

874
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:44,051
I feel good. Please don't tell me I'm not.

875
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,552
You're cancer-free.

876
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,252
What?

877
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,886
There's not one sign of cancer in your body.

878
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,625
- None.
- How?

879
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:59,032
Part of it's the Herceptin.
The rest, I don't know.

880
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:02,232
- But the cancer's still there...
- Barbara...

881
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,864
- it only takes one cell.
- You're cancer-free.

882
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,172
I read the results myself,
and I made them retest.

883
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,346
Cancer-free.

884
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:14,474
Cancer-free.

885
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,179
Free of cancer!

886
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,283
Cancer-free!

887
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:32,399
All I wanted to hear were those words,
and I never thought I would!

888
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,267
And now I don't know what to do!

889
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,696
What do I do?

890
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:43,709
Well, to be honest, all of the other women
responded like I thought they would,

891
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:47,649
they improved,
but your cancer's gone, completely.

892
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:53,355
So, as for what I would do, just be grateful.

893
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:59,989
And by the way,
you don't have to come here anymore.

894
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:03,762
Except to say hello.

895
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:21,174
- Do you think she misses us?
- I know she does.

896
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,319
Just like we miss her.

897
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:28,590
- Can I put it on the tree?
- I was just going to ask.

898
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:40,569
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

899
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:43,071
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

900
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:45,671
Merry Christmas, Mom.

901
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,942
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

902
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:10,629
I'm sorry. After four years of remission,
your cancer is back.

903
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:14,729
The cancer has spread
to your lymph nodes and your liver.

904
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:18,706
You'll need to get your affairs in order.

905
01:11:20,243 --> 01:11:26,547
Wow. People actually say that.
"Get your affairs in order."

906
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,889
How long do I have?

907
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,423
Four months, maybe five.

908
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,924
How about chemo?

909
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,469
You've run that course. I'm sorry.

910
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:56,135
You mean to tell me,
in this world-class research hospital,

911
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:59,776
that's my only option? How can that be?

912
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:04,451
Well, there is one possibility.
It's a Phase Three Trial

913
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:09,521
and if approved, it'll start soon,
but you have to be HER-2 positive.

914
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:12,494
- Am I?
- I don't know.

915
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:15,758
But we'll find out.

916
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,433
- Carl.
- My afternoon's all booked.

917
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,306
I'll make it fast. I just have a few ideas
about the trial design.

918
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,504
You've never designed a drug trial before.

919
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,549
No, but I know more
about Herceptin than anyone.

920
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:33,947
Yeah, thank you. I've got this under control.

921
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,781
Come on, Carl. Please, just hear me out.

922
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:42,182
To be honest, Denny,
I don't want or need your input.

923
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,588
Look. I am the one
who's been in the trenches,

924
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:51,031
trying to find the women that you need
to enroll in your mess of a trial,

925
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,262
but I can't because your requirements
are too strict.

926
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:55,271
- In your opinion.
- It's not just me.

927
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:58,502
Ask your "thought leaders." You are
running Phase Three into the ground!

928
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,475
- We're done here.
- Okay.

929
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,275
- If we could just simplify...
- I said we're done!

930
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:07,215
When is the last time you told a patient
she was going to die?

931
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:13,821
Monica Stein. Cindy Lopez. Jane Hart.
Sarah, Joan, Linda.

932
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,450
Those are just the women
that I had to tell this week!

933
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:19,723
All of them are HER-2 positive,
and all of them were excluded from the trial

934
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:22,424
because they've all had
one too many courses of chemo!

935
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,093
Well, it shouldn't make a difference!

936
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,062
They should be eligible.

937
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,995
Is there room in there for two?

938
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:58,734
As long as you don't flip me over
like last time.

939
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,861
O ye of little faith.

940
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:08,934
There. See? I'm not a total klutz.

941
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,881
It's over.

942
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,144
The trial's gonna fail.

943
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,246
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

944
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,649
Reinhart's design will see to that.

945
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,964
Twelve years.

946
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,593
Twelve years I've been fighting it, for what?

947
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:38,941
A drug company
that just wishes I'd go away?

948
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:45,406
Promises I can't keep to patients
who are counting on me?

949
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,221
All the time I missed

950
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,157
with you and the kids.

951
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,256
All for nothing.

952
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:08,964
You're my long-distance runner.

953
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,845
You know what you're gonna do?

954
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,677
You're gonna go to sleep,

955
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:29,182
and you're gonna wake up,

956
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,424
and you're gonna fight your fight
until you win.

957
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,167
That's who you are.

958
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:10,528
- Hello.
<i>- It took a year and a half,</i>

959
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,227
but we're back on track.

960
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:16,033
- Reinhart has been transferred.
- Wait, who's taking his place?

961
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:17,505
I don't know, but get this,

962
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,873
whoever it is has marching orders
to save the study.

963
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,970
Can you believe it? I'll call you later.

964
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,375
- Yes!
- Yeah, I'm calling to see

965
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:30,943
if I've been approved for the study.

966
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,686
My name's Ellie Jackson. No, I'll wait.

967
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,135
What do you mean,
no one's looked at my paperwork?

968
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:48,398
You've had it for two months.

969
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:53,040
Yes, I know it's July,
but I'm not on vacation.

970
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:59,671
I have to be approved
before the study starts,

971
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:02,343
so that I can start on the first day.

972
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:06,820
Because I don't have that many days left.

973
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,324
Thank you.

974
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:21,833
Okay, I'll cut to the chase.
We're trying to save the Phase Three Trial,

975
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:26,035
and we don't have enough participants,
and we're hoping you can help.

976
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:32,772
So, let's see, I could write a cover letter
and send out the information packets

977
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:34,908
to the 3,000 names on my Rolodex

978
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,853
in exchange for which you'll give me
and another breast cancer advocate

979
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,947
a say in the trial design.

980
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:43,183
Yes.

981
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:46,093
And compassionate access to the drug,

982
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,358
for the women
who do not qualify for the trial.

983
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:51,294
- We'd like to do that, but...
- No buts.

984
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:55,632
There are women out there
with no other medical option,

985
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:59,266
except for an experimental drug,
which does seem to work,

986
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,934
but they can't have access to it.

987
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:05,004
And the FDA allows compassionate access
in Phase Three studies.

988
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,548
Even so, there's a very limited amount
of the drug available.

989
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,143
Make some more.

990
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:15,949
Tumor cell is sort of blanketed
by the HER-2.

991
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:20,292
If you would come up with, kind of,
your top-three priorities, that would help.

992
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:28,329
I don't have one good slide here.
I can't believe that.

993
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:32,605
Come on. Let's go.

994
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:38,040
We got to get more of these out. 16.

995
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:12,171
Hi. I'm here for the Phase Three trial.

996
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:16,610
It took me all summer long,
but I just got approved.

997
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:21,220
Ellie Jackson. Welcome.
We're happy to have you,

998
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,690
except you're early.

999
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,819
I can just go get a cup of coffee.

1000
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:29,422
No, I didn't mean today.
We don't start until next week.

1001
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,698
- That'll be too late.
- It's just a week.

1002
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:39,238
The trial was just approved.
We aren't ready yet. Come back next week.

1003
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:47,979
I have been chasing people

1004
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:51,748
and committees around this hospital
for three months

1005
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:56,121
trying to get approved for this study,
to save my life.

1006
01:19:57,493 --> 01:20:00,827
And every time I manage
to get somebody's attention,

1007
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,267
they can't help me
because they're not ready.

1008
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:11,334
They don't have my paperwork
or they're moving, or they're on vacation,

1009
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:15,611
or they're sitting at home
waiting for the cable guy.

1010
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,409
I get it.

1011
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,012
Life goes on. People have jobs.

1012
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:24,609
Things happen.

1013
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:28,121
Well, cancer happened to me.

1014
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:34,122
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna die.

1015
01:20:34,797 --> 01:20:38,097
Not because there weren't people
here to help me,

1016
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,500
but because they weren't ready.

1017
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,975
I'm dying in front of you right now.

1018
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:52,542
And if you have help to give me,
I need it now.

1019
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,217
I need it right now!

1020
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:01,819
Find Dr. Slamon.

1021
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,394
Thank you.

1022
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,928
Hi, Ellie. Dr. Slamon.

1023
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:19,031
- I'm sorry about the scene out there.
- Don't apologize. Are you kidding?

1024
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:22,272
Do you know how many fits
I've had to throw around here myself?

1025
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,937
It's ridiculous.

1026
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:29,017
All right.

1027
01:21:32,588 --> 01:21:34,113
It's official.

1028
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:38,194
You are the first subject
in Phase Three. Congratulations.

1029
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,752
- Thank you, Dr. Slamon.
- No, Ellie.

1030
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:46,701
Thank you.
Carol's gonna be in shortly, all right?

1031
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,567
- Okay.
- Okay.

1032
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:07,517
<i>Congratulations, runners and walkers,</i>
<i>you are halfway there.</i>

1033
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:12,756
<i>Please visit the water tables,</i>
<i>and we'll see you at the finish line.</i>

1034
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:20,065
- Have you seen Lilly?
- I guess she's around here somewhere.

1035
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:21,501
Dr. Slamon?

1036
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,070
- Hi.
- Hello.

1037
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,200
I just wanted to tell you, thank you.

1038
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:30,405
- Well, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1039
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:34,874
Dr. Slamon. Thank you for fighting for us.

1040
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,682
- All these people know Dad?
- Yeah, and they're thanking him.

1041
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:42,748
- For what?
- Helping them or someone they love.

1042
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:48,020
Dr. Slamon, I just wanted to say thanks
for giving my mom more time.

1043
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,395
- Who's your mom?
- Nicole Wilson.

1044
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:53,998
Well, I think I should be thanking you.

1045
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:57,767
Your mother was the first.
We wouldn't be here without her.

1046
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:05,776
- Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1047
01:23:09,852 --> 01:23:11,252
Hey, buddy.

1048
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,725
- This is Slamon.
<i>- I'm coming down today.</i>

1049
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:20,854
Meet me outside your building at 4:30.
Don't be late.

1050
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,625
Blake, why don't you just
come to my office?

1051
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:24,189
<i>Just be there.</i>

1052
01:23:33,976 --> 01:23:36,707
Look, you're late. I got a plane to catch.

1053
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:41,079
Look, I read all the data last night.
I wanted you to hear it from me.

1054
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,282
- Well?
- Congratulations.

1055
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,721
We proved Herceptin officially works.

1056
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,782
More than anyone ever imagined,
except for you.

1057
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,797
I got to get to DC.
I'm showing the results to the FDA.

1058
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:59,426
- Do you need me to go? I can go.
- Denny, I think I can handle this one.

1059
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:02,596
- Don't tell anyone but Donna.
- What about Lilly?

1060
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,537
And Lilly.

1061
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:07,874
- Good work.
- You, too.

1062
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:19,722
What are you doing home?

1063
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:26,758
- I just saw Blake.
- Did you invite him over for...

1064
01:25:12,975 --> 01:25:14,568
I love you, Mom.

1065
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:09,997
All right! Yeah!

1066
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:13,592
Yeah!

1067
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:26,540
Run!

1068
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:40,920
Yeah!
