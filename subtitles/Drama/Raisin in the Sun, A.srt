2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,700
Your face...

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,630
Did you fight?

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,680
Do I need to tell you?

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,970
The police's work...

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,680
I forgot all about it.

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,280
Lee Eun Soo,

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,390
the men who took away your father's surgery money,

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,720
can you forgvive them?

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,290
Forgive? No.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,620
Those people,

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,800
did you ever get to meet them?

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,190
Yes.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,660
You must've been hurt a lot, too.

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,740
It must've been hard for you.

16
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,420
You're bleeding.

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,430
Don't touch me.

18
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,530
There is nothing that's hurting me.

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,510
I longed to meet them so badly.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,450
Telling myself that I was going to beat them up and trample over them.

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,940
I was so determined.

22
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,760
Then I finally met them.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,660
Meeting them made me feel so relieved and happy.

24
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,450
Why would I hurt?

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,360
It doesn't hurt at all.

26
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,530
You're lying.

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,840
Then why are you crying?

28
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,200
Right now, your eyes,

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,570
they are full of tears.

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,700
Why did you come to this neighborhood?

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,410
Because there's someone I knew.

32
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,240
What about you?

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,940
There's someone I know.

34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,760
<i>Miss.</i>

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,100
<i>Miss?</i>

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,520
<i>It's you right, Miss?</i>

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,290
I'm going now.

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,760
Kang Jae hyung!

39
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,230
Park Kang Jae!

40
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,340
Hey, keep it quiet man.

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,190
Am I your friend?

42
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,970
I'm your sibling you bastard.

43
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,920
What?

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,320
Did you drink?

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,230
How much did you drink?

46
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,710


47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,160
HK sea ..

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,170
Hong Kong whatever...

49
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,910
Paper company or money laundering..

50
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,180
That...

51
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,770
Those are the originals.

52
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,090
I'll give it to you Hyung.

53
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,860
Keep it.

54
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,020
Now that your're drunk, you're being kind?

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,030
Stop being drunk and go to sleep.

56
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,070
It's not that I want to forgive them.

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,640
You don't have to forgive me for hitting you, but

58
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,240
cancel the thing you said to me.

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,990
You're doing so well. (Sarcastically)

60
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,470
I don't want you to forgive me!

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,070
Behind one's back, she does all sorts of things.

62
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,850
In front of you, she acts as though she's innocent.

63
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,100
Do you know how disgusting of a person she is?

64
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,660
Do you know scary that woman is?

65
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,670
Do you know how strange she is?

66
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,150
Do you know how strange she is?

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,210
So,

68
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,530
you take that, Hyung.

69
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,810
Do whatever you want with it.

70
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,420
Hey, you punk.

71
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,490
I'm worried about you.

72
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,010
Hyung.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,710
Kang Jae hyung.

74
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,540
What?

75
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,640
That woman is strange.

76
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,660
What is?

77
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,220
I don't know. It's strange.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,680
Jeong Se Ro,

79
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,110
she says she will curse him.

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,130
She said for him to go to hell.

81
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,980
My grandmother threw water at her.

82
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,820
That woman...

83
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,100
is strange.

84
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,710
<i>Beyond the Clouds
Episode 5</i>

85
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,270
I'm sorry customer but taking pictures are not allowed.

86
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,410
I can't take one of you?

87
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,080
Don't play around.

88
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,040
How are you?

89
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
17 to 1.

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,500
He'll be working on the dealer team starting today.

91
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,120
Glad to be here.

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,930
Aiyoo. It's getting more fun to work here.

93
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,990
Well, the response to Angel's Tear is

94
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,800
as you can see(good).

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,140
Since I started to work here, I have never been so excited.

96
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,060
This is the first time.

97
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,240
What a great ability you have.

98
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,590
He's good at showing off his social skills.

99
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,480
I like showing off those, too.

100
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,730
Han Young Won is...

101
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,590
No, what about the CEO?

102
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,890
That person is...

103
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,210
Lee Eun Soo, right?

104
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,420
We checked for suspicious people,

105
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,470
but that document envelope bothers me.

106
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,830
You said that you received an envelope that day.

107
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,170
<i>Jeong Se Ro</i>

108
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,920
Beside him,

109
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,420
isn't that Secretary Seo?

110
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,770
Well, it may be nothing, but

111
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,680
I thought I had to show you.

112
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,690
Why weren't there any other suspicious people?

113
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,820
Yes. There is no CCTV near the workshop so we can't verify anything there.

114
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,060
There was this footage at the opening hall but we have no other footage.

115
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,300
Ah, now it feels like the real thing.

116
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,530
Did you go in safely last night?

117
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,140
Who are you?

118
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,060
He will be helping me dealing.

119
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,460
I told you I was going to pick my own team members.

120
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,110
I am Hong Kim.

121
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,020
Lee Eun Soo,

122
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,430
can we have a talk with you?

123
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,820
Let's do the greeting later.

124
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,900
Later at 4 o'clock, there is a meeting to discuss new items.

125
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,170
What is this person?

126
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,280
She is cold.

127
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,430
Whatever Young Won knows,

128
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,950
to me,

129
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,650
is it going to be a big problem?

130
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,980
Young Won knew all along what I was doing for you.

131
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,900
Be careful of what you say.

132
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,780
If someone overheard you, they may misunderstand.

133
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,290
I know what you're saying.

134
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,700
Even if she knows,

135
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,470
it just means that I knew of the dirty dealings of the company.

136
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,970
It's the truth. We can't do anything about that.

137
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,590
What if the Chairman hears about this?

138
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,160
Before that happens, we have to elevate Young Joon into the company.

139
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,630
Other than having his son,

140
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,170
I have nothing else to show.

141
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,090
For far too long,

142
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,640
I've been living so pathetically.

143
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,310
It's making me feel bad.

144
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,560
Hanging up.

145
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,760
Lee Eun Soo, can we talk?

146
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,350
CCTV?

147
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,270
The CEO says not to talk about it since it's nothing.

148
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,100
It's not that I think any differently from her, but...

149
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,850
that document you received on the opening day,

150
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,430
we need to find out what that was?

151
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,730
What was it, Lee Eun Soo?

152
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,230
Do you guys keep watch on employees with CCTV?

153
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,770
No, it's nothing like that.

154
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,560
Because it's an important matter to us.

155
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,590
So, what is that important matter?

156
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,050
What is so important that I have to tell you about
every move I make?

157
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,100
Lee Eun Soo...

158
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,630
If you're that curious, go ask the CEO yourself.

159
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,290
I would like the new item to be placed like this sample.

160
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,640
Because of your insistence, we went along, but

161
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,180
isn't it wasteful to cover the diamond with sapphire?

162
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,790
If you want to accentuate the piece, shouldn't we put the diamond on top...

163
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,380
A diamond is a diamond even if you cover it up.

164
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,830
Even inside the sapphire, it sparkles.

165
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,810
It's shining through.

166
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,530
Isn't that so?

167
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,400
I like it.

168
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,280
Sure I like it, too.

169
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,790
But from the business point of view,

170
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,200
about this design;

171
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,640
putting it simply, the customers like big things.

172
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,680
So, jewelry should have a big gem...

173
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,970
Those things are not that important.

174
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,900
It's not a piece to show off how rich you are.

175
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,210
Aren't you the one who should be most against this design?

176
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,640
Can you get the rose cut?

177
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,240
I'll get one.

178
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,010
This is Korea.

179
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,880
Rose cuts are rare enough that you have to use whatever is available in Korea.

180
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,920
How can you get all the pieces only according to what we want?

181
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,590
Trust me to get them,

182
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,780
since we eat out of the same bowl.

183
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,850
You're too confident, right?

184
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,190
Will it be possible in one week?

185
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,780
Yes.

186
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,320
Since Lee Eun Soo is so confident, we can end the meeting here.

187
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,060
Should I look for pink sapphire first?

188
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,430
Or find Jeong Se Ro first?

189
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,490
You asked me at the police station, remember?

190
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,280
To find Jeong Se Ro.

191
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,220
What should I look for first?

192
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,090
CEO Han is testing Lee Eun Soo, am I right?

193
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,960
How can anyone get those within one week?

194
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,260
I don't know.

195
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,670
Whether she is testing Lee Eun Soo or

196
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,970
suspecting Lee Eun Soo.

197
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,460
Suspect him?

198
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,450
Oh, yes. Did you find out anybody who knew Lee Eun Soo?

199
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,800
You know. The Academy alumni.

200
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,770
You said Jeong Se Ro left a single piece of evidence of his whereabouts.

201
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,140
Did you try to look for him?

202
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,850
I couldn't turn you down because you asked me so sincerely.

203
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,490
There are lots of places who look for people.

204
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,930
I'm using them so you don't have to thank me too much.

205
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,820
Where is he? Can they find him?

206
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,760
Before that, I have something to ask you.

207
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,060
I received some documents on the opening day, but

208
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,770
why is Secretary Min interrogating me about that with CCTV footage?

209
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,750
That document...

210
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,860
you were referring to at the police station.

211
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,930
Is there a connection?

212
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,950
<i>Pretending to talk so innocently with that mouth,</i>

213
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,010
<i>you tell me with your own words.</i>

214
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,340
<i>The truth about laundering dirty money,</i>

215
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,230
<i>that you helped.</i>

216
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,390
Secretary Min said unnecessary things.

217
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,260
I don't think so.

218
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,290
You said you found Jeong Se Ro.

219
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,210
If I tell you, then you will tell me about Jeong Se Ro?

220
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,210
You want to make a deal?

221
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,020
I guess so. Where are my manners?

222
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,310
But shouldn't you be thanking me?

223
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,550
Jeong Se Ro is someone I don't have to talk about.

224
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,360
Isn't that true?

225
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,520
He is a graduate of our school, but

226
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,580
we can't show you his information without his consent.

227
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,270
We're not trying to use it for ill purpose.

228
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm sorry. It's regrettable.

229
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,600
I didn't know about this. What can we do?

230
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,450
His criminal record of conning was extensive:

231
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,540
Jeong Se Ro's father.

232
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,510
The ones that I spoke with say that

233
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,870
Jeong Se Ro lived honestly.

234
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,350
I can take a guess as to what Jeong Se Ro was like as a con man's son.

235
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,190
I guess all he learned was being a trash under his criminal parent.

236
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,970
Is there a law that says all criminal children turn out that way?

237
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:30,220
He could have been just a kid who wanted
 to become a doctor or president.

238
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,720
If he didn't steal other kids' money, that might be a relief.

239
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,780
Because of judgemental people like you,

240
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,200
those kids can turn out to be criminals.

241
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,090
Are you saying that I should be sympathetic to Jeong Se Ro?

242
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,530
No.

243
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,740
Aren't you curious?

244
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,000
Who that person might be?

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,070
Why he came to see you?

246
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,250
Isn't it true if you think realistically?

247
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,980
It's not that you framed him for murder.

248
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,520
You didn't put him in prison. But why would he have contacted you?

249
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,150
Looking at it, it seems strange. Isn't it strange to you?

250
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,500
I didn't get mad at you!

251
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,080
Ai, what are you doing? You can't eat the whole thing so why are you ripping them?

252
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,840
To eat it and get indigestion.

253
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,260
Ahjusshi, you are a hippo not a goat.

254
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,740
Pink sapphire.

255
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,160
You want me to get all of these?

256
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,190
Hey! You brought me here to be Lee Eun Soo's shadow(servant)?

257
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,490
Yes.

258
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,300
Instead of Lee Eun Soo, you want me to get the gems?

259
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,690
Of course. Since when were you so naive?

260
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,880
I was too naive.

261
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,200
Just too naive.

262
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,650
How can I get all of these to Korea within this time frame?

263
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,990
If I had this kind of skill, I would have been Lee Eun Soo!

264
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,530
Get it. Get it. Get it!

265
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,000
We can continue our work only if they trust Lee Eun Soo.

266
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,730
You don't know your own importance.

267
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,750
You should have self confidence and not act this way.

268
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,110
Let me hit you just once.

269
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,400
Oh? Why?

270
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,220
I'm bad at expressing my sincerity, but

271
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,950
you are sincerely audacious.

272
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,380
I sincerely want to hit you!

273
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,570
No, wait.

274
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,550
You scoundrel! Scoundrel!

275
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,600
Aw, save me!

276
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,160
We're not late, right?

277
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,580
We should be 5 minutes late to be sassy.

278
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,280
Okay.

279
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,160
Oh, wait a minute, President Park.

280
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,740
Looks good, my leader.

281
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,700
Fooling around? Be attentive.

282
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,830
Didn't we do this before?

283
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,090
These things are bothersome to you.

284
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,230
Then, why did you want to be at a place like this?

285
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,970
What's so good about hotel food?

286
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,620
It's good since it has been a while.

287
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,590
To date also.

288
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,220
What is it that you want? Do you want me to buy you anything?

289
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,210
Young Won's diamond?

290
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,760
Young Won's Belle La Fair.

291
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,110
I didn't want to tell you because you might of given me that expression.

292
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,350
I wish you didn't treat me as an outsider and listen to me.

293
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,810
What?

294
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,360
Young Won already found out everything.

295
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,700
How you are using Belle La Fair.

296
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,450
So?

297
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,890
It will be hard for a good person like Young Won to handle the store.

298
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,220
Do you want to see Young Won be more miserable here?

299
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,350
With Young Won's personality, with your type of work

300
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,640
she may get in your way.

301
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,010
Stop it.
-That money,

302
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,170
if people found out that it's ill gotten money,

303
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,770
Young Won will..
--So I should let Young Joon handle it?

304
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,680
Why talk about it so long?

305
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,670
If we keep going this way, you

306
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,680
and Young Won will end up severing your relationship. It's just a matter of time.

307
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,540
I am not expressing greed.

308
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,650
It's better to give all your assets and leave Belle La Fair to Young Joon.

309
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,110
I don't need anything else.

310
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,640
You're telling me to.

311
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,210
The fact that there's no one else to help you except Young Joon,

312
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,060
why don't you know?

313
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,390
How old is Baek Nam Joo this year?

314
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,280
I met you at 20.

315
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,840
I became 45.

316
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,520
You don't even know my age?

317
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,230
You're still young.

318
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,430
Other people call me

319
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,570
"thief" because you're so young.

320
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,150
You might even feel unfair.

321
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,700
There must be a lot you want to do, too.

322
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,940
But...

323
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,720
since your were in your 20's and

324
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,010
until you became 45,

325
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,040
I think during those days,

326
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,270
with responsibility,

327
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,760
I fulfilled them as much as I could.

328
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,800
It's better to ask to buy flowers.

329
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,380
If you're still the woman that's living with me.

330
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,110
How can we share the same bed when you feel so bad?

331
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,640
The reason why I'm persevering your insults,

332
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,750
is because...

333
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,850
I still like you as a man.

334
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,320
I often think I'm crazy,

335
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,860
but I've always been like this.

336
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,070
Belle La Fair...

337
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,870
wants a fancy colored diamond

338
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,310
rather than a round white diamond.

339
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,320
If in case of a white diamond, we prefer special cut ones.

340
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,120
When fancy colored diamonds become available,

341
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,420
we wish to have the first right.

342
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,560
Of course, it will be handled that way.

343
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,490
What we want is a exclusive distribution outlet.

344
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,510
Exclusivity?

345
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Why exclusivity?

346
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,910
You have to take our items exclusively.

347
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,150
Please proceed.

348
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,610
For 1 year,

349
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,440
you need to keep the promise you guys made.

350
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,270
Our condition is that...

351
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,430
you purchase $100 million/year.

352
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,210
Do you know how much Belle La Fair annual sales are?

353
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,520
It's blue diamonds.

354
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,340
If our Ever Gem Stone,

355
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,520
can continuously get blue diamonds to you,

356
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,100
Belle La Fair's sales...

357
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,260
Wouldn't the profit of Belle La Fair grow a little bigger?

358
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,510
This...

359
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,180
is it a genuine blue diamond?

360
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,890
It is a real blue diamond.

361
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,360
Why do you keep selling blue diamonds?

362
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,180
This is the first time I've seen a blue diamond.

363
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,140
The Angel's Tear is at Belle La Fair.

364
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,590
But that's a historical treasure.

365
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,750
That historical treasure...

366
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,370
You can now make them at Belle La Faire.

367
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,980
I like the words "growing together".

368
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,710
Because of the high quality at Belle La Fair,

369
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,590
we two and President Na would make good partners, I think.

370
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,430
It means we'll grow together.

371
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,560
I think it's best to look for another business partner.

372
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,140
I'm sorry but it's hard to believe.

373
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,120
How long has it been since blue diamonds were cut off,

374
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,550
but how in Korea...

375
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,550
were you able to profit blue diamonds?

376
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,930
Lee YoonSoo.
--Your word are

377
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,880
rather harsh.

378
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,110
Though I'm thankful for the first right,

379
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,590
an exclusive contract...

380
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,860
The risk is too big.

381
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,650
It's also a bit of a burden.

382
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,820
Well, there's not much to say here.

383
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,360
Let's get up then.

384
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,340
Let's go.

385
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,490
It's regrettable for both of us.

386
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,170
Young Won...

387
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,350
What brings you here?

388
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,830
A meeting. This is our father.

389
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,010
Oh, nice to meet you.

390
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,610
EverGem Stone President?

391
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,100
I saw you briefly at the Bella La Fair opening of Angel's Tear.

392
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,570
I remember. The handsome son was with you.

393
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,920
Your memory is really good.

394
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,880
You are the one who helped my daughter.

395
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,720
It's my first time meeting you. I am Park Kang Jae.

396
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,580
If I knew you were staying at the same hotel,

397
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,460
we would have treated you.

398
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,520
Was it something important?

399
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,350
No, it wasn't.

400
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,300
To call Han Young Won a (wench) would be too harsh, right?

401
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,720
She was so prickly to us.

402
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,400
If Se Ro trusts us,

403
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,320
it means Lee Eun Soo trusts us. That's what it means, right?

404
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,880
Does everything in the world work out that easy?

405
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,140
I want to live easily so that's how I want to live.

406
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,660
Hey, by the way,

407
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,560
her father must be something.

408
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,650
That Han Tae Ho chairman or whatever.

409
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,140
I think her mother is beyond something, too.

410
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,890
What do you think of Han Young Wan as CEO?

411
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,260
Thank you!

412
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,900
What now?

413
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,480
I told you I don't know. Why again?

414
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,720
I told you, I'm Se Ro's sunbae.

415
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,260
Sunbae or Hoobae, I don't know anything.

416
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,520
I found Se Ro.

417
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,070
What?

418
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,050
It was hard finding him.

419
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,360
Where? Seoul?

420
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,810
Yes.

421
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,210
Seoul?!

422
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,600
Is my baby all right?

423
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,270
Is he well?

424
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,290
Where is he? Take me there.

425
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,820
Take me, please.

426
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,020
Hyungnim, I was keeping an eye here, but...

427
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,000
there is big trouble.

428
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,520
What?

429
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,310
Why would Secretary Ahn be at Se Ro grandmother's place?

430
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,190
Se Ro's grandmother?

431
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,740
Don't butt in rashly.

432
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,000
You can't show your face.

433
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,770
Go to the Grandmother's house. Hurry.

434
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,670
Ok.

435
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,460
Why? What's wrong?

436
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,250
Whatever trace of Jung Se Ro you can find,

437
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,350
find all of them.

438
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,760
You're here.

439
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,890
Please sit down.

440
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,970
Hey, you son of a bit*h of a thief!

441
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,690
Hey, what's there to steal here?

442
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,540
What are you doing, punk?

443
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,150
Hey, stop there!

444
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,650
Stop right there!

445
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,890
You're not stopping?

446
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,710
Stop!

447
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,190
Our Young Won...

448
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,530
I raised her like a precious plant.

449
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,270
I didn't want to see her hands smelling of money.

450
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,870
I also don't like her speak of the worlds' ill from her pretty mouth.

451
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,620
I see.

452
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,170
And so,

453
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,610
I'm taking care of the accounting from my side.

454
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,650
The dealer-type work...

455
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,660
will have to work a lot with Secretary Ahn.

456
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,170
Then...

457
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,050
President Han Young Won is...
--Oh,

458
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,630
you don't have to think too differently.

459
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,960
I'm just helping with the accounting.

460
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,810
Belle La Fair will be a company that Young Won will always lead.

461
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,860
However...

462
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,840
I want to see you beside her, helping her along the way.

463
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,700
Of course.

464
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,840
I worry a lot, is what I'm saying.

465
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,560
While you're by my Young Won's side and watching over her,

466
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,450
whatever Young Won is up to, and whatever occurs during Young Won's weekly duty,

467
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,340
if you can let me know everything, that would be great.

468
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,990
Even if it's about my household.

469
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,560
Reason...

470
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,820
Is it alright to ask for the reason?

471
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,800
In today's words,

472
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,970
I'm a "daughter's dummy". That must be it.

473
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,510
I'll pay you more than enough.

474
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,690
I will ask Han Young Won about it.

475
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,550
I'll ask Han Young Won if I can spy on her.

476
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,870
And if I can report it to the Chairman.

477
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,180
I have to ask her first since its her business.

478
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,710
What did you say?

479
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,590
Let's talk later.

480
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,400
<i>I'm Jung Se Ro.</i>

481
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
<i>Chairman Han Tae Ho?</i>

482
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,680
Finally we can talk to each other, Jung Se Ro.

483
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,680
Leave.

484
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,070
Talk to me.

485
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,110
Let's see.

486
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,270
I'll recite Belle La Fair's accounting from what documents I have.

487
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,200
Deposit record.

488
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,220
Expense record. Custom documents.

489
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,500
Oh.

490
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,780
HK distribution business documents.

491
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,190
Of course, these are the originals.

492
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,880
How much are you willing to give me?

493
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,010
That's right. You should of asked for money in the first place. Why were you playing around?

494
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,540
<i>How much will it take?</i>

495
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,690
I'll just 2 Million Won. Oh, that's cheap!

496
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,720
Before that, let me ask you? Where did you get the documents?

497
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,340
That's..

498
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,470
That's the original document.

499
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,630
I'll give it to you, hyung. Take it.

500
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,260
<i>Where did you get it from?</i>

501
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,510
<i>Who gave you the document?</i>

502
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,020
Never mind that.

503
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,880
Tonight at 7 PM. Let's give and receive it and put an end to this.

504
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,570
You...

505
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,600
Do you want me to kill you?

506
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,810
Before I die, let me spend the 2 million Won.

507
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,150
Ah,

508
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,360
is it right for you to bother my grandmother?

509
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,240
Let's not be tacky and do that kind of thing.

510
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,220
I'll take the money and run. So, don't look for me, either.

511
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,550
And don't be curious about me.

512
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,580
Don't ever show up again.

513
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,310
Since you are begging only for money..

514
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:37,210
Its not that. I am taking it away from you. Let's get that straight.

515
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:44,140
You, who don't want to pay taxes and launder money, think about your position first, you old man.

516
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,090
And another thing,

517
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,330
if you touch my grandmother again, I won't just sit idle by.

518
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,210
I'll call you again and let's be more gentlemanly.

519
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,220
Work hard.

520
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,760
Lee Eun Soo.

521
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,360
Something happen with my father?

522
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,600
That something just happened to you, not me.

523
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,160
What are you saying?

524
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,570
The person you detest,Jung Se Ro, and your

525
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,250
father was making a deal.

526
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,880
You want me to find Jung Se Ro.

527
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,990
Your father gave me money to Jung Se Ro.

528
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,680
What do you mean give money?

529
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,980
You ask him yourself.

530
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,450
These words may be a bit harsh but

531
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,390
In my eyes, your father is the same;

532
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,730
he is a con man like Jung Se Ro's father.

533
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,580
Tell me why you are doing this.

534
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,400
To the father who has stood by me,
why are you talking like that about him?

535
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,580
Why you are so pissed off.

536
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,870
I know.

537
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,330
Why am I getting so pissed?

538
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,510
The things that I know.

539
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,990
The fact that you don't know what I know is
frustrating.

540
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,740
That pisses me off.

541
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,410
Tell me so that I can understand.

542
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,450
Don't ask me but

543
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,780
ask your father.

544
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,410
Just like you were asking me.

545
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,470
Father!

546
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,990
I took care of Jung Se Ro.

547
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,410
How?

548
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,180
I took care of it with money.

549
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,230
Money?

550
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,810
It was pestering me so I went along with what they wanted.

551
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,670
He killed Woo Jin.

552
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,460
To that guy give money? Dealing with him?

553
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,600
It was pestering you? You got rid of him?!

554
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,040
Stop it!

555
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,770
Gong Woo Jin and Jung Se Ro.

556
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,260
From now on, don't

557
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,820
bring up their names anymore.

558
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,400
That document. Se Ro found it under a drawer, right?

559
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,690
Yup.

560
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,490
Its my hunch.

561
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:26,280
Gong Woo Jin was killed by Han Tae Woo.

562
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,810
99%.

563
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,510
What?

564
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,830
Gong Woo Jin tracked Han Tae Woo's business.

565
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,200
That's why Han Tae Woo killed Woo Jin. It looks that way.

566
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,450
Why didn't I think of that before?

567
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,180
Just a minute...

568
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,670
But Gong Woo Jin was his daughter's fiance.

569
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,170
Can that be?

570
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,330
Hyung!

571
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,090
Hey. I have something to tell you.

572
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,680
2 Million Won?

573
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,450
Do you think I wanted their filthy money? Do you think that's why I gave you the documents?

574
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,530
How did you know?

575
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,250
Why do you want to turn me into a person who
 can be bought with money?

576
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,290
Why?

577
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,870
You can bet more later. Since you can't do that, are you pissed?

578
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,810
No matter what they think of you..

579
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,790
To them its just trash money.

580
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,870
They throw those to people and say that
 the world is a good place to live!

581
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,950
After that, they'll sleep with their legs stretched!

582
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,760
Let's go.

583
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,130
To us, its not trash money.

584
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,740
Cha Pyo will bring the money and we'll split it evenly.

585
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,310
Where is Cha Pyo?

586
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,430
I'll tell you again. I don't need that money.

587
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,260
Even if you don't, keep it.

588
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,100
I'll make sure I give it to you and you make sure you take it.

589
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,890
You know what the heaviest thing in the world is?

590
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,840
The money you first took.

591
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,120
If you took it,

592
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,800
have some responsibility toward our work.

593
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,130
You have to share the burden.

594
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,030
This work is what you started, isn't it?

595
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,450
That is..

596
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,230
Because they may bother your grandmother,

597
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,280
Kang Jae put a stop to it.

598
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,560
He did it by taking the money to end it all.

599
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,960
So, he can end the Jung Se Ro matter with them.

600
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,730
However you,

601
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,260
,don't you bother them with Jung Se Ro issue.

602
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,750
The way I see it, you owe one to Kang Jae.

603
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,910
He resolved a big issue.

604
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,410
What about Grandmother?

605
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,450
Grandmother...!

606
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,500
Are you there?

607
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,770
Did you do this, young miss?

608
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,920
Well then,

609
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,130
you wanted to make some money?

610
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,100
Yes.

611
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,350
So I could sell them and

612
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,840
try to make some money.

613
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,830
Well then,

614
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,910
get as much as you can.

615
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,750
That..

616
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,040
It's not a cheap thing, it's expensive.

617
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,580
Why didn't you mess the place more?

618
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,380
I have nothing to lose.

619
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,240
You should have took out some more of your anger.

620
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,230
I was going to but

621
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,320
You came in.

622
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,650
Why are you poor?

623
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,070
Why did you...

624
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,240
Why are you poor, grandmother?

625
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,080
Why are you

626
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,480
weak and

627
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,270
poor.

628
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,090
So that I can't take my anger out on you.

629
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:01,340
<i>On mother's way to work.</i>

630
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:07,020
<i>White wild flower</i>

631
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,630
<i>That flower</i>

632
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,980
<i>Its white pedals</i>

633
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:20,560
<i>It taste good,too.</i>

634
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,880
<i>When I'm hungry</i>

635
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,770
<i>I just</i>

636
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,920
<i>picked and ate it.</i>

637
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,990
<i>Mother. Mother.</i>

638
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,830
<i>I call her.</i>

639
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:44,010
<i>And I'll I pick to eat them.</i>

640
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,830
Right now...

641
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,480
How can you sing?

642
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,300
Then what should I do?

643
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,890
What can I say to this girl?

644
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,660
How can I tell you everything?

645
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,290
So, I'm just singing.

646
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:46,650
<i>On days when my heart can't contain itself</i>

647
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:58,000
<i>When it takes me to deeper places</i>

648
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,010
<i>With a</i>

649
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,510
<i>beautiful image</i>

650
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:13,100
<i>that once made me cry</i>

651
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:19,450
<i>You come to me</i>

652
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:25,080
<i>in my dreams tonight</i>

653
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,120
<i>What do you want</i>

654
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,060
<i>me to say now?</i>

655
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,850
<i>What kind of hear are you expecting?</i>

656
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,190
<i>Even if you've grown</i>

657
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,180
<i>faint to me now</i>

658
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,300
<i>There is a path that I need to take</i>

659
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:55,150
<i>You are nothing</i>

660
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:00,580
<i>♫Your back is♫</i>

661
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,690
<i>♫disappearing from me.♫</i>

662
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,440
What is this?

663
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,330
Did he really..

664
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,160
Did he really kill the person who loved his daughter?

665
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,180
We'll have to look more into it.

666
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,670
It'll be better not to tell Se Ro, right?

667
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,530
Yeah since we are not sure.

668
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,820
Oppa,

669
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,640
Let's not tell him.

670
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,420
Even so, you shouldn't say those things.

671
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,420
He was unjustly put into prison and he's angered about that.

672
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,990
If they planned and framed him,

673
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,560
How can he live?

674
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,780
Even still,

675
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,230
if this is true,

676
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,370
let's destroy that family.

677
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,430
All right.

678
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,820
You're right.

679
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,570
You know

680
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,850
I do things well when you tell me what to do.

681
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,630
I won't leave them alone.

682
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,300
Hey.

683
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,120
This is really strong! Drink something else.

684
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,230
To put this here,

685
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,430
it took me 5 years.

686
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,150
Even so, its a relief to have found it.

687
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,760
A relief?

688
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,550
Because of this

689
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,200
we had lot of work to resolve.

690
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,990
Now, it must be the end.

691
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,070
Secretary Seo?

692
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,520
Hello,

693
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,880
I am Baek Nan Joo.

694
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,040
I met you in the past once.

695
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,610
Tae Kang...

696
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,770
No,

697
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,790
It will be faster if I introduce myself as
Belle La Fair CEO's mother.

698
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,100
It really is a pleasure for me.

699
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,240
It was an honor for me.

700
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,920
Yes,

701
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,290
I get it.

702
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,420
I'll relay the message. Yes.

703
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,880
Yes. Bye.

704
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,120
Han Young Won side is reacting fast.

705
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,040
Han Young Won's mother wants to meet.

706
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,270
She wants to meet in secret without her daughter knowing.

707
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,260
Why would she?

708
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,350
This family is really strange.

709
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,420
What are those God awful thing?

710
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,730
It belongs to a grandmother I know.

711
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,980
This looks cheap? Its pretty to me.

712
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,820
Take a look at this!

713
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,530
Here.

714
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,460
I think we were doubtful of his ability.

715
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,860
Just like the old Gong Woo Jin Team Leader.

716
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,020
Who are you comparing to whom?!

717
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,290
No, that the ability is..

718
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,030
Anyway, I think he is a person who is helpful to us.

719
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,810
Come with me please.

720
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,400
Where to?

721
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,390
It has to do with your family.

722
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,500
I'm not exactly sure what it is.

723
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,990
What do you want to do?

724
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,850
Do you not want to go?

725
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,110
Nice to meet you.

726
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,850
You must be busy, yet you came.

727
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,300
This is my son.

728
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,700
I saw him before at the opening.

729
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,020
He makes a good impression.

730
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,100
I apologize.

731
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:04,150
Since you suddenly wanted to meet,
I couldn't make too much time.

732
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,040
Let's get straight to why you wanted to see me?

733
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,210
Then, let's just eat.

734
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,060
Young Joon.

735
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:14,360
<i>You gave Belle La Fair the exclusive rights,</i>

736
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,530
<i>and you continued to contact them?</i>

737
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,230
<i>Yes.</i>

738
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:24,340
Obviously, that means
 you're interested in our company.

739
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:29,190
I could help you with your business plans.

740
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,150
Listen to it more.

741
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,230
Be quiet. Everything can be heard.

742
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,650
Listen to what they have to say
'till the end.

743
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:46,670
<i>Bell La Fair refused our offer first.</i>

744
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,230
<i>That was with Representative Han Young Won.</i>

745
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:55,350
My Young Joon and I
think differently.

746
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,410
Bella La Fair...

747
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,260
It's about time that the eldest son takes over.

748
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,650
Han Young Won!

749
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,200
Han Young Won!

750
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,780
Why are you avoiding this?

751
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,020
What are you so afraid of that
you can't say a thing?

752
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,810
Thank you for giving me
such an important information.

753
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,440
Are you really going to let it go,
even after everything you've heard?

754
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,020
Please keep what happened today
a secret.

755
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,630
For some strange reason,
I reveal everything about me.

756
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:42,380
When I don't know anything about you.

757
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,740
Han Young Won.

758
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,070
Just what is it?

759
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,070
Because they're humans,
they could covet money.

760
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,000
That's how I want to think.

761
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,780
Later on, they could say,
"Young Won, I was crazy back then."

762
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,710
When they do,

763
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,390
I want to say,
"Why did you do that?"

764
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,060
"It was really hard for me."

765
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,370
That's what I want to tell them.

766
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:17,500
To you, they might seem despicable.

767
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,980
But to me, they're my family,

768
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,840
and I can't lose my family.

769
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,710
I don't have the courage to
live after losing people again.

770
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,670
Please.

771
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,770
Do you really not know?

772
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:38,380
The documents that your father and
Jung Se Ro traded money for?

773
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,940
I don't know.

774
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,990
I know a little.

775
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,060
I don't know much about family issues.

776
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,920
You should know the important things!

777
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,060
Are you proud of not knowing?

778
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,020
Not knowing, pretending not to know,

779
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,140
and not wanting to know...
They are all,

780
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,510
sometimes, it's a sin.

781
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:03,430
Even if I knew,

782
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,530
I can't say anything.

783
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,580
Exactly, why?

784
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,300
Because I am,

785
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,450
just like you said,
I am...

786
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,220
a daughter of a con man.

787
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,400
She's not the one.

788
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,860
How do you know that?

789
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,030
Even if no one else knows,

790
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,150
she said things I know.

791
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,770
That woman,

792
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,620
her eyes,

793
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,780
they can't be lying.

794
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,120
But then,

795
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:16,100
why were those documents in
a deceased, Gong Woo Jin's desk?

796
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,790
Was Gong Woo Jin
working with Chairman Han?

797
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,020
If that's not the case...

798
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:29,630
Gong Woo Jin was pursuing Chairman Han.

799
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,230
Se Ro.

800
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,050
What are you thinking?

801
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,520
It's just,

802
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,790
<i>I could kill you.</i>

803
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,730
<i>It was Han Tae Oh.</i>

804
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:49,760
<i>That woman had nothing to do with it.</i>

805
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,110
Se Ro, where are you going?

806
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,290
Se Ro! Jung Se Ro!

807
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,810
Are you thinking that too?

808
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,820
<i>The phone is turned off so...</i>

809
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,700
Is Han Young Won home?

810
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,040
<i>Miss is not home</i>

811
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,570
Where did she go?

812
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,920
Where is Han Young Won?

813
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:04,830
Who is it?

814
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,900
I don't know.
He was looking for Miss.

815
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,180
Young Won?

816
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,950
Who?

817
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:22,980
<i>Gong Woo Jin</i>

818
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,390
Han Young Won.

819
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,450
What is it now?

820
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,990
Your father.

821
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,550
Your father is.

822
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,210
Are there other things I need to know?

823
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,580
Tell me.

824
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,420
Nothing shocks me anymore.

825
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,510
Lee Eun Soo.

826
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,990
<i>I can't lose my family.</i>

827
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:15,090
<i>I don't have the courage
to live after losing people.</i>

828
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,430
<i>Please</i>

829
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,490
Your father.

830
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,540
He's a bad person.

831
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,510
That's not what you wanted to say.

832
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,370
I'm clearing out this space right now.

833
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,050
So from tomorrow, you can use it.

834
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,130
I'm going to become strong.

835
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,520
I'm going to endure it.

836
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,790
So that I can protect my family
and Belle La Fair.

837
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:52,180
-So, if there are other things I need to know.
-There aren't any.

838
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,030
You told me not knowing is a sin.

839
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,730
That I should know what's important!

840
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,090
Your father.

841
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,840
What about my father?

842
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,420
Do you think it's easy for me
to accept you?

843
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,700
You do what you want to do,
and a person that's impossible to understand,

844
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,830
giving you Woo Jin's office,

845
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,480
giving you Woo Jin's desk.

846
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,950
Do you think it's an easy thing for me?

847
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,440
If you think about it,
you helped me a lot.

848
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,620
I keep...

849
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,570
You distress me.

850
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,210
Even then, I am

851
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,730
giving you Woo Jin's space.

852
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:56,580
Not because I trust you.

853
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:02,970
But right now, I can't
 be without someone like you!

854
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,640
So, tell me the truth.

855
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,820
What is it that even you're hiding from me?

856
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:16,200
In middle of the night,

857
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,590
why did you come looking for me?

858
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:26,900
Woo Jin.

859
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,520
Hold on.

860
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,990
Hold on.

861
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,690
Woo Jin.

862
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:37,710
Just for a little bit.

863
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,520
For a little bit.

864

<i>Episode 6 Preview</i>

865
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:07,990
<i>Tell her that there won't be
a place for her in Korea.</i>

866
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,400
<i>What did my grandma do wrong?</i>

867
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,650
<i>I even went to prison!</i>

868
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,060
Is this helping me?

869
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,080
<i>I told you things can get worse.
I asked you to keep it a secret.</i>

870
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,830
<i>You can't beat your father.</i>

871
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,020
<i>I'll go meet him.</i>

872
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,740
<i>I really want to meet you.</i>

873
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,400
<i>What you went through was big.</i>

874
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,370
<i>But your opponent is stronger and despicable.</i>

875
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:32,240
<i>I apologize for my rudeness.</i>
