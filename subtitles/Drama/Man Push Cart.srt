1
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
How are you? Need any help?

2
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:32,801
- You sure?
- Yeah, thanks.

3
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:53,802
- You're Pakistani, right?
- Yeah.

4
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,203
You from Lahore?

5
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:59,004
- Yeah.
- Me, too!

6
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:03,905
Too long.

7
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:31,406
Our condolences on
this one-year anniversary.

8
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:39,407
How's Sajjad? Is he
in kindergarten now?

9
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,608
I told your son you had to work

10
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,209
and that's why you couldn't come
to the mourning ceremony last week.

11
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,410
Sorry I couldn't bring him today; your
mother-in-law took him to the playground.

12
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:24,811
Well, he is drawing a lot
now, and he's really good.

13
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:28,212
Come to the house with me.
We'll talk with your mother-in-law.

14
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:31,413
- Maybe...
- Sajjad's my son!

15
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:33,914
I haven't seen him for three months!

16
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:37,115
Even if I have to bring him to work
with me, at least I could see him.

17
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,916
At least for a day.

18
00:49:31,117 --> 00:49:34,117
Congratulations, brother! Congratulations!

19
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:18,518
- What do you mean, "Please, please"?
- That's his son, please.

20
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,219
He is not your son anymore!

21
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,420
It's your fault she's gone from
this world, God rest her soul!

22
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:28,921
It's your fault!

23
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:35,022
How are you?

24
00:51:37,123 --> 00:51:39,823
I waited for you at Toys 'R' Us,
but I didn't get to buy you a toy.

25
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:43,424
What's your favorite toy?

26
00:51:45,225 --> 00:51:46,925
Still motorcycles?

27
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,876
Sajjad, it's papa.

28
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:57,927
Do you think of me?

29
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,128
Did you feed it milk?
You're not supposed to.

30
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:57,929
It's only a 2-week-old baby.

31
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,030
Look, look, look!

32
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:06,031
You should have fed it water,
with an eye-dropper.

33
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:09,832
Then rubbed its belly for digestion.

34
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:14,133
Please, can't you do something else?

35
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:16,834
Like what? I told you...

36
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,100
- Hi Ahmad! Nice night, eh?
- Hi Altaf. What happened?

37
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:31,301
This van is too old and too
tired -- like me! Look!

38
01:16:34,802 --> 01:16:37,902
- The engine cut out?
- Yeah. It's no good anymore.

39
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:41,703
I have to get to my corner.
Can you give me a hand?

40
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:32,804
I'm going to check on my van.
Can you cover me?

41
01:17:33,005 --> 01:17:35,705
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Ahmad.
