1
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,644
Money is a public good.

2
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,229
Like water, then?

3
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,402
Exactly.

4
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,332
The white city ofAlgiers.

5
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,503
When Mireille abandons Pépé le Moko.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,518
How about us?

7
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:47,689
When, yet again,
we have abandoned Africa.

8
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,746
Constance, you had no choice.

9
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,335
We know that, going south,
degrees of latitude become negative.

10
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,673
So we go north,
dear soul, dear friend.

11
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,010
You still have the watch, Godmother.

12
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,560
No more crimes and blood.

13
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,688
No more Kigali.
Hooray forvacation.

14
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,303
Uncle Mathias, why did you say
this watch is worth a fortune?

15
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,014
It doesn't even tell time.

16
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,102
THINGS

17
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,956
Henri Déricourt.
Just a second. That I know.

18
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,209
Right.

19
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,423
But Richard Christmann, I don't know.

20
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,092
I know they started the fire,

21
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,553
but never mind, it's him.

22
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,890
Okay, war is war,

23
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,059
but a crime is still a crime.

24
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,647
Keep checking for Alice, please.

25
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,858
Two M's, one N.

26
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,370
We're far from Byzantium, you know.

27
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,625
What is opening up before us
resembles an impossible story.

28
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,461
We're facing a sort ofzero.

29
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,966
I once encountered nothingness.

30
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,552
Well, it's a lot thinner than you think.

31
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,847
Jaffa, 1 948.

32
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,899
LIKE THIS

33
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,300
You're absolutely right.

34
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,428
I don't love any people.

35
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,682
Not the French,
not the North Americans,

36
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,018
not the Germans.

37
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,190
Not theJewish people,
not the black people.

38
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,775
With her slit eyes.

39
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,109
I love only my friends —

40
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,235
The shape ofa dollar bill.

41
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,195
when there are any.

42
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,529
CinemaScope.

43
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,989
Nothing else.

44
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,493
- Plan on staying in Haifa?
- 16:9, Uncle.

45
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,744
Hey, kid!

46
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,106
Where'd you steal that watch?

47
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,401
Give it to me, or I'll turn you in.

48
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,194
No, it's mine.

49
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,156
So you speak German!
You can do me a favor, my boy.

50
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,452
And you're educated, to boot!

51
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,079
What a piece of work, that Ludovic!

52
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,914
Who told you my name?

53
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,250
I know everything.

54
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,016
Mr. Obersturmbannführer Goldberg.

55
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,272
What did you do in Avenue Foch in 1 943?

56
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,691
Get lost, you rotten kid.

57
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:44,296
Any movement on a planar surface

58
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,176
not dictated by physical necessity

59
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,847
is a spatial form ofself-assertion,

60
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,935
whether it involves
empire-building or tourism.

61
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,775
Anybody can act as if God didn't exist,

62
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,155
but what has changed today

63
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,365
is that the bastards are sincere.

64
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,459
THINGS LIKE THIS

65
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,432
A-L-I-S-S-A.

66
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,857
Stop being wary ofeverything.

67
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,613
I'm thinking about what Ludo told us.

68
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,823
Okay. Like what?

69
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,326
The old man with the young girl.

70
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,370
I saw them talking to the captain.

71
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,747
Okay. So?

72
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,040
So?

73
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,126
The name ofthe company's
main shareholder—

74
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,254
Goldberg.

75
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,590
"Gold mountain."

76
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,925
Yes.

77
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,969
And the old man's name.

78
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,012
Okay.

79
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:28,024
Abandon ship,
abandon ship, abandon ship.

80
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,250
Quiet, Alissa. Quiet!

81
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,671
Meow. That's what the ancient
Egyptians called their cats.

82
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:37,052
You trouble me with each ofyour words.

83
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,486
Be silent, Alissa.

84
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,614
"Repent not ofthy confidence."

85
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,425
... waves of Allied bombers
crushed the Third Reich.

86
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:24,766
The Luftwaffe tried to regain the advantage
with a terrifying new tactic.

87
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,022
German pilots would crash
their planes into enemy bombers.

88
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,665
Did you know
that kamikaze inJapanese

89
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,042
means divine wind?

90
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,627
Of course.

91
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:18,319
In October 1 943, the Russian forces
pushed the Germans back.

92
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,405
Major Kamenskaya.

93
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,117
I'm a friend of your godmother,

94
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,453
Alexandra Irinivna.

95
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,621
Yes, exactly.

96
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,667
The former Moscow chief of judicial police.

97
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,920
I've read a number of books
on what she —

98
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:44,053
I've read a number of books
on what she wrote, so —

99
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,431
We have to talk.

100
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,183
Excuse me?

101
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,066
And you plan on staying in Haifa?

102
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,155
I came to take a look.

103
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,743
They say there's a right of return,

104
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,497
but for me it'sjust one way for now.

105
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,168
What exactly do you study at Stanford?

106
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,088
I lead a seminar:

107
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,424
Monetary creation and literary creation.

108
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,311
You see, even today,

109
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,940
what we wonder about in Moscow —

110
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,279
'35.

111
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,240
There will come a time...

112
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,702
- '36.
- when everybody will know why—

113
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,955
The Spanish Civil War.

114
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,291
forwhat purpose,
there is all this suffering,

115
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,963
- and there will be no more mysteries.
- The republicans asked the Comintern

116
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,466
to move the gold in the Bank of Spain
out of the country.

117
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,761
We must work.

118
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,723
The France-Navigation Company.

119
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,016
That's right.

120
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,060
- The bands are playing so gaily—
- When it reached Odessa,

121
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,272
- a third or a quarter of it had disappeared.
- Oh, my God!

122
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,816
And another third in Moscow.

123
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,360
...and we shall depart forever,
we shall be forgotten.

124
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,988
I have my theory about the first third.

125
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,576
For the last third,

126
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,582
we'll have to dig deep
into the communist archives.

127
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,294
...and people will remember
with kindly words...

128
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,340
and bless those who are living now.

129
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,091
Oh, dear sisters,

130
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,219
our life is not yet at an end.

131
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,764
Let us live.

132
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,933
Willi Münzenberg.

133
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,393
The music is so gay, sojoyful,

134
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,981
and it seems like in a little while
we shall know why we are living.

135
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,815
Aren't you going to tell me about Darlan?
Who was Darlan?

136
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,692
Do I have to answer?

137
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,485
Who was he?

138
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,362
...General Pétain,

139
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,489
on the German side...

140
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,663
...the Allied invasion of North Africa

141
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:44,335
and at that moment, Churchill,
he resisted...

142
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,423
At that moment, he resisted, didn't he?

143
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,127
Want my opinion?

144
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,173
AIDS is only a tool for killing
all the blacks on the continent.

145
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,057
I wasjust thinking.

146
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,601
Light exists because of what?

147
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,604
Because of darkness.

148
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,407
LIKE THIS

149
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,078
Ladies and gentlemen,join us
at the Berlino bar on Deck 5 at 6:45 p.m. —

150
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,121
Ofcourse, money was invented

151
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,540
so that people wouldn't have to
look one another in the eyes.

152
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,543
Minimum prize is 500 euros.

153
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,011
So we come back to zero, mister.

154
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,181
Luckily the Arabs invented it.

155
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,684
They don't even get royalties.

156
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,399
Ofcourse, negative numbers
came from the Indies

157
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,321
and stopped off a few years in Arabia,

158
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,740
on the way to Italy.

159
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,786
Fibonacci used them first.

160
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,416
When the British left Israel,

161
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,254
what exactly did you do
with the gold of the Bank of Palestine?

162
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,628
THINGS LIKE THIS

163
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:20,718
They always say that you can
only compare what is comparable.

164
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,346
In fact,

165
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,598
we can only compare

166
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,935
what is incomparable,
not comparable.

167
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,483
That's over and done with.

168
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,036
Stalin.

169
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,830
Hitler.

170
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,631
Your playacting is useless.

171
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,549
Stop it.

172
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:12,687
I've also learned to collaborate
with the French.

173
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,441
Say,

174
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,196
I'll teach you something
about Napoléon.

175
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,409
During the burning of Moscow,

176
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,371
he signed the decree establishing
the Comédie-Française.

177
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:38,379
I do not understand.

178
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,717
To understand, Herr Goldberg,
that is difficult.

179
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,807
I don't give a damn about the fact
that you pinched Spanish gold.

180
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,227
I just have to find the rest.

181
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,398
You no longer need to fear Moscow.

182
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,318
My only real job, Herr Krivitzky —

183
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,447
That'sjust fine, Major.

184
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,617
My grandmother used to say that
at the drop of a hat.

185
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,750
I don't want to die...

186
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,712
before I've seen Europe happy again...

187
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:26,927
and the words Russia and Happiness...

188
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,518
attached like two belt buckles.

189
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,647
Excuse me, friend. Excuse me.
May I askyou a question?

190
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,279
Still, Naples I can understand.

191
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:31,242
But Alexandria, Haifa, Odessa,

192
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,244
to go from Algiers to Barcelona?

193
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,247
Take it easy, Constance. Let's not —

194
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,147
Don't tell anyone.

195
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,316
Silence is golden.

196
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,858
"Islam is the West of the East."
Rudyard Kipling.

197
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,945
Let's go.

198
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,621
Once,

199
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,748
in 1 942,

200
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,209
I encountered nothingness.

201
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,046
Well, it's a lot thinner than you think.

202
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,010
Casablanca, Algiers, Cairo.

203
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,670
AJew.

204
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,216
Yes, they told me.

205
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,636
My parents did.

206
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,220
So what?

207
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,682
Saying it is never enough.

208
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,195
THINGS

209
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,864
... geometry as origin.

210
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,951
The origin being always
what we come back to,

211
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,664
we have been witnessing
in the past few decades,

212
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:51,251
notably in mathematics,
a return to geometry.

213
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,005
The idea, then, is not that geometry
must return to its origin,

214
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,593
but rather that we ourselves
must return to geometry as an origin

215
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,305
- and be part of a return —
- ...the opportunity for free time

216
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,265
- to do all your shopping.
- ...to geometry.

217
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,148
Poor things,

218
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,776
the only thing they own
is the name we impose on them.

219
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,113
There's nothing
more convenient than a text.

220
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,075
We only have books to put in books,

221
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:29,790
but when we must put reality in a book,

222
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,001
and looking below the surface,

223
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:37,631
we must put reality in reality.

224
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,015
I Turned Away So as Not to See

225
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,359
"Geometry,
which remains as topical as ever.

226
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,488
And even as it develops,

227
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,660
remaining throughout
all its new forms,

228
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,164
Geometry."

229
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,255
Husserl capitalizes Geometry.

230
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,549
Geometry.

231
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,763
"In all configurations,

232
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,433
Geometry."

233
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,985
This I cannot accept.
Not as fact.

234
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,945
I'll talk about it this evening.

235
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,864
I have to work.

236
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,452
Mademoiselle Alissa.

237
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,512
STRAIT IS THE GATE

238
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:11,892
They continued for a while to whisper...

239
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,770
so that the young girl
would not overhear them,

240
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,732
but the precaution was needless:

241
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,736
she was in deep conversation
with her own thoughts.

242
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,831
As the whole of these parts,

243
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,416
where the sum of these parts,
at a given moment,

244
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,586
denies — as each contains the whole —

245
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,880
the parts we are considering;

246
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,675
as much as this part denies them,

247
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,635
as the sum of the parts,

248
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,513
again becoming the whole,
becomes the whole of the linked parts.

249
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,598
I'll train those two!

250
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,397
Dialectical thinking is first of all,
in the same movement,

251
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,816
the study of a reality

252
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,943
inasmuch as it is part of a whole,

253
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,945
inasmuch as it denies this whole,

254
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,905
and inasmuch as this whole contains it,

255
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,824
conditions it and denies it,

256
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,870
inasmuch as, consequently,
it is at once positive and negative

257
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,746
in relationship to the whole,

258
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,164
inasmuch as its movement

259
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,959
must be a destructive
and conservative movement

260
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,544
in relation to the whole.

261
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,053
The photograph of a land
and its people, at last.

262
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,973
Doctor Hamjiri.
Welcome, welcome.

263
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,808
Elias.

264
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,229
Listen.

265
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,902
After Arago admitted Daguerre
into the Academy of Sciences,

266
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,071
a mainly British armada —

267
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,658
hence well before
Lord Balfour's declaration —

268
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,161
rushed into Palestine.

269
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,415
Here is one of the earliest
photographs of Haifa Bay.

270
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,724
Where are you now, O you beloved land?

271
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,749
Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,

272
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,418
you who take away the sins of the world —

273
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,696
It's all right.

274
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,991
You're going back to Moscow.

275
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,172
The devil! He turned out to be dead!

276
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,633
You only had to wait for us.

277
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,639
So then, Otto Goldberg,

278
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:47,394
Leopold Krivitzky
and even Moses Schmuke,

279
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,396
according to the passports.

280
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:54,317
But you pronounce Richard Christmann.

281
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:59,489
The French knew him well, since
he worked for German counterespionage

282
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,199
and their own.

283
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:05,036
Started in the Foreign Legion after Spain,

284
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:10,417
then in the Resistance networks
in occupied Paris for the Abwehr.

285
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,670
After the German defeat,

286
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:18,466
he continued to be part of the remains
of the Gehlen organization,

287
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,345
Major Giske, the Algerian FLN.

288
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,559
He ended up in Tunis as a representative
for Bayer and Rhône-Poulenc.

289
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,770
Several terrorist attacks.

290
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,898
Acquitted twice.

291
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,817
Like Henri Déricourt.

292
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,819
MARKUS, GERMAN SPY

293
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,613
Like Henri Déricourt.

294
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,783
No, that's another story.

295
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:55,629
War criminal, maybe not,
but torturer.

296
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:02,886
But you know that, Lieutenant Delmas.
Alice Simmonet.

297
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,142
How do you know that?

298
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,978
Roger Faligot's book.

299
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,149
The NKVD archives.

300
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:28,745
That would explain why only two-thirds
of the Spanish gold reached Odessa,

301
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,998
but not why Moscow
also received only a third.

302
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,173
The Museum of  Man network.

303
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,800
Germaine Tillion.

304
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,178
Alice.

305
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,263
Mr. Fontes.

306
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:55,939
"The mind borrows from matter the perceptions
from which it draws its nourishment."

307
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,816
"The mind" —

308
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,904
"The mind borrows from matter the perceptions
from which it draws its nourishment."

309
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,291
- "...and restores them" — Read the whole line.
- Sure!

310
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,086
"The mind borrows from matter the perceptions
from which it draws its nourishment

311
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,255
and restores them to matter
in the form of movement

312
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,507
on which it has stamped
its own freedom."

313
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,208
This poor Europe.

314
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,295
Not purified,
but corrupted by suffering.

315
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,175
Not glorified, but humiliated
by recaptured liberty.

316
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,016
Imagine a desert.

317
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,613
Imagine a concert

318
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,202
That hasn't been written

319
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,122
Imagine

320
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:08,006
Imagine a light

321
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,049
That later

322
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,222
Without you, I am —

323
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,394
Nothing and everything!

324
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,804
Did you hear?
They did away with tax havens.

325
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,766
So what will we do?

326
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,894
We'll remain in hell.

327
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:15,698
Italy has taken up too much
of our attention in the past 2,000 years.

328
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,993
For the French, painting is Italian,

329
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,539
honeymoons are in Italy,
museums are Italian,

330
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,165
whereas...

331
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:31,798
I find German Renaissance painting
absolutely fascinating.

332
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,300
Thanks for the information.

333
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,748
So, are you going to do anything?

334
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,627
You know,
all those aborted resolutions —

335
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,714
The United Nations have been
somewhat disunited since '48.

336
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,800
The crime doesn't matter,
so as for him —

337
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,595
Ludovic told me you know everything.

338
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,264
So you must also know
that they fired me.

339
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,868
My friends,

340
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,537
I've got it:

341
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,998
the black box.

342
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,460
That's why Hollywood was called
the Mecca of the Movies.

343
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,755
The Tomb of the Prophet.

344
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,799
The eyes all turned in the same direction.

345
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,135
The movie theater.

346
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,888
Yes, but...

347
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:07,602
the strange thing is that
Hollywood was invented byJews.

348
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,811
Adolph Zukor,

349
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,687
THINGS

350
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,147
William Fox,

351
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,857
David Selznick,

352
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,609
Samuel Goldwyn,

353
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,694
Marcus Loew,

354
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:17,904
LIKE THIS
Carl Laemmle,

355
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,738
Carl Laemmle,

356
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,323
et cetera.

357
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,630
Life is beautiful, you will see

358
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,426
How in spite of sorrow

359
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,054
You will have friends,
you will have love

360
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,307
You will have friends

361
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:02,091
WHERE ARE YOU GOING...

362
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,595
EUROPE?

363
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:14,979
Is there a single deed in the world of which
I can easily say today, "I've done that"?

364
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,859
Catherine wants to sell
my business, the garage.

365
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,778
Her friend wants to buy it.

366
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,363
They know it. I don't.

367
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,116
I know the bills, that I do.

368
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,751
France today is running
the greatest risk in its history.

369
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,379
You have to say "we"
to be able to say "I."

370
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,133
In a drama,
we fight in hopes of pulling through.

371
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,511
In a tragedy, not at all.

372
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,971
Everything remains clean.

373
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,015
Everything happens in private,

374
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,434
people ignore each other,

375
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,229
wars everywhere
for the past 50 years.

376
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,649
We look at ourselves in wars
like in a mirror.

377
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,945
We save time.

378
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,989
It takes guts to think.

379
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,076
Love thy neighbor? Ridiculous.

380
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:14,038
You have to love yourselfenough
not to harm your neighbor.

381
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,916
Today that's become impossible.

382
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,001
Eitheryou obey the law,

383
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,670
oryou betray.

384
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,589
We're not asking you all that, Daddy.

385
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,801
I wonderwhyyou don't love us.

386
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,722
Ideas divide us,

387
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,600
dreams may bring us closer.

388
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,520
No, nightmares.

389
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:44,151
Because there's love and pride
in your paternal blood, therefore hatred.

390
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,614
So, what have you come up with
today to piss us off?

391
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,367
First I love my brother,

392
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,245
and for the moment
we're talking about brotherhood.

393
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,830
And liberty.

394
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,874
Liberty is for later.

395
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:02,211
And when it comes time to talk
about equality, I'll tell you about crap.

396
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:06,215
Okay, Flo, but why don't you love us?

397
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,556
Excuse me, miss.

398
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
Excuse me.

399
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,853
We want to go to the Côte d'Azur.
Is this the right direction?

400
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,273
Are we on the right way
to the Cote d'Azur?

401
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,983
Straight? Left? Right?

402
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,860
Go invade some other country!

403
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,404
Unbelievable! French shit!

404
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,156
French scum!

405
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,219
Go on, Mother.

406
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,763
Go on, Mom.

407
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:59,769
Yes, to keep space and time intact,

408
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,812
I lied.

409
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,856
I neglect to experience them.

410
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:09,195
It's a little unfair.

411
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:14,825
But for myself,
I think this is what I do:

412
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,453
I always believe I'm elsewhere.

413
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,123
- I always believe I'm elsewhere.
- Drop it!

414
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,459
- And that each particular moment —
- Drop it.

415
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,336
matters none.

416
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,046
Anything else?

417
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:31,133
There's a character, the Mother,

418
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:36,097
who could care less ifshe has a life,

419
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:40,226
if life is considered an end in itself.

420
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:46,482
She doesn't have the slightest doubt

421
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,734
that she is still alive.

422
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:54,824
It never occurs to her to wonder
how and why or in what way she is.

423
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,995
In short, she is not aware
of being a character

424
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,373
because she has never,
not even for a moment,

425
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,500
been detached from her role.

426
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,585
She doesn't know she has a role.

427
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,296
But there you are:

428
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,090
maternal blood,

429
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,718
full of hatred,

430
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,846
loves and lives together.

431
00:50:54,217 --> 00:51:06,479
Is this the Martin garage?

432
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,242
Flo, what should we say?

433
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,995
We don't speak to those
who use the verb "to be."

434
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,334
- Do you work here?
- Yes, but I don't have a contract.

435
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,670
We came to speak with your parents.

436
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,724
LOST ILLUSIONS

437
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,908
I quit.

438
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,701
I'm going back down south.

439
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:14,547
What about the comrades?

440
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,841
You'll come see us.

441
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,303
That'll be up to them.

442
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,277
Sure you'll come.

443
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,146
For tonight's news.

444
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,357
For the elections.

445
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,942
I'm filming.

446
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,445
Forget it, darling.

447
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,031
We have an appointment.

448
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,866
Forget it, lady.

449
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,627
Just for a few minutes.

450
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,420
For a statement.

451
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,714
Which one will run?

452
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,758
Forget it.

453
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,510
- But your parents made the appointment.
- What parents?

454
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,346
We're not making it up.

455
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,182
He meant, what kind of parents?

456
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:52,394
Mr. and Mrs. Martin aren't your parents?

457
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,731
Please don't use the verb "to be."

458
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,069
Now I'm totally confused.

459
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,238
- Well?
- No answer.

460
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,864
Give me that.

461
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:08,869
Not surprising, they all have cell phones
saying they aren't there.

462
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:12,581
Sorry, saying no one's home.

463
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,375
Get lost, Channel 3!

464
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,421
I don't get it. The batteries are new.
It must have a problem.

465
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:24,343
There, use the verb "to have"
and things will go much better for France.

466
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,433
You get that out of Balzac, Flo?

467
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,476
Florine.

468
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,354
Ifyou make fun of Balzac,
I'll kill you.

469
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,411
Please, sir. A few questions.

470
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,705
Please.

471
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,133
An hour and a half late.

472
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,230
If it had been done
as initially planned,

473
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:23,652
this project would've placed France
way ahead in book digitization,

474
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,030
but now it's hopelessly behind.

475
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,658
Should I wait foryou, sir?

476
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,579
No, go pick up the Prince at the airport
and stop by the office.

477
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,790
Well?

478
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:42,254
"Presidency" is feminine in French.

479
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,555
We'll see about that.

480
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,140
We already have.

481
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,518
Not at all. Our convention.

482
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,520
Today's August 4, right?

483
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,070
Flo's right. We'll have to wait a bit.

484
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,950
The news is at 7:00.
There's always some editing.

485
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,586
Give me 1 0 minutes.
I'll settle this.

486
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,885
Can I film while we wait?

487
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,607
Not at all.

488
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:49,571
You can film me.
Why don't Florine and I run for election

489
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,657
instead of Mom and Dad?

490
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:02,751
He's dreaming. Kids can't run for election,
even at the canton level.

491
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,758
Sure,

492
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,094
but kids are part of the people,

493
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,513
and the people's will exists.

494
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:22,062
Besides, we'll end up paying 30%
of France's debt because you're getting old.

495
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,064
The exact —

496
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:29,736
The exact profit
insurance companies make off the debt.

497
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,366
Can I film the pretty dress?

498
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,702
Sure, why not?

499
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,809
I'm listening.

500
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:14,198
Today, it's inconvenient.
I'd forgotten.

501
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,867
They were born on the same day.

502
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:22,539
Each birthday,Jean-Jacques and I
agreed to debate with them,

503
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,458
in theory democratically.

504
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,636
Do they lead it?

505
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,142
More or less.
We had to sign an agreement.

506
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,021
That's so cool!
We should film that.

507
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:54,321
We work at night.
We do what we can.

508
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,788
We give what we have.

509
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,124
How long will it take?

510
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,877
Unfortunately, they're allowed 24 hours.

511
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,472
Eitheryou wait,
or come back tomorrow.

512
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,899
We'll wait.

513
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,068
We'll wait!

514
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,406
I'll borrow Catherine's Mini
and be right back.

515
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,284
I have to settle this garage business.

516
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,329
Goddamn it!

517
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,921
Watch out, Mom.

518
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:29,916
That's right,
I could beat you all to a pulp!

519
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:25,097
I'd even attack the sun
if it ever attacked me.

520
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,209
Really? We're moving to America now?

521
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,044
No, England.

522
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,588
Exactly four centuries ago.

523
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,632
He doesn't have his heart in his mouth.

524
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,302
So, do you love us or not?

525
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:10,016
When I talk to myself,

526
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,437
I speak someone else's words

527
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,481
that I say to myself.

528
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,819
When you hearyour own voice,
where does it come from?

529
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,158
No, Dad, from here.

530
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,493
So what?

531
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,625
I'll inform the TV people.

532
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,212
No, Mom, stay!

533
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,852
One is part of the other.

534
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,147
The other is part of the one,

535
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,274
and there are three people.

536
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,859
We're four.

537
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:13,705
There is the law,
but you have duties. Say so.

538
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:20,587
Well, Mother, we're entering an age
with digital technology

539
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,382
where, for different reasons,

540
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,761
humanity will have to face problems

541
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,347
that won't allow themselves the luxury
of being expressed.

542
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,559
About the garage, for instance,

543
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,521
there must be redistribution of property.

544
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:45,779
It must be said, the revolution,

545
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,614
alas...

546
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:49,991
Fraternity...

547
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,744
Saint Augustine.

548
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,588
"I include among my friends
those who disapprove of my acts

549
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,423
but not my existence."

550
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,348
I still smile.

551
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,017
It's been pointless for so long.

552
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,524
My tongue goes back out
and into the mud.

553
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,278
I stay that way,

554
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,113
no longer thirsty,

555
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,616
the tongue goes back in —

556
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,203
The mouth closes.

557
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,414
It should now make a straight line.

558
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:42,127
That's it. I created the image.

559
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:49,676
Nearly everything —
grains, math, television —

560
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,512
there are almost as many
as prime numbers.

561
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,183
I don't get it, why television?

562
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:02,439
Nerve connections have become
raw material today.

563
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:06,484
So in my humble opinion
once again Africa is out of luck.

564
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,529
You mean, not part of history,
that's what you think.

565
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,157
What hasn't changed
is that there will always be bastards.

566
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,202
And what has changed today
is that the bastards are sincere.

567
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,622
They sincerely believe in Europe,
that's true.

568
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,877
Europe was a German musician,
a French writer,

569
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,962
Italian singers.

570
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,839
Ah,yes, The Marriage of Figaro.

571
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,183
But still, what we're doing is pathetic:
we distribute,

572
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,268
whereas we should first produce.

573
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,103
Yet we once knew how.

574
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,689
With a tom-tom.

575
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:49,736
Here and now, with these people,
I'm trying to produce something.

576
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,529
Don't you think?

577
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,160
Didn't Flo bring you sandwiches?

578
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,714
Yes. 5:00 p.m.

579
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,593
Do you think we can shoot soon?

580
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,553
Yes, soon, I think so.

581
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,015
I told you, here and now
I don't give orders.

582
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,102
You heard. 5:00 p.m.

583
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,895
It'll be all right.

584
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,316
Do you think —

585
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,986
WillJean-Jacques
give up his place to you?

586
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,239
I hope so.

587
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,866
Ask ifshe has a plan.

588
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:43,331
What do the unions say?

589
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:49,754
We'll see. First they'll say I'm right,
then do what they want.

590
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,589
So bye-bye Bertha.

591
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,469
Above all keep your mouth shut.

592
01:06:56,554 --> 01:07:01,099
Show first.
Show only what's possible.

593
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,188
What, for instance?

594
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:19,993
Not talk about what's invisible, show it.

595
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,465
You want more power?

596
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:43,308
No power. A society, not a state.

597
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,936
Sorry, Florine, I don't get it.

598
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,356
The state dreams of being alone.

599
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,651
Individuals dream of pairing up.

600
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,987
Let's get a move on!

601
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,002
What'd she say?

602
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:22,680
Think hard about what you're fighting for,
because you just might obtain it.

603
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:38,196
- What history?
- You'll see.

604
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,786
Be careful, Dad!

605
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,893
Do you wear thongs, like Mom?

606
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,230
- Lucien!
- I'm curious.

607
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,952
Live or tell,

608
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,787
we don't have a choice.

609
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,039
I'll tell.

610
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:57,252
1 789, the night of August 4.

611
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:01,089
With the corps
all privileges were abolished,

612
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,927
- only common law would remain —
- Common law.

613
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:07,720
- universally applicable —
- Condemned.

614
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,764
to every Frenchman.

615
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:15,728
No more screen between
the individual and the law.

616
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:23,027
I scorn the dust I am made from
and which speaks to you.

617
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,571
You bet, pet.

618
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,407
Bravo.

619
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:30,702
Saint-Just. '89.

620
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,081
Beautiful 20-year-old bodies.

621
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:11,511
Madame,

622
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:15,431
what are these many eyes
that watch in the night?

623
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:21,104
Monsieur,

624
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:25,566
suddenly this,
suddenly that astonishes me,

625
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,151
there's no one here,

626
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,029
yet here I am speaking to you,

627
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,865
and you hear me since you're answering.

628
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,204
Monsieur,
through it all,

629
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:42,458
what are these images,
at times at liberty,

630
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,335
at times locked in?

631
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:49,382
This vast thought,
where figures pass.

632
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,801
Where colors glow.

633
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,973
Madame,

634
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:58,724
that was space.

635
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,228
And space is dying.

636
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,922
One word is enough.

637
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,425
I'm trying.

638
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,970
You are full of your beauty,
your strength.

639
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,889
And I told you too.

640
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,352
There's no love left between us.

641
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,197
You divide by the number
of elected officials

642
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,784
on the pretense that it is costly to democracy,
and that these officials don't work,

643
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:24,912
and that the public should be educated
about all these layers.

644
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,832
I'm mayor and regional councilor.

645
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,751
My canton's regional council
is not of my political persuasion

646
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,588
and we all know who does what,
and we work together intelligently.

647
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:38,759
So that argument is no good.
It must be completely revised

648
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:42,555
because it leads the population
to believe that these officials

649
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,683
are only there to collect their pay,

650
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,811
whereas the time devoted
by the state's elected officials —

651
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,939
and we were talking about rural officials
earlier who deserve our praise —

652
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,816
is given generously.

653
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,236
...of the Republic today guarantee
France's territorial and social cohesion.

654
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,738
I saw —

655
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:01,699
General councilors. It's not easy.

656
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,160
No election is easy.

657
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:06,329
You'll need a plan.

658
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:16,107
of course.

659
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,025
A plan.

660
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,531
Do you have one?

661
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,450
To be 20.

662
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,579
To be right.
To keep hoping.

663
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:34,375
To be right
when your government's wrong.

664
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,087
To learn to see before learning to read.

665
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:43,092
Isn't that cool?

666
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,679
You poor thing, you never listen.

667
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:52,101
Yet, without realizing it,

668
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,982
she had already taken the decisive step.

669
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:04,822
She was now heading
into unknown territory,

670
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:10,703
beyond the confines
of her former paradise,

671
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:12,163
alone.

672
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,039
Someone different than this little girl —

673
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:16,625
- The perfect union of several voices —
- fearless.

674
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,503
after all prevents

675
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,631
progress toward one another.

676
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:29,096
- Thief! Thief!
- Our reality is highly complex...

677
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,724
and we have a tool to understand

678
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:35,644
that deeply simplifies reality —

679
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:39,482
- Anyone seen my cap?
- and prevents us from taking it into account.

680
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,284
- Hey! Whitey.
- I think from that standpoint —

681
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,286
- Did you see anything?
- France is lagging behind.

682
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:55,831
- No, miss.
- We're a so-called developed country—

683
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,417
- Enough.
- that in 201 0 leaves the weakest people —

684
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,753
- I sawyou, you bum.
- to a dismal fate.

685
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,755
Hey, be careful!

686
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:12,264
What are you doing?

687
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:31,242
Welcoming a bygone landscape.

688
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:38,791
Shit, that's a Renoir!

689
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:43,754
Yes, exactly. The moron missed out
on some beautiful things.

690
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:49,969
And those two,
that's you and your mom?

691
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,108
Ifanyone asks, sayyou don't know.

692
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,327
I can't make out the brand name.

693
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:20,374
Night and day.

694
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,585
Thanks, I know English.

695
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:26,255
It comes from Egypt.

696
01:21:26,339 --> 01:21:29,383
It was found in a pharaoh's tomb
in Tel el Amarna.

697
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,636
There are no hours, nothing.

698
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:36,348
Yes, but there's time,
the dawn of time.

699
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:46,317
Who decides the day?

700
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,484
It does.

701
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:52,239
Nothing's moving.

702
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,033
It's thinking.

703
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:57,620
If it goes on too long, give it a shake.

704
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,583
Then what?

705
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,295
Mystery.

706
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,303
What are you thinking about?

707
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,934
And you?

708
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,397
Your behind.

709
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,278
That really interests you?

710
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,946
Oh, stop! Get out!

711
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,073
That's enough! Beat it, damn it!

712
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:18,117
Bastards!

713
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:19,743
Assholes!

714
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:25,207
That's enough, you littlejerk!

715
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:44,935
so you went to see them again

716
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:50,649
Yes, after the first election was canceled,

717
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,736
the children are now awaiting

718
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:58,532
the decision of the Council of State

719
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:04,413
their father has a little place
in the south

720
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,083
for the first election,

721
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:10,794
the Council's decision was fair

722
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:16,800
Florine and Lucien kept their last name

723
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:22,723
Popular sovereignty was expressed
but without a pattern

724
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:29,313
this time they got 93% of the vote

725
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:34,318
with just their first names

726
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:39,907
so they're going to win

727
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:46,163
once, in the Resistance,
not far from Toulouse,

728
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,666
there was a small network

729
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,211
that was part of the "Combat" movement

730
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,800
"the Martin family"

731
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:02,221
whose motto was

732
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:08,310
liberate and federate

733
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:16,819
OUR HUMANITIES

734
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:50,018
In the Sudan, gold dust,
along with black slaves,

735
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:52,813
is known to be the main merchandise
in Saharan smuggling.

736
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:56,358
But we don't realize
that for centuries this gold

737
01:25:56,442 --> 01:26:00,195
was one of the decisive weapons
of western Islam.

738
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:12,457
On neither the sun, nor death,
can we look fixedly.

739
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:39,943
See,

740
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,945
there,

741
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,697
two female gold diggers,

742
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:46,325
at a meeting of the Golden League.

743
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:51,997
In their image, then,
the historian doesn't seek, he finds.

744
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:05,052
To safeguard all the images of language
and make use ofthem.

745
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,264
Because they are in the desert
where we must go find them.

746
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,395
PALESTINE
STATE OF PALESTINE

747
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:40,963
It was in 1 839 that Palestine
had its first photographer.

748
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:46,677
The squaring of the circle was found
with the famous X + 3 = 1 metaphor

749
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,096
which Einstein sought all his life.

750
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,682
Clarum per obscurius.

751
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,192
At the end of 1 926,

752
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,529
inJerusalem,

753
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:10,367
Gershom Scholem wrote to
Franz Rosenzweig in Berlin.

754
01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:14,830
Your cheeks are pretty amid the necklaces

755
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:17,332
The country is a volcano.

756
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:22,004
And the day will come when language
will turn itselfagainst those who speak it.

757
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,215
This is why the girls love you

758
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:31,471
Take me away, go on,
run me afteryou

759
01:28:32,765 --> 01:28:34,308
The king had me enter his chambers

760
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,476
A captive lover.

761
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:40,731
And the second angel
spilled his chalice over the sea.

762
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,442
And it became like the blood of the dead.

763
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:51,158
During his second course
at the New School in New York,

764
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,452
RomanJakobson demonstrated

765
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:56,872
during the winter of'42-'43,

766
01:28:56,956 --> 01:29:00,709
how it is impossible
to separate sound from meaning

767
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,503
and that only the notion of phoneme

768
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:07,716
- allows us to resolve this mystery.
- Writing for two voices

769
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:12,637
is only successful when dissonance
is introduced by a common note.

770
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:38,830
Tell me where the soldiers are

771
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:42,709
Where are they?

772
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:46,546
Tell me where the soldiers are

773
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,548
What has been done?

774
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,675
Isaac asked his father:

775
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:55,889
I see the fire, I see the knife,

776
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,558
but I don't see the lamb.

777
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,143
EARTH AGAINST HEAVEN

778
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,978
And Abraham said:

779
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:07,150
God will provide himself
a victim for a holocaust.

780
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,074
JEW

781
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:19,121
The Crusades and the very name
of Jerusalem explain many things.

782
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,416
MUSLIM
Ifthere was a desire forvengeance,

783
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,168
the person to avenge wasJesus Christ.

784
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:33,718
Palestine.

785
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,771
ODESSA

786
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:11,548
OCTOBER, ELECTROSCOPE SHUDDERED
BUT IS FALLING ASLEEP

787
01:32:33,589 --> 01:32:35,382
Are there any questions?

788
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:37,300
I have a question.

789
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:42,847
You said that it was a silent movie,
so how did people understand?

790
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,683
Odessa.

791
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:48,770
Staircase, in the Russian language,
is a feminine word.

792
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:50,730
When construction
of the stairs was finished...

793
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:57,070
no one had any doubt that the stairs
had become an integral part of our city.

794
01:32:57,154 --> 01:32:59,364
I think she's talking nonsense.

795
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:01,741
But there was something else.

796
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:02,909
Well, yes.

797
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,995
- Poor Vakulinchuk.
- This is the Potemkin staircase.

798
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:08,707
...thanks to
Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein's film,

799
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:12,711
Battleship Potemkin,
or the Year 1 905.

800
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:27,350
In the manifestation,
there wasjoy, happiness.

801
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:31,354
There you go. It's your turn.

802
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:35,108
The soldiers fired on them
because it was manifest.

803
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:38,528
And in manifest
you have mano (hand).

804
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:42,616
Not some draped sentiment,
but an ideal,

805
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,035
a smile that dismisses the universe.

806
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:06,890
HELLAS

807
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:23,698
Hellas.

808
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:30,705
Democracy and tragedy were wed in Athens,
under Pericles and Sophocles.

809
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:35,126
A sole child: civil war.

810
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:43,093
The Greek tragic hero:

811
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:48,515
the mortal exhibition of a speechless body,

812
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:53,937
in lieu of an impossible declaration.

813
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,826
PRINCIPLES OF TRAGEDY

814
01:35:11,914 --> 01:35:15,166
Ismene, sister, mine own dear sister,

815
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:18,962
knowest thou what ill there is,
of all bequeathed by Oedipus?

816
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:26,428
When Ulysses, returning from the Odyssey,
reached Ithaca,

817
01:35:26,512 --> 01:35:30,140
the only one who recognized him
under his disguise was a dog.

818
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:36,563
But that morning,
when he fell in line alongside Atalanta,

819
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:40,400
he realized that war
would be at the center of his life.

820
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:47,657
French Newsreels today present
the first coverage of a country in strife.

821
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:53,663
The brothers are leaving

822
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:57,751
Ourvillage

823
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:02,005
They raise a flag

824
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:06,050
And they depart

825
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:09,053
They raise a flag

826
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:13,683
And they depart

827
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:16,394
Why did I so desire the gift of prophecy?

828
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:19,564
So, Cassandra, will you be reasonable?

829
01:36:19,648 --> 01:36:21,441
No.

830
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:23,735
You don't approve of the gods' plans?

831
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:24,944
No.

832
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,529
But you will be silent?

833
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:27,947
No.

834
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:31,743
The dream of—

835
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,793
Naples.

836
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:44,547
Let's bring back duration.

837
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:51,262
More significant
than the deep structures of life...

838
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:54,474
are their breaking points,

839
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:57,936
their sudden or slow deterioration.

840
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:01,189
Their sudden or slow deterioration.

841
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:13,993
The sad thing

842
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:19,249
is that we copy the same model
dating from Mediterranean antiquity.

843
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:23,795
- Infection is an ancient event.
- It has colored with its scents,

844
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:27,382
- colors and affirmations —
- Without infection —

845
01:37:27,466 --> 01:37:31,052
- all life in the western world.
- evolution would have been impossible.

846
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:36,599
The plague broke out in Naples
on October 1 , 1 943,

847
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:43,147
The same day the Allied forces
entered this unfortunate city as liberators.

848
01:37:44,608 --> 01:37:46,276
Freedom is costly,

849
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:52,115
but you don't buy it
with gold or blood,

850
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:58,413
but with cowardice,
prostitution and betrayal.

851
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:07,255
Could the North Americans claim
to have liberated the peoples

852
01:38:07,339 --> 01:38:09,507
and yet oblige them to feel vanquished?

853
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,175
Nothing and everything!

854
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,970
You cannot go back

855
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:18,224
Because life pushes you on

856
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:21,686
Like an endless scream

857
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:28,610
Spain is a country that at this moment
has no lack... of opportunities to die.

858
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:32,447
And even our utopias,

859
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:39,078
it being clearly understood that
the essential is not what a dictator thinks —

860
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:41,039
Mamma mia

861
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:45,043
To bloody deeds
To bloody deeds

862
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,265
We discoverwar only once,

863
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,518
but we discover life several times.

864
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,609
But a more loyal truth —

865
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,277
Viva Don Quixote!

866
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,614
and we might add,
within arm's reach.

867
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:26,084
Bullfight in the Plaza de Toros.

868
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:30,421
They were all there:
Hemingway, Dos Passos, Orwell.

869
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:34,509
Afterwhich,

870
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:37,345
once the bull was put to death,

871
01:39:37,429 --> 01:39:40,056
toreros and spectators left for the front.

872
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:43,977
Women —

873
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:48,314
like all those building fortifications
on the outskirts of the city,

874
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,441
in anticipation of the Moors' offensive.

875
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:56,114
Later, Simone Weil,
after Franco's victory,

876
01:39:56,657 --> 01:40:00,451
when she heard that the Germans
had entered Paris, declared:

877
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:04,455
"A great day for Indochina."

878
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,334
You see,

879
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:12,505
- with the verb "to be" —
- A sort of great hope after the occupation.

880
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:14,549
the loss of reality becomes flagrant.

881
01:40:14,633 --> 01:40:18,803
For example, we'll soon be in Barcelona.

882
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:26,185
Better to say:
Barcelona will soon welcome us.

883
01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:36,446
What time is it?

884
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,828
Nothing but the right time.

885
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:46,205
Alissa!

886
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:55,965
THINGS

887
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,717
LIKE

888
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,187
When the law is unfair,

889
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:11,689
justice precedes law
