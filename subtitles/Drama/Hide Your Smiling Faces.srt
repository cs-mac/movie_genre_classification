That's not how
you play.
You go like this.

16
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,739
And then you
go like this.

17
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,274
Okay.
Yeah.

18
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,409
Oh, no.

Hmm.

Bleh!

28

Just imagine if you
had to live in here.

Who do you think
lives in here?

30
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,353
Probably,
nobody anymore.

31
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,589
There are holes
in the wall.

Yeah, dude.

the sound effects?

44
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,443
Ian: Well...

45
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,512
It sounds like a bird
falling from the sky
or something.

46
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,913
Yeah, it sounds
like a rock, it doesn't
sound like a bird.

47
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,083
(Whistling)
Birds are more like this.
(Cawing)

48
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,818
Well, maybe a dead bird
sounds like...

49
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,455
(Whistling)
Pshew!

50
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,557
What about the last
sound effect?
(Imitates explosion)

51
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,992
That's like a missile.

00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,364
Do you have lemonade?
Yes.

162
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,599
Okay, a large lemonade.
Okay.

163
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,041
It's $4.50.
All right.

164
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,414
There's $5.

165
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,982
(Phone ringing)

166
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,121
Thanks.

167
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,358
Oh.
Hey!

168
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,394
What the fuck?
I paid for that.

169
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,896
I'll get you another one.
Oh.

170
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,297
Um, sorry.

171
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,434
(Chuckling)

172
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,305
(Chuckling)

173
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,890
(Slurping)

174
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,014
Tristan: Come on, Eric.

175
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,384
Eric, what are you doing?
Come on.

176
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,318
Oh.

177
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,621
Shit.

178
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,522
Tristan: Isn't that your
brother's friend?

179
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,061
(Crying)

180
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,702
(Coughing)

181
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,307
(Coughing)

182
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,725
(Mother crying)

183
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,977
(Mother sniffling)

184
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,421
Mother: (Crying)
I'm sorry.

185
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,298
What's so funny?

186
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,268
Father: Look at your brother.

187
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,739
You look at him.

188
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Mother: Are you okay?

189
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,427
Do you wanna talk
about Ian, honey?

190
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,296
No.

191
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,275
Can I go to sleep?

192
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,712
Okay.

193
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:39,824
Do you want me
to get the light?

194
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,626
Sure.

195
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,345
(Groaning)

196
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,508
Courtney: <i>Hi,</i>
<i>my name is Courtney</i>

197
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,477
<i>and I went to school</i>
<i>with Ian ever since</i>
<i>i was little.</i>

198
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,447
<i>Ian was a very nice boy.</i>

199
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,749
He was always
there to help.

200
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,219
One day, we were
taking a math test

201
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:45,490
and my pencil broke,
so he gave me his.

202
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,359
Also in gym class once,
we were playing dodgeball

203
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,761
and I got hit in the arm.

204
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,663
He came over just
to make sure I was okay.

205
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,334
I can't remember one time
that he was mean to me.

206
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,206
I miss Ian very much
and I know that his dad

207
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,775
must be really sad
right now, and I hope
he feels better soon.

208
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,652
Man: I hope that we
all keep, Ian's dad
in our prayers.

209
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,589
And in our hearts.

210
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,459
And I just know that
he's going through
a really tough time

211
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,863
I guess it's a...

212
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,266
Hard time for you, right?

213
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,472
Well, you need
to know that...

214
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:37,675
The lord has a plan.

215
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,582
The lord has a plan for Ian.
You know that, right?

216
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,521
Excuse me?
He wanted this
to happen?

217
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,559
Did I want it
to happen?

218
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,960
He, the lord.
Oh, the lord.

219
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,231
Well, he works
in mysterious ways.

220
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,207
And he has a plan for,
bigger than any of us could
ever possibly understand.

221
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,978
And sometimes things
happen that...

222
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,281
You know,
life's just tough.

223
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,520
Man: <i>No, the lord didn't</i>
<i>want him to die.</i>

224
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,226
<i>But he did die.</i>

225
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,495
<i>He guides and protects</i>
<i>us all, so he was</i>
<i>protecting Ian.</i>

226
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,865
<i>You need to know that,</i>
<i>young man.</i>

227
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,734
God bless you, sir.
Good night.

228
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,769
You too, Paul.
Thank you so much
for coming.

229
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,538
He's with the lord
now, son.
Don't you worry.

230
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,386
(Tv playing)

231
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,546
(Dog barking)

232
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,381
(Knocking)

233
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,956
Hi. Um...
If this dog gets on
my property again...

234
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,291
I'll fucking
shoot it, okay?

235
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,664
(Sighing)

236
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,535
Bad doggy.

237
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,946
(Inhaling sharply)

238
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,999
(Footsteps approaching)

239
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,412
Hey, man, wanna
go for a ride?

240
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,676
(Metal clanking)

241
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,919
Tristan: I used to hate it
when the water turned cold
all of a sudden.

242
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,689
Because when
I was little,

243
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,157
that's where
I used to think
all the monsters were.

244
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,333
Do you ever
think about dying?

245
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,603
Eric: What?

246
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,305
Like dying,
someone killing you,

247
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:15,573
or you
killing yourself.

248
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,210
No, not really.

249
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,217
I do.

250
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,021
Why?

251
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,958
Tristan: I don't know,
I just do.

252
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,194
Are you sad?

253
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,099
Tristan: Yeah, I guess,
a little.

254
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,335
You wanna die,
because you're sad?

255
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,644
(Sighing)

256
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,914
That's dumb.

257
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,382
Ahh! Get off.
(Laughing)

258
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,864

(Clanging)

260
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,381
Whoa.
Tommy, cut it out.

261
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,349
Daisy.

262
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,786
(Barking)
Eric: Daisy.

263
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,990
Eric: Daisy, what
do you have?
(Barking)

264
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,692
Shh! Come here.
(Barking)

265
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:42,926

(Whispering)
Come here, come here.

268
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:50,701
(Coughing)
Holy shit.

269
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,837
Oh, my God.

270
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,110
Tommy, take one of them.

271
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,111
(Dog whimpering)

272
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,813
What?

273
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,415
Eric: Grab one.

274
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,986
(Whimpering)
An animal?

275
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,823
Eric: Yeah.
The cat.

276
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:14,992
Trust me.

277

(Dog whining)

280
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,908
Come on, Daisy.
Let's get out of here.

281
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,818
(Coughing)

282
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:43,954
Ew!

283
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,824
(Grunting)

284
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,799

It's okay.
It's okay, come on.
Stay in.

It's okay.
It's okay.

293
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,510
It's okay, come on.

Do you think
you'll die if I shoot?

310
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,258
I don't know.

311
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,095
What if I held
it to your head?

325
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,416
Boy 1: Come on, Eric.
Boy 2: Come on, Tristan.
Pull it off.

326
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,118
Boy 2: There you go.
Boy 1: Come on.

327
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,721
Boy 2: Bitch, pin him.
Boy 1: Come on, Tristan.
Pin him.

328
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,456
Boy 2: There you go.
Boy 1: Come on, Tristan,
pin him.

329
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,757
Tristan: Who's next?

330
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,691
Boy 1: Eric, you suck.

331
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,162
All: Here we go.

332
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:28,365
Connor, you got this.
Come on, Colin,
beat his ass.

333
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,500
Go, right here.
Come on, Connor.

334
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,072
Connor, don't let
him take you down.

335
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,174
(Splashing)

336
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,319
(Scratching)

337
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:54,791
You coming in?

338
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,565
Come on,
it's not that deep.

339
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I'm fine.

340
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,616
(Scratching)

341
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,413
Come on.

342
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,781
I'm okay.

343
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,818
Let's go.

344
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,685
No, Eric.
I'm okay.

345
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,390
No.
I can swim.

346
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,195
Let's go.
No. Eric.

347
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,897
Eric, no.

348
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,634
Eric? Eric! Eric!

349
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,569
(Screaming)
Eric, no. Stop.

350
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,905
Eric, stop.
(Splashing)

351
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:15,739
(Screaming)
Eric. Eric.

352
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,676
It's just water.
Eric, stop.

353
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,912
Alright, I'm gonna drop you,
and you're gonna swim.
No, I can't swim. I'll drown.

354
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:22,946
One...
Eric, don't do this!

355
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,447
Two...
Eric, no.

356
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,348
Three.
Eric...

357
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,352
(Gasping and coughing)

358
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,254
You all right?

359
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,822
See?
You're swimming.
(Gulping)

360
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:36,793
Sort of.

361
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,195
(Both chuckling)

362
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,596
(Coughing)

363
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,700
This isn't so bad.
Hmm?

364
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:48,838
(Exhaling)

365
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,375
(Gasping)

366
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,351
Tristan: <i>I just don't wanna</i>
<i>be here anymore...</i>

367
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:03,954
<i>You know?</i>

368
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,226
<i>No one likes me here.</i>

369
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,695
(Sighing)

370
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,697
I do.

371
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,434
Tristan: <i>What?</i>

372
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,002
I do.

373
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,305
Tristan: <i>You do what?</i>

374
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:23,907
I like you.

375
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,509
You're my friend.

376
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,944
(Clicking)

377
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,648
What's that?

378
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,019
Tristan: <i>What is what?</i>

379
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:37,854
That sound.

380
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,473
Tristan: <i>Don't you ever wish</i>
<i>you were somewhere else?</i>

381
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,644
Eric: I don't know.

382
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,580
(Stuttering)
I don't think so.

383
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,050
Tristan, this is so dumb.

384
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:13,923
Tristan: <i>I hate it here.</i>

385
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,562
You're my friend.

386
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,568
Tristan: <i>I don't know.</i>

387
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,940
(Sighing)

388
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,008
<i>I gotta go, Eric.</i>

389
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:36,880
<i>Bye, Eric.</i>

390
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,955
(Sobbing)

391
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,705
So you don't wonder
what it feels like?

392
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,475
Well, sometimes I do.

393
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:07,877
What about you?

394
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,749
I guess so.

395
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:13,917
I mean, yeah.

396
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,124
Why do you think
of this stuff?

397
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,129
I don't know.
It's just...

398
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,364
It comes into my mind.

399
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,072
Hmm.

400
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,077
Hold on.

401
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,646
What are you doing?

402
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,120
What are you doing?

403
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,059
Dude, what are
you doing?

404
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,461
See?

405
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,162
We don't even
have to touch.

406
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,636
This is weird.

407
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,439
(Scoffs)

408
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,177
It's not weird.

409
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,512
It's pretty weird.

410
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:18,782
(Chuckling)

411
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,825
Ready?

412
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,463
Fine.

413
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,804
It felt so weird.

414
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:41,438
I didn't feel anything.

415
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,676
Wanna try again?

416
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:49,746
Fine.

417
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,784
(Chuckling) Eew.

418
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,985
Oh, my God.

419
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,117
Hey, guys.
Hi, Eric.

420
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,055
Hey. How are you?
Good. How are you?

421
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,157
Mother: Good.
Woman: Good.

422
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,161
Mother: You know,
it's been hard

423
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,697
but we're getting
there, I think.
Woman: Yeah.

424
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,899
Mother: Back to normal.
How about you guys?

425
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:43,700
Woman: Same.

426
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,668
I couldn't do it.

427
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,771
I wish I had someone
to do it for me.

428
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,212
Oh, Jesus! God!

429
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,081
Eric.
Excuse me.

430
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,285
I'm so sorry.

431
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:35,785
(Dog barking)

432
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,238
Daisy?

433
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,006
(Dog continues barking)

434
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Eric.

435
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,775
Look.

436
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,715
Why is she on this?

437
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,854
I found her like that,
tied up on the street.

438
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,331
Let's go.

439
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,027
Eric?

440
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:29,999
Eric!

441
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,417
(Clattering)

442
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,002
(Clattering stops)

443
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,332
Are you alright?

444
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,073
What's wrong with you?

445
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:00,977
Eric: Let's go.

446
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:05,414
Come on!

447
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,250
Hold on.

448
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:20,463
(Sighing)

449
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,432
Oh, man,
this is just...

450
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,536
There we go.

451
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:49,992
Okay, I'm gonna give
you some of this.

452
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,208
You want some
help, honey?

453
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,318
What's the matter?

454
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,953
What?

455
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:17,720
What's wrong?

456
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,056
It's just a stomach ache.

457
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,393
Hmm. You're not
gonna eat?

458
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,213
What's wrong
with your arm?

459
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,349
Eric: It's fine.

460
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:51,387
Why aren't you
using it?

461
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,756
Stop.

462
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,093
Father:
Just let me see it.

463
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:57,493
Mother: What's going
on, guys?

464
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,098
I hate it here.

465
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,634
Mother: That's very nice.
Thank you very much.

466
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,237
I do.
You guys don't care.

467
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,242
Mother: You know what, Eric?
That's bullshit.
(Clattering)

468
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:14,310
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

469
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,419
Really?

470
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,454
Why do you
even care?

471
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,223
(Scoffs)

472
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,058
'Cause I'm your father.
I'm your dad, okay?

473
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,560
Something happens
to your hand

474
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,561
and I don't know
what happened?

475
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,671
(Sighing)

476
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:48,411
He's just doing that
to get attention.

477
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:57,787
Hey, Tommy.

478
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,822
The way he acts...

479
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,426
That's not you, okay?

480
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,194
Okay.

481
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,552
(Soft clattering)

482
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,690
Hey, get up.

483
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,233
(Drowsily) What?

484
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:44,867
Get dressed.
Come on.

485
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,338
Why?

486
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,439
It'll be fun,
just come on.

487
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:55,544
No.

488
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,745
Fuck you. Come on.

489
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,351
Get dressed
and meet me outside.

490
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,219
And bring
some food, okay?

491
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:24,767
Hey, Tommy!

492
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,204
Come here.
I wanna show
you something.

493
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:36,579
Eric: Look.

494
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,319
It's for Ian.

495
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,588
Eric: Yeah.

496
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:50,359
What are you
thinking about?

497
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:54,863
I don't know.

498
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:29,632
What's wrong?

499
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:34,637
Nothing.

500
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:37,906
You've been
here before.

501
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:40,909
You don't
remember?

502
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,481
There used to be
train tracks here

503
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:46,815
but they don't
use them anymore.

504
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:51,720
It's kind of scary.

505
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,722
Yeah.

506
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:56,992
You don't have
to go in, if you
don't want to.

507
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,535
No, I want to.

508
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,404
Okay.

509
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,705
Eric?

510
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,847
Ha!
(Gasping) Eric no.

511
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,350
Eric, stop.

512
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:55,751
Eric! Really!
Eric: (Laughing)
You're gonna go over!

513
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,486
I'm gonna push you!
Tommy: Eric, no!

514
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:59,555
Eric, stop!
Eric, really!

515
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:01,457
Okay. Okay.
(Grunting)

516
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,993
It was just a joke.
Calm down.

517
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,402
Why would you
do that?

518
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,738
(Sighing)

519
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,544
(Exhaling sharply)
It was just a joke.

520
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,580
It... I didn't...

521
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:25,714
I didn't think you were
gonna care that much.

522
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:45,768
I'm hungry.

523
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,069
No.

524
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,406
What?

525
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:51,073
What is this?

526
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:02,918
It's...

527
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,953
Why?

528
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,559
Well, it's Ian's dad's.

529
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,730
I took it cause
I thought he might
want it.

530
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:16,965
And...

531
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,668
I'll throw it
away someplace.

532
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,876
Tommy: It's rotten.

533
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:01,743
Why are you
burning it?

534
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,115
No. No. No. Shit.

535
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:08,851
Shit.

536
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,721
God damn it.

537
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:33,876
Have you ever thought
about jumping?

538
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,714
Yeah.

539
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,148
A little.

540
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,051
But I never would.

541
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,900
What are you doing?

542
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,103
I'm making a grave.

543
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:03,739
For what?

544
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:05,574
For the raccoon.

545
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:11,613
Do you want
to say something?

546
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,220
It's kind of what
people usually do.

547
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,825
Okay.

548
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,570
Dear raccoon,

549
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,339
I'm sorry you died.

550
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,641
And I'm sorry
that my brother

551
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:40,742
burned you
after you died.

552
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:46,982
I hope you come back
as a better animal

553
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,053
unless you liked
being a raccoon,

554
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:52,087
then I hope
you come back
as that.

555
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,856
Amen.

556
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,224
Oh.

557
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:02,698
Here.

558
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,239
What if I
roll off?

559
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,642
You're not
gonna roll off.

560
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,277
I roll
in my sleep.

561
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,981
I'll hold you.

562
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,138
(Spitting)

563
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,224
Eric: Missed.

564
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,893
It's all up to me.

565
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,029
(Chuckling)

566
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:13,702
Wow.

567
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:17,773
Oh!
Stupid.

568
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,192
What did he look
like when he fell...
I guess?

569
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:42,931
He, uh...

570
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,001
He looked like Ian.

571
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,877
Was he happy?

572
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:00,282
I don't know.

573
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:02,484
How was he
before he died?

574
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:08,423
He was mostly happy.

575
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,961
That's what he looked like.
He looked happy.

576
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,143
Do you think
he jumped?

577
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:33,915
Who said
he jumped?

578
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:38,520
I don't know, people.

579
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,325
You know, he...
He could have fallen.

580
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:47,496
Just playing around
like a kid.

581
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,265
Slipped.

582
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:56,538
Tommy: <i>Do you think mom</i>
<i>will get mad at us?</i>

583
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,176
Eric: <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Who cares, man?</i>

584
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:03,779
<i>Who cares</i>
<i>what she thinks?</i>

585
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:12,854
Do you think it hurt?

586
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,224
I don't know.

587
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,236
I'm sorry.

588
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,054
I'm sorry, man.

589
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:48,590
You're my friend.

590
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,559
Okay?

591
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:52,928
Don't forget it.

592
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,256
(Heavy metal playing)

593
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:56,558
(Creaking)

594
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:00,462
(Door closing)

595
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,197
It's okay, Daisy.

596
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,069
It's okay.

597
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,539
It's okay.

598
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:18,640
It's okay, I got you.

599
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:20,742
I won't let you go.

600
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,417
(Thunder rumbling faintly)

601
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,422
It's okay, Daisy.

602
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,124
I got you.

603
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:38,493
I got you, Daisy.

604
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,696
Okay, Daisy.

605
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,300
I'm gonna count to three

606
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:47,102
and I'm gonna let go
and you're gonna swim,
okay?

607
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:49,671
Three...

608
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,109
One, two, three.

609
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,306
Boy 1:
<i>Knock him down, Tommy.</i>

610
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:28,710
(Boys clamoring)
Boy 2: Come on, Tommy.
In the circle.

611
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:29,677
Boy 1: Go, Tommy.
Boy 3: Get him
down already.

(Boys clamoring)

613
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,316
Come on.

614

Come on, Tommy.
Let's go.

615
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:44,359
Tommy, go.
Come on, Tommy.

616
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,097
Let's go.
Go!

617
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,766
(Boys clamoring)
(Clapping)

618
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,770
Boy 1: Nice job,
old man!
Boy 2: Nice, Tommy.

619
01:07:59,108 --> 01:07:59,808
Me and you,
come on.

620
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,313

Go Eric.

Tommy: Get back in.
Come on, Eric.
Get up.

624
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,623
Let's go. Eric.

625
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,662
(Grunting)

626
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:23,098
Tommy: Let's go, Eric.
Get his legs.

627
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,432
Boy 4: Oh, shit.

628
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,233

01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,383
Tommy: Eric?

634
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,227
Boy 4: Oh! Dude.

635
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:54,863

watch out!
Hey!

636
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,506

fucking psycho!

I'm sorry.
