1
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:29,052
SEX AND LUCIA

2
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:09,361
Yes?

3
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,331
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.
For everything I said when I left.

4
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:15,851
Yeah, but you were right

5
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,331
You live with a sick person

6
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:21,372
No, that's not true.

7
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,332
I was too hard on you.

8
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,572
Don't worry, Lucia
That's it

9
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:30,973
I'm in a hole I've tried to
get out, but I can't

10
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,813
I'm lost forever

11
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:37,054
I'll take a few days off
and we'll take a trip.

12
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:39,214
To your island.

13
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,775
You can show me.
How about it?

14
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,655
Just the two of us.
It's calm this time of year.

15
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:49,336
We'll swim and lay in the sun.

16
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:51,856
I don't want to go to the island

17
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:57,497
I don't understand you.
You always wanted to go back.

18
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:10,139
Relax, honey. Don't worry.

19
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,099
Look, wait up for me

20
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,420
and tell me tonight.

21
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,260
I'll listen to anything you say.

22
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:28,021
Is that why you're so screwed up?

23
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,861
Something about the island?

24
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,582
I'm sorry, I can't tell you about it

25
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:35,902
You don't deserve this
You shouldn't know

26
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:37,863
Lucía, we're slammed.

27
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,183
Sorry, I have to hang up.

28
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:45,024
- We're slammed, but later...
- Yeah, slammed Bye

29
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:15,068
Sorry, but I have to go.
Lorenzo needs me.

30
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:18,748
If I were you, I'd take him to a shrink

31
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:36,751
Lorenzo.

32
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,152
Lorenzo.

33
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:19,637
Lorenzo?

34
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:22,518
- Lorenzo Alvarez residence?
- Yes.

35
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:25,798
Are you a family member?

36
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:28,678
I'm his girlfriend,
I live with him. What is it?

37
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:32,039
This is the police department
calling to inform you that

38
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,679
I've got some bad news

39
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,479
Don't wait up

40
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,280
I may never be back

41
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
You see, he

42
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,720
A car came along and

43
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,321
I don't know where to,
but faraway

44
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,481
I leave you everything

45
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,922
but me Forgive me
That's my last request

46
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,511
I'll live alone.

47
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,472
With no one else.

48
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:22,792
I don't need people.

49
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,154
What'll it be?

50
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,441
Alone.

51
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:27,521
Alone in the sun.

52
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:31,442
No.

53
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:34,682
I'm not gonna swim.
I'll stay in the sun.

54
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,323
Alone.

55
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:46,244
Alone in the sun.

56
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:49,124
Alone.
Alone in the sun.

57
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:08,416
SEX
6 YEARS EARLIER

58
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,704
The best fuck of my life.

59
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:13,465
I don't even know your name.

60
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:16,505
It's better that way.
Less complicated.

61
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,466
Give me a hint.

62
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,306
Anything. I'd like that.

63
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,987
Like a souvenir.
Where are you from?

64
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:30,707
Madrid.

65
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:32,988
I'm from Valencia.

66
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,228
Another one.

67
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:39,189
Two more hints each
and we go our separate ways.

68
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,469
I'm a paella expert.

69
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:47,550
- That's logical.
- Not quite. Keep in mind

70
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,870
that you just fucked
a world-class cook.

71
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:54,551
You're right.

72
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,311
Everything was delicious.

73
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:58,591
Of course.

74
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:03,392
A little salty, though.

75
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,752
What about you?

76
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:06,112
Sure, lots.

77
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,593
- Let's hear one.
- I was born in Madrid

78
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:10,593
on this very day.

79
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:12,353
Around this time.

80
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:16,314
It's your birthday!

81
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,034
Yes.

82
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,395
My birthday boy from Madrid.

83
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,955
What a great way to celebrate!

84
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,555
I'm your paella chef
from Valencia.

85
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:28,316
And your birthday gift.

86
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,436
Hey, that's three things!

87
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:33,956
You gave me only two.

88
00:14:34,596 --> 00:14:37,077
I'm going to look for the third.

89
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:09,161
I've been calling all morning.

90
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,482
It's not my fault he's so busy

91
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:14,882
- Then whose fault is it?
- It's his job's fault

92
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,563
Tell him to work less.
I'll call back later.

93
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:41,646
He still can't talk

94
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:43,406
Can I leave him a message?

95
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,687
Of course I'll pass it on

96
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,127
Well, let's see.

97
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,967
I'm pregnant.

98
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,848
Since I know it's not his,

99
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:54,408
and I don't need him,

100
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,848
tell him I'm going to find
my child's father.

101
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,048
- You're leaving?
- That's right.

102
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,929
I'll give you two
a little hint.

103
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,529
He's not from Valencia.

104
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,810
Fine, one more hint.

105
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,890
I'm leaving right now for...
Madrid.

106
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:17,131
They'll advance you 20 percent
of what they gave you last time.

107
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:20,532
- I couldn't ask for more.
- No, it's fine. Thanks, Pepe.

108
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:22,252
It'll get me through winter.

109
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:24,612
I'll have it ready by summer.

110
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:27,573
Really?
You've been blocked two years.

111
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:31,493
I'm figuring out

112
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:32,933
if I'm really a writer.

113
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:35,734
You? A writer?

114
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:38,694
To the core.

115
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:46,615
What about that other story?
The one about the island.

116
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,055
And the Valencian girl?

117
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:50,456
Maybe.

118
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:53,496
I'm going to buy smokes.

119
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:57,457
Put lots of sex in it.
That's always nice.

120
00:16:58,777 --> 00:16:59,897
Yeah, very.

121
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:04,498
Can I talk to you?

122
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:07,658
Now?

123
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,419
Later, then.

124
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,939
I'm with a friend.

125
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,340
What about?

126
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:29,941
Well...

127
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,062
Is something wrong?

128
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:35,902
Yes.

129
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:37,743
Tell me.

130
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:41,983
Now?

131
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:43,903
Yes.

132
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,346
What's your name?

133
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:05,587
Lucía.

134
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:07,267
I'm Lorenzo.

135
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:08,707
I know. I know you.

136
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:12,628
I read your novel.

137
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:15,268
Many times, and...

138
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,188
I can't read anything else.

139
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:20,349
It grabbed me inside

140
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:22,549
and won't let go.

141
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,189
But...

142
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,590
I've also followed you.

143
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,270
When I see you

144
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,230
I like to follow behind

145
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,791
and see where you go,

146
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:34,911
in secret.

147
00:18:36,191 --> 00:18:37,471
I know where you live.

148
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,151
It's nearby.

149
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,792
And sometimes

150
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:44,952
I see you here.
Do you recognize me?

151
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:46,632
No.

152
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:50,953
I'm a waitress

153
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,153
in that restaurant.

154
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,554
You've never come in.

155
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,874
My boss is fine.

156
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:03,435
He's a good cook.

157
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,915
But he wants to live together,

158
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:08,876
and the truth is,

159
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,876
I was really glad.

160
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:12,556
Because...

161
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:13,916
I felt needed.

162
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:16,517
And I even like him.

163
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:18,957
So...

164
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,238
I've decided...

165
00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:27,398
What?

166
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,519
The person I really want
to live with is you.

167
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,639
It's not that you're lonely.

168
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm completely in love with you.

169
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,680
Madly, as you can see.

170
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,721
You're so brave.

171
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:49,601
Yeah.

172
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,442
And it's over. I tried.

173
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,042
Did you enjoy that?

174
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,564
Feel free to leave.

175
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,010
Is there anything else
you want?

176
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,370
Yes.

177
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,691
With time, living together,

178
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:01,652
you'll end up falling in love
with me, of course.

179
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,736
I think I just did.

180
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:37,857
Let's go get drunk and celebrate.

181
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:23,583
What pretty lights

182
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:24,904
you have at home.

183
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:38,346
I'm so happy.
You can't imagine.

184
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,066
Go ahead and undress me.

185
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,028
Forgive me, Lorenzo.

186
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:55,388
I'm not used to
things working out.

187
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,511
Do whatever you want to me.

188
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,754
You start, okay?

189
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:47,724
A ray of sunshine

190
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:50,524
Brought your love to me

191
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:21,089
Slowly.

192
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,889
With love.
We're just starting.

193
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,930
Like that.
So it lasts longer.

194
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:16,297
I'm dying, I'm dying!

195
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:19,617
My love!

196
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:24,458
I'm gonna die!

197
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,421
It's delicious, Lorenzo.

198
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:46,021
Wait until you try the fish.

199
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:50,301
I've always been
around good cooks.

200
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:51,822
I don't know why.

201
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:55,142
Though my boss isn't around
much anymore.

202
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:57,743
My grandmother, yes.

203
00:26:57,903 --> 00:26:59,743
With her home cooking...

204
00:27:01,423 --> 00:27:02,543
just for me.

205
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:05,744
I moved in with her
when I was six.

206
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,144
She said my parents and brother

207
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:10,624
had opened a newsstand in heaven

208
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:12,865
in front of the angel school.

209
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:17,545
And a bookshop. Their stand
in the village never paid much.

210
00:27:18,746 --> 00:27:21,986
The three of them were killed
in a car crash.

211
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:24,946
And my poor grandmother
two years ago...

212
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:28,147
told me the whole story.

213
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,587
I still believe it.

214
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:32,468
I always liked people
who tell good stories.

215
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:34,788
I trust them.

216
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:38,188
Did your mother
teach you to cook?

217
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:41,589
No. She left my dad real quick,
when I was young.

218
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:43,629
I had to cook for him.

219
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,589
Until one day he got stabbed.

220
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,790
I may be

221
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,951
a shitty cook,
but I'm a great waitress.

222
00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:58,871
I have a camera.

223
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:10,001
How about a striptease?

224
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:16,442
Right now, without getting up.

225
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,043
If you do one later.

226
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:19,683
You wouldn't.

227
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:36,645
I've got just what you want.

228
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:44,766
Oh, how I knew...

229
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:47,207
I've got just what you want

230
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:52,247
Oh, how I knew
I've got just what you want

231
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:54,728
It's all been taken care of,

232
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,888
I'll settle the score,
remember

233
00:29:58,288 --> 00:29:59,369
I've got a map

234
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:01,449
Gorgeous.

235
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,929
and I'm one nosy bitch
I'm working on it

236
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:09,370
I gotta do it,
I don't want to end up broke

237
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,850
My feet are my ticket

238
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,891
Had to be good at something

239
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:16,931
I'm working on it

240
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:18,691
I'm working on it

241
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:20,091
I'm working on it

242
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:22,172
I'm resourceful, baby!

243
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:24,972
You turn me on,
saliva, milk and stuff

244
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:26,812
I'm in control

245
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:06,187
Lorenzo...

246
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,787
Lorenzo, my love.

247
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,187
I can't take anymore.

248
00:32:12,828 --> 00:32:14,868
So much love will kill me.

249
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:25,909
I'm dying!

250
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,830
I'm dying!

251
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,191
Don't scream, it's no big deal!

252
00:32:40,231 --> 00:32:41,272
Push.

253
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:44,192
That's it, a little more.

254
00:32:47,272 --> 00:32:48,793
Here it comes.

255
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,273
A little more.

256
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,113
Here it comes.

257
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:07,235
I'll get the dad.

258
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:09,076
Yes, please.

259
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:19,157
You see?
Shouting makes no difference.

260
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,038
There's no one there.

261
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:30,839
It's all right, my little girl
will help me find him.

262
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,479
Have you ever...

263
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,239
with another girl...

264
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,160
had better sex?

265
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,600
No.

266
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,160
Tell me the truth.

267
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,961
Maybe on an isolated occasion.

268
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,201
But it's different.

269
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,642
Isolated on the island, right?

270
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,242
Yes.

271
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:58,523
A random somebody,

272
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,483
a total stranger,

273
00:34:00,843 --> 00:34:02,443
with a full moon...

274
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:09,764
We should go to your island.
Separately, and meet there,

275
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,244
like strangers.

276
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:13,645
We'd have the best sex ever.

277
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:25,967
Which do you prefer?

278
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:29,447
Wild sex with a stranger?

279
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,768
Or sex with someone you know,

280
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:34,448
someone you love,

281
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:36,048
but also wild?

282
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,689
What?

283
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,489
You have to choose.

284
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,129
Wild sex with a stranger,

285
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,650
or wild sex with someone

286
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,650
who's crazy about you,
and who you love.

287
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,811
Go ahead.

288
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,171
- Be frank.
- With you.

289
00:34:58,771 --> 00:34:59,851
Finally.

290
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:06,572
I'd never imagined
being so lucky.

291
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,533
Girls like you

292
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,333
never like guys like me.

293
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,134
You're a gift.

294
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:44,938
The restaurant in Madrid
grew famous

295
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:47,538
thanks to the paellas
made by the silent girl

296
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:52,539
She still recalled her grandmother,
buried back home with her parents

297
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:56,540
When asked where she was from,
she was so timid that

298
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,940
she'd say she was from Malta

299
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,501
Her destiny changed that night,
when she ran into a real Maltese

300
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:09,341
A ray of sunshine

301
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,982
Brought your love to me

302
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:15,582
A ray of sunshine

303
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:19,663
Straight to my heart

304
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:55,997
- How's it going?
- Fine.

305
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:59,117
Getting used to all this clean air.

306
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:00,557
Yeah.

307
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:05,358
You get used to everything here.
This island's easy.

308
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:07,758
And you're a pro.

309
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:10,959
Of course. You have oxygen.

310
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,839
I'm renting scuba equipment
this summer.

311
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,280
I'm testing it.

312
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
You like diving?

313
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,041
No, not me. Just the opposite.

314
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,001
Sorry, but...

315
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:29,001
I prefer open air.
Open air and sunshine.

316
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:30,922
Too bad.

317
00:38:32,202 --> 00:38:34,002
These waters are special.

318
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:35,762
To each his own.

319
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:50,404
This really isn't an island.

320
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:53,445
It isn't?

321
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,725
It's a giant lid.

322
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:58,005
A floating piece of earth.

323
00:38:58,365 --> 00:38:59,766
Like a raft.

324
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:04,406
But it isn't moving.

325
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:09,207
People get dizzy here
during high tide.

326
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,207
And no one knows why.

327
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:13,368
Except you.

328
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,808
I've dived underneath
the whole island.

329
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,569
It's totally hollow.

330
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:21,969
Thousands of caves,

331
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:24,809
but nothing else.

332
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:29,330
Not a single rock connects it
to the sea floor.

333
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,730
What's your name?

334
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,050
Carlos.

335
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:35,091
I'm Lucía.

336
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:37,971
Trust me, Lucía.

337
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:40,051
I'll show you someday.

338
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,492
Okay.

339
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,732
But I'll stay up here.

340
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:48,173
Right. The girl waits
on the pretty side,

341
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:49,933
and the crab explores the ugly,

342
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:51,853
rocky,

343
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,013
horrible side.

344
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:03,775
You want to see the good things

345
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:05,215
on this island?

346
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:08,415
Yeah.

347
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:11,936
I want you to meet Elena.

348
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:35,579
Hi, I'm Elena.

349
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:37,500
Lucía.

350
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,100
Stay for dinner?

351
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:46,781
Okay.

352
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,261
You can sleep here, too.

353
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:50,101
It's a guest house.

354
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:52,022
Carlos is alone,

355
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:55,462
so I have 9 rooms free.
Want to see them?

356
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,463
Come on.

357
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:03,143
This is my room.

358
00:41:09,544 --> 00:41:11,785
Next to the kitchen
so I can cook on-line.

359
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:14,985
Come on in.

360
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:16,905
No, I'm sorry.

361
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,586
I'm not ready to see

362
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,266
other people up close.

363
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:24,426
I know which room.

364
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:29,787
It's perfect for you.

365
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:31,587
Come on.

366
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:37,348
I leave the second floor vacant
until summer.

367
00:41:57,271 --> 00:41:59,111
3,000 a day in low season,

368
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:01,392
but you can have it for 2,000.

369
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,552
Plus 2,000 if you want board.

370
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:07,112
I recommend it,
I'm the best cook around.

371
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:11,473
Can I skip dinner
and stay tonight?

372
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,033
We'll talk tomorrow.

373
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:15,274
Of course.

374
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:22,355
Something terrible happened
and I had to run.

375
00:42:26,035 --> 00:42:28,355
We'll take care of you here.

376
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:35,396
A ray of sunshine

377
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:39,157
Straight to my heart

378
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:43,238
Brought your love to me

379
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:47,078
I'd searched for so long

380
00:42:47,758 --> 00:42:49,358
And finally it's mine

381
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:50,839
I have a new guest.

382
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:53,559
She's a fantastic singer.

383
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:56,760
So from now on,
I'll cook even better.

384
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,000
If possible.

385
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,000
Can I name you?

386
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,641
Name? Yeah, Lucía.

387
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:12,402
Are you writing it?

388
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,322
It's still unsent.

389
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,163
You can change your name
if you want.

390
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,403
We all use nicknames.

391
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,684
HER NAME'S LUCIA.

392
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:30,524
A RAY OF SUNSHINE.

393
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:32,245
Is that okay?

394
00:43:34,165 --> 00:43:35,325
It's great.

395
00:43:43,006 --> 00:43:44,086
Look.

396
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:45,727
This is for you.

397
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,567
"Sing us something, Lucía".

398
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,448
A RAY OF SUNSHINE...

399
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,249
STRAIGHT TO MY HEART...

400
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,011
"Welcome, Lucía. Nice song.
Where are you?".

401
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:20,892
EVERYDAY FURTHER AWAY
FROM WHERE I WAS.

402
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:23,092
I like that.

403
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:26,212
So would Carlos.

404
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:27,653
For himself.

405
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:29,813
He's been here 6 months.

406
00:44:30,173 --> 00:44:32,733
I sense he's still tied
to the mainland.

407
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:37,214
He's someone
who gains your trust easily.

408
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:40,254
Is there anything between you?

409
00:44:40,454 --> 00:44:42,495
Yeah, sex.

410
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,535
Every now and then.

411
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,455
Without intimacy.

412
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:53,816
I prefer it,
this way I don't get hooked.

413
00:44:54,696 --> 00:44:57,057
Just wild sex.

414
00:44:58,537 --> 00:45:00,377
It must be the island.

415
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:03,338
Yeah, but...

416
00:45:04,938 --> 00:45:08,618
Carlos has the biggest dick
I've ever seen.

417
00:45:09,098 --> 00:45:10,339
How lucky.

418
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,299
I don't know where he got it.
It's enormous.

419
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:16,308
Where are you?

420
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:17,908
The abortion part.

421
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,630
Is that a hint?

422
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,310
Why don't you take a stroll?

423
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,590
I am.

424
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,031
In the street.

425
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,951
You're like an expectant father.

426
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:38,311
Exactly.

427
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:42,512
And you're the mother.

428
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:27,638
It's very positive.
There's lots of happiness.

429
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,159
It's me. I was expecting
something tragic.

430
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,959
Like in your first novel.

431
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:38,640
I should have read it
while you were writing,

432
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,040
to get used to the idea.

433
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,401
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

434
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:47,601
I'm going for a walk.

435
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:53,442
I didn't grab your heart
this time.

436
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:55,922
I guess I already have it.

437
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:11,605
Remember that birthday
when you were on the island?

438
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,845
You sure got a great gift.

439
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:19,006
Get ready, because tonight
I've got another for you.

440
00:48:19,206 --> 00:48:22,086
- From me.
- Are you proposing?

441
00:48:23,406 --> 00:48:24,806
Remember my sister?

442
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:26,527
The one who's a nurse?

443
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:30,527
Well, she's become
close friends with a girl

444
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:35,328
whose baby she helped deliver
four years ago.

445
00:48:35,888 --> 00:48:37,288
A little girl.

446
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:44,929
Speaking of girls...

447
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:48,290
How's the novel? All the stalling...

448
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,650
What do I tell my editors?

449
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,410
- You always think of something.
- Sure,

450
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:57,371
that's why you get
all your stories from me.

451
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:02,412
Write this one as is.
It's unbelievable.

452
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:04,652
Why's that?

453
00:49:05,132 --> 00:49:06,572
By the way, don't worry

454
00:49:06,772 --> 00:49:10,413
about my sister, she doesn't know
it's you. Or the mother

455
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,213
who gave birth,
I don't even know her.

456
00:49:13,893 --> 00:49:15,694
I kept you secret.

457
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:17,414
Why secret?

458
00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:19,694
Well,

459
00:49:20,054 --> 00:49:22,375
the baby girl was born
here in Madrid.

460
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:25,295
But she was conceived
on a beach,

461
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:27,215
on an island,

462
00:49:28,295 --> 00:49:29,896
a night like tonight,

463
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:32,616
with a stranger...

464
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:34,056
from Madrid.

465
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,937
It was his birthday.

466
00:49:40,337 --> 00:49:42,898
If you write this well,
it'll be the story of your life

467
00:49:43,698 --> 00:49:46,098
and my birthday gift to you.

468
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:52,179
I know where to find the kid.
Afternoons in a square.

469
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:54,899
Without the mother.

470
00:49:55,979 --> 00:49:57,300
What's her name?

471
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,540
The mother?

472
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,660
No, the daughter.

473
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,820
Your daughter's name is Luna.

474
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:07,661
Of course. Luna.

475
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:20,191
What's your name?

476
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,192
Luna.

477
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:32,193
What's the sun's name?

478
00:51:35,514 --> 00:51:37,434
- Lorenzo.
- Lorenzo.

479
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:40,194
Just like me.

480
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,395
What's the moon's name?

481
00:51:42,595 --> 00:51:43,555
You want the job?

482
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:44,675
Yes.

483
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:47,035
Then the moon's name is Luna.

484
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:57,557
Today was an important day.

485
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,759
You don't know your father?

486
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:15,679
You've never seen him?

487
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,240
Do you know his name?

488
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,160
No.

489
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,641
Don't worry, names don't matter.

490
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,041
Would you like it if

491
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:33,882
I were your dad?

492
00:52:36,842 --> 00:52:37,923
Could you be?

493
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:40,643
Yeah, if you want me to be.

494
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:43,523
But in secret.

495
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:45,444
My real father?

496
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:54,085
He thought it was a very big secret
for such a small little girl

497
00:52:54,285 --> 00:52:55,805
His smile faded

498
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:59,686
Then he went over
and sat alongside her

499
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,406
You know what happens
if someone discovers the secret

500
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:05,927
between the moon and the sun?

501
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:10,607
The tide would drop...

502
00:53:11,847 --> 00:53:12,968
and drop...

503
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:15,728
with a sound like:

504
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,010
Like mountains caving in.

505
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:40,011
Maybe someday he'd find a way
to tell her,

506
00:53:40,211 --> 00:53:43,212
so for the time being
he left it at that

507
00:53:44,212 --> 00:53:46,452
What was the point of being a father

508
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:48,453
if she didn't know?

509
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:53,773
He knew then that
if he'd told her,

510
00:53:54,453 --> 00:53:56,854
she'd have kept the secret

511
00:53:59,254 --> 00:54:00,334
Secret

512
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,656
You have a daughter?

513
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:13,736
Lorenzo, honey.

514
00:54:15,897 --> 00:54:16,857
Do you?

515
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:19,417
Why do you ask?

516
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:21,577
I saw it on your computer.

517
00:54:22,978 --> 00:54:24,178
And I loved it.

518
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:26,458
I can't keep writing it.

519
00:54:26,738 --> 00:54:27,738
Why not?

520
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:29,819
I don't know what it is
to be a father.

521
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:32,339
Then make it up.

522
00:54:46,901 --> 00:54:48,981
I'm glad you're writing again.

523
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:51,382
I was feeling guilty.

524
00:54:52,662 --> 00:54:54,142
None of it is your fault.

525
00:55:05,224 --> 00:55:07,104
Luna doesn't know her dad.

526
00:55:08,384 --> 00:55:09,984
She lives alone with her mom?

527
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:12,545
No, with a dumb soccer player.

528
00:55:15,585 --> 00:55:17,625
I've never seen my dad.

529
00:55:20,906 --> 00:55:21,986
Me, neither.

530
00:55:24,706 --> 00:55:26,467
My mother's an actress.

531
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:29,667
A porn actress.

532
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:32,988
I like that.

533
00:55:33,348 --> 00:55:35,108
She quit last year.

534
00:55:35,748 --> 00:55:37,588
She met this amazing guy

535
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:40,469
who was a client,
and fell for him.

536
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,229
Now we live together.

537
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:45,909
He retired her.

538
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,910
Sounds nice.

539
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:50,150
He's the sweetest guy...

540
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,270
He has the biggest heart ever

541
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:55,551
And he's handsome

542
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:57,671
He's really sexy

543
00:55:59,111 --> 00:56:00,311
You like him, too?

544
00:56:00,872 --> 00:56:01,752
Me?

545
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:05,192
Why? Can you tell?

546
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:11,433
You like him a lot?

547
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:14,153
Okay, drop it.

548
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:21,154
Would you do him?

549
00:56:21,354 --> 00:56:24,875
No! He's my mother's lover.

550
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,835
Poor thing,
she's in love for once.

551
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,596
Do you think he likes you?

552
00:56:37,637 --> 00:56:40,997
If he offered,
and your mom never found out?

553
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,918
Just once, as a test.

554
00:56:43,438 --> 00:56:44,878
A test, right?

555
00:56:45,998 --> 00:56:48,078
This is between you and me.

556
00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:52,559
Just once?

557
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:55,719
Yeah. Why not?

558
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,680
Because. I don't know...
I hope I never get

559
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,041
put to the test.

560
00:57:05,841 --> 00:57:07,761
But she put him to the test

561
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:11,722
One morning when her mother
was shopping,

562
00:57:12,602 --> 00:57:15,522
she took a shower
and left the door open

563
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,209
It almost happened.

564
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:06,449
What did?

565
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,850
The test. With Antonio.

566
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,491
Tell me about it.

567
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:19,291
Last night,
when they went to bed,

568
00:58:20,571 --> 00:58:23,212
I put one of my mom's movies on.

569
00:58:24,412 --> 00:58:25,852
It's strange, but...

570
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:28,693
Seeing her in action
gets me hot.

571
00:58:29,813 --> 00:58:31,413
You masturbated.

572
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:33,213
You always guess.

573
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:36,974
I took one of her dildos

574
00:58:37,174 --> 00:58:39,414
from her room while they slept.

575
00:58:42,015 --> 00:58:44,575
I lay naked on the sofa,

576
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,055
in the dark,

577
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:48,976
in front of the TV.

578
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:52,216
I started copying
her sexual positions.

579
00:59:49,704 --> 00:59:51,384
Their lust almost killed them

580
00:59:54,225 --> 00:59:55,465
He covered her mouth

581
00:59:55,665 --> 00:59:57,785
so her mother wouldn't wake up

582
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,190
We decided not to tell my mom

583
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:31,910
And to never do it again

584
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:37,391
I promised Antonio
I'd find myself a boyfriend

585
01:00:37,871 --> 01:00:40,752
right away so I'd have someone
to play with.

586
01:00:44,152 --> 01:00:47,632
Here, I'll loan you my mom
for a couple days.

587
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:56,514
I masturbated because of you,

588
01:00:56,634 --> 01:00:58,794
but ended up thinking of him.

589
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,674
But we didn't do it.

590
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:04,755
I'm not even sure I saw him

591
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,435
I just felt him

592
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:09,956
Spying on me from behind

593
01:01:11,316 --> 01:01:12,676
At least I think so.

594
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:50,001
How nice!

595
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:52,882
You never greet me this way anymore.

596
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,323
I should get home early every night.

597
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:02,563
Your mom was great.

598
01:02:03,003 --> 01:02:04,003
Quite an actress.

599
01:02:05,044 --> 01:02:06,164
You got off?

600
01:02:06,844 --> 01:02:07,764
Yes.

601
01:02:09,284 --> 01:02:10,484
If only I'd seen you

602
01:02:12,485 --> 01:02:14,605
through a hole in the wall.

603
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:17,045
Are you Belén's boyfriend?

604
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:20,806
Would you like him to be?

605
01:02:20,926 --> 01:02:22,886
Yeah, sure.

606
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,006
Then that's that.

607
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:43,969
I have to sleep

608
01:02:44,089 --> 01:02:46,649
at Luna's tonight.
Her parents are going out.

609
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,930
I can ask if my boyfriend
can come along.

610
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:55,651
She's really cool.

611
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,291
What's her name?

612
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:00,972
Elena.

613
01:03:02,372 --> 01:03:03,292
Well,

614
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:08,893
I'd prefer just to see you and Luna,
no one else.

615
01:03:18,134 --> 01:03:19,574
Why the boyfriend?

616
01:03:19,694 --> 01:03:21,414
Can't they wait?

617
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:24,415
She asked me as a special favor.
Maybe they can't.

618
01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:26,655
- They'll fuck.
- Good for them.

619
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:29,616
We don't even know him.
And in our bed?

620
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:32,896
You're just like your dog.

621
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:40,537
Hi, boyfriend.
The doors are open.

622
01:03:48,898 --> 01:03:51,859
Be nice to him
or I'll have you fixed.

623
01:03:51,979 --> 01:03:53,219
You hear me?

624
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:07,581
Delicious.

625
01:04:08,621 --> 01:04:10,021
You're a great cook.

626
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:16,502
And what do you do?

627
01:04:25,024 --> 01:04:26,384
You won't tell me?

628
01:04:34,385 --> 01:04:35,545
I'll find out later.

629
01:04:45,026 --> 01:04:46,027
I want some water.

630
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:53,588
Before I met Luna
I thought I'd never have kids.

631
01:04:56,468 --> 01:04:58,788
Wouldn't you want
a daughter like her?

632
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,309
Of course.

633
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:05,269
To me...

634
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,070
You'll always be my first.

635
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,150
And to you?

636
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,990
The first and only.

637
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:41,755
Can I watch TV?

638
01:05:44,555 --> 01:05:46,195
It's late, go to bed.

639
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:49,716
If Lorenzo tucks me in.

640
01:05:49,796 --> 01:05:52,276
You'll have to show me where.

641
01:05:55,997 --> 01:05:56,917
And a kiss?

642
01:06:23,841 --> 01:06:27,441
- Can you tell stories?
- Of course, that's my job.

643
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:56,085
Did you know that island
has the lowest moon?

644
01:06:58,725 --> 01:07:01,246
That's right.
But only a few of us

645
01:07:01,446 --> 01:07:03,806
in the world know it.
It also has

646
01:07:04,006 --> 01:07:06,847
great weather,
and it grants wishes.

647
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,807
If you need something,
the rocks below the shore

648
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,808
give it to you as a gift.

649
01:07:13,848 --> 01:07:16,568
But watch out for the holes
in the ground.

650
01:07:20,009 --> 01:07:21,809
Though it doesn't matter,
because

651
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:23,609
no one ever dies there.

652
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:27,650
For example, if you fall,
you can choose any life you want.

653
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,930
You can be your favorite fish.

654
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:58,694
The island was glad
when the girl arrived,

655
01:07:58,854 --> 01:08:00,694
especially the rocks
below the shore,

656
01:08:00,814 --> 01:08:03,335
so they decided
to give her something.

657
01:08:03,535 --> 01:08:04,455
But what?

658
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:07,415
A raft.

659
01:08:08,015 --> 01:08:09,176
Bigger.

660
01:08:10,376 --> 01:08:11,296
A dog.

661
01:08:11,616 --> 01:08:14,176
No. Something she didn't have.

662
01:08:14,816 --> 01:08:15,937
Her father.

663
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:20,137
Bull's-eye, butterfly.

664
01:08:52,342 --> 01:08:54,462
Tonight you keep watch outside.

665
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:00,583
All she had to do was

666
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:04,063
look everywhere for him
until she found him.

667
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:08,064
Her father could be
whoever she wanted.

668
01:09:10,744 --> 01:09:13,585
But then the girl had doubts,
like everyone.

669
01:09:14,105 --> 01:09:17,505
Would she choose a lighthouse keeper
or a fisherman?

670
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,746
She knew one thing:
what she really wanted

671
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:24,146
was her mother to become
a beautiful mermaid.

672
01:09:33,948 --> 01:09:35,228
She's asleep.

673
01:09:44,109 --> 01:09:46,830
Belén, I want you to know something.

674
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,670
I changed into this,
do you mind?

675
01:13:40,063 --> 01:13:42,063
Hi, it's Elena

676
01:13:42,743 --> 01:13:44,103
Is Belén there?

677
01:13:44,864 --> 01:13:45,744
Yes.

678
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:48,024
It's Elena.

679
01:13:55,825 --> 01:13:56,745
Hello?

680
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:59,586
- How are you?
- Better.

681
01:13:59,746 --> 01:14:01,586
I'm improving.

682
01:14:02,946 --> 01:14:03,986
And you?

683
01:14:04,546 --> 01:14:06,667
Well, I haven't cried.

684
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:09,987
I can't.
I haven't seen her.

685
01:14:10,147 --> 01:14:13,228
They told me,
but I don't understand.

686
01:14:13,948 --> 01:14:16,988
I don't want to imagine it.
That's why I came here.

687
01:14:17,308 --> 01:14:20,829
To be closer to her
by swimming in the sea.

688
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:25,629
Cry, Belén

689
01:14:26,309 --> 01:14:27,630
Now that you can.

690
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:34,711
It helps me to hear you cry.

691
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:38,751
That's it

692
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:40,031
Cry

693
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:41,072
Cry

694
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:42,752
You need to cry.

695
01:14:45,672 --> 01:14:47,352
She hears you, too

696
01:14:48,713 --> 01:14:51,553
A big kiss from the sea...

697
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:53,273
from both of us.

698
01:15:03,675 --> 01:15:05,875
Lately you're always in bed.

699
01:15:06,075 --> 01:15:07,635
You know what time it is?

700
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:12,916
It's a beautiful day.
Sunny and clear.

701
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:16,277
And it's my day off.

702
01:15:16,837 --> 01:15:18,677
Get up, lazybones!

703
01:15:23,038 --> 01:15:24,158
You need all

704
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:26,238
these pills just to sleep?

705
01:15:27,358 --> 01:15:30,039
You never had problems
sleeping before.

706
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:34,679
Lorenzo, honey.

707
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:39,640
I'm worried about you.
You've been depressed for days.

708
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,000
Trouble with the novel?

709
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,720
Is that it?

710
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,481
You look terrible.

711
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:49,961
Something's happened.

712
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:51,082
What?

713
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,362
You're sweating.

714
01:15:57,042 --> 01:16:00,163
I've left,
and there's no coming back.

715
01:16:00,363 --> 01:16:01,403
Your life

716
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:03,523
is more important
than your novel.

717
01:16:03,683 --> 01:16:05,044
Than any novel.

718
01:16:05,204 --> 01:16:08,484
Writing is vital to you, but
you need to take care of yourself.

719
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:13,125
You're too good a person to see
the shit I have inside.

720
01:16:13,285 --> 01:16:14,245
Stop, that's enough.

721
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,565
I have a confession.

722
01:16:15,765 --> 01:16:17,965
So you see how close I am.

723
01:16:18,926 --> 01:16:20,486
I've been reading the novel.

724
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,766
Everything you've written.

725
01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:26,047
At night, when you're asleep.
Do you mind?

726
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:27,727
I understand

727
01:16:27,927 --> 01:16:30,607
why you're so affected,
why you reject it,

728
01:16:30,807 --> 01:16:33,008
and why it's hard for you
to go on.

729
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,248
It can't be easy, living there,

730
01:16:35,448 --> 01:16:36,808
in that house,

731
01:16:37,008 --> 01:16:39,168
with that stormy relationship.

732
01:16:39,288 --> 01:16:42,889
So much repressed desire,
impossible to control.

733
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:47,210
He's coming between
a mother and her daughter,

734
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:48,970
breaking a sacred bond.

735
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:51,970
But the passion's there, too.
The lust.

736
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:00,851
I identify with her.

737
01:17:01,052 --> 01:17:03,332
I understand exactly
how she feels.

738
01:17:03,612 --> 01:17:06,252
Disgusted, guilty, selfish...

739
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:07,572
Her mom's jealousy...

740
01:17:07,772 --> 01:17:09,813
But she's forced to choose

741
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:12,293
between passionate love
for a man,

742
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:13,973
and love for a mother.

743
01:17:14,573 --> 01:17:18,294
I'd have chosen the same.
Such decisions are made

744
01:17:18,494 --> 01:17:20,174
by gut instinct.

745
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:21,334
Sex...

746
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:23,855
The thick, burning lust

747
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,415
filled the mother,

748
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:27,175
the man and the daughter.

749
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:30,056
They were sex-crazed

750
01:17:30,176 --> 01:17:31,976
The stench of raw sex

751
01:17:32,896 --> 01:17:33,896
The mother and the man,

752
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:38,777
the man and the daughter,

753
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:40,857
the daughter and the man

754
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:43,338
All the man's poisoned love...

755
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:46,258
Alone with the daughter,
the daughter and the man

756
01:17:46,418 --> 01:17:47,578
The smell was...

757
01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:50,099
heavy, hot, overwhelming

758
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,259
Stuffy

759
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:52,739
Stale air.

760
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:55,019
Exhausted

761
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:08,541
The paint fell from the corners
of the room

762
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:11,062
and the walls became rocky,

763
01:18:12,182 --> 01:18:13,982
Like those in a cave.

764
01:18:15,062 --> 01:18:17,102
A filthy den of...

765
01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:19,623
Get out!

766
01:18:21,623 --> 01:18:22,503
Relax.

767
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,224
Just wanted to let you know
that I'm here.

768
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:46,787
The man was selfish, a coward.

769
01:18:47,387 --> 01:18:51,387
He hated himself so deeply,
so utterly, there wasn't even

770
01:18:51,787 --> 01:18:53,628
time for forgiveness.

771
01:18:54,428 --> 01:18:56,148
Only time for death.

772
01:18:56,508 --> 01:18:58,108
Death, death,

773
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,909
death, death.

774
01:19:01,989 --> 01:19:03,029
Belén's fine.

775
01:19:03,269 --> 01:19:05,349
She's home with her family.

776
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:07,510
Forget the whole thing.

777
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,270
You've suffered enough.

778
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:12,710
Will I ever read the novel?

779
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:13,830
Of course.

780
01:19:17,471 --> 01:19:18,551
Another thing.

781
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:21,792
Tell me about Elena, too.

782
01:19:22,192 --> 01:19:24,072
My sister writes to her on-line.

783
01:19:24,272 --> 01:19:27,272
She's on that Mediterranean
cooking chat everyday.

784
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:29,633
- Her user name is "Alsi".
- "Alsi"?

785
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:30,713
A-L-S-l.

786
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:35,554
That's Spanish
for "island" backwards.

787
01:19:35,954 --> 01:19:37,754
Hi, Alsi How are you?

788
01:19:40,754 --> 01:19:42,155
I don't know you.

789
01:19:42,835 --> 01:19:45,595
It's better that way.
I'm here to help.

790
01:19:48,235 --> 01:19:49,276
What's your user name?

791
01:19:49,396 --> 01:19:51,196
I don't understand the icon.

792
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:54,156
It's a lighthouse for your island.

793
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,716
Are you the keeper?

794
01:19:56,037 --> 01:19:57,037
Yeah.

795
01:19:58,637 --> 01:20:01,997
I have a story for you,
it's full of advantages.

796
01:20:02,918 --> 01:20:04,078
I'd like that.

797
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:06,918
Thanks.

798
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:12,879
The first advantage
is at the end of the story.

799
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:16,199
It doesn't finish,
it falls in a hole.

800
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,720
And the story
starts again halfway.

801
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,161
The other advantage,
and the biggest,

802
01:20:25,961 --> 01:20:29,001
is that you can change course
along the way

803
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:32,082
If you let me.
If you give me time.

804
01:20:34,442 --> 01:20:37,362
All the time you want.

805
01:20:38,763 --> 01:20:40,403
Go on, please

806
01:21:14,808 --> 01:21:16,088
To be continued

807
01:21:24,889 --> 01:21:27,170
What happened?
Why are you so late?

808
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:29,290
My boss invited me to dinner.

809
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:32,010
He wanted me to try a new dish.

810
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:33,850
Did you screw him?

811
01:21:34,371 --> 01:21:35,451
What?

812
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:38,491
Did you go to bed with him?

813
01:21:42,492 --> 01:21:45,532
That's right, you guessed it.

814
01:21:50,213 --> 01:21:52,053
And how was it?

815
01:21:52,453 --> 01:21:54,493
- Tell me about it.
- No.

816
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:56,094
You first.

817
01:21:57,014 --> 01:21:58,414
What's going on?

818
01:21:58,614 --> 01:21:59,854
What's your problem?

819
01:22:00,734 --> 01:22:02,815
I lost track of you ages ago.

820
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,815
You're not alive!

821
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:07,695
Was it the first time with him?

822
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,176
The second.

823
01:22:11,096 --> 01:22:13,216
The first was before we met.

824
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:15,736
Or should I say
before I proposed?

825
01:22:16,217 --> 01:22:17,817
So it doesn't count.

826
01:22:20,297 --> 01:22:23,698
You could have told me before.

827
01:22:24,378 --> 01:22:26,258
Yeah, I could have.

828
01:22:27,738 --> 01:22:28,658
And today?

829
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:31,299
Well...

830
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:34,339
It doesn't count, either.

831
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:35,619
It's a lie.

832
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,260
But we came close.

833
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,060
How close?

834
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,901
Did you stop or did he?

835
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:47,861
What about you stopping with me?

836
01:22:59,103 --> 01:23:02,263
Lorenzo, do you love me?

837
01:23:03,263 --> 01:23:06,584
I need to hear you say it
right now.

838
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:13,065
Yes. Deeply.

839
01:23:14,065 --> 01:23:16,585
More than myself. But I'm lost.

840
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:19,746
Then let me help you.

841
01:23:20,106 --> 01:23:21,706
You don't deserve this.

842
01:23:21,906 --> 01:23:24,226
Why not? I'm your girlfriend,

843
01:23:25,106 --> 01:23:27,227
and I love you more than myself.

844
01:23:27,347 --> 01:23:29,987
Come on, it's obvious.
You're draining my life away.

845
01:23:30,147 --> 01:23:33,468
I'm doing all I can to get back,
and accept myself,

846
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:35,388
but if I can't,

847
01:23:35,948 --> 01:23:37,708
don't wait for me.

848
01:23:39,508 --> 01:23:41,349
I wouldn't, either.

849
01:23:43,029 --> 01:23:44,509
What happened to you?

850
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:52,070
Belén, it's Elena.

851
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:55,151
How are you?

852
01:23:56,871 --> 01:23:58,151
It's real hot here.

853
01:23:58,351 --> 01:24:00,831
Why don't you come out?
The sea will do you good

854
01:24:01,032 --> 01:24:03,712
I have a guesthouse
for the whole summer.

855
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:07,472
I'll have a room free in August.
Upstairs.

856
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:10,073
My best room.
You'll watch the sunset

857
01:24:10,233 --> 01:24:13,113
from your bed.
Bring someone if you want.

858
01:24:13,713 --> 01:24:14,593
Well?

859
01:24:14,994 --> 01:24:18,034
The truth is,
I'd love to visit an island...

860
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:20,754
with someone.

861
01:24:21,194 --> 01:24:22,355
Then that's it

862
01:24:23,835 --> 01:24:26,115
- It's difficult, Elena.
- Difficult?

863
01:24:26,315 --> 01:24:29,476
Nothing is here
All the bad's left behind

864
01:24:29,676 --> 01:24:31,956
- Just bring along the good
- Right.

865
01:24:33,516 --> 01:24:34,756
The good up front.

866
01:24:35,636 --> 01:24:37,157
I really want to see you,

867
01:24:37,357 --> 01:24:38,277
but here

868
01:24:39,357 --> 01:24:41,197
I don't want to lose touch

869
01:24:43,598 --> 01:24:45,078
Say you'll come

870
01:24:46,078 --> 01:24:47,158
Promise me

871
01:24:49,598 --> 01:24:50,679
I promise.

872
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,399
I'll try.

873
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:54,599
Good bye.

874
01:25:26,404 --> 01:25:29,164
Forgive me, Lucía.
I've got to end this.

875
01:25:31,164 --> 01:25:34,205
I'm going to kill them
for once and for all.

876
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:35,925
Both of them.

877
01:25:37,845 --> 01:25:38,845
Right now.

878
01:25:57,848 --> 01:26:00,769
If you've stopped being a writer,
you have to

879
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:02,049
explain why.

880
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:05,409
You're holding back.

881
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,330
If you don't tell me,

882
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,770
I'll never forgive you!

883
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:14,411
You hear me? Never!

884
01:26:14,811 --> 01:26:15,971
I can't talk like this.

885
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,051
Talk?

886
01:26:18,571 --> 01:26:21,052
You're the one who won't talk.

887
01:26:22,012 --> 01:26:23,852
You keep it all inside.

888
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,972
You won't let me help you.

889
01:26:26,412 --> 01:26:27,652
Everything's you.

890
01:26:27,812 --> 01:26:29,613
I'm crumpled up in the corner.

891
01:26:30,573 --> 01:26:31,493
Look.

892
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:33,413
You were meant to live alone,

893
01:26:35,054 --> 01:26:36,294
and to suffer alone.

894
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:40,614
And to drive yourself fucking crazy,
which I don't understand.

895
01:26:41,414 --> 01:26:43,095
You're sick, Lorenzo.

896
01:26:43,535 --> 01:26:47,935
Sick of yourself, of your
own standards, and nothing else.

897
01:26:48,655 --> 01:26:50,296
Of your fucking secrets!

898
01:26:50,736 --> 01:26:53,256
You keep me around,
but in the dark.

899
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:56,217
Because my complaints
don't count.

900
01:26:56,977 --> 01:26:58,337
Because you don't give

901
01:26:58,497 --> 01:27:00,337
a fuck what happens to me.

902
01:27:00,497 --> 01:27:02,257
Your troubles are so deep,

903
01:27:02,657 --> 01:27:04,138
I'm fucking stupid,

904
01:27:04,338 --> 01:27:07,018
and all you care about
is if I screw my boss or not.

905
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:14,299
I'm exhausted.

906
01:27:15,219 --> 01:27:16,579
You're driving me nuts.

907
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,500
I'll be late to work.

908
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,460
Enjoy your hole.

909
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:26,661
Have fun rotting by yourself.

910
01:27:35,062 --> 01:27:37,382
Look, I've never been this mean

911
01:27:37,582 --> 01:27:38,783
to anyone.

912
01:27:39,943 --> 01:27:42,223
It's the last time
I'll let myself talk like this.

913
01:27:42,743 --> 01:27:44,383
It's for me, not you.

914
01:27:47,864 --> 01:27:48,944
That's right.

915
01:27:50,904 --> 01:27:53,025
It's time to think of myself,

916
01:27:53,545 --> 01:27:54,945
of my own needs.

917
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:58,545
Because I see no future with you.

918
01:28:48,353 --> 01:28:49,073
Lucía!

919
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:53,833
Come over here
and lie next to me.

920
01:29:25,358 --> 01:29:26,878
Relax, Lucía.

921
01:29:27,518 --> 01:29:30,039
Let the mud absorb all the bad.

922
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:33,279
Later it'll wash away in the sea.

923
01:30:07,524 --> 01:30:08,804
I don't want sex.

924
01:30:11,204 --> 01:30:12,685
I'm not ready yet.

925
01:30:22,406 --> 01:30:23,646
Don't worry.

926
01:30:26,407 --> 01:30:28,447
We'll just lie here,

927
01:30:30,567 --> 01:30:32,327
drying out in the sun.

928
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,849
Yeah, he looks like Carlos.

929
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:54,371
"Missing for 6 months".

930
01:30:54,891 --> 01:30:57,011
"Manuela and Belén Lozano,
mother and daughter,

931
01:30:57,211 --> 01:30:59,971
and Antonio Castillo,
were all living together.

932
01:31:00,171 --> 01:31:04,532
If anyone knows where they are,
please contact the police."

933
01:31:05,012 --> 01:31:06,052
The police?

934
01:31:06,172 --> 01:31:07,372
We'll...

935
01:31:08,012 --> 01:31:09,813
act like we didn't see this,

936
01:31:10,573 --> 01:31:12,293
Like nothing's happened.

937
01:31:16,854 --> 01:31:18,694
We know he lived with two women.

938
01:31:19,094 --> 01:31:20,614
Mother and daughter.

939
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,455
Yeah, and the daughter...

940
01:31:24,495 --> 01:31:25,335
What?

941
01:31:27,255 --> 01:31:29,936
The daughter was taking care of...

942
01:31:30,576 --> 01:31:31,816
my daughter.

943
01:31:42,457 --> 01:31:44,458
They left without him,

944
01:31:44,818 --> 01:31:47,098
quietly, without saying good bye

945
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:49,338
As he slept,

946
01:31:49,498 --> 01:31:50,739
Like in a dream

947
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:53,819
When he woke, he felt
the two lifeless women

948
01:31:54,499 --> 01:31:55,819
were still with him,

949
01:31:56,659 --> 01:31:57,940
Like any morning

950
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,660
at that hour

951
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:02,940
And he lay still,
wishing his life would also

952
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:06,061
leave him, through his blood

953
01:32:06,741 --> 01:32:08,861
What good was his blood now?

954
01:32:09,861 --> 01:32:12,342
He wished it softly,
without real intent

955
01:32:13,182 --> 01:32:15,262
And he chose to escape,
to start over,

956
01:32:15,742 --> 01:32:16,862
to be new

957
01:32:17,062 --> 01:32:18,863
To change his blood

958
01:32:19,063 --> 01:32:20,383
So he said good bye

959
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:22,063
and left

960
01:32:26,304 --> 01:32:28,144
We should give him a chance.

961
01:32:30,304 --> 01:32:32,145
Don't we all deserve one?

962
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,185
Just in case, if in doubt,

963
01:32:37,225 --> 01:32:39,346
isn't it better to trust people?

964
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:40,786
Right?

965
01:32:43,866 --> 01:32:46,747
So when he gets back,
we'll ask him to explain.

966
01:32:47,387 --> 01:32:48,787
It's better this way.

967
01:32:49,547 --> 01:32:51,707
- Especially for you.
- For me?

968
01:32:52,347 --> 01:32:54,228
I just want to forget.

969
01:32:55,588 --> 01:32:57,428
You can't forget some things.

970
01:32:57,548 --> 01:33:00,629
In this house you can.
That's why we're here.

971
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:03,509
Then it's too late.

972
01:33:04,549 --> 01:33:06,709
I should have come before.

973
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:09,470
When there was time...

974
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:13,750
for Lorenzo.

975
01:33:16,671 --> 01:33:19,071
I wanted him to show me
the island.

976
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:22,552
I asked him to, but he wouldn't.

977
01:33:25,192 --> 01:33:27,432
It would have been
his birthday soon.

978
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:35,033
- What day?
- The 23rd.

979
01:33:45,515 --> 01:33:46,315
Of May?

980
01:33:52,436 --> 01:33:54,156
We could have celebrated

981
01:33:54,476 --> 01:33:55,836
here on the island.

982
01:33:56,077 --> 01:33:57,157
Maybe even with you.

983
01:33:58,517 --> 01:33:59,557
Who knows if

984
01:33:59,757 --> 01:34:01,637
we'd have met, right?

985
01:34:02,357 --> 01:34:03,238
Right.

986
01:34:05,998 --> 01:34:07,358
When was Lorenzo here?

987
01:34:09,318 --> 01:34:10,599
A long time ago.

988
01:34:11,959 --> 01:34:13,439
Before we met.

989
01:34:13,799 --> 01:34:14,879
How long ago?

990
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:17,720
About six years ago.

991
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,600
Yeah.

992
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,280
I think he turned 25 here.

993
01:34:24,121 --> 01:34:25,001
Lucía...

994
01:34:26,481 --> 01:34:27,401
What is it?

995
01:34:29,681 --> 01:34:31,162
I'm overwhelmed...

996
01:34:31,562 --> 01:34:33,362
But I can't cry.

997
01:34:34,522 --> 01:34:35,562
Don't worry.

998
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,522
You don't have to.

999
01:34:38,363 --> 01:34:40,643
I'm the one
who should cry over him.

1000
01:34:48,364 --> 01:34:49,764
I'll just faint, then.

1001
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:53,285
It's the sea.

1002
01:34:53,845 --> 01:34:55,565
Must be high tide.

1003
01:35:06,927 --> 01:35:08,567
I'll never cry again.

1004
01:35:12,527 --> 01:35:13,848
I'm going to bed.

1005
01:35:24,689 --> 01:35:25,769
What's going on?

1006
01:36:10,696 --> 01:36:11,936
"Luna,

1007
01:36:12,136 --> 01:36:14,256
spring of 1988".

1008
01:36:18,497 --> 01:36:19,417
Luna.

1009
01:36:30,939 --> 01:36:33,379
"Why bother being a father

1010
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:35,619
if she didn't know?"

1011
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:40,060
He knew then that
if he'd told her,

1012
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,940
she'd have kept the secret

1013
01:36:47,941 --> 01:36:50,021
Lucía, never talk to me
about this.

1014
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:52,342
I don't want to hear it.

1015
01:37:04,703 --> 01:37:05,784
Well, I do.

1016
01:38:05,192 --> 01:38:06,592
He's out diving.

1017
01:38:09,033 --> 01:38:10,433
Beneath the island.

1018
01:38:13,193 --> 01:38:14,593
Do you like Carlos?

1019
01:38:16,434 --> 01:38:17,834
I don't anymore.

1020
01:38:18,354 --> 01:38:22,034
Go ahead, he's all yours.
I won't even be jealous.

1021
01:38:27,115 --> 01:38:28,435
What are you doing?

1022
01:38:30,316 --> 01:38:32,036
Asking a friend for advice.

1023
01:38:32,236 --> 01:38:33,556
I don't know him,

1024
01:38:33,836 --> 01:38:35,876
but I'm getting to like him.

1025
01:38:41,757 --> 01:38:45,078
He's been writing me since
I got here. He made up

1026
01:38:45,278 --> 01:38:47,398
a sweet story to help me.

1027
01:38:47,798 --> 01:38:49,638
He taught me to forget.

1028
01:38:49,838 --> 01:38:51,279
And to escape pain.

1029
01:38:54,199 --> 01:38:55,239
Want to read it?

1030
01:38:56,479 --> 01:38:57,720
You could get into it.

1031
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,440
It's full of advantages.

1032
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,280
Because in the end...

1033
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,880
there's a hole

1034
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:06,281
to escape through.

1035
01:39:12,402 --> 01:39:13,642
Back to the middle.

1036
01:39:15,602 --> 01:39:17,362
To change course,

1037
01:39:18,643 --> 01:39:19,643
if you want.

1038
01:39:26,524 --> 01:39:29,804
That's his icon,
it's a lighthouse.

1039
01:39:31,844 --> 01:39:33,885
But it has no keeper,

1040
01:39:34,805 --> 01:39:36,845
it must be a computer.

1041
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:39,646
Maybe his.

1042
01:39:47,287 --> 01:39:49,327
You'll meet my daughter.

1043
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:55,728
I can't read this.

1044
01:39:56,088 --> 01:39:57,088
Why not?

1045
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:03,569
It will grab me.

1046
01:40:04,449 --> 01:40:05,929
And won't let go.

1047
01:40:06,409 --> 01:40:07,650
That's good.

1048
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:10,850
Did you finally do it?

1049
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,210
Do what?

1050
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:13,810
Change course?

1051
01:40:15,371 --> 01:40:18,251
Not all the way,
there wasn't time.

1052
01:40:19,131 --> 01:40:20,731
That's why I'm writing him.

1053
01:40:23,172 --> 01:40:25,652
WHERE'S THE KEEPER?

1054
01:40:26,892 --> 01:40:28,092
Don't write him.

1055
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:34,293
There's nothing more he can do.

1056
01:40:42,815 --> 01:40:45,815
Has he written you
since I first got here?

1057
01:41:51,024 --> 01:41:53,825
Hi, Lorenzo. How are you?

1058
01:41:55,465 --> 01:41:57,105
Your face says it all.

1059
01:41:57,265 --> 01:41:59,466
They called to say
you were more awake.

1060
01:42:02,986 --> 01:42:04,226
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:42:05,546 --> 01:42:06,307
Pepe.

1062
01:42:07,787 --> 01:42:08,907
Thank God.

1063
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:15,108
Glad to have you back.
You'll be writing in no time.

1064
01:42:16,748 --> 01:42:17,988
Where's Lucía?

1065
01:42:23,069 --> 01:42:24,589
It says here that

1066
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:27,350
your cranial hematoma
has subsided.

1067
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:31,430
And the rest of your bruises
are history.

1068
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:33,870
Where's Lucía?

1069
01:42:38,351 --> 01:42:40,071
You were in bad shape.

1070
01:42:41,752 --> 01:42:44,072
We didn't think you'd make it.

1071
01:42:45,872 --> 01:42:47,032
How long have I been here?

1072
01:42:48,112 --> 01:42:49,113
Well...

1073
01:42:50,673 --> 01:42:52,473
One week in a coma,

1074
01:42:53,073 --> 01:42:55,314
with this horrible respirator...

1075
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:57,514
And two more weeks

1076
01:42:57,954 --> 01:43:01,034
breathing on your own,
but unconscious.

1077
01:43:01,914 --> 01:43:05,275
And in this room
since four or five days ago,

1078
01:43:06,435 --> 01:43:08,715
blabbering in your sleep.

1079
01:43:09,155 --> 01:43:11,996
And when you'd wake up,
you were out of it.

1080
01:43:17,237 --> 01:43:19,637
We haven't heard from Lucía.

1081
01:43:20,317 --> 01:43:22,317
I looked everywhere.

1082
01:43:22,677 --> 01:43:26,318
She hasn't been to your place,
nor the restaurant, since the night

1083
01:43:26,518 --> 01:43:27,518
of your accident.

1084
01:43:35,479 --> 01:43:36,439
Lorenzo.

1085
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,360
I think Lucía
believes you're dead.

1086
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,840
That's why she left.

1087
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,681
I talked to the ambulance guy.

1088
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:48,641
He said a cop called your house

1089
01:43:48,841 --> 01:43:50,081
and talked to her.

1090
01:43:50,281 --> 01:43:52,122
He mentioned the car

1091
01:43:52,442 --> 01:43:53,522
and she hung up.

1092
01:43:55,002 --> 01:43:56,282
He tried to call back

1093
01:43:57,442 --> 01:43:58,843
but she wouldn't answer.

1094
01:44:01,003 --> 01:44:02,323
I need to pee.

1095
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:04,563
Do it there,

1096
01:44:04,763 --> 01:44:06,644
- in the pan.
- No way!

1097
01:44:06,884 --> 01:44:08,004
Wait, wait.

1098
01:44:08,444 --> 01:44:10,684
Thanks, Pepe, but I can manage.

1099
01:44:13,885 --> 01:44:15,605
Lose the attitude.

1100
01:44:15,845 --> 01:44:18,165
I've helped you all week.

1101
01:44:18,605 --> 01:44:20,126
You just don't remember.

1102
01:44:37,328 --> 01:44:38,688
I know where she might be.

1103
01:44:41,409 --> 01:44:42,449
You came by car?

1104
01:44:44,169 --> 01:44:45,769
As soon as they called.

1105
01:45:11,413 --> 01:45:12,493
Good morning.

1106
01:45:13,453 --> 01:45:16,094
Tell me right now why
you're here and Belén isn't.

1107
01:45:19,054 --> 01:45:20,094
You see?

1108
01:45:20,294 --> 01:45:23,495
I don't want to forget anymore.
Thanks to you, honey.

1109
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:27,295
Well?

1110
01:45:27,975 --> 01:45:29,416
Won't you answer me?

1111
01:45:31,016 --> 01:45:34,496
It's time to show you who
I really am, no more stories.

1112
01:45:34,736 --> 01:45:37,577
Were you there with Belén,
in my room,

1113
01:45:40,937 --> 01:45:43,778
when that fucking dog
killed my daughter?

1114
01:45:45,178 --> 01:45:46,898
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't?

1115
01:45:47,098 --> 01:45:49,858
Then why are the cops
looking for you?

1116
01:45:53,419 --> 01:45:55,019
Belén was with some guy

1117
01:45:55,219 --> 01:45:58,220
who met her in the park
with your daughter.

1118
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:02,820
But he disappeared
after that night.

1119
01:46:13,342 --> 01:46:14,502
What about Belén?

1120
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:16,782
Where is she?
Since you know everything.

1121
01:46:18,263 --> 01:46:21,423
She left with her mom
but didn't tell me where.

1122
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:25,864
She changed in the end,
and chose her mom over me.

1123
01:46:30,864 --> 01:46:32,265
Can't blame her.

1124
01:46:32,945 --> 01:46:35,385
A mother always comes first.

1125
01:46:38,705 --> 01:46:42,026
I don't trust you anymore,
Antonio...

1126
01:46:43,506 --> 01:46:45,946
I won't ask you
any more questions.

1127
01:46:46,146 --> 01:46:47,987
I'll leave that to the police.

1128
01:46:48,627 --> 01:46:50,427
Lying to them won't be so easy.

1129
01:46:51,507 --> 01:46:53,868
Look how brave I got
all of a sudden.

1130
01:46:54,228 --> 01:46:54,908
Wait.

1131
01:46:56,308 --> 01:46:59,188
Please don't call the police.

1132
01:47:00,188 --> 01:47:01,229
Why not?

1133
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,669
Are you holding back
anything else?

1134
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:08,590
I've no one left

1135
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,750
who I can trust.

1136
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:13,590
Where are you going?

1137
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:15,391
Making a getaway?

1138
01:47:15,591 --> 01:47:17,391
They'll track you down!

1139
01:47:18,551 --> 01:47:19,951
If you call the cops,

1140
01:47:21,312 --> 01:47:22,552
I'll leave, too.

1141
01:47:23,192 --> 01:47:24,192
Are you stupid?

1142
01:47:24,672 --> 01:47:25,552
Yes.

1143
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,601
Where are you going?

1144
01:48:25,641 --> 01:48:26,721
I don't understand.

1145
01:48:27,561 --> 01:48:30,761
I trust Carlos, and I believe him.
I want to know more.

1146
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:32,602
That's the easy part.

1147
01:48:33,122 --> 01:48:34,762
Believing what you want.

1148
01:48:35,042 --> 01:48:36,282
What pleases you.

1149
01:48:36,482 --> 01:48:38,523
I did that, too.
Until tonight.

1150
01:48:38,723 --> 01:48:40,483
I'll chase whomever I please!

1151
01:48:41,283 --> 01:48:43,643
Men matter less and less to me.

1152
01:48:43,883 --> 01:48:44,883
That's my lot.

1153
01:48:45,564 --> 01:48:47,164
They've never given me anything.

1154
01:48:47,564 --> 01:48:48,604
Except sex.

1155
01:48:48,844 --> 01:48:51,484
No? What about the keeper?

1156
01:48:52,965 --> 01:48:54,525
What? Besides wild sex

1157
01:48:54,725 --> 01:48:55,765
and a daughter?

1158
01:48:57,365 --> 01:48:58,765
Don't forget that story

1159
01:48:58,965 --> 01:49:01,726
full of advantages that
he wrote just for you!

1160
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:03,486
That's right.

1161
01:49:04,206 --> 01:49:06,206
Maybe your boyfriend
was the last

1162
01:49:06,407 --> 01:49:08,167
- good man on earth.
- No, he wasn't.

1163
01:49:09,527 --> 01:49:12,647
You're wrong,
but that's my business.

1164
01:49:13,127 --> 01:49:15,968
And I suppose Carlos
is also your business.

1165
01:49:16,368 --> 01:49:17,568
Yours alone.

1166
01:49:18,088 --> 01:49:20,048
You're the only one chasing him.

1167
01:49:21,489 --> 01:49:22,369
Yeah.

1168
01:49:23,249 --> 01:49:24,729
Come to think of it,

1169
01:49:24,929 --> 01:49:27,490
I always chase men.
When I like them.

1170
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:29,610
To each his own, right?

1171
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,411
Where could he be?

1172
01:49:36,651 --> 01:49:39,211
I don't know. I'm going home.

1173
01:49:39,411 --> 01:49:41,131
You guys cook tonight.

1174
01:52:50,198 --> 01:52:51,759
I'm so sorry.

1175
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:09,210
Carlos! It's me, Lucía.

1176
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,370
I want to come down.

1177
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:14,331
Come and help me.

1178
01:54:15,291 --> 01:54:17,851
I know how to dive, too.
What did you think?

1179
01:54:23,612 --> 01:54:25,572
Lucía. It's me, Elena.

1180
01:54:36,774 --> 01:54:37,854
Where's Carlos?

1181
01:54:38,254 --> 01:54:39,534
Down there.

1182
01:54:39,854 --> 01:54:41,134
Did he escape?

1183
01:54:43,295 --> 01:54:44,335
Maybe he's dead.

1184
01:54:48,575 --> 01:54:51,976
If he turns up,
we have to believe him, okay?

1185
01:54:53,016 --> 01:54:54,336
Whatever you want.

1186
01:54:54,976 --> 01:54:56,056
That's right.

1187
01:54:57,257 --> 01:54:58,457
He's a crab.

1188
01:55:01,897 --> 01:55:02,977
Let's go home.

1189
01:55:03,217 --> 01:55:04,178
What for?

1190
01:55:04,418 --> 01:55:05,418
To eat.

1191
01:55:05,658 --> 01:55:06,418
So early?

1192
01:55:08,058 --> 01:55:09,098
I'm not hungry.

1193
01:55:09,498 --> 01:55:12,099
Tough. It's about time
you helped me cook.

1194
01:55:13,699 --> 01:55:16,979
We'll make a special meal
and we'll be together

1195
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:19,060
and have fun.

1196
01:55:35,582 --> 01:55:37,622
You're a gift to this earth.

1197
01:55:38,863 --> 01:55:41,943
Elena. You're crying.

1198
01:55:45,303 --> 01:55:48,424
Tears of happiness,
which is what I am from now on.

1199
01:55:48,624 --> 01:55:50,584
Great. I hope it's contagious.

1200
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:52,385
Piece of cake.
Let's go.

1201
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:57,171
The first advantage
is at the end of the story

1202
01:58:57,371 --> 01:58:58,331
It doesn't finish,

1203
01:58:58,531 --> 01:59:00,371
it falls in a hole

1204
01:59:04,572 --> 01:59:06,812
And the story
starts again halfway.

1205
01:59:08,332 --> 01:59:11,213
The other advantage,
and the biggest,

1206
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:14,933
is that you can change course
along the way...

1207
01:59:15,093 --> 01:59:18,014
If you let me.
If you give me time.

1208
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:02,060
A ray of sunshine...
