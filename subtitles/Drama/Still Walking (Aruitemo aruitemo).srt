1
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,747
Radishes are genius.

2
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,457
How about potatoes?

3
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,460
With potatoes,
it's up to the cook.

4
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,713
Radishes you can simmer or grill.

5
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,840
They're even delicious raw.

6
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,259
You don't grill radishes.

7
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,386
Sure, you do.

8
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,932
If you simmer and then grill it,
it loses its tartness.

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,312
Then you mix it with carrots
and sauté with sesame oil.

10
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,439
Sesame oil, right.

11
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,108
Better write it down,
you'll forget.

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,444
No need, I'll never cook it.

13
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,656
My husband grew up on fast food.
He'll eat anything.

14
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,450
Then, why'd you ask?

15
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,661
I thought you might
want to talk, Mom.

16
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:21,790
In that case, move your hands,
not your mouth.

17
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,833
It's nearly lunchtime.

18
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:30,799
Can you go buy some low fat milk
at the store?

19
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,927
Daddy.

20
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,514
Ouch.
He can at least buy milk.

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,310
He doesn't want the neighbors
to see him with a shopping bag.

22
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,311
What?

23
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,481
Even, at his, age, he wants
'to be called "Doctor"

24
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,109
I can't believe that.

25
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,071
You spoil him too much, Mom

26
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,200
Yokoyama Clinic.

27
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,795
Good morning.

28
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,174
Don't you wish the weather
would cool down, Doctor?

29
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,679
It's supposed to be another
scorcher, today.

30
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,516
When it's this hot, I can
hardly stand to drink water.

31
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,853
Cold noodles is all I can eat.

32
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:30,108
That's not good. You should
eat some eel, for your health.

33
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:35,113
I have a feeling my time
could be up any day now.

34
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,701
When it is, I want you
to be there for my death.

35
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,538
In that case,
I've got to outlive you.

36
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,707
See you.

37
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,084
Please, enjoy your walk.

38
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:13,818
ABE Hiroshi

40
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:46,184

KORE EDA Hirokazu

46
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:30,205
STILL WALKING

47
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,683
Let's take the last train home.

48
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,103
If we leave at 8PM
we can make it

49
00:05:55,271 --> 00:06:00,235
I told them we'd spend the night
Brought a change of clothes, too.

50
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,531
Can't you make up
an emergency PTA meeting?

51
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,909
No?

52
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,663
You're always blaming
someone else.

53
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,541
There's nothing to talk about
with them.

54
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,420
Dad still thinks I'm
a huge baseball fan.

55
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,798
You like baseball, Ryo?

56
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,884
I used to, long, long ago.

57
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,263
I want you to know,

58
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:33,309
I'm the one that's really nervous.
Though I doubt you notice.

59
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,563
I know, I know.

60
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,904
They say he even moved
near the race track.

61
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,033
It's a sickness, then.

62
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,243
As they get older, their bodies

63
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,913
can't keep up with women
and drink,

64
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,541
but not so with gambling.

65
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,918
It's the worst vice.

66
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,171
How awful.

67
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,971
You still have sparrows out here.

68
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,559
They show up because
your father feeds them rice.

69
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,270
We only have crows.

70
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:21,816
On garbage pick up days,
they're waiting like this.

71
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,485
Peel off all the skin.

72
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,487
Oh, there's some left.

73
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,824
You're such a pretty girl.
Show off your forehead.

74
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,329
When's Ryo coming?

75
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,374
On the phone he said,
by noon.

76
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,336
Is the "Unsmiling Prince,"
coming, too?

77
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,630
Yes, they're spending the night.

78
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,715
What a surprise.

79
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,136
But you know,

80
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,848
he didn't have to go
for a used model.

81
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,934
That sounds so cruel.

82
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,394
And besides,

83
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,190
it's better to marry a divorcee
than a widow.

84
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:07,362
At least a divorcee
chose to leave her husband.

85
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,782
You sound so scary
sometimes, Mom.

86
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,951
I'm just stating the obvious.

87
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,371
It's because you pushed him
so hard to get married.

88
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,332
Maybe, but he could have
had his pick

89
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,211
Ryo wasn't as popular
as his older brother.

90
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,421
That's not true.

91
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:29,426
At his graduation, all his
buttons were torn off.

92
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,177
He probably got beat up.

93
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:36,391
That's not true
All his lower, classmates wanted them.

94
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,437
He said there was
a long line of girls.

95
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,733
Parental pride can be blinding
Better watch out myself.

96
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,237
It's only been 3 years.

97
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,282
Since her first one died.

98
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,701
Isn't it 4 years ago?

99
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,703
In any case, it's too soon.

100
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,580
You think?

101
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,415
She's just cold

102
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,958
I'm not so sure

103
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,543
I am.

104
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,504
You've never worked
outside the house, Mom.

105
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,759
You don't know how hard
it is to be a single mom.

106
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:15,555
There you go, making fun
of me for "not working".

107
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,932
I'm not making fun of you.

108
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,770
Besides, after we put you
through college,

109
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,148
you only worked 3 years.

110
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,818
Four, it was 4 years.

111
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,540
Please bring it up
with your older sister.

112
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,419
About moving.

113
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,802
Shouldn't you discuss things with her?
Like about your father.

114
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,221
I'm sure she's got it figured out.

115
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,974
I'm not planning on moving back.

116
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,645
Although it'd be great
if they looked after them.

117
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:08,358
That's not likely.
You are, the eldest son.

118
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,361
I'm the second oldest son.

119
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,909
What's that?

120
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,286
Coca cola and ginger ale.

121
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,288
Drink them separately.

122
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,376
They have 'free refills
Don't, act so poor.

123
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,352
Say, how's school?

124
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,187
Average.

125
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,399
Average?

126
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,192
Yeah.

127
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,529
Listen.

128
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,951
Your mother told me yesterday,
about the rabbit.

129
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,747
Why did you laugh when it died?

130
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,749
It was funny.

131
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,042
What was?

132
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:12,297
Rena started saying we should
write letters to the rabbit.

133
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,593
What's wrong with writing letters?

134
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,095
Letters no one will read?

135
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,805
Your iced tea is
so delicious, Grandma.

136
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,307
They're just supermarket teabags

137
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,602
I used to steep my own, but.

138
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,855
Oh, I see.
lt must be the water, then.

139
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,649
It's just tap water.

140
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,068
You'll drink anything.

141
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,446
As long as you like it,
it doesn't matter.

142
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,656
Right?

143
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,033
What did you eat last night?

144
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:22,951
Sushi!

145
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:23,827
Hey!

146
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,496
I told you we're having
sushi for lunch.

147
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,790
Just the sushi that goes around

148
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,458
36 plates!

149
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,419
A new record!

150
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,130
Some record.

151
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,132
The pudding went around, too.

152
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,510
There's pudding
that goes around?

153
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,594
Melon, too!

154
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,599
I ordered some sushi just in case.
But if you just ate some yesterday.

155
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,560
It's fine, I haven't had any.

156
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,478
We can eat sushi everyday.

157
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,604
Everyday.

158
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:56,026
After the son took over at Matsu Sushi,
the fish isn't as good.

159
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:57,652
Is that so?

160
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,737
All done.

161
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:03,158
But they wrap their sea urchin
in cucumber, not seaweed

162
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,701
I like that.

163
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,246
Does sea urchin come with Sushi Deluxe?
That's what I ordered.

164
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,873
Maybe I'll call them.

165
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,667
Oh, don't bother.

166
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,629
Only one.
Don't spoil your appetite.

167
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,841
Oh, let them
That's what I bought them for.

168
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:24,346
You're lucky you don't get
scolded in Grandma's house

169
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,014
I love Grandma's house!

170
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,891
Too bad.

171
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,728
Without the "house" you
would've gotten another one.

172
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:32,729
Red bean, too.

173
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,189
That's for Grandma.

174
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,523
Oh, sorry.

175
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,068
You don't like red bean, do you?

176
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:52,957
Couldn't you stop
calling him Ryo?

177
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,964
If only for today.
To help your mother out.

178
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,092
But Ryo is just Ryo.

179
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,804
You know better.

180
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,847
You do it on purpose.

181
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,268
Tonami doesn't answer.

182
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,313
Publishers are probably closed
on Saturdays.

183
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,566
Call him back Monday.

184
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,530
Don't say anything
to them about my job.

185
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,242
Please.

186
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,787
If we make it through today,
we won't see them for a while.

187
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:35,208
They're your parents.
Don't be so defensive.

188
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,751
That's exactly why

189
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,005
I refuse to say I'm between jobs.
Not to him.

190
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,716
Oh, no.

191
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:47,387
You just get so defensive
about your father.

192
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,102
C'mon, carry one.

193
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,152
Hello.

194
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,446
That's "I'm home," right?

195
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,780
Nice to see you.

196
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,991
You're welcome.
lsn't it hot?

197
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,325
Hello.

198
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,453
What good manners you have.

199
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,871
You left this behind

200
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:17,083
I'm so sorry, he's always leaving
something behind. Thanks.

201
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,754
The station area's changed.
I got lost, drenched with sweat.

202
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,423
You're Rip van Wrinkle,
because you never visit.

203
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,884
That narrow bookstore's gone.

204
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,137
The owner got sick
and was hospitalized.

205
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,348
There was no one left
to look after the store.

206
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:37,479
We'll chill this
in the bathtub, and.

207
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,023
You said you like
cream puffs, Mother.

208
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,317
Thank you so much.

209
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,153
The first one goes to his altar.

210
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,656
Your flower arrangement's beautiful.
Which school, Mother?

211
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,992
Oh, I'm self taught.

212
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,827
Mom just fakes it.

213
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,456
When I took lessons,
it was completely different.

214
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:00,168
As long as they're pretty,
it doesn't matter.

215
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,933
Been a while.

216
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,684
Hello.

217
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,480
You have a nice tan
Hawaii?

218
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:25,360
No time to go anywhere.
I make do at the local park.

219
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,697
He walks around in his swimsuit,
can you believe it?

220
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,032
You've grown again, Satsuki.

221
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,243
Another 1.5cm over the summer.

222
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,161
You'll outgrow me, soon.

223
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,288
You eat enough

224
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,458
Mutsu, are you still fencing?

225
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,418
What?

226
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,546
He quit, after we bought him
all the equipment.

227
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,383
It's too hot and it stinks.

228
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,304
Oh, here's Grandpa.

229
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,517
It's nice to see you again.

230
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,353
Oh, you're here.

231
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,730
Hello.

232
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,068
He knew

233
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,946
I'm so sorry
He's so unfriendly.

234
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,116
Don't worry
My father's just like him.

235
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,911
When Junpei first brought
his wife here,

236
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,915
he ran and hid in
his examination room

237
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,259
I'm sorry, can you sleep OK?

238
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,969
I wake up sometimes.

239
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,012
Poor thing

240
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:38,933
I'm sorry his teeth grinding
wakes you up.

241
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,979
On his high school trip,
Ryota made so much noise

242
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,565
grinding his teeth,

243
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,276
they made him sleep
in a separate room.

244
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,236
The poor thing.

245
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,155
A separate room.

246
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,492
That wasn't me,
that was Junpei.

247
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,708
If you use your thumb joint,
they fall right off.

248
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,293
You're so good.

249
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,380
This always used to be my chore.

250
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,094
They wound up building it
as it was designed.

251
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,680
That's terrible.

252
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,433
They promised to

253
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,020
make it triangular
to let the sun in.

254
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,563
But it's square.

255
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,106
Exactly.

256
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,109
And they're still in court over it.

257
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,653
Oh, dear.

258
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,699
Don't mix it up like that.

259
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,327
You have to out into it.

260
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,036
Really?

261
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,165
How many years did you
watch me do this?

262
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,583
All done.

263
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,880
So pretty.

264
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,966
Brings back memories.

265
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,470
Strange, right?

266
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,722
Everybody does it.

267
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,516
No, they don't, do they?

268
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,477
I only know grilled
or boiled corn.

269
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,771
Did your grandmother teach you?

270
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,940
I wonder who.

271
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,400
Your original?

272
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,902
I bet, just like her flowers.

273
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,154
He'll be here any minute.

274
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,116
His eyesight's shot
but not his nose.

275
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,873
He couldn’t wait for supper.

276
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:54,921
He'd hear the corn popping and
eat them as fast as I cooked them.

277
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,798
My brother loved them.

278
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,927
You like corn, don't you, Atsushi?

279
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,137
So so.

280
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,180
Actually, I'm so so about corn, too.

281
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,932
You'll eat a lot.

282
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,435
They're best hot, go ahead.

283
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,979
With a drop of soy sauce.

284
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,568
So sweet!

285
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:23,199
Before we moved here,
our neighbors had a cornfield.

286
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,161
Sneaking in one night.

287
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,495
You stole corn?

288
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,663
Dad did.

289
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,499
Statue of limitation's up.
That was 30 years ago.

290
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,754
The next day was corn tempura.

291
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,631
Right as I was frying them,

292
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,842
there's a "Hello"

293
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,552
The farmer came over

294
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:46,640
to give us corn, saying
they had a bumper crop.

295
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,770
Just then, it started popping
in the kitchen, like before.

296
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,191
She tells the same story
every time she makes tempura

297
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,943
I sure felt awful about that.

298
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,781
So Junpei chimes in,

299
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,742
"Mother, we didn't have to"

300
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,454
"go buy that corn at
the green grocer’s"

301
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,083
He could be so smart that way.

302
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,751
He could.

303
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,170
Just like that other time.

304
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,005
At the bank?

305
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,549
He was a lifesaver.

306
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:26,554
This is going to be my room
I'll get a blue bed.

307
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,598
What about me?

308
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:32,268
There's no room for you
You're not moving here with us.

309
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,732
You can have this room, then.

310
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,734
Oh, good.

311
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,778
There's a ghost at night.

312
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,488
Forget it

313
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,283
I'm getting the piano, too

314
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,245
I want the piano, too.

315
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,454
You can't play

316
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,539
I'll learn.

317
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,084
You'll never play.
You even quit fencing.

318
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,294
Keep fencing, out of this.

319
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:07,387
Daddy, aren't I
moving with you?

320
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,932
Say, how did you feel
when your daddy died?

321
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,435
I don't know, I was little.

322
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,728
Did you cry?

323
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,521
I don't remember.

324
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,066
If it were me, I would cry

325
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,404
I know, what do you
call Uncle Ryota?

326
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,114
Like everyone,

327
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,536
"Daddy".

328
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:49,637
They should leave this downstairs.
Why'd they haul it up.

329
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,857
Are they starting to lose it?
They don't use this stuff.

330
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,486
They're probably lonely.

331
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,403
For what?

332
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,197
You know.

333
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,701
Have they said anything?

334
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,621
About my wife.

335
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,331
Not really.

336
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:17,999
It's heavy.

337
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,795
Do they disapprove
that it's a second marriage?

338
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:25,507
I don't think so.
She's terrific, wasted on you

339
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:29,969
watch out, you need
to watch your step.

340
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,221
It's too low.

341
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,432
It's not too low,
you're too big.

342
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,768
Did we eat the same food?

343
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,937
Ouch, ouch.

344
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:50,949
No, no, his memory's shot.
He can't remember the orders.

345
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:54,286
He served Toro sushi to the same
customer over and over again.

346
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,496
That sounds good.
Let's all go.

347
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,332
Please, spare me.
We'll have to fold.

348
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,167
You've always been a joker

349
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,920
I'm serious, I'm not joking.

350
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,588
How old is your father?

351
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,882
What? 72, I think.

352
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,010
Hey, same as Dad.

353
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:14,681
Really? The Doctor looks much younger.
He looks vigorous.

354
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,308
You call that vigorous?

355
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,894
Happily retired, right?
I'm jealous.

356
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,272
He wanted to keep working.

357
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,150
But his eyes.
He got cataracts.

358
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,985
No, the other disease.

359
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,405
But they also built
a big hospital nearby.

360
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,240
It was time for him to quit.

361
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,034
At least he salvaged his pride.

362
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,703
The sushi's here.

363
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,705
Here's 20,000 Yen.

364
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:39,789
Thank you.

365
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,418
Your change is 3,000 and
2 million Yen!

366
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,546
Hey, give us a discount.
Look how much we ordered.

367
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,965
Give me a break! I didn't tell
my wife about the sea urchin.

368
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,260
Here they are.
lt's heavy.

369
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,847
Don't eat the sea urchin.

370
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,100
Hey, is that you, Satsuki?
You're so tall.

371
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,019
I grew 1.5cm this summer

372
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,396
I quit fencing.

373
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,024
Nobody cares about your fencing club.

374
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,400
I almost forgot.

375
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,366
My wife sent this
funeral offering.

376
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:18,328
Oh, you don't need to
We don't say prayers anymore.

377
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,997
No, my wife was behind
Junpei in Jr High.

378
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,917
She gave him chocolates
for Valentine's Day.

379
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,795
Really? In that case,
thank you.

380
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,256
Why didn't you tell us
about this first?

381
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,010
I would never give you a hard time
about a discount.

382
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,137
Sorry, it just slipped my mind.

383
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,556
Getting yelled at for
making a funeral offering.

384
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,226
Why not come in
and light some incense?

385
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,894
I'm not dressed for it

386
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,147
I've got to get back.
No telling what Dad's up to.

387
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,650
Thanks for your business.

388
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,242
He's all grown up.

389
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,910
He used to be a bad kid.

390
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:02,914
You never know
how he might have turned out.

391
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,169
I'm done.

392
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,588
You're full? No more sushi?

393
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,845
Heavy.

394
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:20,140
Be careful, Satsuki.

395
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,182
Cheater!

396
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,978
Shouldn't I out it?

397
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,355
They want to break it.

398
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,444
You don't want to join them?

399
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,029
No, thank you.

400
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,655
You sure?

401
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,450
The handrail by the bath.

402
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,995
Yes, Dad fell last year

403
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,538
I heard.

404
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:47,041
He got such a big bruise
on his behind.

405
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,376
Oh, no.

406
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,421
Because you left
the soap on the floor

407
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,881
I didn't leave the soap.

408
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:55,967
Here we go again.
He's always blaming someone else.

409
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:59,971
Hey kids, if you hit it with those
there'll be nothing left.

410
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,222
You'll smash it.

411
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,225
The tiles are falling off
in the bath, too.

412
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,270
They just peel off
when they age

413
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,898
I'll fix those, later.

414
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:13,359
You don't have to,
you're a guest, Nobuo san.

415
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,071
You're happier
doing things, right?

416
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:19,407
I'm like a tuna.
I have to keep moving or die.

417
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,911
I wish it would motivate him
more at work.

418
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:26,206
That machine.
He took it upstairs for me.

419
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:27,666
The Rodeo Boy.

420
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,209
Happy to help.

421
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,086
Hurry, Daddy.

422
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,797
Excuse me.

423
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:39,302
Say, Ryota, now that
you have a family.

424
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,680
How about an RV?

425
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,557
I'll give you a good discount.

426
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,695
Living in Tokyo,
we don't need a car

427
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,782
I always dreamed that my sons

428
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:04,411
would take me shopping
in their cars.

429
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:08,456
Children don't necessarily grow up
the way you want them to.

430
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,292
They certainly don't.

431
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,919
Do they

432
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:16,798
I'll take you shopping in a car.
As much as you want. Which one?

433
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,844
Just you wait, just wait.
This white one?

434
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,097
You've got nerve.
You don't even have a license.

435
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,598
Second?

436
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:26,474
I'm full.

437
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,894
You can eat more.
You're still young.

438
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,939
But we can't have him
getting any bigger.

439
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:34,941
How old do you think I am?

440
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,777
Are your teeth all right?

441
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,864
You don't see a dentist, do you?

442
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,782
I'm too busy with work.

443
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,161
You've got bad teeth, like me.
Better watch out.

444
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,413
Open up wide, now.

445
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,750
Cut it out.
Not in front of the boy.

446
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:55,170
Is it a work call?

447
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,423
Yeah, well

448
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:01,801
I got a rush job from
the Setagaya Museum.

449
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,261
An oil painting?

450
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,637
Yeah, something like that

451
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:08,850
I saw an article in the newspaper
about painting restorers.

452
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,478
It said, "Painting Doctors"

453
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,562
Which paper?

454
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,607
I can't remember.
I'll send you a copy.

455
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,568
You say that, but you've
never once sent me one.

456
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,779
Sorry.

457
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,908
Well, I'm hardly as important
as a doctor.

458
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:28,119
It's not so much medical care
as it is "anti aging"

459
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,206
How lovely.
Can you help me?

460
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:34,000
What's that "anti" something?

461
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,252
I think you're past it, Mom.

462
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:39,005
You're so youthful,
you don't need it.

463
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,882
I'm not so sure I could help.

464
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,802
So I'm the only one left out?

465
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:48,932
My line of work is finally
getting the spotlight.

466
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:53,061
There's more students studying it
at my alma mater.

467
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:58,024
But when it comes time
to jobs, it's competitive.

468
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,152
Apparently.

469
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,154
You always

470
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,700
had such nimble fingers.

471
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,703
You can drink.

472
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,454
I take after my mother.

473
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,540
Yukie san could drink, too.

474
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:15,917
You could match her.

475
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,003
My brother's wife

476
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,713
I wonder where she's living.

477
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:24,092
The address on her New Year's
card hadn't changed Tokorozawa.

478
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,760
I see.

479
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,387
Wonder how she is.

480
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,558
If they'd had children,
we could invite her.

481
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,978
Now that she's remarried,
she can't really visit.

482
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:40,942
In some ways it was good
they hadn't had children yet.

483
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,988
A widowed single mom's harder
to marry off.

484
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:52,495
Luckily, a wonderful man
wanted me.

485
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,625
No, no, we're lucky
you took him.

486
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,460
That's not for you to say

487
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:03,590
Yukari-san, would you like to see
Ryota's childhood pictures?

488
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:04,883
Yes, please.

489
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,052
You'd show her
even if she didn't.

490
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:11,139
I want to get some of the pictures
of me in college.

491
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,932
Atsushi, you, too.

492
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,019
Did it break?
Did you break it?

493
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,103
Not yet!

494
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,189
Not yet.

495
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:23,485
We'll leave the two doctors
to discuss things.

496
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,374
What about.

497
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:43,838
What happened with repairing
the Takamatsu-zuka murals?

498
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,301
Restoration, not repair.

499
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:52,847
There was a long dispute about
whether to preserve

500
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:56,893
the tomb as is or to conserve
that national treasure, that mural,

501
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,687
Asuka Beauty,
they made into a stamp.

502
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,484
Ultimately, the Ministry of Culture
ruled to dismantle it,

503
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,487
in a rare upset for
local cultural preservation.

504
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:10,156
It'll take at least 10 years to.

505
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:15,829
That's a precious plant.
Don't do that!

506
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,497
Sorry.

507
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:28,008
Are you making a living?

508
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,264
Enough to support
a widowed single mom.

509
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:35,557
There.

510
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,517
Strike!

511
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,355
There's a crack!

512
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:43,898
Wow.

513
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:44,899
It broke.

514
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:14,179
It's hard to believe, but they
used to go to concerts together.

515
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,805
Classical music.

516
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,268
Dad's so impatient, he'd
walk fast and get way ahead.

517
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:25,023
We were always racing
to catch up with him.

518
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,401
Look, Mom, you're
in Hibiya Park.

519
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,528
You look like you're in love.

520
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,448
Back when I didn't
know anything.

521
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,037
This is just the 3 kids in this yard
This is Ryota.

522
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:41,790
Let's see.

523
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,666
Was he Atsushi's age?

524
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,960
I think about 5th or 6th grade.

525
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,963
The crape myrtle's still small.

526
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:52,342
We planted that right after
we moved here.

527
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:55,512
The flowers were a brighter red
than they are now.

528
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,680
You think?

529
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:00,392
This is when we all
went clam digging.

530
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,521
This is Junpei
This is Ryota.

531
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:07,649
Say, he looks like he's crying.

532
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,443
Whenever he heard
"Look at the camera and smile,"

533
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,612
he would just freeze up like.

534
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:13,989
Like this.

535
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,244
But he's really lightened up
since back then.

536
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,453
Is that true?

537
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,414
We owe it to you.

538
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:23,790
Not at all.

539
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:28,420
Oh, look, an essay.
From when Ryo was in grade school.

540
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:34,217
"When I grow up, I'm going
to be a doctor, like my father.

541
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:38,930
"My brother will be a surgeon, I'll be
an internist" Did you know this?

542
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,181
No, never

543
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,852
I was sure he always
wanted to be a painter.

544
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:47,897
"My father always wears
his white lab coat.

545
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:52,235
"When a patient calls, even
at night, he takes his bag"

546
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,653
Don't read that.

547
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,906
Who cares? Why are you
so embarrassed?

548
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,576
You don't need to
keep this stuff around.

549
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,251
See?

550
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:12,589
He can be exactly like Dad.

551
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,674
He just takes things seriously.

552
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:18,803
He can't compromise,
the way Junpei could.

553
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:23,350
If one of them had taken over
their father's clinic,

554
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,019
things might have been different.

555
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,688
Let's eat some watermelon.

556
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,690
Good idea.

557
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,942
Put these away.

558
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,446
Everybody line up, now.

559
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:43,119
OK, OK, picture, picture.

560
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:43,870
Come here.

561
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,622
Look, Mom.

562
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:49,292
What? It's so dirty.

563
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,044
A chocolate stain.

564
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,045
It'll stand out.

565
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,673
Wear it inside out.

566
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:55,674
No.

567
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,135
Please cover it up then.
lt looks so dirty.

568
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,887
Grandpa, please
stand to the side.

569
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,514
Where to, Mom?

570
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:09,687
Sorry, we're all here, now.

571
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,732
It's not a funeral,
it's bad luck.

572
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:15,610
It's fine Besides, we're all
here because of him

573
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:17,654
I know, but.

574
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,322
You're not in, Grandpa.

575
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:22,575
Grandpa, please step
in to the left.

576
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:27,247
Just a little more.

577
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:30,250
Grandpa.

578
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,128
Did he go to the bathroom?

579
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:34,921
We'll circle him later.

580
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,799
He's not dead yet.

581
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,635
Smile everyone.

582
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,262
You, too, Ryo.

583
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,180
And he's laughing.

584
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,060
We're off!
Watch for cars!

585
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,356
Is it hot?

586
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,054
Knock, knock.

587
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,731
Do you have to do that now?

588
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,566
Why?

589
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,861
Why don't you come
talk with us?

590
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,114
About what?

591
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:26,699
It doesn't matter.

592
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:30,036
Like about preserving tombs,
or whatever

593
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,090
Ryo was worried.

594
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,803
About what?

595
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:50,640
About how you feel
about his wife.

596
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:53,977
It's his life, let him do
what he wants.

597
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,855
You're so cold.

598
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,275
You weren't like that with Junpei.

599
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,653
Of course not
He was my heir

600
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:06,322
Ryo left the family.

601
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,748
What?

602
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,750
It was my hard work
that built this house.

603
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:22,088
Why do you call it
"Grandma's house?"

604
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,766
He's so petty.

605
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,353
Oh, there's a trick to that.

606
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:41,858
If you go like this and then
at the right spot.

607
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:44,944
Then to hold it in place,
you do this.

608
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,613
Says he doesn't want any.

609
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:49,657
Says tempura's all
he wants to talk about.

610
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:52,994
Just leave him be
He'll come back when he's hungry,

611
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,663
just like your crows.

612
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,249
They only come on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

613
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,585
He's still a kid,
even at his age.

614
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:11,346
Oh, no.
Guess even tunas take naps.

615
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:14,015
He just finds
the tatami floor relaxing.

616
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,143
Yeah, our house
doesn't have any tatami.

617
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:18,562
You should get some.

618
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:22,273
That's impossible.
Our house isn't built that way.

619
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:26,695
Which is why, when we move here
we'll build a tatami room.

620
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:28,822
When are you moving?

621
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:33,159
Hopefully, before Mutsu
goes to Jr High School.

622
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,994
It's not definite yet.

623
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,415
But I showed you the blueprints.

624
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,583
Don't catch cold.

625
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:49,843
Like they say, when you age,
it's best to live with your daughter.

626
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,803
Depends on the daughter.

627
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:53,179
The ashtray.

628
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:56,641
We'll live together but
keep separate kitchens.

629
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,853
Of course we're happy to eat
whatever you cook.

630
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:04,232
All I'll do is look after you.
I might as well be a maid.

631
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:08,737
The body of Hagiwara Mikio,
a 53 year-old

632
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:13,366
employee from Yokohama,
was discovered today on the beach.

633
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,453
Oh, no.
lt's supposed to be autumn.

634
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,540
The night before,

635
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,335
he had made a rare visit alone
and stayed over.

636
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:28,381
That day, he was
shining his shoes.

637
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:30,717
Suddenly he said,
"I'm going to the beach"

638
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,886
By the time I said,
"Be careful".

639
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,805
We're home.
Where were you?

640
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,140
A secret.

641
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:38,099
You're sweaty.

642
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,225
Here.

643
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,394
You didn't pick it.
No.

644
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,773
Only his beautifully polished shoes
were left behind

645
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:48,443
I'll never forget
the sight of his shoes.

646
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:51,071
Have iced tea, not ice cream.

647
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:54,908
If only I'd said something
to him sooner.

648
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:56,451
Here we go again.

649
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:57,952
Oh, let me, at least today.

650
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,413
If only it were just today.

651
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:03,250
He didn't have to save him.

652
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,919
It wasn't even his own child.

653
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,635
Maybe I'll fix us a snack.

654
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,929
No, we've had plenty.

655
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:18,390
Well, you're all here.

656
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:43,873
After you pat it round, use
your thumb to make a bellybutton.

657
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,334
Here's another one.

658
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:48,878
What's that?

659
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:49,963
Poop.

660
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:51,464
Whose poop?

661
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,092
Daddy's.
Daddy's?

662
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:58,346
Poop? I used to make those
when I was a kid.

663
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:09,023
You should use our phone.

664
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:14,362
That Vietnamese place
was good, right?

665
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,322
I'm stepping outside.

666
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:18,992
Is it work?

667
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,745
Yes, probably.

668
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,832
He's so busy.
Does he come home late?

669
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,251
He's had a lot of overtime.

670
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:32,464
He's still in his 40s,
he'll be fine.

671
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,674
Whose oil painting?

672
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:37,969
A Van Gogh?

673
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:40,889
I doubt it's a Van Gogh.

674
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:44,267
How much does he get
for restoring one painting?

675
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:48,062
It's a lot of work.

676
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:50,106
How much did you say?

677
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:52,567
I'm asking her how much.

678
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,154
Here's your reward
for helping Grandma.

679
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:56,905
Thank you

680
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:58,615
Mutsu.
Thank you.

681
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,910
We love Grandma's house.

682
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:04,037
Where's Atsushi?

683
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:08,018
Not to worry,
it's not a big deal.

684
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:15,692
Listen, by the way,

685
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:20,030
do you know anyone
at Shinbido Publishers?

686
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:24,826
Yeah, I figured not.

687
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,454
Oh, hello.

688
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:38,048
Let's all get together
for dinner, soon.

689
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:43,178
You don't have to invite Mishima.

690
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,042
"Homoclomin,

691
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:17,128
"Prolmon,

692
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,675
"Triptanol,

693
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,595
"Neophagen"

694
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,609
Don't touch the medicine.

695
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,159
C'mere.

696
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:55,416
Here.

697
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:56,543
Grandma already.

698
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,712
This is from your Grandpa.

699
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:01,423
Have a seat.

700
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:07,679
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

701
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,015
What? A soccer player?

702
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,017
A piano tuner.

703
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:15,353
A tuner? Why?

704
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,777
Just spit it out, it's OK.

705
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,365
Because I like
my music teacher.

706
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,119
A woman?

707
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:39,627
The idea that a man be swayed
by some woman in his career choice.

708
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:42,380
Show me your fingers.

709
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:49,637
You seem nimble.

710
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:53,933
My father got sick
when I was a kid, too.

711
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:56,394
So I decided to become a doctor.

712
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:58,730
Did he get better?

713
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,608
Your father.

714
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:05,320
He died before
I became a doctor.

715
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:12,660
Being a doctor is good.
lt's a worthwhile job.

716
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,751
You go play.

717
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:30,637
Please don't give him
any ideas

718
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:35,684
I won't let him be a doctor.

719
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:39,562
It's not like I can afford to wait
another 20 years

720
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:41,856
I can't help that

721
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:44,025
I'm not talking to you

722
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:47,904
I know that.

723
00:50:10,468 --> 00:50:12,470
Taking a little break.

724
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,682
Sure, you should rest.

725
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:19,269
You must be tired keeping
Dad and Mom company.

726
00:50:24,649 --> 00:50:29,070
About that phone call.
Turns out they don't need me.

727
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:32,699
Oh, the Setagaya Museum?

728
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:40,165
You just made all that up

729
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,585
I didn't really have a choice.

730
00:50:45,795 --> 00:50:47,589
So, it's a Chagall.

731
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:48,715
What is?

732
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,593
The oil painting you're restoring.

733
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:52,760
A Chagall?

734
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:57,057
What are you going
to do with all these?

735
00:50:57,182 --> 00:51:00,143
I'm storing them
for when I need them.

736
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:04,522
When are you ever
going to need this many

737
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,691
paper bags?

738
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:09,778
The refrigerator's
stuffed as always

739
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:12,197
I feel safe when it's full.

740
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:16,743
Refrigerators aren't
made for safety.

741
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,956
They're made for refrigeration.

742
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:22,958
Hey.

743
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:26,377
Does Dad play Pachinko?

744
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:29,464
It's you?

745
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:32,717
What do you care
if I play Pachinko?

746
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:36,262
There's other things,
like haiku and yoga

747
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:39,349
I feel so relieved when I hear
that Pachinko sound.

748
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:40,850
Sure, Mom,

749
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:45,855
you've earned the right to spend
on whatever you please.

750
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,195
What about this house?

751
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,488
What about it?

752
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:55,365
Well, you know,

753
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,577
if you don't want us, we don't
want to force ourselves on you

754
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:02,664
I haven't said we don't want you
lt's just that.

755
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:03,957
It's just what?

756
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,168
I think your father won't like it.

757
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:11,673
You only bring up Dad
when it's convenient.

758
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:14,968
If we knock down
the examining room

759
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:19,055
and make separate residences
we can both be independent

760
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,476
I didn't know we made those sweets
from rice flour, did you?

761
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,729
Of course not.

762
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,858
It's getting cooler.
Let's go visit his grave.

763
00:52:30,608 --> 00:52:31,943
What about you?

764
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:34,738
I'm fine,
I went recently.

765
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:38,616
In that case, I'll join you instead.
lt'll be a nine walk

766
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,702
I'd better wear a hat.

767
00:52:40,785 --> 00:52:42,078
Sure, why not.

768
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:45,707
Why does she get so excited?

769
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,292
It's just visiting a grave

770
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:26,873
I wonder who left these flowers.
His widow?

771
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:28,958
If she came this far,
she'd visit.

772
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,211
Guess you're right.

773
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,381
Maybe it was Yoshio.

774
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:37,592
He'd never do anything
so thoughtful.

775
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:40,553
Tossing them?
Ours won't fit.

776
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:42,722
I'll light incense.

777
00:53:56,987 --> 00:54:00,240
It was so hot, all day today.

778
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,952
The water must feel good.

779
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:29,019
There's nothing
more unbearable

780
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:33,440
than praying at
your child's grave

781
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,653
I never did anything to deserve this.

782
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:50,498
What do you want, Mom?

783
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:55,170
Her husband's
perfectly, nice, but...

784
00:54:55,628 --> 00:54:58,381
I'm too old to live
with a stranger.

785
00:54:58,506 --> 00:55:00,675
And the kids sure
make a lot of noise.

786
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:02,677
So you don't want them to.

787
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,137
Besides.

788
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:08,475
If they move back,
it makes it harder for you to.

789
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,853
Me? I can't move back

790
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,981
I mean, after your father dies.

791
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:20,153
After he dies. You know.
I can't take my brother's place.

792
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:22,906
Of course, I know that.

793
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,491
In that case.

794
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:31,122
Are you two
going to have children?

795
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:32,916
Where'd that come from?

796
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:37,754
You should think it over.
lt's harder to divorce with children.

797
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:42,968
What are you talking about?

798
00:55:44,093 --> 00:55:47,514
Isn't the line normally,
"I can't wait for grandkids"

799
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:49,849
Your family isn't normal.

800
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,562
These days we're not abnormal.

801
00:56:05,406 --> 00:56:07,867
You used to catch butterflies
in Karuizawa.

802
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:10,745
With your father.
Do you remember?

803
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:12,664
I don't.

804
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:17,127
Let's go visit your
father's grave, too.

805
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,379
Whatever.

806
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:22,465
Oh, it's not "whatever"

807
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:32,475
Look, a yellow butterfly.

808
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:40,275
They say butterflies that
survive the winter

809
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:42,819
come back yellow
the following year.

810
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:45,780
Really?
Sounds made up to me.

811
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:48,491
That's what I heard.

812
00:56:48,616 --> 00:56:49,534
From who?

813
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:51,411
I can't remember.

814
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:58,752
After I heard that,
whenever I see yellow butterflies,

815
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,212
it just breaks my heart.

816
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:16,269
Climbing this hill gets
harder every year.

817
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:20,690
In a car, you'd be
up here in a flash.

818
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:24,110
It's better for you to walk.

819
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:27,697
You're right.
That was good exercise.

820
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:46,675
So, you're graduating college?

821
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,510
Yes, thanks to you.

822
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:49,886
Did you find work?

823
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:53,640
I wanted a job in the media but
I got turned down everywhere.

824
00:57:53,723 --> 00:57:56,601
And that drama school?

825
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:59,687
Sorry, I quit that two years ago.

826
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:02,148
Oh, I see.
What a shame.

827
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:05,235
That's what you said to him
last year

828
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,820
I did?

829
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:12,242
I'm helping out at a small ad agency.
Maybe I'll get a job there.

830
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:14,119
That's perfectly fine, right?

831
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:18,748
When I say ads, I mean more
like supermarket flyers...

832
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:20,458
Did you take their exam?

833
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,836
Nothing formal like that.

834
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:24,713
Thanks

835
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:28,341
I figure I'll keep
helping out there for now.

836
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:34,389
Well, in any case, nothing's more
important than your health.

837
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:37,559
Well, my health is my only asset.

838
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:46,401
Um, seriously,

839
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:51,239
if Junpei san hadn't saved me
back then, I wouldn't be here

840
00:58:51,781 --> 00:58:54,701
I just feel so sorry

841
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,537
and so grateful.

842
00:58:58,288 --> 00:58:59,956
Thank you so much

843
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,378
I'll live my life
for Junpei san, too.

844
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,114
Excuse m e, then.

845
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:39,746
Oh, sorry.

846
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:41,748
Your legs OK?

847
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,169
They're numb from the tatami.

848
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:49,631
There's a step there

849
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:54,010
I'm sorry
I can walk, now.

850
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:58,473
You're still 25.
You can be anything you want.

851
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:02,269
No, I can see my life
won't go anywhere.

852
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:07,148
Come again next year.
Promise, OK?

853
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:11,486
We'll be waiting.

854
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:18,743
I will.
Excuse me, then.

855
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:22,789
Take care.

856
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:25,708
Sorry.

857
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:28,211
He got even fatter.

858
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:31,923
He must weigh over 100 kilos.
All that fat across his back.

859
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:35,885
He ate two of the desserts
he brought  for us.

860
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:37,178
And 3 cups of iced tea.

861
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:39,264
No wonder he's fat.

862
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:41,224
Look, his sweat.

863
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:43,059
Here, too, disgusting!

864
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:47,230
He even used the wrong
conjugation thanking us

865
01:00:47,355 --> 01:00:49,023
for Junpei saving his life.

866
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:51,693
We should've given him
the Rodeo Boy.

867
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:52,819
You're right.

868
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:55,572
Go chase him down
at the bus stop

869
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:56,531
Ryo.

870
01:00:56,656 --> 01:00:58,116
Not me.

871
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:01,619
That.

872
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:05,707
That useless piece of trash.
Why'd my son have 'to save him?

873
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:09,419
There were plenty of others.

874
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:14,966
Please don't say "useless" and
"trash" in front of the kids.

875
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:20,430
"A job in the media".
So pretentious.

876
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:23,433
He wasn't being pretentious.

877
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:28,229
The truth is he's barely
got part time work.

878
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:31,816
What's wrong with that?
He's still young.

879
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,444
His body just keeps growing.

880
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:38,198
There's no point
in him being alive.

881
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:40,742
You heard him apologizing.

882
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:43,870
Apologizing for being alive.

883
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,081
Just like that novelist,
who was it.

884
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:49,209
No, like that comedian
who keeps apologizing.

885
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:56,591
We're not talking about
novelists or comedians.

886
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:00,762
Stop comparing his life to others.

887
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:03,765
One of his socks was black.

888
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,017
He's doing the best that he can.

889
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:09,604
Things don't always work out
the way you want.

890
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:12,357
But how can you sit
in judgment, Dad,

891
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:14,943
saying "useless" and "trash"

892
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:16,111
Don't laugh!

893
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,613
What?
Wipe it with this.

894
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:21,157
You don't need to yell.

895
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:25,286
What are you so defensive about?
This has nothing to do with you!

896
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,750
Is being a doctor so important?

897
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:35,588
Advertising is a fine profession.

898
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:43,263
Who knows how Junpei would have
turned out if he were still alive.

899
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,265
We're only human

900
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:09,539
I heard "useless trash" and thought

901
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:12,750
you were talking about me.
I was scared to come out.

902
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:15,837
Thank god you were
talking about Yoshio.

903
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:20,300
If only he'd lose a little weight.

904
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:23,470
He looks like that former
sumo wrestler, who was he?

905
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:24,679
Takamiyama?

906
01:03:24,804 --> 01:03:29,309
No, he's the one from Hawaii,
who's in those commercials.

907
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:33,855
I mean the one with the face
like a mid belly, like this.

908
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,648
What's a mid belly?

909
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:38,693
I think it's time to go.
Our driver's awake now.

910
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:39,778
Going home, so soon?

911
01:03:39,861 --> 01:03:41,363
Yes we are.

912
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,868
Get ready!

913
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,289
Nobody asked him
to live Junpei's life!

914
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:52,832
Ryota, buy an RV.

915
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:56,377
We'd better put those
desserts in the refrigerator

916
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:59,881
Atsushi, can you bring
those desserts here?

917
01:04:00,882 --> 01:04:03,843
Can you find a spot for
them somewhere?

918
01:04:04,177 --> 01:04:06,930
There's no room.
Oh, dear, in there.

919
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:08,682
From Grandma?
3,000 Yen.

920
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,433
3,000 Yen.

921
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:13,520
Grandma seemed to be
enjoying herself.

922
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:18,733
Of course she was The best thing
for her is to be with her family.

923
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,902
Did we earn some points with her?

924
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:25,406
I don't know.
She won't come out and agree to it.

925
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:29,577
She wants to preserve her son's room.
I can understand how she feels.

926
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:31,746
He's got it good.

927
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:36,167
We've got our hands full
taking care of the living.

928
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:39,421
You'd prefer she look out
for her living daughter?

929
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:40,964
Of course.

930
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:44,968
My brother's ghost isn't
going to look after their old age.

931
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:08,992
Don't worry, it's not that expensive.
lt's light.

932
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:13,955
It doesn't matter what it costs.

933
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:17,250
It's not like I'm going
to buy more than one.

934
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:24,466
Does Mother have her
own cell phone?

935
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,218
It's right there.

936
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:32,098
When she makes calls, she
goes and uses our home phone.

937
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,561
The fool doesn't trust phones
without cords.

938
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:40,315
Says to keep this here.

939
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:45,278
What?
What's so funny?

940
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:46,905
Nothing at all.

941
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:50,116
They should have stayed
for supper, too.

942
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,785
Oh, no

943
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:54,537
I couldn't stand to have
their whole gang

944
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:56,998
hanging around all night

945
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:03,129
Sushi for lunch and eel for dinner.
I'm impressed

946
01:06:03,963 --> 01:06:07,926
I shouldn't have fried so much
tempura. What a waste.

947
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:10,678
Maybe I'll take some
tempura home.

948
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:14,933
Leftover tempura isn't any good.
lt loses its crunch

949
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:17,811
I'm glad we got the Deluxe.

950
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:22,065
Anything less and they only
give you instant soup.

951
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:26,611
Can you eat this?

952
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:28,738
Sure, you can.

953
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:32,617
You don't have to.
Grandpa will eat it for you.

954
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:39,416
Grandma will give you some eel,
instead.

955
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,500
You're so lucky

956
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:42,961
I can't eat all this rice, here.

957
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:46,381
Don't dump your rice
on top of my eel, Mom.

958
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:49,217
Inside your stomach,
it's all the same.

959
01:06:50,593 --> 01:06:54,180
She's never had a delicate
bone in her body.

960
01:06:55,223 --> 01:06:59,227
What do you mean delicate.
You're hardly one to talk

961
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,691
I take her to concerts and
she always falls asleep, snoring.

962
01:07:04,774 --> 01:07:07,193
When was that, dear?

963
01:07:07,902 --> 01:07:12,657
There are so many records
in the room next door

964
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:16,036
I used to be quite a collector,
in my youth.

965
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:19,789
Now it's just decoration.
He hardly listens to them.

966
01:07:19,914 --> 01:07:21,791
They just take up space

967
01:07:23,835 --> 01:07:27,922
I associate physicians
with classical music.

968
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:31,551
He was just the doctor
of a local clinic.

969
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:36,347
But in an emergency, it's good
to have a doctor in the house.

970
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:39,768
Not necessarily.
He was so busy,

971
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:43,563
he couldn’t be here when
his own son was dying

972
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:49,277
I couldn't help it I had a rash
of food poisoning patients.

973
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:50,403
Eat this.

974
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:56,034
You don't have a clue how
important work is to a man

975
01:07:56,117 --> 01:07:59,120
I've never worked,
not even once.

976
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:02,082
Not that he works anymore.

977
01:08:05,668 --> 01:08:08,254
What other music
do you listen to?

978
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:11,967
Well, jazz.

979
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:16,096
It's outdated, but Miles Davis

980
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:19,349
I can tolerate up
to about the Beatles.

981
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:24,729
But this recent rap crap,
you can't call it music.

982
01:08:24,812 --> 01:08:25,813
You're right.

983
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:27,148
At Karaoke,

984
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:31,277
apparently he sings
Japanese ballads.

985
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:33,279
Karaoke?

986
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:36,491
I read it on Shimazu-san's
New Year's card.

987
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:40,787
"I look forward to hearing
you sing Pleiades again"

988
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:42,956
Don't read people's mail.

989
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:46,292
It was a New Year's card,
I couldn’t help it.

990
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:50,630
If you don't like it, have your
friends seal them in envelopes

991
01:08:50,922 --> 01:08:52,841
Japanese ballads, huh?

992
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:56,386
Pleiades is not a ballad.

993
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:59,014
It's classier than that.

994
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:05,895
Don't you two have
a special, romantic song?

995
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:07,397
Nothing like that.

996
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:09,440
Yes, there's a record.

997
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:10,859
What is it?

998
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:16,489
It's a cherished pop song.
Want to hear it?

999
01:09:29,836 --> 01:09:31,129
Last year,

1000
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:35,425
she got tricked into buying " Favorite
Pop Songs" by mail order.

1001
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:39,512
A 30 album set.
Who knows what it cost

1002
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,389
I saw it in my room.

1003
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,392
She's never listened to it.

1004
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:49,355
I wasn't tricked.
How insulting, I'm not senile.

1005
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,899
What? Who's song?

1006
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:52,901
Play it on the stereo.

1007
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:54,027
Now?

1008
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:57,781
The needle rusted?

1009
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:59,574
It plays fine.

1010
01:10:10,084 --> 01:10:12,420
How does this work again.

1011
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:15,882
What kind of song is it?

1012
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,344
How should I know?
It's got nothing to do with me.

1013
01:10:19,427 --> 01:10:22,555
But it has everything to do with you.

1014
01:10:56,172 --> 01:10:57,715
Mom, this song.

1015
01:10:58,758 --> 01:11:02,721
The city lights
are so pretty, aren't they.

1016
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:09,436
Yokohama.
Blue light, Yokohama

1017
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:12,686
I'm so happy
alone with you.

1018
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,867
When is this song from?

1019
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,621
About 1970.
Right before Expo '70.

1020
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,208
I remember you sang it
sometimes.

1021
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,970
We walk forever and ever,

1022
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:48,225
but I only sway,
like a little boat

1023
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,767
I sway gently
in your arms.

1024
01:12:03,114 --> 01:12:07,118
Only our footsteps
follow us.

1025
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:13,833
Yokohama.
Blue light, Yokohama.

1026
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:19,047
Your gentle kiss.

1027
01:12:29,724 --> 01:12:31,893
I'll leave your fresh clothes here.

1028
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,022
With your towel.

1029
01:12:36,856 --> 01:12:38,399
When did you buy it?

1030
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:41,069
The record?

1031
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:46,282
About the time.
At ltabashi

1032
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:51,413
I carried Ryota strapped to my back,
all the way to that woman's apartment.

1033
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:55,250
I could hear your voice,
singing from her room.

1034
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:03,425
"We walk forever and ever".

1035
01:13:04,008 --> 01:13:07,387
I didn't want to interrupt you
so I went straight home.

1036
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:11,725
The next day, I bought it at
the Canary Record shop by the station.

1037
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:16,771
Please leave your washcloth
hanging out to dry.

1038
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,949
Remember how Mom said,
"It plays fine".

1039
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:32,871
You know she plays it
when she's alone.

1040
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:36,458
Kind of gives you the creeps.

1041
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:39,002
That's not true.

1042
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:42,005
What's strange about that?

1043
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,631
Yeah?

1044
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:48,136
Everybody has a song
they listen to on the sly.

1045
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:51,640
You think?

1046
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:53,558
Of course.

1047
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:58,146
So you have one, too?

1048
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:04,235
Which one? Tell me.

1049
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:06,988
A secret.

1050
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:12,827
Women are so scary.

1051
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:15,997
People are scary.

1052
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:18,375
Everyone is

1053
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:00,541
I bet there's a baseball game on.
Want to watch?

1054
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:05,630
We put a dish on the roof.
You can watch extra channels.

1055
01:15:05,713 --> 01:15:07,048
Not really.

1056
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:14,014
There's not much to watch on TV,
these days.

1057
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:19,853
There's nothing funny
but they laugh so loud.

1058
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:22,397
Those laughs aren't real,
are they?

1059
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:24,691
So they say.

1060
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:34,159
Here.

1061
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:36,328
What's that?

1062
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:39,748
You treated us to a real feast today.
Why don't you treat yourself.

1063
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:44,335
My, an allowance
from my own son.

1064
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:46,087
How wonderful.

1065
01:15:46,212 --> 01:15:47,714
You're always treating us.

1066
01:15:47,797 --> 01:15:49,966
In that case, thank you.

1067
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:53,303
What shall I buy.

1068
01:15:55,388 --> 01:15:57,641
What was that sumo
wrestler's name?

1069
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:00,227
Still on your mind?

1070
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,770
Solving these things
keeps your mind active.

1071
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:04,147
Waka no hana?

1072
01:16:04,272 --> 01:16:05,398
Not him.

1073
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:07,442
Kita-no-fuji?

1074
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:09,903
He was really handsome.

1075
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:13,865
No, he was more loveable.

1076
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:22,874
Say.

1077
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,669
Isn't it time we let Yoshio go.

1078
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:30,090
Let's stop inviting him.

1079
01:16:32,675 --> 01:16:33,968
Why?

1080
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:37,597
I feel sorry for him.

1081
01:16:37,847 --> 01:16:40,642
It seems painful
for him to see us.

1082
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:43,854
That's why we invite him.

1083
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:52,404
Can't have him forgetting
after just a dozen years.

1084
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:59,160
It was his fault
Junpei died.

1085
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:01,288
But Yoshio didn't.

1086
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:04,958
It makes no difference.
Not for a parent.

1087
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:10,880
Not having someone to hate
makes it all the worse for me.

1088
01:17:14,509 --> 01:17:16,219
So once a year,

1089
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:20,640
I make him feel awful, too.

1090
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:24,936
Will the gods punish me for that?

1091
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:33,653
So I'll invite him next year
and the year after.

1092
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:41,953
That's what you keep
inviting him here for?

1093
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,248
You're cruel

1094
01:17:45,373 --> 01:17:47,500
I'm not cruel

1095
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:50,712
I think it's normal.

1096
01:17:51,337 --> 01:17:54,340
Everybody keeps saying that.

1097
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:58,178
When you get to be a parent,
you'll find out

1098
01:17:58,261 --> 01:17:59,387
I'm a parent.

1099
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:01,348
A real parent.

1100
01:18:01,806 --> 01:18:03,141
What's that mean?

1101
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:08,688
Take your bath.
Your father's, done.

1102
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:11,900
Take the prince with you.

1103
01:18:12,942 --> 01:18:14,027
The prince?

1104
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:17,072
You should.
We have a nice big bath.

1105
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:18,907
Yukari-san.

1106
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:23,203
We usually take separate baths.

1107
01:18:23,286 --> 01:18:27,415
On a day like today,
he should let his son bathe first.

1108
01:18:27,624 --> 01:18:29,459
He just spaces out all day.

1109
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:33,087
There's no need
to bathe every day.

1110
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:35,548
It's a waste of precious
hot water.

1111
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:37,050
What is it, Mother?

1112
01:18:37,258 --> 01:18:39,844
Let Atsushi bathe first,
with Ryota.

1113
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:40,971
Sure.

1114
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:43,181
Usually, we don't

1115
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:45,517
I'll leave your pajamas out

1116
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,102
I brought a T shirt.

1117
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:49,437
Wear them,
I bought them for you.

1118
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:50,647
Where?

1119
01:18:52,106 --> 01:18:55,110
A discount shop, I bet.
Let's see

1120
01:18:55,193 --> 01:18:56,319
I'll show you.

1121
01:18:56,444 --> 01:18:57,487
Let's see.

1122
01:18:58,029 --> 01:18:59,280
You like this color.

1123
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:01,866
Oh, no

1124
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:05,120
Atsushi, let's take a bath.

1125
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:07,205
Wait 'til I finish this part.

1126
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:18,299
The bath is really narrow

1127
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,760
I don't think we'll both fit.

1128
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:25,140
Here.

1129
01:19:31,771 --> 01:19:33,273
What about my T shirt?

1130
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:37,152
You've got your
mother's pajamas, right?

1131
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:39,404
I don't need to wear those.

1132
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:43,825
You should She took the trouble
to buy them for you.

1133
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:46,953
Are you mad?

1134
01:19:48,955 --> 01:19:51,458
She's like this when I visit.

1135
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:54,085
She just wants to look after me.

1136
01:19:54,168 --> 01:19:55,837
It's not about that.

1137
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:56,963
What, then?

1138
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:04,387
If she's going to buy pajamas,
she could buy a set for Atsushi, too.

1139
01:20:06,222 --> 01:20:10,393
All day, she treated him
like a guest, not family.

1140
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:16,316
You're projecting.
She just didn't get around to it.

1141
01:20:17,358 --> 01:20:20,195
She had 3 toothbrushes set out.

1142
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:24,824
Hand me my T-shirt.

1143
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:32,999
Yukari-san.

1144
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:45,553
Yukari-san, come.

1145
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,530
Use this.

1146
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,437
Job not going well?

1147
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:39,107
It's fine Why?

1148
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:42,068
Forget it, then.

1149
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:46,114
Don't worry about me.
Things have changed.

1150
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:51,494
Can't you.

1151
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:56,291
Call your mom once in a while?
Let her hear your voice.

1152
01:21:57,041 --> 01:22:00,295
When I do, all she ever does
is complain.

1153
01:22:00,795 --> 01:22:02,755
Be patient and hear her out.

1154
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:04,799
That's not my job.

1155
01:22:06,217 --> 01:22:10,597
Can't the two of you work things out,
without dragging me into it?

1156
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:17,770
Whatever But that line about
the corn I said it, not Junpei.

1157
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:20,481
Oh, yeah?

1158
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:21,774
Yeah.

1159
01:22:23,026 --> 01:22:25,320
What difference does it make?

1160
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:30,158
Ryo, it's too hot to get in

1161
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:31,785
I'll be right there.

1162
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:36,248
Not that it matters, anymore.

1163
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:49,719
Damn.

1164
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:35,348
Do you have a splinter?

1165
01:23:36,308 --> 01:23:40,645
If you can pinch a mole like this,
you'll be rich.

1166
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:42,981
Grandma?

1167
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:50,113
See this?

1168
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:56,077
Grandma told me, so I always
tried hard to pinch it.

1169
01:23:58,079 --> 01:23:59,998
Not that it did much good.

1170
01:24:06,504 --> 01:24:10,133
Why did you want
to be a doctor, Ryo?

1171
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:18,225
It was long ago.

1172
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:21,561
Long, long ago.

1173
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:30,862
Is it this one?

1174
01:24:32,113 --> 01:24:34,240
Oh, here it is

1175
01:24:34,407 --> 01:24:36,201
I'll give you this, too.

1176
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:40,580
Oh, no, Mother.
lt's too expensive.

1177
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:44,959
Oh, no, it's not expensive.
But it's a fine kimono.

1178
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:50,757
My, daughter wants everything
but once she gets it, she ignores it

1179
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:55,136
I gave her a beautiful kimono
but she's never worn it once

1180
01:24:56,346 --> 01:25:00,350
I wonder if she's
sold it on the "Inter something"

1181
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,435
for cold hard cash

1182
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:03,186
I doubt that

1183
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:06,689
I wouldn't put it past her.

1184
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:11,027
You get dimples
when you laugh.

1185
01:25:13,905 --> 01:25:15,573
It's so sweet.

1186
01:25:17,033 --> 01:25:19,828
What's the point of
dimples at my age.

1187
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:22,289
That's not true.

1188
01:25:22,622 --> 01:25:25,625
A woman should be
charming at any age

1189
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:27,835
I'm jealous.

1190
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:30,463
Don't be.

1191
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:35,510
Are you all right?
You're flushed.

1192
01:25:36,636 --> 01:25:38,847
Because I drank
a little tonight.

1193
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,808
Oh, when I was young.

1194
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:47,230
They said, "A woman should
never empty a glass of beer"

1195
01:25:48,314 --> 01:25:50,733
You young folks are lucky.

1196
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:55,030
These days, I rarely drink
when I'm out.

1197
01:25:55,113 --> 01:25:59,659
So, you drink at home? It must be
boring, my son doesn't drink.

1198
01:25:59,784 --> 01:26:02,162
Well, these days

1199
01:26:02,245 --> 01:26:04,998
Ryota often drinks
beer at home.

1200
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:07,166
Oh, really?

1201
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:11,546
Just a little.
Says it helps him sleep.

1202
01:26:13,214 --> 01:26:16,843
Oh, I didn't know.

1203
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:22,849
Better dry your hair
You'll catch cold

1204
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:26,102
I weigh less than before.

1205
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:34,444
What are you two
going to do about a baby?

1206
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:42,661
We'll probably take some time
to think about it.

1207
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:44,621
Guess you're right.

1208
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:49,125
But if you're going to have one,
you shouldn't wait.

1209
01:26:50,126 --> 01:26:51,920
You're right.

1210
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:56,925
You have to think
about Atsushi, too.

1211
01:26:57,384 --> 01:27:02,222
You'd hate to have things
get awkward with a new baby.

1212
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,893
Maybe it's best that you don't.

1213
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:09,145
What a shame

1214
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:13,942
I wonder if this sash will match.

1215
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:17,153
Maybe it's too plain.

1216
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:41,594
It's normal, isn't it?

1217
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:45,932
Right?

1218
01:28:01,906 --> 01:28:02,866
What?

1219
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:05,285
It just flew in.

1220
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:13,626
You followed us home
from the grave, right?

1221
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:27,641
Keep it closed.
lt might be Junpei.

1222
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:32,270
Hey, Mom

1223
01:28:34,856 --> 01:28:36,191
Junpei

1224
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,820
Junpei.

1225
01:28:40,945 --> 01:28:42,739
Hurry, get it outside.

1226
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:48,161
Cut it out, you're pathetic.

1227
01:28:48,537 --> 01:28:49,788
Calm down.

1228
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:50,956
But.

1229
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:59,005
See, it is Junpei.

1230
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:00,632
Ridiculous

1231
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:07,639
Junpei.

1232
01:29:16,814 --> 01:29:19,234
Gently now, gently.

1233
01:29:24,364 --> 01:29:27,742
It's a butterfly.
Just a butterfly.

1234
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,872
Right.
Just a butterfly

1235
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:39,337
I'm letting it go.

1236
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:01,818
On my grandma's
17th memorial,

1237
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:05,113
a butterfly flew in at night.

1238
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:11,870
You should take
your bath, Mom.

1239
01:30:15,332 --> 01:30:16,958
I guess I will.

1240
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:37,979
The Yokoyama family.

1241
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,487
Oh, I see.
Please wait a minute.

1242
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:48,073
The lady across the way
feels sick.

1243
01:30:55,163 --> 01:30:56,623
I'll take it.

1244
01:30:57,582 --> 01:30:59,834
Her heart again?

1245
01:31:00,084 --> 01:31:03,004
She's supposed to be taking
her Digitalis.

1246
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:19,312
OK, call an ambulance, then

1247
01:31:19,812 --> 01:31:21,689
I can't.

1248
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:25,693
I'd like to, but

1249
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:31,199
I'm sorry I can't be
of more help.

1250
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:44,754
Slowly, now.

1251
01:31:44,879 --> 01:31:47,048
It'll sway a little.
Slowly.

1252
01:31:47,173 --> 01:31:49,509
We'll stop here
and turn around.

1253
01:31:51,845 --> 01:31:54,014
What's her pulse?

1254
01:31:54,222 --> 01:31:55,515
Please get back.

1255
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,519
Let's open up
and load her in.

1256
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,897
You don't understand, I'm.

1257
01:32:06,192 --> 01:32:07,569
OK, you'll be fine.

1258
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:11,197
Excuse me, get back.

1259
01:32:45,398 --> 01:32:46,941
Time to go to bed.

1260
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:56,451
Don't walk around in
those pathetic pajamas.

1261
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:42,622
He said he'd fix the tiles.

1262
01:33:43,165 --> 01:33:47,126
But he ate his fill,
took a nap and went home.

1263
01:33:49,504 --> 01:33:53,967
He's always like that
All talk and no action.

1264
01:34:35,633 --> 01:34:38,386
Grandma was strange, before.

1265
01:34:40,263 --> 01:34:43,558
It just seemed that way to her.

1266
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,396
Even though he's gone?

1267
01:34:51,065 --> 01:34:52,817
Even when 'they die,

1268
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:56,154
people don't really go away.

1269
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:11,586
Your father's here.
Right inside you.

1270
01:35:13,379 --> 01:35:15,757
Half of you is made
of your father.

1271
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:18,885
Half of you from me.

1272
01:35:21,054 --> 01:35:22,931
What about Ryo, then?

1273
01:35:27,894 --> 01:35:32,023
Ryo will become
a part of 'you, too.

1274
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:34,567
Slowly but surely.

1275
01:35:35,318 --> 01:35:36,569
Slowly but surely?

1276
01:35:44,327 --> 01:35:45,579
What?

1277
01:35:46,413 --> 01:35:47,914
What's slowly but surely?

1278
01:35:49,082 --> 01:35:52,502
What do you say?
Do you want to let Ryo in?

1279
01:35:54,254 --> 01:35:57,132
Hey, let me in.

1280
01:35:58,133 --> 01:35:59,926
How will he get in?

1281
01:36:00,844 --> 01:36:02,637
From your mouth?

1282
01:36:03,555 --> 01:36:06,474
What from the mouth?

1283
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:09,519
From your bellybutton?

1284
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:11,646
Bellybutton?

1285
01:36:13,314 --> 01:36:15,191
My bellybutton,
slowly but surely?

1286
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:18,421
I became one of
the relay runners

1287
01:37:19,672 --> 01:37:21,966
in the fall track meet

1288
01:37:25,428 --> 01:37:28,515
I saw a yellow butterfly, today.

1289
01:37:30,058 --> 01:37:35,188
Just like the one I caught
with Dad in Karuizawa.

1290
01:37:39,192 --> 01:37:42,070
When I grow up,

1291
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:47,367
I want to be a piano tuner,
just like Dad.

1292
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:52,956
If that's impossible,
I'd like to be a doctor.

1293
01:39:13,537 --> 01:39:14,871
I'm off.

1294
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:17,916
Please look after him, Father.

1295
01:39:25,006 --> 01:39:26,341
Off you go.

1296
01:39:27,592 --> 01:39:30,387
Sorry there's leftover fish.

1297
01:39:37,269 --> 01:39:40,813
Be careful.
Don't go into the sea.

1298
01:39:41,314 --> 01:39:42,273
OK

1299
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:01,000
The beach?

1300
01:40:01,084 --> 01:40:02,418
Yeah, let's go.

1301
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:08,586
Don't fall

1302
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:10,171
I'm fine.

1303
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,730
And the Bay Stars baseball team?

1304
01:43:11,608 --> 01:43:13,276
These days,

1305
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:16,529
I follow the Marinos.

1306
01:43:17,989 --> 01:43:20,700
You, into soccer?

1307
01:43:21,826 --> 01:43:24,162
I catch games at
the Yokohama stadium.

1308
01:43:25,413 --> 01:43:27,249
Huh, who with?

1309
01:43:30,335 --> 01:43:31,753
Oh, who cares.

1310
01:43:32,378 --> 01:43:36,049
We should go, with the kid.

1311
01:43:38,051 --> 01:43:39,302
We should.

1312
01:43:40,845 --> 01:43:42,389
One of these days.

1313
01:43:51,898 --> 01:43:53,817
That ship ran aground.

1314
01:44:09,249 --> 01:44:11,125
Go see a dentist.

1315
01:44:11,751 --> 01:44:12,835
One of these days.

1316
01:44:12,961 --> 01:44:15,088
Don't keep putting it off.

1317
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:19,259
A single cavity
can ruin your teeth.

1318
01:44:19,676 --> 01:44:20,301
OK

1319
01:44:20,427 --> 01:44:22,929
It's too late if you
have to pull them.

1320
01:44:23,054 --> 01:44:24,598
OK, OK, OK

1321
01:44:26,474 --> 01:44:29,352
And take your weekends off.

1322
01:44:29,478 --> 01:44:31,104
You're getting older.

1323
01:44:31,187 --> 01:44:34,691
Yesterday, you said
I was still young.

1324
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,942
Oh, here it is

1325
01:44:36,025 --> 01:44:39,070
I'm sure I still had
something left to say.

1326
01:44:40,488 --> 01:44:42,490
Come visit again, soon.

1327
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,913
Please teach me
that sautéed radish recipe

1328
01:44:47,996 --> 01:44:50,165
I'd be happy to

1329
01:44:50,332 --> 01:44:51,500
I'm fine.

1330
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:53,209
Shaking hands?

1331
01:44:53,334 --> 01:44:55,211
Oh, who cares.

1332
01:44:55,336 --> 01:44:56,754
Bye, Father.

1333
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:58,173
See you.

1334
01:44:58,256 --> 01:44:59,674
Good bye.

1335
01:44:59,883 --> 01:45:01,968
You've got good manners.

1336
01:45:05,013 --> 01:45:06,640
Excuse us, then.

1337
01:45:47,847 --> 01:45:51,101
They'll be back
for New Years.

1338
01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:08,410
We can pass on New Years now.
Once a year is plenty.

1339
01:46:09,828 --> 01:46:13,957
Can't have them treating us too much.
Next time we won't spend the night.

1340
01:46:14,082 --> 01:46:15,875
I told you so.

1341
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:18,753
We should've left
before dinner, yesterday.

1342
01:46:19,254 --> 01:46:22,924
I ate too much.
I put on 1 kilo.

1343
01:46:23,341 --> 01:46:24,926
Seven bus stops ahead.

1344
01:46:28,471 --> 01:46:31,766
I remember
the name of that sumo wrestler.

1345
01:46:32,934 --> 01:46:34,603
It's Kurohime-yama.

1346
01:46:39,732 --> 01:46:43,737
It's always like this.
I'm always a little late.

1347
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:05,258
Don't do that stuff.

1348
01:47:06,384 --> 01:47:07,719
Don't do what?

1349
01:47:09,095 --> 01:47:13,808
Shaking their hands.
They'll get the wrong idea.

1350
01:47:13,934 --> 01:47:19,063
If a handshake gives them the wrong
idea, I'm perfectly happy to.

1351
01:47:24,444 --> 01:47:25,945
Oh, I remember.

1352
01:47:29,282 --> 01:47:30,408
What?

1353
01:47:31,326 --> 01:47:33,036
The name of that sumo wrestler.

1354
01:47:33,495 --> 01:47:34,621
Who?

1355
01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:35,997
Doesn't matter.

1356
01:47:36,122 --> 01:47:37,499
Who is it?

1357
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:41,586
It doesn't matter anyway.

1358
01:47:47,675 --> 01:47:50,470
We never brought up
that sumo wrestler.

1359
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:56,184
Three years later, Dad died

1360
01:47:57,853 --> 01:48:01,481
I never did get to
a soccer match with him.

1361
01:48:04,108 --> 01:48:06,611
Mom bickered with Dad
until the day he died,

1362
01:48:07,195 --> 01:48:09,698
but she died soon after him.

1363
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:15,495
I never did give her
a ride in a car.

1364
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:56,494
It's so hot.
The water must feel good.

1365
01:49:00,957 --> 01:49:02,500
Look, Mommy.

1366
01:49:02,584 --> 01:49:05,795
Put them in here.

1367
01:49:16,264 --> 01:49:17,682
Let's pray, then.

1368
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:35,200
Look, ants.
Watch your step, now.

1369
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:44,250
Look, a butterfly.

1370
01:49:46,586 --> 01:49:48,463
They say yellow butterflies like that

1371
01:49:49,005 --> 01:49:53,927
are white ones that survive the winter
and come back yellow the next year.

1372
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:55,303
Really?

1373
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,682
Who told you?

1374
01:49:59,683 --> 01:50:02,060
I wonder who.

1375
01:51:14,507 --> 01:51:18,511
ABE Hiroshi

1376
01:51:20,513 --> 01:51:23,517
NATSUKAWA Yui

1377
01:51:24,184 --> 01:51:27,187
