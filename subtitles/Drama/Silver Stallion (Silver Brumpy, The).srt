1
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,320
<i>Last night, the FAA was forced to ground
all aircraft, leaving thousands stranded...</i>

2
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,200
<i>...when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages...</i>

3
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,040
<i>...crippled the western United States.
But the big story today...</i>

4
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,960
<i>...the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple...</i>

5
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,480
<i>...Reed Richards and Susan Storm
will take place this Saturday.</i>

6
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,920
Unbelievable. Bizarre anomalies...

7
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,280
...are occurring all over the world,
defying every law of physics...

8
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,800
...and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked.

9
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,600
What did you pick? The blue ones
with them little flowers? l like them.

10
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Excuse me, would you mind?

11
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,480
-lt's happening again, isn't it?
-Yeah, sure.

12
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,840
No. We're not postponing
anything, not this time.

13
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,160
This will be the wedding you dreamed of.
l won't let anything get in the way.

14
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,280
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

15
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,360
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

16
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,400
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

17
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,760
Dr. Richards, l'm very sorry,
but we're overbooked.

18
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,280
-We do have seats available in coach.
-Okay, here we go.

19
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,720
-Smile!
-Awesome!

20
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,360
Look, Mom!

21
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,200
-Let me get one more.
-That should be fine.

22
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,720
That's my seat.

23
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,360
Sorry.

24
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,680
Excuse me.

25
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,000
What if we get an endorsement
from an airline? Get us a private jet?

26
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,800
l think we have enough
endorsement deals.

27
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,600
That's funny. Seriously, Reed, it could
help subsidize your little inventions.

28
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,000
-No, thanks.
-Excuse me.

29
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,000
-Consider it. Talk to you later.
-Where are you going?

30
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,080
l don't fly coach.

31
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,880
l hope it rains.

32
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,360
<i>The snowfall came with no warning...</i>

33
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,120
<i>...and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.</i>

34
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,000
<i>In Japan, some suggest
the solidification of the bay...</i>

35
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,440
<i>...was due to underwater
volcanic activity...</i>

36
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,160
...though no such activity
has been reported in the area.

37
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,520
<i>Scientists have ruled out
global warming...</i>

38
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
<i>...as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe.</i>

39
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
<i>With scientists unable
to explain the events...</i>

40
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,920
<i>...some are wondering
if the hand of God is at work.</i>

41
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
<i>In other news, Reed Richards
and Susan Storm's wedding...</i>

42
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,240
<i>...has Manhattan all abuzz.</i>

43
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>The guest list includes
many of New York's power elite.</i>

44
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,880
Hey, honey.

45
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,480
The city's charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

46
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,640
...during that armored-car robbery.
l only remember two cars getting thrown.

47
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,320
Reed.

48
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,640
All right. l'm putting it away.

49
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,240
You were saying?

50
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,680
l have a fitting in half an hour.
The musicians after that.

51
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,320
l haven't picked out the place settings
or the flowers. There's too much to do.

52
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,360
Don't worry about it. Between
the two of us, we'll get it all done.

53
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,640
And what were you doing
when l walked in?

54
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,480
-lnputting my to-do list.
-Really?

55
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,920
-Scout's honor.
-Hey, guys.

56
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,640
New uniforms showed up.
What do you think?

57
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,000
l think there's no way
we're wearing that.

58
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,960
What do you have against capitalism?

59
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,760
What's this?

60
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,840
-Just a little hobby of mine.
-Yeah?

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,720
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something science-y?

62
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,480
A little of both.

63
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,640
l'm both impressed
and disgusted at that.

64
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,880
Yeah. Sue says l'm addicted to it.

65
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
l wonder why she'd say that.

66
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,280
Hey, Johnny.

67
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,120
Keep it quiet, but l've cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances.

68
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,440
They're caused by cosmic radiation, not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

69
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,360
Wow, that's really boring.

70
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,400
Listen, l have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about.

71
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,480
Yeah, of course.

72
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,680
Your bachelor party.

73
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,240
No. Seriously, Johnny.

74
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,280
John. Focus-testing showed Johnny
skewed a little young.

75
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.
lt's just not my kind of thing.

76
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,560
Then do it for Ben. lt means a lot
to the big guy. You'll break his heart.

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,640
He does have some
sort of rocklike heart.

78
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,680
l have too much to do
before the wedding.

79
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,960
l think Sue might have
a problem with it.

80
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,600
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

81
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,320
lf somebody told her
you were investigating...

82
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,680
...global disturbances
and cosmic radiation...

83
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,600
...instead of focusing on the wedding,
like you promised.

84
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
-A bachelor party could be fun.
-Yes!

85
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,200
But no exotic dancers.

86
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,640
-This is it?
-l don't know anybody here.

87
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,560
l would have invited your friends,
but you don't have any.

88
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
Hey!

89
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Johnny, we had a deal.

90
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,120
They're not exotic dancers.

91
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,040
They're just hot.

92
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,200
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?
That's so awesome.

93
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,160
Wow, you're really cute.

94
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,440
l'll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

95
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,120
No problem.

96
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,720
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter....

97
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,240
Could l help you?
No, you can't use that elev--

98
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

99
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,400
Hello?

100
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,960
Thanks, Roberta.

101
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
May l help you?

102
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,120
-We're here to see Dr. Richards.
-He's not here. Can l help you?

103
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Yes. You can take me
to see Dr. Richards.

104
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,080
Okay.

105
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,640
Sorry.

106
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,760
When the universe began, it was
no bigger than a marble. Then, bang!

107
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,480
lt exploded.
And in a trillionth of a second...

108
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,760
...it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know.

109
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,160
Wow, you're really smart.

110
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,520
Thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

111
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,720
l love this song. Wanna dance?

112
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,240
-No, l don't.
-Yes, you do.

113
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,240
-Honestly.
-Come on, you'll be great.

114
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,920
l don't want to embarrass you guys.

115
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,760
Just loosen up. Have some fun.

116
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,080
That's it.

117
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah.

118
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
That's it.

119
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,360
-Guy really knows how to loosen up.
-You're not kidding.

120
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,280
There he is.

121
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
Yes.

122
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,840
Unfortunately.

123
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
For him.

124
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,800
Shall we?

125
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,440
l think it might be clobbering time.

126
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Sue. What are you...?

127
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
General Hager.

128
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,760
Let's talk somewhere private.

129
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,320
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

130
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,720
l was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to....

131
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
This was Johnny's idea.
l just went along.

132
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
How does Reed know the general?

133
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,600
A few years back, the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system.

134
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,480
Reed testified that the
technology wouldn't work.

135
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,240
l'm here on direct orders from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

136
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,480
Personally, l don't like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian.

137
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,920
Especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much.

138
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,800
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

139
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,360
What can l do for you?

140
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,400
As you may know, there've
been unusual occurrences.

141
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,560
Officially, we've downplayed their
significance, but we're concerned...

142
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,480
...these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security.

143
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,880
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

144
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,880
-What is it?
-We hoped Dr. Richards could tell us.

145
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,040
l'm afraid l've never
seen anything like it. Ben?

146
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,480
l would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

147
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,280
lt's giving off its own energy.

148
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,200
Take a look at this.

149
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
These have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world.

150
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,680
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

151
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,280
To find out what this is about, we need
a way to locate and intercept that object.

152
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,240
A sensor could be tied into
the Baxter Building's satellite grid.

153
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,840
We can pinpoint the location
of the object.

154
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,320
-Good. You'll build the sensor for us--
-l'm afraid l can't.

155
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,520
What?

156
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,920
l'm getting married this Saturday.
l just don't have the time.

157
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,520
Richards, your country
needs your help.

158
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Call Professor Jeff Wagner.

159
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,880
He's head of the
Physics Department at Brown.

160
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,520
l expected more, Richards.

161
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,720
Even from you.

162
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,160
John Storm,
Fantastic Four lncorporated.

163
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,520
-Ever done any modeling?
-Not interested.

164
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,880
-You got an amazing complexion.
-Not interested.

165
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,800
Wow, and you just walked away.

166
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,200
l was definitely still talking.

167
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,960
l can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

168
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,560
They can build a sensor without me.

169
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,200
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

170
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,240
No postponements. No interruptions.

171
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,880
Thank you.

172
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,080
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar....

173
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,080
Don't worry about it. l know you.

174
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,920
l'm glad you had fun.

175
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,040
Thank you.

176
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
Besides...

177
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,560
...it was nothing compared to what
l did at my bachelorette party.

178
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,800
Talk about wild.

179
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,520
Wild?

180
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,040
Come on.

181
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,280
Hey, what are you doing up here?

182
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,960
Nothing. Just needed some air.

183
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,520
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

184
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,480
l'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

185
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,680
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

186
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,760
That is, they would be if l had any.

187
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Look, don't tell Johnny.

188
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,320
-Don't tell Johnny what?
-Great.

189
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,640
-Are you building that thing?
-No.

190
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,800
lf Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

191
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,680
-Hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
-l know.

192
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,320
Don't worry.

193
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,920
lt's the wedding of the century.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

194
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,320
<i>...Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...</i>

195
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,160
<i>...will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.</i>

196
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,920
-Look at these parasites.
-l know, it's unbelievable.

197
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,480
Have they no shame?

198
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,040
Hey! Hey, listen! Listen, everybody!

199
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,120
This is a very special day for my sister,
probably the most important of her life.

200
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,120
So l just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

201
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,080
Come on, Johnny.

202
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,680
Just kidding. We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos...

203
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,040
...to the highest bidder, so go online
and place your bids. Thank you.

204
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
Johnny, are you planning--?

205
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,160
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

206
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,360
-Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.
-Thank you.

207
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,080
-Are you all right?
-How are you?

208
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,320
lnvitation, sir?

209
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,200
l should be on that list.

210
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,120
-Name?
-Stan Lee.

211
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,680
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

212
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
-No, really. l'm Stan Lee.
-Nice try.

213
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,640
This isn't how l imagined it.

214
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
lt never is.

215
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,640
No, Alicia, it just doesn't feel right.

216
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,840
Sweetie...

217
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,080
...l think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

218
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,800
lt's more than that.
ls my life always gonna be a circus?

219
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,000
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

220
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,000
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

221
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,200
Ben and l aren't normal...

222
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,320
...but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.

223
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,320
Do you love Reed?

224
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,760
More than l've ever loved anyone.

225
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,080
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

226
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,320
Thank you.

227
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,760
Okay.

228
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,440
-Oh, great.
-What?

229
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,720
l've got a zit.

230
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,080
-Can't you put makeup on it?
-No, no, l got it.

231
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,240
Crisis averted.

232
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,160
Now all l have to do is concentrate
on the area for the next eight hours.

233
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,320
Reed, come on. You're gonna miss
your own wedding.

234
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
Just a minute.

235
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,920
Almost done.

236
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,880
General, l'm putting
the sensor online now.

237
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,280
There. lf there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere, you'll know.

238
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,480
<i>Let's hope so. We've gotten
reports of two more craters.</i>

239
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,240
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

240
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,800
All right. Just linking it to my PDA.

241
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,040
-Reed.
-And that's it.

242
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,160
Good, that's great.
Now shave and put on your tux.

243
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,680
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

244
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,760
Absolutely.

245
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,800
What?

246
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,160
l'm getting married.

247
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,720
Oh, jeez.

248
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,800
l'm getting married.

249
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,080
l heard of getting cold feet....

250
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,640
Okay.

251
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,760
Hey, Johnny.

252
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
Does that amaze anyone else?
How did she know it was me?

253
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,200
To be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

254
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,120
-You're late.
-Let's not make today about me.

255
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
lt's Reed and Sue's big day.

256
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,560
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

257
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,840
Don't do that.

258
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,400
-Okay, you're perfect.
-You're perfect.

259
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,360
l'll see you upstairs.

260
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,760
Bye, Johnny.

261
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,280
So seems like you and Alicia are
doing well. Annoyingly so, in fact.

262
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,520
Yeah, l'm a lucky guy.

263
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,440
Yeah, you are.

264
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,960
Question for you, though:

265
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,760
How do you guys...?

266
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,880
-None of your business!
-Okay, l'm just concerned.

267
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,240
l'd hate to find out
she was killed in a rock slide.

268
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
l'll show you a rock slide!

269
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,800
What are you?

270
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,840
Thank you.

271
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,440
Johnny?

272
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,960
You shouldn't tease him so much.

273
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,680
lt was a joke.

274
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,640
l don't know, l think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

275
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,840
l think you're jealous.

276
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,640
You think l'm jealous?
Have you seen the women l've dated?

277
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,480
No.

278
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,200
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

279
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,480
Hey. lt's the bride of stretchy man.

280
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,360
-Don't start.
-Don't listen to him. You look gorgeous.

281
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

282
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,480
-Come on. We're on.
-Okay. Okay.

283
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,720
You don't look completely
ridiculous in that dress.

284
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,400
ls that obnoxious-brother talk
for ''You look kind of nice''?

285
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,880
You look beautiful.

286
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,800
Thank you.

287
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,360
Dad would be proud.

288
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,520
Yeah.

289
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
Reed, shut your cell phone off.

290
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,600
Actually, this is a--

291
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,160
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to....

292
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!

293
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,280
Where was l? Oh, yeah.

294
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to join this couple...

295
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,280
...Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

296
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,680
...in the bond of holy...

297
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,760
...matrimony.

298
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,120
l can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

299
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,160
l know, but there's a good reason.

300
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,800
-We have to do this quickly.
-That's romantic.

301
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,760
-Should l continue?
-Yes, please.

302
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,400
-There are many kinds of love.
-Could you skip to the end, please?

303
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,480
-Reed.
-Excuse me?

304
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,840
-What happened?
-What's going on?

305
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,320
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

306
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,800
lt's too late.

307
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,360
-Pull up!
-l'm trying! l'm trying!

308
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,960
Ben!

309
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,680
-Johnny.
-This is Dolce.

310
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,480
Flame on!

311
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,920
Man, he's fast.

312
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,320
That is cool.

313
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,680
-Hey, taxi!
-Oh, man!

314
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,920
Showoff.

315
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Time to end this.

316
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,080
Can we talk?

317
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,280
Okay, you win.

318
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,280
Flame on! Come on!

319
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Flame on!

320
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,800
Hey.

321
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,120
Your herald summons you.

322
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,960
Another world awaits.

323
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,680
Let it be done quickly.

324
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,560
lt looked like a man, but completely
covered in silver, and it flew this, like...

325
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,280
...surfboard-type thing.
l know that sounds crazy.

326
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,320
Oh, no, not at all.

327
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,280
Did you follow the shiny man to
Lollipop Land or the Rainbow Junction?

328
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,720
-l know what l saw.
-Thank you. lt's all right, Johnny.

329
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,360
Whatever this thing is, it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

330
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,280
So it caused the anomalies?

331
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,240
lt seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself...

332
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,640
...randomly affecting matter.
Evidently, this entity, this...

333
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,480
...Silver Surfer...

334
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,400
...didn't want to be detected.
lt destroyed the sensor.

335
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,680
-lt knew it was being monitored?
-And traced it back here.

336
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,680
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

337
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,720
Are you feeling okay?

338
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,680
Yeah. l just.... l gotta walk this off.

339
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
We must destroy it
before it attacks again.

340
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,200
Richards, find me
another way to track it.

341
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,280
Sue, l am so sorry.

342
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,680
l didn't tell you, because l
didn't want you to worry.

343
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,600
l'm not mad you built the sensor.
You did the right thing.

344
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,960
Oh, great.

345
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,280
l wasn't finished.

346
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,200
Okay. Sorry. Please continue.

347
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
This proves what l've been saying.

348
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,440
Could you drop the force field?

349
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,920
We can't even-- Sorry.

350
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,720
Even our wedding
turns into World War lll.

351
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,840
l know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

352
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,760
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

353
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,640
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

354
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,960
l'm gonna go check on Johnny.

355
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,200
Johnny?

356
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,920
Hey, are you all right, pal?

357
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,600
Are you all right?

358
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,720
Johnny?

359
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,400
Johnny, are you okay?

360
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,880
l don't know. l've been feeling really
strange since my run-in with surfer boy.

361
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,520
Maybe we should get you checked out.

362
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,120
-Why did you do that?
-l didn't do anything!

363
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,360
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

364
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,120
Oh, my God, Sue! Just--

365
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,600
Just hang on! l'll get you, okay?

366
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,080
Flame on!

367
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,440
Hey, watch it.

368
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,640
Reed!

369
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,960
Reed! Reed!

370
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,800
-Help!
-Sue?

371
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,440
l'm on fire!

372
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,640
-Sue! What's going on?
-l'm on fire!

373
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,720
-You're on fire!
-You think?

374
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,280
-Hold on!
-Pull me in!

375
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

376
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,360
Johnny!

377
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,800
-l'm not Johnny!
-Sue, how did this happen?

378
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,640
l touched Johnny, and then this.

379
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,080
-Where is Johnny?
-Here.

380
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,320
Try it again.

381
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,240
-Nice.
-There you go.

382
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,480
Hey, get out of there.

383
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,760
Sue, your clothes.

384
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,840
Why does this always happen to me?

385
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,440
All of Sue's results are normal.

386
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,320
But Johnny's....

387
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,640
Johnny's are what?

388
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,080
Your encounter with the Surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux.

389
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,320
ls that bad?

390
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,000
lt caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

391
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,640
-l'd like to run more tests and--
-Want a volunteer?

392
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,160
-No, no, hey!
-No, no, no!

393
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,920
No, no, hey! This is serious!

394
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,560
l just wanted to give him a hug.

395
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,880
We don't know the extent
of his condition.

396
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,560
lt could be progressive.

397
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,600
-lt could be fun.
-No, Ben!

398
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,360
Ben!

399
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,080
Hey. Hey, it's me! l'm back!

400
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,560
Oh, my God!

401
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,960
Come on!
We just said this is serious!

402
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,560
Oh, yeah, serious.

403
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,520
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

404
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,720
-Hey, not bad.
-lncredible.

405
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
-You better be able to fix this!
-l'm right on it.

406
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
-Ben, stop it!
-l see why you like that.

407
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,320
Oh, no, no, no.

408
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,120
Crap.

409
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
That's not funny. What am l
supposed to do in the meantime?

410
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,040
Just try to keep
your distance from us.

411
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,600
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

412
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,720
<i>My inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm...</i>

413
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,520
<i>...turned invisible
and is staying that way...</i>

414
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,400
<i>...after yesterday's
embarrassing fiasco.</i>

415
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,160
<i>Next, the Invisible Woman's
greatest fashion blunders...</i>

416
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,880
<i>...and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.</i>

417
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,400
Why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

418
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,600
l can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it!

419
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,840
-l believe there is.
-How?

420
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
See? No answer.

421
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,040
Yes, there is.

422
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,040
What if, after this crisis is over...

423
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,880
-...we leave it all behind?
-What are you talking about?

424
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,280
We move out of the Baxter Building.

425
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,840
l'll take a teaching position
somewhere.

426
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,760
Get back to my research.

427
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,400
The two of us will live our lives
and raise a family, like normal people.

428
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,400
You would do that?

429
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,280
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

430
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,880
Oh, thank you.

431
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,920
What about Ben and Johnny?

432
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,160
They'll understand.

433
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,720
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

434
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,720
Let's not mention it to them yet.

435
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,560
Johnny's got enough to worry about
as it is, with his power problems.

436
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,640
You've been busy, my friend.

437
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,560
Your talents are impressive.

438
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,440
Can you understand what l'm saying?

439
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,640
Together, we could be unstoppable.

440
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,760
Anything would be ours for the taking.

441
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,920
All that you know is at an end.

442
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,800
What do you mean by that?

443
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,760
Wait! l said, wait!

444
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,800
They're breaking up the team.
Reed and Sue, l overheard them.

445
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,560
They want a nice, normal,
boring-ass life.

446
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,720
-No more Fantastic Four.
-Well...

447
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,160
...what do we do?
Keep going, just the two of us?

448
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,640
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

449
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,760
When were they gonna tell us?

450
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,160
They'll tell you when they're ready.

451
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,080
lt's their decision, not yours.

452
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,240
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

453
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,120
Guys.

454
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
We've got a serious problem.

455
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,200
l cross-referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

456
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,720
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

457
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,760
-He's been to all these planets?
-And now they're lifeless.

458
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,160
Barren. Some even shattered.

459
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,000
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

460
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,040
How are we gonna stop him?

461
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,360
We don't even know where he is.

462
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,040
What about the craters?

463
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,760
They appear in a numerical sequence.

464
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,080
The last crater was formed
in Greenland...

465
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,560
...so the next in the sequence
should be...

466
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,520
...latitude 51 degrees,
30 minutes north...

467
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,920
...longitude zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

468
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,000
When he surfaces, move the fight
away from the crowd.

469
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,160
He's too fast to contain.
When l see silver, l'm hitting him!

470
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,240
You can't do that. We stick to the plan
and work as a team.

471
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,960
Oh, we're a team now?
News to me.

472
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,840
-What are you talking about?
-You know what.

473
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,200
We were gonna tell you.

474
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,880
-When? When you moved our stuff out?
-Johnny, this isn't a good time.

475
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,760
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should have told us.

476
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,160
That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

477
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,800
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

478
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,800
lt's a whirlpool!

479
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,240
Oh, my God.

480
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,840
What is that?

481
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,320
Get out! Get out!

482
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,280
Don't let go!

483
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,840
-Move!
-Come on! Go!

484
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,840
No, Johnny!

485
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,440
Guys? What are you doing?

486
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,080
Ben! Lift it higher!

487
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,720
l'll try.

488
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,720
Sue!

489
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,320
Stay back,
before you get somebody killed.

490
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,360
Oh, my God.

491
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,000
What the hell was that?

492
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,320
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

493
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,960
Next time? There's no next time.

494
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,240
You can't handle this alone.
l'm bringing in help.

495
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,240
Bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger.

496
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,840
No more than you already have.

497
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,520
Victor?

498
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,240
What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

499
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,880
-Look out!
-Don't move!

500
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,440
Since you're a ghost,
you won't mind if l break your neck.

501
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,440
-Let him go.
-You know who that is?

502
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,920
Victor von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

503
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Ben, let him go.

504
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,520
How is this possible?

505
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,560
How are you still alive?

506
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,200
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

507
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,880
Von Doom's made contact with the
alien. He's got valuable information.

508
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,240
lnformation that might just
help save the planet.

509
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,480
Now let's be clear about this...

510
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,400
...shall we? l hate you.

511
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,520
All of you.

512
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,960
But the world's at stake and we
need to work together to survive.

513
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,600
General, we know firsthand, you trust
Victor and you're gonna regret it.

514
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,000
So far, the only one l've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

515
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,000
Reed, don't agree to this.

516
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,560
Let's see what he's got.

517
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,160
l made a detailed recording
of our little encounter.

518
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,680
<i>All that you know is at an end.</i>

519
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,360
Well?

520
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,880
l like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

521
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,120
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

522
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,920
There? See what happened?

523
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,720
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

524
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,080
lf we can separate him from the board,
we can cut off his power completely.

525
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,760
-That's what we have to do.
-How?

526
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,800
lf l knew that,
l wouldn't need you people, would l?

527
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,280
You two should
get started right away.

528
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,600
l'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

529
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,240
l'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

530
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,520
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

531
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,200
You got me. Things were simpler
when l could just whale on the guy.

532
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,120
What's he doing? A fire.

533
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,720
Look at that.

534
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,800
l'll pay for that.

535
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,760
l'll tell you, Ben, l'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

536
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,600
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

537
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,240
Thank you.

538
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,200
Look, kid, it's out of our hands.
lt's up to the eggheads now.

539
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,800
You think Reed's right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing?

540
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,600
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

541
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,720
You know, l'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

542
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,400
Really?

543
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,880
But if Reed's right, and this is it...

544
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,560
...how do you want
to spend your last few minutes?

545
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,800
Part of me would like
to go out fighting.

546
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,840
But the truth is...

547
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,040
...l'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.

548
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
That sounds pretty good.

549
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,040
l mean, not the ''holding Alicia'' thing.
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

550
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,160
Want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

551
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,600
She's very attractive.
She's so attractive.

552
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,840
Even with the-- l can't think of
a guy that wouldn't want to--

553
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,960
What l meant...

554
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,680
...was that it's nice
to have somebody.

555
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,800
Well, you got me, pal.

556
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,200
How's it going?

557
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,120
l can't find a link.

558
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,720
-lt'll be all right.
-No, it won't!

559
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,440
The whole world's
counting on me, and l just....

560
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,080
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.

561
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,760
-You always do.
-Thanks, Sue.

562
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,680
-You just need to relax.
-Yeah, right.

563
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,480
You do. Reed, you need to relax.

564
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,200
Take a deep breath.

565
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,640
Slower.

566
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,800
There you go.

567
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,120
Come on. Again.

568
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,120
See? l can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

569
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,760
-Do you remember that time--?
-A pulse.

570
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,240
A tachyon pulse.

571
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,840
l love you.

572
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,920
l'm glad l could help.

573
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,000
<i>So exactly how does this thing work?</i>

574
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,160
When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board...

575
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,240
-...making him powerless.
-Like a fish in a net.

576
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,320
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

577
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,040
-ln theory, anyway.
-How long until it's operational?

578
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,120
-Three hours.
-Three hours.

579
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,080
l can only go so fast,
since l'm working by myself.

580
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,800
-What do you need to make this happen?
-There are a couple of things.

581
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,720
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

582
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,680
What are you doing?

583
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,400
-Don't you knock?
-You're supposed to be helping Reed.

584
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,840
Tell him not to worry.

585
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,480
l'll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him.

586
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,200
-Anything else?
-How'd you do it?

587
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,360
How did you come back?

588
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,680
lt scares you, doesn't it?

589
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,960
The things l can do.

590
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,440
Did you know l could create
a force field inside someone's body...

591
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,480
...and expand it until they explode?

592
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,920
Give it your best shot.

593
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,800
Just get back to the lab.

594
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,160
Mr. Storm?

595
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,680
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in 1 0 minutes, with or without you.

596
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,320
Were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

597
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,760
That was a joke. l was joking.

598
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,800
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

599
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,280
l know you very well.
l read your personality profile.

600
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,160
Confident. Reckless. lrresponsible.

601
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,520
Self-obsessed,
bordering on narcissism.

602
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,360
Okay, so you do know me.

603
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,760
All l've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

604
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,200
Okay.

605
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,320
l've been a little off my game lately.

606
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,560
This is not a game.

607
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,400
-Sir, he's in position north of here.
-Good.

608
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,360
-General, give us a one-mile perimeter.
-Forget it, Richards.

609
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,640
You had your shot and you blew it.
This is a military operation now.

610
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,960
Jam the signal, get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

611
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,160
-You don't understand.
-No, you don't understand.

612
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,000
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks.

613
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,000
l'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

614
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,640
Got it?

615
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,440
But l guess you never played football
in high school, did you, Richards?

616
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,880
No, you're right, l didn't.

617
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,560
l stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

618
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,040
And fifteen years later...

619
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,960
...l'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century.

620
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,280
l'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

621
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,560
And the jock who played quarterback
in high school...

622
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,560
...is right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

623
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,600
And l say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

624
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,320
...unless he does exactly
what l tell him to...

625
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,240
...and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect.

626
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,680
Give him what he wants.

627
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,680
l am so hot for you right now.

628
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,360
-Me too.

629
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,320
This is it.

630
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,120
You have your coordinates. Set up
your posts and rendezvous back here.

631
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,960
First squad, move out!

632
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,920
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.
Look at you. You're cute.

633
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,920
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

634
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,400
Overgrown furball.

635
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,600
<i>-What's our status?
-Yeah. I'm good to go.</i>

636
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,800
-Same here.
-Almost there.

637
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
Guys?

638
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,040
<i>-We have a problem.
-What's wrong?</i>

639
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,400
He's here.

640
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

641
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,360
Why are you destroying our planet?

642
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,080
l have no choice.

643
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,120
-Sue!
-Wait!

644
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,280
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

645
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,800
There's always a choice.

646
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,640
Not always.

647
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,320
Why are you trying to destroy us?

648
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,200
l am not the Destroyer.

649
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,760
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

650
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,440
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

651

<i>-Fire one over the top.
-Roger, out.</i>

652

-Open fire.

653
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,240
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

654
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,480
Fall back! Fall back!

655
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,320
-Let me just--
-No, wait!

656
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,600
Reed.

657
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,240
Come on, Sue.

658
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,640
All right, it's up.

659
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,800
Reed.

660
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,040
Got him.

661
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,000
Not so tough now, are you?

662
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,080
Victor! Stay back!

663
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,360
You're the quarterback.

664
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,560
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

665
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,400
-Perimeter secure!
-Move him out.

666
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,600
-Open the gate!
-Get him to the debriefing room.

667
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,080
-We had an agreement.
-Calm down.

668
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,880
The enemy has been captured.

669
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,920
-Where is he?
-Contained.

670
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,120
General?

671
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,640
Mr. Sherman.

672
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,400
lf you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

673
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,720
-l want to be there for the questioning.
-Not gonna happen.

674
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,240
Make sure our guests remain here,
comfortably.

675
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,600
Yes, sir.

676
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,720
General, what about the board?

677
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,400
lt's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

678
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,760
There are certain things
l'm not permitted to do...

679
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,480
...because they're considered
human-rights violations.

680
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,720
Fortunately, you're not human.

681
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,480
Are we prisoners?

682
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,880
How did that happen?

683
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,920
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

684
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,320
l can't imagine what
they're doing to him.

685
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,360
-l say he gets what he deserves.
-How can you say that?

686
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,280
l'm just saying maybe
the general's right about this.

687
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,400
The guy was about to destroy
the planet. He said so himself.

688
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:30,040
lt doesn't make sense. He protected me
from the missile. Why would he do that?

689
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,960
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

690
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,920
There's more going on.
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

691
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,640
Maybe he lied?

692
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,240
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

693
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,880
But under the radar.

694
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,840
ls there any way
we could get some DVDs...

695
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,840
...or popcorn or something?

696
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,600
-l'll call it in.
-Great.

697
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,600
Thank you. Semper fi.

698
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,320
That's the Marine Corps.
We're the Army.

Von Doom wants to speak with you.

703
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,240
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

704

Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

706

What's your name?

707
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,440
Come on, you must have a name.

708
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,760
l'm Susan.

709
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,080
You said you weren't the one trying
to destroy our world. Then who is?

710
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,640
-The one l serve.
-Who do you serve?

711
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,960
l'm trying to help you, but to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

Please.

...Galactus...

...the Devourer of Worlds.

716
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,520
lt must feed on energy to survive.

717
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,120
Both thermal...

718
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,160
...and organic.

719
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,800

720
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,400
Because l must.

721
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,920
Doesn't it bother you, all the worlds and
innocent people you've helped destroy?

722
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,200
My service spares my world...

723
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,440
...and the one l love.

724
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,920
Why did you try to protect me?

725
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,800
Because...

726
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,280
...you remind me of her.

727
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,920
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

728

lt is not l who draws the Destroyer here.
lt is the beacon.

729

What's the beacon?

730
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,800

...that's about to destroy our planet in
less than 24 hours. Did l miss anything?

788
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,920
l've locked on Victor's energy trail.
He's headed over Southeast China.

789
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,560
Hang on.

790
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,280
Norrin Radd.

791
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,080
-What?
-l was once called Norrin Radd.

792
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,280
Norrin, we'll need your help
to save our world.

793
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,640
Do you understand?

794
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,120
What the hell was that?

795
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,040
Victor, the board is drawing the
Destroyer here. You have to give it up.

796
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,880
You know, l've never
been the giving type, Reed.

797
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,840
Hold on!

798
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,520
We're sitting ducks!

799
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,240
We're gonna have to split up!

800
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,760
-What?
-This ought to be fun!

801
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,320
He's really pissing me off!

802
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,480
Surf's up, metalhead!

803
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,480
Victor, only the Surfer can stop the
Destroyer. But he needs his board.

804
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,400
-Come and get it, Richards.
-Victor.

805
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,200
Let's all go for a spin!

806
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,760
Norrin!

807
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,960
Catch.

808
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,480
Sue!

809
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,440
Oh, my God.

810
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,160
Sue. Sue.

811
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,520
-Oh, God.
-Johnny, don't touch her!

812
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,400
Oh, God. Oh, God.

813
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,600
You need to find a way
to get the board.

814
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,160
-Sue, l....
-Okay.

815
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,360
He is here.

816
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,560
Reed?

817
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,640
Reed.

818
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,920
Victor's gotta have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

819
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,400
We take it out,
we can separate him from his board.

820
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,760
He's too strong for me.

821
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,840
l could whale on him if l get close...

822
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,800
...but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

823
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,240
lt would take all of us.

824
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,760
Or maybe just one of us.

825
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,800
We don't know
what it could do to you.

826
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,480
Let's not make this about me.

827
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,920
To quote a friend of mine...

828
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,120
...it's clobbering time.

829
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,640
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

830
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,640
Not without me.

831
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,400
You've gotta go.

832
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,080
Treasure each moment with her.

833
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,240
And tell her she was right.

834
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,240
We do have a choice.

835
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,840
Thought you could use a hand.

836
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,760
Oh, my God.

837
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,680
Why isn't it working?

838
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,200
We were too late.

839
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,600
l will no longer serve.

840
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,360
This is the end for us both.

841
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,800
Hi.

842
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,840
Hi.

843
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,160
What did l miss?

844
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,640
Hey! Hey!

845
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,720
-He did it.
-Great job, kid.

846
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,680
Hey, wait. l'm not changing.

847
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,320
Hey, that's right.

848
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,240
Great.

849
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,040
Okay, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

850
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,880
So l guess this is it.

851
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,600
We all go our separate ways.

852
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,520
No.

853
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,840
-No?
-No.

854
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,360
-No?
-lf not for the team...

855
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,080
...the whole world would be gone.

856
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,440
We can't run away from our
responsibilities. This is who we are.

857
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,600
-That's what l've been saying.
-What about having a normal life?

858
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,880
-A family?
-Who says you have to be normal...

859
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,760
...to have a family?

860
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,520
So are you up for another media-circus
wedding? Fifth time's a charm.

861
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,280
No.

862
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,160
l got a better idea.

863
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,680
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Reed Richards...

864
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,000
...and Sue Storm together in holy...

865
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,600
...matrimony.

866
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,640
-What is it?
-Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

867
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,560
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

868
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,080
Could we just skip to the end?

869
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,680
-Yeah. The love these two share--
-No, the very end.

870
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,200
Yeah, great. You have the rings?

871
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,720
Oh, yeah.

872
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,320
l now pronounce you man and wife,
and you may kiss the bride.

873
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,240
-Okay. We should get out of here.
-Yeah.

874
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,640
-Gotta go, hon.
-Okay.

875
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,120
l have to throw the bouquet.

876
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,640
Ready?

877
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,360
Heads up, Johnny.

878
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,000
Sorry.

879
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,120
Reflex.
