1
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:14,651
You're a big venue now.

2
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:20,411
Global commerce,
sports franchises. . .

3
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,807
chit-chat cafes.

4
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:26,361
But you don't get it
because you don't see it.

5
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:29,337
Life is not what you think it is.

6
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:34,907
Because of guys like us. . .
you can go on thinking it. . .

7
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,016
'til reality sets in.

8
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,469
Reality's a motherfucker.

9
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,101
The first thing you do
when it hits you. . .

10
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,211
is wonder where we are.

11
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:51,996
We do our shit.

12
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,293
You do yours.

13
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:59,899
But remember. . .
it's a dirty world.

14
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:05,083
And without us,
it'd be a whole lot dirtier.

15
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:08,154
Welcome to Edison.

16
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:17,948
Heads up.
2 harbor cops just showed up.

17
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,016
We got problems in here.
If they come into bank, shoot 'em.

18
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,871
Any units near 12th and Plaza,
respond to an alarm at Plaza Bank.

19
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,504
Approach with caution.

20
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,326
We got it.

21
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,957
What was that?

22
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,820
You're outta your fuckin mind.
You know that? Fuck!

23
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:46,264
- You want onions with that?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:47,895
There you go.

25
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,888
- Stay down !
- Stay down !

26
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,862
Go.

27
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,038
Get in the car!

28
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,542
What are you doing?
Get in the car!

29
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,212
Stay calm.
I know you're hurt.

30
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:54,232
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

31
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,749
Okay buddy.

32
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,955
I know you're hurt.
Get you to your feet, okay?

33
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,219
All your friends are dead,
fuckhead.

34
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,575
It's just me and you now.

35
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:14,586
Come on GI Joe.
Come out and play.

36
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,399
Come on.

37
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,152
Drop the gun, walk away,
or I'll kill her.

38
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,686
Close your eyes, sweetheart.
You don't wanna see this.

39
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:10,298
It's okay, come on.
Come on, it's okay.

40
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,603
Just a flesh wound.

41
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:14,720
It's okay.
You're alright.

42
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,435
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

43
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,126
That bad man's not gonna
hurt you any more.

44
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,943
It's okay.

45
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:50,559
On your knees!
Come on !

46
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:51,040
What's goin' on?

47
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,526
- Lock your fingers behind !
- Put your hands behind your head.

48
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:55,161
Come on crack whores!

49
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:59,001
Look at that China White, baby.
Look at that China fuckin' White.

50
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:01,692
That's my money, too.
That's all my money.

51
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,340
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, fuckhead. You squatters?

52
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:06,303
Fuck you talkin' about?

53
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:07,928
- You own this house?
- No.

54
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:09,180
- What about you?
- No.

55
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,711
- You got a lease?
- No.

56
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:14,168
You got a mortgage?
You guys fucked up tonight.

57
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,096
Don't look at me.
Don't fuckin' look at me.

58
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:17,722
Okay, this is how it works.

59
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:21,087
You never saw us.
And we never saw you.

60
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:23,674
The world just keeps turnin' .

61
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,883
- You ain't takin' us in?
- Nah.

62
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,613
Got to all school.

63
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,624
We answer up, get capped
for losin' that shit.

64
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,738
Yeah, maybe you should
leave town.

65
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,015
Motha' fuckers.

66
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:40,799
We'll get his license.
Rat his ass out to the Feds.

67
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,102
Tired of this bullshit.
Fuck that.

68
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:44,631
Welcome to the majors.

69
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:47,423
It gets easier after the first one.

70
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,448
Him.

71
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:10,360
Rafe.

72
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,673
Not ready, bro?

73
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,261
I'll take care of this shit.

74
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,450
The fuck?
Oh, you motherfucker.

75
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:57,530
You fuckin' spit at me?
I'll fuckin' kill you!

76
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:59,351
Aw, Jesus.

77
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:05,593
Jesus.
Jesus.

78
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:08,863
Oh, Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus.

79
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:11,543
Come on.

80
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,236
Come on. Stop cryin' .

81
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,072
I haven't seen you
around here before.

82
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,746
Who are you?

83
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:22,593
Isiaha Charles.
I just moved here with my mom.

84
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,793
Who's he to you?

85
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:29,212
I just met him.
He gave me a job.

86
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,048
Where'd you do time?

87
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,645
I've never done time.

88
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,755
- You never did time?
- No.

89
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:47,170
Oh, that is good shit.

90
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:52,056
You want some?

91
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,081
I'm good.

92
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,384
All right.
This is how it's gonna work.

93
00:09:56,483 --> 00:10:00,608
Your buddy was smokin' crack
and he got fuckin' crazy. . .

94
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,530
and he came at you with a knife.

95
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:08,959
Now tell me what happened.

96
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:14,335
My buddy, he got fuckin' crazy. . .

97
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,956
and he came after me
with a knife.

98
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:24,412
Which is when Lazerov
and I entered the domicile

99
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:27,483
in response to
a domestic disturbance. . .

100
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,228
and saw the defendant fire
one round from a bulldog.

101
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,186
- Is this that bulldog You refer to?
- Yes.

102
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:36,349
- Is this the knife You pried from
the deceased's hand? / - Yes

103
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:38,940
- What was he doing with him?
- Something to stab the defendant.

104
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:44,707
Now after the deceased deceased
did the defendant resist?

105
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,008
- No.
- did he say anything?

106
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:51,808
He cried, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

107
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:54,874
Cried?
What do you mean he cried?

108
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:02,840
What do you mean he cried?

109
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:04,574
He cried.
Jesus, Jesus.

110
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:05,625
That's enough.

111
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,377
- Jesus. Oh my God.
- That's enough, Officer Deed.

112
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:10,906
You may step down.

113
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,368
Thank you.

114
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:27,232
That'll be a 10 minute recess.
We'll reconvene at quarter past.

115
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,890
- What the hell was that?
- Testifying.

116
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,897
- to the Second Coming?
- Back off.

117
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:37,434
Officer Deed?

118
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,257
Officer Deed.

119
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:40,793
Yeah.

120
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,583
- Why'd he thank you?
- Who are you?

121
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,311
Josh Pollack.
Heights Herald.

122
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,194
- the Jewish handout?
- It's a community weekly.

123
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,495
The guy is Jewish?
You're shittin' me.

124
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,217
I don't know he's Jewish.

125
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,233
And, what do you care?

126
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,402
You busted him in Ashtown,
that's adjacent to the Heights.

127
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:03,267
Tell our Jewish friends not to worry.
They can still walk to worship.

128
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,830
So why'd he say thank you?

129
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:12,672
It's a manslaughter
and possession beef.

130
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,642
- It could've been murder.
- So Why did FRAT catch this?

131
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,624
Talk to public affairs.

132
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:21,026
Officer Deed, can you tell me why
FRAT is cruising the streets?

133
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:24,475
Talk to public affairs.

134
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,218
Guy thanked you?

135
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,563
Jack-off.
I hate that fuckin' guy.

136
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:58,303
- Who's that?
- Wallace. Pussy.

137
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,515
Hey.

138
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:09,535
How'd court go, Frank?

139
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,659
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

140
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,025
- Something I should know?
- No. Same old, Same old.

141
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,131
Deed's first murder testimony.

142
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,303
Yep, weapons possession
18 months.

143
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:26,852
Rafe. Inspection Monday?
Be sure you're there.

144
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:56,890
Pollack.

145
00:13:57,573 --> 00:13:59,003
Pollack!

146
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:04,666
Pollack.

147
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,204
Yes, sir?

148
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:07,739
What are you doing?

149
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:09,948
Article on the murder trial.

150
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,271
I told you to put the verdict
on the police blotter.

151
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,861
That's a sentence, not a tome.

152
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:18,307
It's a legitimate story.

153
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:20,227
Then find a legitimate paper
to publish it.

154
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:23,008
All I want is the verdict, okay?

155
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,083
Fraud.

156
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:32,639
Sorry, did you say something?

157
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:37,149
No, sir. I didn't.

158
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,122
That's what I thought.

159
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,418
Actually I said fraud.

160
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,195
Did you now?

161
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,517
You know why The Times
won't hire you Pollack?

162
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:01,819
You don't do the work.

163
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,181
A thousand words, not a single
fact except for the verdict.

164
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:07,490
Everything else is supposition.

165
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,215
FRAT wouldn't talk to me.

166
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:13,251
So the point of covert police
work is not to talk about it.

167
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:15,260
This incident is public record, sir.

168
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:18,627
Involving undercover police
who like to keep a low profile,

169
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:19,969
so they can sleep at night.

170
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,925
You can't imply nefarious activity

171
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,323
because a felon whispered
thank you to one of them.

172
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:26,048
I qualified it with a question.

173
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,579
You qualified. . .

174
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:32,287
Watch my lips, son.
You're not qualified to qualify.

175
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:33,923
Nobody cares what you think.

176
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:37,852
Only what you know and that's
diddly 'cause you don't do the work!

177
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,602
Unfortunate this is about as well
written as you are uninformed.

178
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,900
You know what?

179
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:47,935
I think you should try novels.
You're fired.

180
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:05,888
This isn't a real paper anyway.

181
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,958
Perfect for you.
Lazy little shit.

182
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,028
Get out while you can.

183
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:15,291
Shit.

184
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,676
Rafe.
Don't make yourself crazy.

185
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:01,309
You're gonna give
yourself a hernia.

186
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:03,039
Come on. Let's go to bed.

187
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:12,450
You want the free range
Chicken Kiev with potatoes

188
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,933
or vegetables over risotto
in a bell pepper sauce?

189
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,584
I'd like a meal prepared to order,
not manufactured for distribution.

190
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,268
Ashford was right.

191
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:24,672
About what?

192
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:27,076
All this articulate conjecture
wrapped around one fact.

193
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:30,436
- Isiaha Charles, illegal weapons
possession. / - Right.

194
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:33,600
- 8 words if you count the preposition.
- Another critic.

195
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:35,907
- You asked me to read it.
- It was mistake.

196
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,633
Because I agree with him?

197
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:42,626
Come on, sweetie.

198
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:46,656
You know I thought being fired
was the highlight of my day.

199
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:53,189
You're great sex.

200
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:57,215
But imperious and penniless
are serious social handicaps

201
00:17:57,318 --> 00:18:00,002
and you should stick
with your strengths.

202
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,508
I was hoping for sympathy.

203
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,100
Poor baby.

204
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,989
Well, that woulda worked.

205
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,712
Yeah, that's bullshit.

206
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:26,811
Rafe.

207
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,788
Talk to me, please.

208
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:36,704
- Is It your headaches again?
- Leave It alone, please.

209
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:38,525
I said I'm okay.

210
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:44,485
What's wrong with you?
I'm worried.

211
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,128
I'm okay. I'm all right.

212
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,068
I'm gonna take a ride.

213
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:03,387
Rafe please,
you need to get help.

214
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:19,903
He couldn't'a done better,
believe me.

215
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:32,097
Hey, Rafe, what's up?

216
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,824
You're almost a no-show
for inspection.

217
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:35,652
Oh, no no.
I had dinner at Maria's.

218
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:37,475
I thought you were ending that.

219
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:39,875
I am gonna process ending it.

220
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:43,238
You can get inspected every day of
the week, Rafe, if you need it.

221
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,589
But there are no exceptions.

222
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,513
I need your commitment.

223
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:54,560
I made my commitment.
That's for sure.

224
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:59,359
All right.
Let's go have some fun.

225
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,269
- say hello to Marilyn.
- Hey, Marilyn.

226
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:09,953
Hey, hero.
The girls'll be happy to see you.

227
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:17,245
He's making me
a little bit nervous.

228
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,977
You stalking me now?

229
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,340
- I'm not lazy.
- You're stoned.

230
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,741
And you are a vision
of temperance.

231
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,579
- this Is Cambodia.
- It was Kampuchea at the time.

232
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,995
Wow. I knew you used
to be somebody but

233
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:32,062
- You're burying the lead, kid.
- Come on man, I'm a good writer.

234
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:32,834
So what?

235
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:34,562
That builds strong papers.

236
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,769
- And this story Is impor. . .
- Pollack.

237
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:38,310
I don't publish stories.

238
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:43,013
I publish coupons for merchants who
don't kidnap competition,

239
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,981
bomb busses
or immolate themselves.

240
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,058
- Am I wrong about the story?
- What do I know?

241
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,549
- Help me get It right.
- do the work.

242
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:56,166
I was in court, I took notes
and tried to talk to FRAT.

243
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,087
Talk to the defendant, huh?

244
00:21:58,185 --> 00:21:59,614
He's in Longworth.

245
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,443
Afraid to visit prison?

246
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:04,741
How am I talk to somebody who
knows the defendant well.

247
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,045
How about visiting the scene of
the crime, make an assessment.

248
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:08,573
Okay.

249
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:13,571
- You're right.
- As if I need your affirmation.

250
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,236
I'm not telling you to do this.
I'm telling you not to.

251
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,245
Could be dangerous.

252
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:23,455
Will you help me or not?

253
00:22:25,384 --> 00:22:27,589
Why the sudden urge
to get this right?

254
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,890
My girlfriend read it.

255
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:32,573
Agreed with you.

256
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:37,569
Right.
You're doin' this for pussy.

257
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:41,416
- Well I wouldn't put it that way.
- For Pussy.

258
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:46,398
What happened to you?

259
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,182
Don't talk to the system.

260
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,303
What the hell does that mean?

261
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:53,597
Make up somethin' .

262
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:46,526
5:52 a.m.

263
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:54,887
The call was for a D and D,
domestic disturbance.

264
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,374
We knocked.
Couldn't be heard over the shouting.

265
00:23:57,482 --> 00:24:00,481
Well the time, 5:52 a.m.

266
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,911
5: 17, 6: 10.

267
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,174
There's no 5:52.

268
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:17,762
No report that date and address.

269
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:21,793
Filed by a Sergeant Francis Lazerov,
or an Officer Raphael Deed.

270
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:24,679
- FRAT files aren't public record.
- Why?

271
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,461
- We can't speak for FRAT.
- Who can?

272
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:29,470
FRAT.

273
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:32,838
Even if you were with a real paper
I wouldn't talk to you. That's Policy.

274
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,945
It's public record, Captain Tilman.

275
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:38,206
It's trial and conviction.
Not us, alright?

276
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,742
Here we go.

277
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:44,542
If you're gonna turn every beef
between two losers into headlines

278
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:49,057
that's gonna seriously compromise
our ability to social deviancy.

279
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:53,374
You know, we might as well
pack it up and close shop.

280
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,295
Screw John Q. Citizen.
Is that what you want?

281
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:58,494
I don't think so.

282
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:00,609
Have a good one.

283
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,142
- Bern !
- Sir.

284
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,373
It's Capt. Tilman, head of First
Response Assault & Tactical Unit.

285
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:07,815
Thanks a large part
to this gentleman

286
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:10,882
we're looking at an 82% reduction in homicides,69 in felonies,

287
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:12,808
71 in sexual assault.

288
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:15,491
With those number we can have
early intervention program.

289
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:18,943
In fact I see a day when
we won't need courts at all.

290
00:25:22,217 --> 00:25:23,940
- Hi.
- No, You Stay away.

291
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:27,871
No. I'm just looking for
somebody. Ms. Melba Charles?

292
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,791
She lives here, right?

293
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:32,286
She's over there.

294
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,567
Oh, Jesus.

295
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:19,750
Isiaha Charles?
I'm Josh Pollack, I'm a writer.

296
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:23,208
- I was at your trial.
- Oh, Yeah.

297
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:24,735
Here.

298
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,839
Listen.

299
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:36,068
After Officer Deed testified,
you said thank you.

300
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,943
Why?

301
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,496
I can't talk about the trial.

302
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:46,051
Can we talk about you?

303
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:48,644
Who you were before this?

304
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:54,055
By the way, I'm very sorry
about your mother.

305
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:56,927
What about my mother?

306
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,559
Her stroke.

307
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,288
Stroke?

308
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:04,805
- You don't know.
- Whoa, when?

309
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:07,681
- a few days ago, I guess.
- How bad of a stroke?

310
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,276
Is my mother a vegetable?

311
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:13,440
I'm sorry.

312
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:15,360
Oh, Mama.

313
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:18,912
Motherfuckers!

314
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:24,777
A'ight, look.
You gotta get me outta here.

315
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,020
You gotta get me to my mother.

316
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:27,846
- I can't.
- No, You can.

317
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,492
If you get me out of here, I'll tell you
everything you want about the trial.

318
00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:35,234
- I don't know how.
- the way they capped Rook.

319
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,542
- What?
- Stole the crack, the 40 G's.

320
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:40,610
Made up that shit about the knife.
I'll tell you all of that.

321
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:44,352
Ma. . .

322
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,136
I love you.

323
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:48,746
You hang on.

324
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,393
I'll be home soon.

325
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,561
I promise.

326
00:27:58,987 --> 00:28:01,671
You get this to her.
You promise me.

327
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:10,400
Fuck!

328
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:14,431
I'm sorry.

329
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,256
Mrs. Charles.

330
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,347
Ma, I love you.
You hang on.

331
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:36,898
I'll be home soon.
I promise.

332
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:53,221
You call me now?
I'm not your personal editor.

333
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:54,752
Just read this.

334
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,240
This is a Pulitzer.

335
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:40,736
What's it for?

336
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,241
Blowing the judging committee.
What do you think?

337
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,442
You saw Isiaha's arrest report?

338
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,547
Copies of the court transcript.

339
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:51,433
- No mention of cash, coke or guns?
- No.

340
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:54,401
- the emergency dispatch?
- The copy's there.

341
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:58,437
There's no record of a 911
that time, date, address.

342
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:04,391
You talked to the District Attorney,
the Public Defender, Judge.

343
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,976
You told me not to
talk to the system.

344
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:10,144
What do you think?

345
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:13,120
It could dismantle the
department when it's done.

346
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,657
What's missing?

347
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,255
The other side of the story.

348
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,459
They're murderers.

349
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,244
If you believe Isiaha Charles.

350
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,746
You won't publish it as is?

351
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,663
I won't publish it at all.

352
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:29,344
But The Times will if you
get the department's side.

353
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:31,842
The department?
They're murderers.

354
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,449
Right.
You're doing this for pussy.

355
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:43,207
I'm doin' it for this.

356
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,457
Fourth estate, Pollack.

357
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:56,266
It's the only job protected by
the Constitution, and this is why.

358
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:58,177
This is tyranny.

359
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,063
When you see it
you're obligated to yell.

360
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,129
A risk you're unwilling to take,
and I don't blame you.

361
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:08,555
In your new enlightenment I'll take
you back to the Herald,

362
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:12,198
but don't call yourself a jeranalist.

363
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,081
The coupon king has spoken.

364
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:18,242
Good night, Pollack.

365
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:21,896
Oh, here, take this with you.

366
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:25,443
Go on, leave. Leave.

367
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,985
Go.

368
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:07,907
- get the door.
- got it.

369
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,786
You move, you die!
Spread 'em! Spread 'em!

370
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,851
- Here.
- Against the wall.

371
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:45,666
Hey Deed !

372
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:48,169
I got somethin' for ya!

373
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:49,890
Come on, baseball.

374
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:52,866
Watch your step!

375
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,417
Fuck.

376
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,240
Shut up, gimme your other hand.

377
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,178
Shut up.
All right, let's go.

378
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:12,072
Bern, I owe you. . .Anything

379
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:15,337
Not now, not here.
Girls, come out everybody come out.

380
00:33:15,437 --> 00:33:16,866
- Laz.
- Yeah.

381
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,788
Take the girls out.
I'm going downstairs.

382
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:20,321
- Party at my house.
- Line up Here.

383
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:22,152
- Let's go.
- Come on, sweetie.

384
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:26,086
Come on.
Come on.

385
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:29,258
Here ya go, cupcake.

386
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:31,173
The fuck am I gonna do with this?

387
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:35,145
I thought you gave up
muckraking, Moses.

388
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:38,498
It's Pollack's story.

389
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:44,451
You heard of anything
like this, Levon?

390
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,946
Sure all the time.
From felons.

391
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:48,482
Well, there it is.

392
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,714
D.A. 's office doesn't comment on
unsubstantiated accusations.

393
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:56,361
Why don't you come back
when you have specifics?

394
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:59,816
- We can't be more specific.
- What are We talking about?

395
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,600
Innuendo? Hearsay?

396
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:08,264
D.A. needs names.
Otherwise the office can't respond.

397
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:13,068
Jack, when did you start referring
to yourself as an inanimate object?

398
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,251
You run a community weekly Moses

399
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:23,435
and I'll always have time for you
but now that time is up.

400
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:26,690
Mr. Pollack.

401
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:29,677
Mr. Reigert. Mr. Wallace.

402
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,405
These aren't the good old days,
Moses.

403
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:36,520
They never were, Jack.

404
00:34:40,174 --> 00:34:41,996
- Why wouldn't you give him
- Huh-uh.

405
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:44,100
- if You were to just
- Not now.

406
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:47,367
Ashford doesn't come here easily.

407
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:50,338
He didn't have anything
specific or actual either.

408
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,609
Ignore it.
I'm not insulting Tilman with this.

409
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,139
Yeah, it's Jack.

410
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:56,866
Can you come on over?

411
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:01,386
- Why weren't you more specific?
- You have a source to protect.

412
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:03,308
I was that vague, you fired me.

413
00:35:04,078 --> 00:35:07,340
Do you know how
pervasive this is?

414
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:08,774
Are you think they're involved?

415
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:11,267
I don't know who's involved,
and neither do you.

416
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:13,579
Than why did we
even come here?

417
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:16,553
Levon Wallace,
city's best investigator.

418
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:19,239
If the story holds up
he'll confirm it.

419
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,770
What do we do now?

420
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,995
I publish coupons.
You should look for a job.

421
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:27,109
- Mr. Ashford
- Look, kid.

422
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:31,851
You've got a story, access to the
D.A. and his best investigator.

423
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,015
If you can't make a career of that
you don't belong in this business.

424
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:37,698
Mr. Ashford.

425
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:40,871
Stop the Mister. Okay?
I'm outta this game.

426
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,555
And your late night visits irk me.

427
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,195
If Wallace confirms your story,

428
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:48,742
then you have to put the question
to Tilman, Lazerov, and Deed.

429
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,108
Use a phone.
And pray they don't take the call.

430
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:55,555
Moses!

431
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:58,531
Look, kid.
It's Friday.

432
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:01,802
Go do what you're supposed to do.
Go get laid, for christ sake.

433
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,417
- Outta the way.
- I wasn't doin' a thing.

434
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:26,892
Yeah, whatever.

435
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:33,507
- Look out.
- All right!

436
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:51,171
Hey.
Just here to dance.

437
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,435
Have a good time.

438
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:27,875
What?

439
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:33,644
Oh, my God. . .
Poppy.

440
00:37:58,031 --> 00:37:59,460
Pollack.

441
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:03,878
- Who's that?
- He's a reporter.

442
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,388
We have to go.

443
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,405
- Why?
- We have to go.

444
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,012
- That's the guy from your story.
- Shh.

445
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:22,888
He's kinda cute, right?

446
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:24,620
Are you dating other people?

447
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,726
Don't worry. Looks like
he just got engaged.

448
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,417
I saw that.
Tough break for you.

449
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:35,364
You never put a face on it do you?
Once published, it will ruin his life.

450
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,195
I'm not ruining his life.

451
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:41,220
I said your story.
God, it is always about you, right?

452
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,685
I do think about that. Okay.

453
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,078
I think about ruining somebody's
life.

454
00:38:47,183 --> 00:38:48,612
You're not gonna get
self-absorbed and mopey?

455
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,021
Don't get all soft and mopey

456
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:57,354
Hey, what are you doing?

457
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,387
- What happened?
- Come on. Move it!

458
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:05,315
Get outta the way!

459
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:09,060
Move! Move!

460
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,576
Don't move, help's comin' .

461
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,108
Aw, fuck.

462
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:28,298
Officer Deed, Edison P. D. I have 2
down outside the Plaza Nightclub.

463
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,412
I have a medical bracelet here.

464
00:39:30,511 --> 00:39:34,733
It says serum prothrombin
conversion, blood type O.

465
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:39,531
Stay still, buddy. Help's comin' .

466
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:42,020
- She needs help.
- I know. Stay still.

467
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:01,316
You okay?

468
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,196
Yeah.

469
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,789
Hell. Shit.

470
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:09,893
Wallace?

471
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:11,909
You ever answer your
fucking phone?

472
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:12,299
You?

473
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:13,742
I've been up all night.

474
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,320
Pollack got the shit kicked up
last night, so did Willow.

475
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:18,667
What? Who?

476
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,834
His girlfriend.
They're in the hospital.

477
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:25,381
How bad?

478
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:27,974
She's in a coma.

479
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:33,541
She's got factor seven deficiency.
It's a blood disorder.

480
00:41:34,512 --> 00:41:36,901
They don't know how
she's gonna survive.

481
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:39,012
And Pollack?

482
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:41,703
Took a beating but he'll be all right.

483
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:43,909
Mugged?

484
00:41:44,784 --> 00:41:46,213
Warned.

485
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,533
Who are you?

486
00:42:04,753 --> 00:42:06,858
Deed. Edison P. D.
Who are you?

487
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,079
- You don't wanna be here.
- Who are you?

488
00:42:12,752 --> 00:42:15,240
Moses Ashford,
I own the paper he works for.

489
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:21,286
- How bad Is he?
- He's banged up.

490
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:23,689
Sedated. Do you care?

491
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:31,948
- Tell him somethin'?
- Tell him What?

492
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,575
Tell him I have nothing
to do with this.

493
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,982
- with What?
- You gonna Tell him or not?

494
00:42:45,777 --> 00:42:47,205
Officer Deed.

495
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,823
Is there any hope for you, son?

496
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:55,845
No.

497
00:42:57,872 --> 00:42:58,821
Let go.

498
00:42:58,929 --> 00:43:00,751
- What are you doin'?
- Go me.

499
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:09,290
It's not safe for him here.

500
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:11,237
Move him somewhere safe.

501
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,126
Come in.

502
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,506
Make yourself as
comfortable as you can.

503
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,871
The market will deliver.
It's on Wallace's tab.

504
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:33,132
You have run of the house,
but, no matches.

505
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:35,622
- No fire at All near the barn.
- You told me.

506
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:38,216
All that dry hay could catch fire.

507
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:42,063
This place has been in
Wallace's family for years.

508
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,109
Why do I have to stay here?

509
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:45,802
You don't have to stay here.
take a plane, go home to mommy.

510
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:46,952
I wanna be near Willow.

511
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,064
Believe me, it's safer
both of you if you're here.

512
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,795
When I publish.

513
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:52,326
You can't publish.

514
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:55,308
- Why not?
- Look at what they did to me!

515
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:59,920
Serious journalism doesn't
look so good up close, huh?

516
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:04,143
It's a little hard to tell with this large
thing hanging over my eye, thanks.

517
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:07,338
So who's a fraud now?

518
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:10,026
You know what? You don't
even know what it's like.

519
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,061
Life's a bitch, ain't it?

520
00:44:14,162 --> 00:44:18,384
Think you can swim, then it's oh
shit, where are my water wings?

521
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,107
This isn't from swimming pool.

522
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:22,511
No, this is what you aspire to.

523
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:25,191
You want a prize?
Here's your shot.

524
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:30,189
See when you asked Charles
to tell you his story you committed.

525
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:34,314
Now you have a moral duty.
People depending on you.

526
00:44:36,914 --> 00:44:38,822
Doesn't get any better than that, kid.

527
00:44:41,522 --> 00:44:44,489
Hey, why are you doin'
this to me?

528
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:47,656
Cause you did it to me.
I'll call you later.

1
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:53,331
How can I help you, Frank?

2
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:55,252
Why were you at that club?

3
00:45:57,277 --> 00:46:01,305
Yoga, exercises, aerobics.
What do you think? I was dancin' .

4
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:01,876
Dancin'?

5
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:04,220
Yeah. It's a dance club, Frank.

6
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:06,707
I'm fuckin' James Brown.
Watch me.

7
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:08,725
- Ow!
- Yeah, I feel good.

8
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:11,517
- I got soul.
- Neck bones, candy ass.

9
00:46:11,617 --> 00:46:15,263
- Right, Right, right. right.
- Oh.

10
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,710
- After You clocked out. . .
- Hm?

11
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,640
- Tilman got a call.
- right.

12
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:22,745
That Herald reporter was
makin' noise at the Hall.

13
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:26,778
Nothin' hardcore but
he had to come to Jesus.

14
00:46:27,457 --> 00:46:28,985
The girl need one, too?

15
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:32,640
I didn't know
she had bad blood.

16
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:35,040
- I figured She was a bonus.
- right.

17
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:38,783
Gave him a sermon, he's pissed
chapter and verse the girlfriend.

18
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:41,951
- He won't be gettin' dumb now.
- Yeah.

19
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,480
This is from Tilman.

20
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,420
- You gotta worry.
- right.

21
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:50,302
Pollack.
The kid's got nothin' .

22
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:51,831
His source.

23
00:46:53,285 --> 00:46:54,714
Who?

24
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,563
Your Jesus buddy got
shanked at Longworth.

25
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:03,002
Drive safe.

26
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,202
Fuck.

27
00:47:41,804 --> 00:47:43,331
Who the hell told you?

28
00:47:43,437 --> 00:47:46,982
Lazerov said it came from you.
I went to the hospital, went in there.

29
00:47:47,663 --> 00:47:49,485
And I saw a some guy,
I don't know who it was.

30
00:47:49,582 --> 00:47:54,089
And I was Deed.
Deed was talking to him I left.

31
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:57,355
Lazerov said?
When did that start?

32
00:47:57,455 --> 00:47:58,403
Please, give me a break.

33
00:47:58,512 --> 00:48:00,138
- Give You a break?
- You know What Lazerov said

34
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,543
Can you over the hospital he's
taking you and Wu to the hospital,

35
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,071
nobody's calling me,
nobody's saying anything.

36
00:48:04,177 --> 00:48:05,703
I thought you knew.
It's not up to me.

37
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:06,856
How do I know?

38
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:07,724
Oh, shit.

39
00:48:07,824 --> 00:48:08,489
Well thank you.

40
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:14,058
Thanks for dropping by
and laying this shit on me.

41
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:17,519
Hospital security.

42
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:20,393
- Lazerov?
- You got that For me?

43
00:48:20,786 --> 00:48:23,569
Yeah, Pollack was released
to Wallace and Ashford.

44
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,094
What'd you get?

45
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:27,696
Nothin' that can't be mitigated.

46
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:32,112
Except maybe the photos,
taken before help arrived.

47
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,048
And there's a bad news.

48
00:48:37,399 --> 00:48:39,502
- Charles Is dead.
- What?

49
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:40,947
Knifed at Longworth.

50
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,977
Great. If Charles is dead,
we got nothin' .

51
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:47,377
We got a bigger problem.

52
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:53,528
FRAT collars dealers
with drugs, guns, flesh.

53
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:55,191
Guilty verdicts.

54
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:57,869
Whatever FRAT confiscates,
FRAT keeps.

55
00:48:57,975 --> 00:49:01,905
$ 12 million cash
in the past 5 years.

56
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:06,227
Six million dollars for ordnance.
Four million for surveillance.

57
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:09,594
Tilman overpays by two,
three, 400 percent.

58
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:11,600
But take a look at
who he's buying from.

59
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,136
Surveillance from midland.

60
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,829
PC's from high tower.
Arms from Phoenix.

61
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:18,801
Oh, Digi-Vector
they built FRAT's website.

62
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:23,031
They own sports teams.

63
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:25,334
Car dealerships.
Retail chains.

64
00:49:25,436 --> 00:49:26,384
City's leadership.

65
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:31,282
And the founders of
the Better Edison Foundation.

66
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,436
When did this pop up?

67
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:35,989
It hasn't yet.
Official opening's next week.

68
00:49:38,688 --> 00:49:40,029
Reigert.

69
00:49:40,128 --> 00:49:42,332
It's a political action committee.

70
00:49:42,432 --> 00:49:45,115
The overpayments
end up right here.

71
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:46,076
Money laundering.

72
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:48,959
Yeah well, we're not gonna
find any memos on that.

73
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:53,115
You showed me the bones
of a covert fascist state.

74
00:49:56,482 --> 00:49:57,343
Methodist Hospital.

75
00:49:57,441 --> 00:50:00,890
Hi, I'm checking on a patient,
Willow Summerfield.

76
00:50:00,995 --> 00:50:02,521
Are you a relative?

77
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:05,213
I'm a friend.
I was in the hospital with her.

78
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:07,419
Oh. One moment.

79
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,138
Shit.

80
00:50:18,277 --> 00:50:19,901
Just spread it out here.

81
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,515
FRAT's basic profile.

82
00:50:24,615 --> 00:50:29,404
Six-two, 200 plus pounds.
Perfect rifle, pistol scores. . .

83
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:34,115
each one of 'em prior to joining
FRAT had three physical. . .

84
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:35,842
fights in their jackets.

85
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:37,669
None are married, no kids.

86
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:41,217
The night Pollack was attacked,
he was there.

87
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,811
- Why Is that a surprise.
- he was with a girl.

88
00:50:44,204 --> 00:50:47,945
She kept lookin' at an engagement
ring like she just got it.

89
00:50:49,003 --> 00:50:50,379
So two things.

90
00:50:51,437 --> 00:50:56,999
You don't take your honey to
a tune-up and FRAT don't marry.

91
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:16,000
Come on.

92
00:51:57,523 --> 00:52:01,549
I really like living alone but,
I'm beginning to think. . .

93
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,081
What?

94
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:06,252
I think I need a woman in my life.

95
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:08,459
Well, shit, don't look at me.

96
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,723
He's not answerin' .

97
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:20,179
You dialed the wrong number.

98
00:52:20,276 --> 00:52:22,863
I know my number,
I dialed it twice.

99
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,028
He's gone.

100
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:28,476
Motherfucker!

101
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:37,691
Damn it. Why don't I
call the County Sheriff?

102
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:40,672
The County Sheriff is Tilman's
duck hunting partner.

103
00:53:55,492 --> 00:53:56,921
There. There.

104
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,446
Josh !

105
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:09,795
What the fuck are you doing?

106
00:54:09,894 --> 00:54:14,118
Lazerov was at the farm!
I blew up that bastard's car.

107
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:16,029
You blew up his car.

108
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:17,662
He was gonna kill me.

109
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,389
Jesus Christ.

110
00:54:20,073 --> 00:54:22,465
Well Tilman'll rein Lazerov
in for goin' to my house

111
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,829
but it doesn't mean you're safe.
He's homicidal.

112
00:54:25,928 --> 00:54:27,556
He's killed 6 in the line of duty.

113
00:54:27,658 --> 00:54:30,048
Six? And he's still
wearing a badge?

114
00:54:30,153 --> 00:54:33,897
That was 15 years ago when Edison
was the murder capital of America.

115
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:36,296
When our biggest industry was
the production of crystal meth

116
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:41,217
and when drive-bys were a sport.
That was before you came back.

117
00:54:46,509 --> 00:54:49,292
Did you see Deed give a girl
an engagement ring?

118
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,073
Yeah.
Why is that important?

119
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,660
No member of FRAT's
ever been married.

120
00:54:55,342 --> 00:54:56,488
So?

121
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,273
It may be the only hook
we have to hang our hat on.

122
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:01,960
- Isiaha Charles can
- Charles's dead.

123
00:55:02,062 --> 00:55:04,364
- What?
- he was knifed in prison.

124
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,605
Jesus Christ.

125
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:14,256
Your work ever ruin a life?

126
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:19,432
Did it?

127
00:55:19,635 --> 00:55:23,660
You do this job right you'll
ruin lives, celebrate murderers.

128
00:55:24,147 --> 00:55:26,634
They'll give you
a Pulitzer Prize for it.

129
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:30,384
I need you to reach out to Deed.

130
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:37,489
Look, you don't have
to do this with your life.

131
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:41,257
But if you're going to,
now is when you decide.

132
00:55:53,173 --> 00:55:54,419
- Who Is this?
- It's Pollak.

133
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,762
What the fuck do you want it?

134
00:55:55,863 --> 00:55:57,389
Meet me at Blunts.

135
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:16,305
Damn, Francis,
you are outta control.

136
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,610
You are outta control, Francis.

137
00:56:18,715 --> 00:56:21,499
I thought you said you
wanted fear of God put in this guy.

138
00:56:21,596 --> 00:56:23,986
So you thought that extended
to his girlfriend?

139
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:24,855
I just thought.

140
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:28,886
No, you didn't think.
You acted on impulse.

141
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:34,549
I've had to preach to a spouse,
but only after due consideration.

142
00:56:34,654 --> 00:56:36,313
Do consideration.

143
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:39,677
You enlisted Marilyn, Wu and you
went to that hospital on impulse!

144
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,203
And now this!

145
00:56:41,407 --> 00:56:43,033
The fuckin' punk was
writin' a story about me.

146
00:56:43,135 --> 00:56:45,339
There is no story, Francis!

147
00:56:45,727 --> 00:56:50,235
It's a bunch of allegations made
by a convicted felon who is dead.

148
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:51,964
And that's where it
woulda stayed had you

149
00:56:52,064 --> 00:56:55,415
not dragged it to the front door
of Lee Wallace's family farm.

150
00:56:55,522 --> 00:56:59,450
Instead of a kid makin' his first foray
into the world of journalism.

151
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:03,961
I got a seasoned investigator
up my ass probing FRAT business.

152
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,423
This is gonna require
all my attention.

153
00:57:07,617 --> 00:57:10,399
Until it's resolved,
you're desk-bound.

154
00:57:21,347 --> 00:57:23,452
You're takin' Wallace's side?

155
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:24,987
No.

156
00:57:25,092 --> 00:57:26,814
He's a fuckin' poser.

157
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:29,982
Rodeo clown with Santa Fe
string tie bullshit.

158
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:34,013
Gimme a break. I've done everything
you asked me to do.

159
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,548
Yes.

160
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:40,836
He pissed on the idea
of FRAT since the beginning.

161
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:42,080
That's politics.

162
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:44,388
15 fuckin' years
I'm on the streets.

163
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:46,397
Gettin' rid of the cancer
that was killin' this town !

164
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:49,570
Fifteen years ago, Edison
needed brute force to survive.

165
00:57:49,672 --> 00:57:53,600
Now, it needs finesse,
hardly your strong suit!

166
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:55,234
I've done everything.

167
00:57:56,395 --> 00:57:59,940
Every fuckin' thing
that you asked me to do.

168
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:01,384
Yes.

169
00:58:01,483 --> 00:58:02,726
And now what?

170
00:58:02,826 --> 00:58:04,550
You're gonna throw me
in the fuckin' garbage?

171
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:08,394
I'm on your side.
Let's just go get in the car.

172
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:11,844
It's not fuckin' right
you takin' his side.

173
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:12,897
I'm on your side.

174
00:58:13,004 --> 00:58:17,031
It's not right you takin' his side.

175
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:17,701
I'm not. . .

176
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:21,450
It's not fuckin' right
you takin' his side!

177
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:24,325
It's not fuckin' right!

178
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:33,475
Francis.

179
00:58:34,733 --> 00:58:36,645
You're my guy,
you're number one with me.

180
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,297
Since day one.
What are you doin'?

181
00:58:40,495 --> 00:58:42,403
You're my guy okay?

182
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,677
Let's get in the car
and get the fuck outta here.

183
00:58:48,177 --> 00:58:49,322
Straight up?

184
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:50,954
That's no bullshit.

185
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:55,665
Let's just go get in the car,
all right?

186
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:57,577
And cut the shit.

187
00:59:00,658 --> 00:59:04,881
- Let's get in the car.
- I'm sorry. I just need to sleep.

188
00:59:08,436 --> 00:59:09,865
Yeah.

189
00:59:30,552 --> 00:59:32,077
Smooth operator.

190
00:59:33,721 --> 00:59:34,865
I'm in the book.

191
00:59:34,968 --> 00:59:36,114
Your line
may be tapped.

192
00:59:36,216 --> 00:59:36,883
Are you?

193
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:38,030
No.

194
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:41,297
I'm not wired.

195
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:44,376
You're shakin' .

196
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:46,002
Well I'm scared shitless.

197
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:50,133
I didn't do that to you.

198
00:59:52,444 --> 00:59:53,971
Now where are they?

199
00:59:54,072 --> 00:59:55,123
Down the street.

200
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:56,753
And who are they?

201
01:00:14,718 --> 01:00:16,343
You should teach.

202
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:19,991
What?

203
01:00:20,957 --> 01:00:23,063
You said you needed a woman

204
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,412
The only guys your age I know. . .

205
01:00:24,511 --> 01:00:27,130
havin' sex regularly
are college professors.

206
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:37,691
This is who I am.

207
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:42,209
When's it hit the paper?

208
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:47,970
An officer of the court
wants to believe this story.

209
01:00:48,737 --> 01:00:52,384
An aberration in a life that
has a chance of having value.

210
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:54,877
Man, my life is over.

211
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:56,314
- Come on.
- What?

212
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:57,849
Let's go on back.

213
01:00:59,493 --> 01:01:02,657
Sit down.
Have a seat.

214
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:11,007
Let's go.

215
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,575
What do you mean
your life is over?

216
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:18,883
You have a beautiful fiance.

217
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:20,991
Yeah.

218
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:25,631
So you'd walk
from that for prison?

219
01:01:26,794 --> 01:01:29,475
I'm not seein'
a lotta options.

220
01:01:30,248 --> 01:01:32,158
The guys out there. . .

221
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:36,008
they think you got caught up in
this before you knew what it was.

222
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:40,903
I knew.

223
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:43,969
They think you
can get immunity.

224
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,759
They want you to tell your
story to a superior court judge.

225
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:49,732
Force Reigert and Tilman to resign.

226
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:51,843
Edison'll clean up its own mess.

227
01:01:51,948 --> 01:01:55,015
You think the
court's not involved?

228
01:01:55,118 --> 01:01:57,507
Un-fucking-believable.

229
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:01,066
Is anybody not
corrupt in this town?

230
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:02,793
I don't know. . .you?

231
01:02:06,926 --> 01:02:09,413
If it goes to justice. . .

232
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,910
- be the guy to take it.
- Why?

233
01:02:13,552 --> 01:02:15,852
Well I thought you were in love.

234
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,638
She can do better.

235
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:20,869
Can you?

236
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:33,064
I was studyin' plumbin'
when you called.

237
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:37,487
- I mean. . .
- Nice.

238
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:41,996
You know, I like to
think about that

239
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:46,705
comin' home to Maria
huggin' my children.

240
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,292
Just livin' a normal life.

241
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:57,364
Wha's up?

242
01:02:59,926 --> 01:03:05,142
What happened to her.

243
01:03:07,545 --> 01:03:10,805
- She didn't deserve this.
- You're right.

244
01:03:45,597 --> 01:03:47,703
It was a righteous offer.

245
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,079
This is gonna get ugly.

246
01:04:07,872 --> 01:04:10,175
No, no.
Let him go.

247
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:32,139
Just got a call
from Hanson at FBI.

248
01:05:32,237 --> 01:05:35,401
Justice is setting
up a task force.

249
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:37,707
Sturm und drang.

250
01:05:37,807 --> 01:05:42,118
If they had anything, they'd be
arresting, not searching.

251
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,758
And will they find anything?

252
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,725
- This isn't connected to you.
- You're connected to me.

253
01:05:46,832 --> 01:05:49,037
And you're under a microscope.

254
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:53,165
Because of your. . .
your reckless behavior.

255
01:05:53,264 --> 01:05:56,048
The girl's picture will
be everywhere tomorrow.

256
01:05:56,145 --> 01:05:57,967
Wallace and Ashford
already know somethin's up.

257
01:05:58,065 --> 01:06:00,366
If that kid's article
links me and Better Edison to

258
01:06:00,466 --> 01:06:04,013
I am the reason that
this city is what it is.

259
01:06:04,116 --> 01:06:07,280
This? This doesn't
get near to you.

260
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:11,241
Yeah well. . .
I wish I had your certainty.

261
01:06:16,053 --> 01:06:17,680
FBI.
This is a Federal warrant.

262
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:20,563
We're taking all
FRAT evidence files.

263
01:06:36,503 --> 01:06:38,227
In my office.

264
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:52,535
They have impounded your car.
Or what's left of it.

265
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:55,416
Anything that you need to
tell me right now, Laz?

266
01:06:57,241 --> 01:06:58,869
No, Captain.

267
01:06:58,972 --> 01:07:02,235
Sit on it then,
till O-one hundred.

268
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:05,493
Go.

269
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:09,816
Goddamn phones everywhere.

270
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:11,444
Fuckin' yid from the Herald.

271
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:14,517
- You don't know that.
- Bullshit. He was makin' noise.

272
01:07:14,622 --> 01:07:15,385
And you

273
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:18,935
with your Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
beggin' to be looked at.

274
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:21,244
You say anything to Maria?

275
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:24,693
You flap your lips and
she could come to Jesus, too.

276
01:08:29,929 --> 01:08:32,610
Get his keys.

277
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:34,818
And call nine-one-one.

278
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:01,414
Tilman shot Lazerov.

279
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:03,143
Lazerov's dead.

280
01:09:03,246 --> 01:09:07,020
Apparently Lazerov attempted
to shoot Deed. Tilman intervened.

281
01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:09,418
Well Tilman just served up.

282
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:10,661
Dammit.

283
01:09:10,765 --> 01:09:12,195
Come on.
No, wait, Lee.

284
01:09:12,301 --> 01:09:14,026
- What's the point, Moe?
- Wait a minute.

285
01:09:14,126 --> 01:09:16,036
Forget it, Moe!
Forget the whole thing.

286
01:09:16,143 --> 01:09:17,190
This isn't going anywhere.

287
01:09:17,293 --> 01:09:18,538
Bullshit.

288
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:21,704
- Pollack!
- This shit isn't over.

289
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,665
What are you doing?

290
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:25,257
Isiaha's dead.
Willow's in a fucking coma?

291
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,603
I'll publish myself

292
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:30,251
if I have to copy it at Kinko's
and pass it out on the street corner.

293
01:09:32,271 --> 01:09:35,917
It's a fucking disaster.
A fucking disaster! !

294
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:39,371
We were on the short list
for the Republican Convention.

295
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:42,060
The summer fucking Olympics! !

296
01:09:42,257 --> 01:09:45,130
And now we're look at
a Federal consent decree?

297
01:09:45,236 --> 01:09:49,165
There's a dead body
outside my fucking office! !

298
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,756
The fuck are we gonna do?

299
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:55,209
It kinda puts a little crimp in your
Better Edison thing, doesn't it?

300
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,747
We gotta do something
about him, Lee.

301
01:09:56,854 --> 01:09:57,802
Who, Tilman?

302
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:01,203
Well. . .there it is.
You know. Yeah.

303
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:03,211
What about you, Jack?

304
01:10:03,317 --> 01:10:04,747
Huh? Me?

305
01:10:04,855 --> 01:10:07,156
Yeah you.

306
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:13,202
What are we gonna do about you?

307
01:10:13,304 --> 01:10:18,390
Well. . . I'll be fine.
Thanks for asking.

308
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:18,240
All units. . .All units
please respond.

309
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:20,640
We have a five-twelve
at 6th and Main.

310
01:11:20,738 --> 01:11:23,038
All units.
All units please respond.

311
01:11:23,137 --> 01:11:25,725
We have a five-twelve at 6th and
Main.

312
01:11:25,826 --> 01:11:28,794
Copy that dispatch.
This is two-six responding.

313
01:11:38,886 --> 01:11:39,747
Hello?

314
01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:42,911
It's me. Meet me at the courthouse
tomorrow morning at nine.

315
01:11:43,013 --> 01:11:44,540
Rafe please talk

316
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:47,229
Hello? Rafe?

317
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:01,089
Josh?

318
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,511
- Maria?
- Yeah. Green. Hi.

319
01:12:05,609 --> 01:12:09,734
Thank you for helping Raphael get
over his fear of doing this.

320
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:12,511
I'm Hector, Maria's father.

321
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:13,861
- Hi.
- Yeah.

322
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:14,629
Where's Rafe?

323
01:12:14,732 --> 01:12:16,834
He's changing in
the men's room. Yeah.

324
01:12:16,938 --> 01:12:18,564
- Okay.
- Okay.

325
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:22,691
Rafe?

326
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:24,329
Rafe?

327
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:26,053
Yeah, I'm out here!

328
01:12:34,509 --> 01:12:36,235
What's goin' on, man?

329
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:40,645
What are ya doin'?

330
01:12:44,877 --> 01:12:46,505
It's crazy, man.

331
01:12:46,799 --> 01:12:48,422
Tilman shot.

332
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:49,387
Yeah, I know.

333
01:12:49,485 --> 01:12:52,358
And your first reaction
is 'let's get married'?

334
01:12:52,463 --> 01:12:53,740
It's what she wants.

335
01:12:53,838 --> 01:12:55,465
That's her.

336
01:12:55,566 --> 01:12:57,869
Hey, why are you doin' it?

337
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:00,167
Death benefits.

338
01:13:05,074 --> 01:13:06,502
What' this?

339
01:13:06,609 --> 01:13:08,432
It's the rest of your story.

340
01:13:11,218 --> 01:13:13,127
Are you sure?

341
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:14,760
Am I sure of what?

342
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:18,413
Are you sure you want this,
and I want you to think about it.

343
01:13:18,515 --> 01:13:22,343
Something goes wrong your
whole world comes crashin' down.

344
01:13:22,452 --> 01:13:24,363
And mine, too.

345
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,879
What do you think?

346
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:33,295
I say write your fuckin' story.

347
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,421
Thank you.

348
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,054
Just remember.

349
01:13:40,408 --> 01:13:45,109
These guys don't fuck around.

350
01:13:45,397 --> 01:13:47,221
They're relentless.

351
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:49,905
Keep your head down.

352
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,382
And your door locked.

353
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,528
Thank you.

354
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,249
Come on, I gotta get married,
come on. Let's get out.

355
01:14:41,504 --> 01:14:43,328
Rafe. Come in.

356
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:45,148
- Hey, Rafe.
- Wha's up, man?

357
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,119
Rafe. Sit down.

358
01:14:56,226 --> 01:14:58,714
This is a police file photo
Pollack's girlfriend

359
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,208
at the Lazerov's come to
Jesus talk.

360
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:08,227
And there it is. The enemy
you can't beat a photograph.

361
01:15:08,324 --> 01:15:11,673
Ashford's printing this as
a tease to polics story on FRAT.

362
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,845
So we say Charles is a liar.

363
01:15:14,949 --> 01:15:18,015
He'd say anything to go home
and visit his dying mother, right?

364
01:15:18,117 --> 01:15:19,744
Whatever discrepancies
there are between

365
01:15:19,845 --> 01:15:21,950
his testimony and what's
actually in the police locker

366
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:26,180
will be offset when the Feds find the
drugs we planted in 's house.

367
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,963
You rammed the door
to compromise its security.

368
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:33,188
Keep the junkies from using
the place as a shooting gallery.

369
01:15:33,288 --> 01:15:35,872
Lazerov was unstable.

370
01:15:35,976 --> 01:15:37,601
So the Feds' will buy that.

371
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:39,614
All that's left is Pollack.

372
01:15:41,641 --> 01:15:42,786
Pollack?

373
01:15:48,392 --> 01:15:49,638
He's a kid.

374
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:58,085
Justice needs the case closed.

375
01:15:58,188 --> 01:16:00,391
So we give 'em.

376
01:16:00,491 --> 01:16:03,656
Herald needs its advertisers,
I can handle that.

377
01:16:03,757 --> 01:16:05,862
But this kid pollack?

378
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:09,510
This kid polic is
like a pup with a bone.

379
01:16:09,613 --> 01:16:10,858
He doesn't wanna hear
there's no meat on it,

380
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:13,829
he just keeps gnawin'
and gnawin' and gnawin' .

381
01:16:14,608 --> 01:16:15,655
So. . .

382
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,167
Polic has to see the man.

383
01:16:26,898 --> 01:16:28,720
It's a partner's duty.

384
01:16:32,369 --> 01:16:34,474
To Laz?

385
01:16:34,578 --> 01:16:37,448
To Laz.

386
01:16:54,258 --> 01:16:55,308
What?!

387
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:57,714
What? What?

388
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:59,724
You know what.

389
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:01,553
You know exactly what.

390
01:17:01,654 --> 01:17:03,378
You're the only one
that can put an end to this now.

391
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:05,781
I go to Justice, what I'm dealing
with threatens the people I love.

392
01:17:05,878 --> 01:17:06,826
What's the matter with you?

393
01:17:06,933 --> 01:17:07,882
You're havin' an
argument with yourself.

394
01:17:07,992 --> 01:17:10,578
- Don't talk to me like I was
- I said It was a righteous offer. . .

395
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:11,540
but I'm not takin' it.

396
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,267
You're not listening.

397
01:17:17,784 --> 01:17:20,567
I'm not talkin' about my offer.

398
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:22,488
I didn't say go to Justice.

399
01:17:22,586 --> 01:17:27,768
I said you're the only one who can
put an end to this. Didn't I?

400
01:17:27,864 --> 01:17:29,392
Yes you did

401
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:35,444
Yes you did.

402
01:17:53,821 --> 01:17:56,506
Hello, you've reached the
answering machine for. . .

403
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:57,850
Moses Ashford.

404
01:17:57,951 --> 01:18:00,438
Please leave a message at the tone.

405
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:03,990
Hey, it's Josh.
You're not gonna believe this.

406
01:18:04,094 --> 01:18:06,877
I just got a hold of
the evidence we need on FRAT.

407
01:18:06,976 --> 01:18:09,758
Listen, I don't wanna talk
over the phone, but

408
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:12,059
Moses, you're gonna
wanna see this.

409
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,941
I'm layin' out the story now
and then I'll email it to you.

410
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,585
Oh, and I'm also Fed-Ex'ing
hardcopies to all the big papers.

411
01:18:18,686 --> 01:18:20,117
I'll talk to you later.

412
01:18:42,915 --> 01:18:44,442
You've got email.

413
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:57,742
Right.

414
01:19:57,839 --> 01:19:59,268
Yes, I know.

415
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:03,406
Yeah, I emailed it last night
but I'll mail a hardcopy to be safe. . .

416
01:20:03,503 --> 01:20:06,286
so let me get your
address right now.

417
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:13,582
Okay, right,
perfect

418
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:16,170
Okay, it's on its way.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

419
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:40,299
Fuck.

420
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,166
What're you doing?

421
01:21:14,589 --> 01:21:15,635
In the car!

422
01:21:16,026 --> 01:21:17,935
In the car!
Move! Get in !

423
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,050
Oh my god.

424
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:43,990
Shit!

425
01:21:49,663 --> 01:21:50,427
Fuck!

426
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:02,328
Fuck.

427
01:22:05,414 --> 01:22:06,937
We're gonna fuckin' die.

428
01:22:14,341 --> 01:22:15,202
Move it!

429
01:22:15,685 --> 01:22:16,449
Go!

430
01:22:18,948 --> 01:22:20,193
Open fire!

431
01:22:22,596 --> 01:22:24,420
- Go! Go! Go!
- What?

432
01:22:24,998 --> 01:22:26,428
Go! Go!

433
01:22:37,032 --> 01:22:38,942
Go to the warehouse!

434
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:41,188
Look out!

435
01:24:37,017 --> 01:24:38,644
Fuck!
Fuck!

436
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:41,518
Jeez

437
01:24:41,723 --> 01:24:42,968
Hold your fire!

438
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:49,584
You hear me Deed?

439
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,967
Let's stop all this alright?
We don't have to do this.

440
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:56,499
All I want is the kid.

441
01:24:56,604 --> 01:24:58,709
You hear me?
All I want is that kid.

442
01:24:58,813 --> 01:25:03,122
Tell him whatever
it is, you won

443
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:08,307
and we can come to an extremely
agreeable solution here.

444
01:25:08,414 --> 01:25:11,097
Same deal you gave Lazerov?

445
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,208
Motherfucker.

446
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:17,912
The fuck is wrong with you!

447
01:25:18,014 --> 01:25:19,739
Let's finish this thing.

448
01:25:27,745 --> 01:25:29,752
You go.
I'll light this up!

449
01:25:30,914 --> 01:25:32,738
Move! Move!

450
01:25:52,035 --> 01:25:53,378
Drop 'em.

451
01:25:53,573 --> 01:25:55,875
Get up.
Get up.

452
01:25:59,526 --> 01:26:00,670
He's down !

453
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,447
Hey Rafe!
Come on out now.

454
01:26:08,552 --> 01:26:10,178
It's over!
I got your boy here.

455
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:14,787
Come on, Rafe. Get out where
I can see you, Rafe.

456
01:26:14,889 --> 01:26:18,718
I'll kill him now
I don't see you!

457
01:26:18,824 --> 01:26:20,255
Get out a here!

458
01:26:25,067 --> 01:26:28,134
We're finished.
It's over we're done.

459
01:26:28,332 --> 01:26:30,241
You're goddamn right it's over.

460
01:26:30,347 --> 01:26:33,512
- Put It down.
- FRAT's over.

461
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:36,196
Everybody's dead.

462
01:26:36,299 --> 01:26:38,308
Everybody's dead because of you!

463
01:26:38,411 --> 01:26:41,477
Because you couldn't do
what you were supposed to do.

464
01:26:41,581 --> 01:26:44,844
Put a bullet in this
fucker and his story.

465
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:47,240
Well you do it now, Rafe.

466
01:26:48,492 --> 01:26:52,520
Put a bullet in his fuckin' head.
Do what I tell you.

467
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:56,166
We walk away,
forget about this shit.

468
01:26:56,269 --> 01:26:57,131
You kill him.

469
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:59,052
Right now you do
as you're told.

470
01:26:59,149 --> 01:27:03,558
Do it!
You do it!

471
01:27:03,664 --> 01:27:06,827
Because if you don't, I will.

472
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,377
- Duck.
- What?

473
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,960
Keep your door
locked, kid

474
01:27:59,098 --> 01:28:00,525
Now not for another 15 minutes.

475
01:28:00,633 --> 01:28:02,640
Don't say anything.
I'll be there in a minute.

476
01:28:03,993 --> 01:28:05,717
Where have you been?

477
01:28:05,816 --> 01:28:07,443
Laying out Polllack's story.

478
01:28:07,545 --> 01:28:11,092
Yeah, well, the story changed.

479
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,919
And Deed wasn't here.

480
01:28:16,026 --> 01:28:18,994
Detective Wallace.
D.A. Reigert's here.

481
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:28,214
Tilman?

482
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,361
Why are they here?

483
01:28:47,136 --> 01:28:48,476
They're reporters.

484
01:28:48,575 --> 01:28:50,103
The press is on the other side.

485
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:53,555
And material witnesses
to the dissension in FRAT.

486
01:28:53,664 --> 01:28:54,809
Right.

487
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:57,213
Not much for the FBI
to work with, is there?

488
01:28:57,312 --> 01:28:59,516
No they'll probably
close up shop.

489
01:29:06,722 --> 01:29:08,632
This kind of story. . .

490
01:29:09,506 --> 01:29:14,241
not really in the Herald's
wheelhouse, is it Moses?

491
01:29:14,338 --> 01:29:16,063
No it's not.

492
01:29:16,165 --> 01:29:17,690
No.

493
01:29:22,116 --> 01:29:24,603
Tilman have any last words?

494
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,864
Well, there it is.
Good day, gentlemen.

495
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,028
He said there was agreement
between the D.A. 's office. . .

496
01:29:36,132 --> 01:29:40,062
and judges regarding
FRAT related prosecutions.

497
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:42,852
That the cash evidence from
criminal trials wound up in the

498
01:29:42,952 --> 01:29:47,359
Better Edison Foundation
for your political campaign.

499
01:29:47,463 --> 01:29:51,010
That laundering this
money was systematic.

500
01:29:51,112 --> 01:29:53,416
That principals from
Midland, Hightower

501
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:56,580
and other companies
were involved.

502
01:29:57,448 --> 01:29:59,174
He said all that?

503
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:06,658
And that was
unmitigated slander.

504
01:30:06,762 --> 01:30:08,006
I'm gonna go with it

505
01:30:08,107 --> 01:30:12,264
if you run for any elected or
appointed office in this state.

506
01:30:12,941 --> 01:30:16,966
Broke as you are, you think
that's a smart thing to do?

507
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:22,055
Now, Jack, did I get broke
doin' the smart thing?

508
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:42,889
In the night, when no
reporters were around to cover it

509
01:30:42,992 --> 01:30:45,862
Wallace removed all
evidence of Better Edison.

510
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,950
Will are recovered.

511
01:30:51,057 --> 01:30:54,222
Indeed, he got into
another line of work.

512
01:30:54,322 --> 01:30:57,966
It would have violated a sacred
trust to turn him in to the law.

513
01:30:58,067 --> 01:31:00,272
And the law already knew.

514
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,956
Justice is a lot
like journalism.

515
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:07,027
Sometimes the most
important questions

516
01:31:07,124 --> 01:31:09,908
are the ones you
decide not to ask.

617
01:31:53,794 --> 01:32:06,734
THE END
