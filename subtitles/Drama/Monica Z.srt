1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:05,283
Monica ... Leonard Feather. Nice to meet you!
I heard you sing.

3
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,617
- Oh I hope you weren't disappointed ?
- Do I look like a disappointed man to you?... do I?

4
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,700
No.

5
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:18,450
- Come to New York and sing.
- New York?

6
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:24,158
You've got the voice, you've got the looks.
I think you can make it huge in the U.S..

7
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,700
- Just tell me when, I come .
- Ok, how about Christmas?

8
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:31,992
There's an opening at the Christmas and new year
 at "Swing 46". You come then.

9
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:39,533
- No, not Christmas.
- Why not ? Say yes!

10
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:44,992
Tommy Flanagan Trio is backing.
But you do what you want...

11
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,158
- Really?, do you know Tom Flanagan ?
- I know everybody .

12
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:53,325
I have all his records at home.
Every single one!

13
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,700
- Well, then I might just say that is a yes then.
How about that?  - Yes .

14
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,533
Now we are in Hagfors .

15
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:23,783
Good morning.

16
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:40,908
- Hello , darling .
- Hi , Mom.

17
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:44,908
I missed you .

18
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:49,658
- How did it go in Stockholm?
- Fine. Have you eaten half of the dough ?

19
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:55,283
No, it's the fine star
Eva- Lena made.

20
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,908
- Is Dad there?
- Yes .

21
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,658
I 'll tell you something .

22
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:16,908
There was an American at Nalen yesterday.
A manager from New York.

23
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,617
He wants me to
go over there and play .

24
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:26,408
That sounds great. When?

25
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,742
At Christmas.

26
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:36,617
- Have you talked to Eva- Lena about it?
- It was the only opening they had.

27
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:46,117
You're completely hopeless Monica.
Last Christmas you sang in Copenhagen .

28
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:51,367
And the Christmas before you quarreled
and broke up with Torbjörn on Christmas Eve.

29
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:56,825
When will the girl have a proper Christmas?

30
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:02,325
- I'll do it anyway.
- Yes, I'm sure you will.

31
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:15,158
- It broke.
- It doesn't matter. It 's fine .

32
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:20,700
You know the pram in the shop ?
You will get it!

33
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:25,367
- Already ?
- Yes, why not?

34
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:30,075
You know what I'm going to do ?
I'm going to the U.S. and sing.

35
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:34,867
- When?
- In a week.

36
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:38,367
But I won't be away for too long.

37
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:42,825
- On Christmas Eve ?
- Yes .

38
00:06:56,325 --> 00:07:01,992
What should we do ?
Now she just disappears again .

39
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:06,700
We'll look after Eva- Lena .

40
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:10,450
Hagfors. I connect the call.

41
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,867
Hagfors.

42
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:15,867
- Welcome to New York.
- Thank you .

43
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,992
- This is Tommy Flanagan. Hi, pleasure to meet you!
- Monica. I have all your records. Thank you!

44
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,283
Doug Watkins. Hi. Nice to meet you!

45
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,575
- Denzil Best .
- Hello . Monica. It's a pleasure!

46
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:49,283
- Man, she's a looker.
- I hope she can sing too.

47
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:06,533
Hi guys. Why are you standing out here?

48
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:10,867
They usually don't have adjusting rooms
for our kind in places like this.

49
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:16,033
you're kidding me? -No!
-That's the dummest thing I've ever heard.

50
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:20,117
 -Welcome to America!
-Then you should come into my room. Come on in!

51
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:24,492
- I don't think the owner would be too happy with that.
- Tommy is right.

52
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:30,533
- Then I'll just stand here with you. - Alright.
Then if you gonna stand here with us we might as well reherse with us, right?

53
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,450
One, two ... one two three four

54
00:10:23,283 --> 00:10:25,742
What 's going on?

55
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:36,283
Get her off the stage, NOW!

56
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:44,283
You gonna fix another singer Leonard .
The girl cannot be on stage with three negroes .

57
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:51,367
- For God's sake Sam, why didn't you say something we booked the gig?
-'cause most Jazz singers sing better than they look...

58
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:55,575
...so ordinarly nobody cares, but Jesus Christ Leo,
just look at her!

59
00:10:55,742 --> 00:11:01,075
How I was supposed to know that she's gonna be
so goddamn... white!  Get rid of her!

60
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,492
- Sam, Sam, wait up!
- I said, get rid of her! - Sam...

61
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,533
- Hello?
- Eva -Lena ? It's mom.

62
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,617
Are you in New York? -Yes.
- We are celebrating Christmas Eve.

63
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:26,825
Merry Christmas to you , my love.
I miss you dearly.

64
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:34,158
- You get a Christmas gift from me .
- Hello? I can not hear you.

65
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,700
Hello?

66
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:06,783
Hey, baby. How are you?

67
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,658
What did you talk about?

68
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:23,283
Ella Fitzgerald ?

69
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:31,908
- I have dreamed all of my life about meeting you.
- If you don't have bigger dreams than that, I pitty you young girl!

70
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:37,700
I am a singer from Sweden.
Can I sing a song to you?

71
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:41,200
I would like to know what you think.

72
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:45,408
Well... If you gotta sing, you gotta sing!

73
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,200
That's enough.

74
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:04,533
What do you know about
how it feels to miss New Orleans?

75
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,533
Why don't you sing about your own life instead of
pretending to be somebody else .

76
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,117
When Billie sang it, she meant it.

77
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,283
Mother !

78
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,867
Hi , Mom.

79
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,450
I missed you .

80
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:11,575
- I'm "Humle"
- And I'm "Dumle"

81
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:18,908
Aren't they fun?

82
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:22,658
Now comes grandpa .

83
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:27,783
Here you go. Are you happy now?
It was you who wanted to be famous.

84
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:39,533
Monica from Hagfors
is not good enough for the U.S.

85
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:55,117
Welcome back Miss Zetterlund. Your mother made sure
that you still have your job.

86
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:59,033
Hagfors . Connecting the conversation.

87
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:05,117
Weren't you supposed to be a star in America?

88
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:11,992
- Marika Nilsson .
- Hey, it's me .

89
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:18,658
- I'm canceling the tour with Dompan .
- What? Why? are you crazy?

90
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:24,617
- I can get a permanent job at Televerket .
- You'd rather die than stay in Hagfors .

91
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:28,033
Yes, but I have
to think of Eva- Lena .

92
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,700
- It's for you , Monica.
- Are you ready for Krylbo , Monica?

93
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:56,283
Hey . Are you coming ?

94
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,658
I did not tell Dompan that
you are quitting. -Damn!

95
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:07,700
Come on . You'll regret it for the rest
of life, if you are not going.

96
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:24,658
- What 's going on?
- I'm leaving.

97
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:36,617
- What about Eva- Lena ?
- I'll think of something as soon as I am in Stockholm.

98
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:40,867
How ? You can never support
yourself as a singer in Stockholm.

99
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:47,492
Maybe not, but I'm done here .
Here, it isn't allowed to think that you are something .

100
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:54,783
Are you something?
Are you something special?

101
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,742
I'll never set a foot here again!

102
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:11,658
Hey, baby. Did grandma tell you that
I'm taking the bus ?

103
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:15,408
Come on . Give Mom a hug.

104
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,617
I thought of something .
The map in the hallway, you know?

105
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:32,117
Insert a pin in each new city I'm in ,
so you can see where the bus is going to.

106
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:38,408
I promise to call from each place .

107
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,117
Come on . Don't you want to wave for me?

108
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:48,950
You are right to travel .
I'll take care of Eva- Lena .

109
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:32,867
- Who is this?
- Sture Åkerberg , the new bassist .

110
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,908
Hey, hey.

111
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,658
- Hello?
- Hello . I am in Sundsvall .

112
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:51,408
- Grandma and I went to swim.
- That sounds nice .

113
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:55,825
They are calling me.
I have to go.

114
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:59,992
She didn't have time anymore?
-No!

115
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:05,700
What are we going to do now? - I don't know.
Buy ice cream! -Yes!

116
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:12,033
Here we go.

117
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:15,992
I call you, baby .

118
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,492
Thank you.

119
00:20:54,658 --> 00:21:02,408
We will end the evening with "Do you know
what it means to miss New Orleans"

120
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:08,992
I won't sing this song anymore, because I don't know
a thing about New Orleans, but Dompan can sing it instead.

121
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:18,117
What the hell are you thinking?

122
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:25,575
All jazz bands playing the same songs.
It is more real to sing in Swedish.

123
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,367
Sing in Swedish?! But we play jazz!

124
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:34,242
When you sing with my band,
you sing in English. Come on.

125
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:40,825
- You were great. Got a light ?
- You were great too.

126
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:48,783
- What did you say about singing in Swedish?
- Why do I have to sing about New Orleans?

127
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,408
- I've never been there.
- Can I have an autograph?

128
00:21:53,575 --> 00:22:00,033
- What's your name?
- Linnea. Thank you.

129
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:04,617
I was on tour with Cornelis .
He sings in Swedish.

130
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:08,158
It is possible.

131
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:12,825
- You can check writers in Sweden.
- Yes, that would be fine.

132
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:20,033
- Monica , can we get an autograph ?
- Yes . Where's the paper?

133
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:24,533
- On the arm.
- Should I write there?

134
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:30,200
Thank you. Hey.

135
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:54,658
What are you reading?

136
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:56,492
"Gissningar"

137
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:03,117
Is it not sad that the tour is nearly over?

138
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:06,492
On the contrary . It's nice to be home .

139
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:10,867
You think so? I barely know anymore
what "home" is.

140
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:16,033
- You have a child , right?
- A daughter.

141
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:20,450
- What should you do now?
- Take my daughter to Stockholm.

142
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:27,158
She needs to see that you can be what
you will. Or at least try .

143
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:36,283
- I like your style.
- Thank you .

144
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:58,658
Hey, little Monica.

145
00:23:58,783 --> 00:24:02,117
What you said ...

146
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:06,742
... about singing in Swedish ...
I have thought about it.

147
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:10,575
See this book.

148
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:15,783
It is Beppe Wolgers poems.
He writes as if it is jazz.

149
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:22,742
If you like it, then talk to Beppe
 at Nalen whe he is there one evening.

150
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:26,200
Fine. Thank you.

151
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:32,117
- See you tomorrow .
- Yes .

152
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:41,075
- What's with you and Sture?
- Are you nuts?

153
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:44,033
He's not my type.

154
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,658
He is a typical musician.

155
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:54,783
They might be good enough. However, they are
not the ones that make your heart beat faster.

156
00:24:55,867 --> 00:25:00,700
- It takes more. For us .
- Yes , it does.

157
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,408
There you can see Dompan .
You could sing jazz in Swedish.

158
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:55,950
The guy who wrote the text , is standing there -
Beppe Wolgers .

159
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:06,200
You are happy when you walk
flanked by Sweden's most beautiful ladies.

160
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:13,075
- Beppe, my friend ! Here we come .
- Welcome!

161
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:15,700
Hey.

162
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:21,408
- My wife Kerstin.
- Nice to finally meet you.

163
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:24,658
I have to go to the kids.

164
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:29,492
- Can you write more stuff for me?
- With pleasure.

165
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:35,617
I'm at the cabaret this fall at
Hamburger Börs. Are you coming ?

166
00:27:35,783 --> 00:27:39,617
Theatre is just not for me.

167
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:44,867
- When Beppe Wolgers asks, you say "yes".
- Say "yes" to life.

168
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:49,992
- Of course .
- Great! Let me introduce you to the people .

169
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:55,075
Monica Zetterlund .

170
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:58,992
Povel, it's Monica Zetterlund .

171
00:27:59,158 --> 00:28:02,867
Monica. A pleasure .

172
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:07,158
Have you said hello to Monica Zetterlund ?

173
00:28:09,158 --> 00:28:12,700
- Monica.
- Lena Nyman.

174
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:20,700
Hasse and Tage . Monica Zetterlund ,
the wonderful Monica Zetterlund.

175
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:28,617
Good to see hello to
the blonde negro from Värmland forests.

176
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:33,867
- What a nice compliment.
- You sing great.

177
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:57,033
Who is it that is staring over there?

178
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,325
- Vilgot Sjöman , the director, you know.
- Is it Vilgot Sjöman ?

179
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:08,992
- Do you know him ?
- Not directly. He's making a new film .

180
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:16,033
It's called "I'm curious"
and it is about sex - I've heard.

181
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,283
What a type.

182
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:23,825
I'll take care of him.

183
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:31,033
-Hello, Vilgot Sjöman. -Hey, Monica Zetterlund.
You stand there looking curious!

184
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,158
Cheers .

185
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:48,075
- Beppe want me in his cabaret.
- It is a good idea.

186
00:29:48,242 --> 00:29:53,450
You have the talent . When you sing jazz,
you are cool and sophisticated -

187
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:58,950
- But privately, you're a completely different woman.

188
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:05,617
I mean it.
You're funny , popular and sexy .

189
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:12,533
Utilize both: the ice princess from New York-

190
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,242
- And the brat from Hagfors that
I have just met.

191
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:22,075
So you will become a big star .

192
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:26,617
Would you like more than just talk?

193
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,408
Then you would have to take me away from here .

194
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:57,033
Here's the thing. Wagner.

195
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:21,158
Good, isn't it?

196
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:32,117
Wagner thought of you when he wrote it.

197
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:39,200
That is how it is
to be with you - like a storm.

198
00:33:01,617 --> 00:33:09,617
I have Wagner's complete works .
Don't you want to listen to them ?

199
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:15,783
- Did I say that I have a daughter?
- No, but it isn't a problem.

200
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:19,742
I love children.

201
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,325
Yes, but then ...

202
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,450
Then I move in.

203
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:37,408
- Really?!
- Yes, really!

204
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,450
He is already here .

205
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:56,700
- Hey, Vilgot. is everything fine ?
- Yes, yes of course.

206
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:59,700
Thank you, Sture .

207
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:04,117
Say hello to your parents and say that
I will meet them soon.

208
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:07,242
I will.

209
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:24,742
- Are you happy now?
- Yes, I have been so lucky.

210
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,617
What kind is a man that might
take care of other people's children?

211
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:33,867
Vilgot is not your type.
He's a bit boring.

212
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:38,450
Boring and intellectual.

213
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:43,950
- Boring?! Have you seen him directing Wagner?
- No.

214
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:53,950
Stop. just stop here, a little further,
just before the sign.

215
00:34:57,158 --> 00:35:01,533
- Can't you get her?
- Are you serious?

216
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,992
I'm not setting a foot in Hagfors again.
I have already told you loud and clear.

217
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:09,450
I'll wait here and smoke a cigarette.

218
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,450
Damn ...

219
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,450
No ...

220
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:58,825
- Could't you pick her up yourself ?
- I've tried. He didn't want to.

221
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,617
He's crazy .

222
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:07,950
Come on, baby!

223
00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:12,450
Goodbye, Grandpa .

224
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:16,158
Come on, baby!

225
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:32,158
- All of her friends are here in Hagfors, you know this, right?
- She'll find new ones in Stockholm.

226
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:39,158
- Don't you greet your parents when you come home?
- I'm not setting a foot in Hagfors again.

227
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:45,117
Yes, I've heard it. Mother is waiting.
She has cooked and put on clean bed linen.

228
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:49,992
so that you could spend one night with us,
your old parents.

229
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,367
Did you come by car just to say this?

230
00:36:54,533 --> 00:37:00,075
Are you taking care of her from now on?
Or is it as usual ?

231
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:05,242
- This was the most stupid thing I have heard.
- Singing in Hagfors is one thing.

232
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:09,325
But Stockholm is it something else entirely.

233
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:14,283
You're probably home soon .

234
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:21,533
Get in.

235
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,617
Get in.

236
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:07,742
Stop! Can we stop?

237
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,242
Why not start a little simpler ?
It is so straight and hard .

238
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,700
Can't we try to start with the bass?

239
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:21,242
Singing and bass starts ,
then the others come in later.

240
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:26,533
The bassist in the beginning is so fine. we
start with that and everything else will follow.

241
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,992
- We're trying.
- It can not be combined with this.

242
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:37,533
- Can we go for a key down?
- Yes . G?

243
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,867
Yes.

244
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,950
So you start them, yes?

245
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:12,658
Yes. It 's much more fun .
What do you say, Sture ?

246
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:16,283
Yes ... that 's it.

247
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,450
- What do you mean?
- It's probably better that way.

248
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:26,825
- Should I rewrite everything?
- Great !

249
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:34,367
- So I'll rewrite it . until tomorrow?
- Yes, great. It will be a success.

250
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:39,367
You should come. It's a big premiere.

251
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:45,742
It would be great
if father also came.

252
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:50,408
He can't still be so mad.

253
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:55,283
Say that all Stockholm celebrities are coming.

254
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:00,200
He said that? Good.

255
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:04,283
- No, you don't have to think about it, I'll fix it .
- Grandpa is coming for sure.

256
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:10,075
I will arrange a hotel. Yes , hotel .

257
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:15,283
Both grandparents are coming.

258
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:19,700
PREMIERE TONIGHT

259
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:29,867
I should have said no to this.
It's not for me .

260
00:40:30,075 --> 00:40:36,283
Yes, it is exactly right for you.
Now I'm also nervous. Sit down.

261
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,867
It's a completely different crowd.

262
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,033
I'll open another one.

263
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,117
Father is also coming today.

264
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:26,242
- What is it, Monica?
- Dad is not here.

265
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:30,950
Don't let him spoil this evening for you.

266
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:42,617
I will sing
a small jazz melody in Swedish.

267
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:24,492
" Hamburger Börs - A success!
Monica Zetterlund performed in Stockholm -

268
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:29,492
- And received a standing ovation.
The show is a total success ."

269
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:41,033
" ' Sakta vi go genome stan ' is poetry.
and Zetterlund do it justice ."

270
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:55,283
You should make a record only
in Swedish with lyrics by Beppe Wolgers.

271
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:01,492
- That sounds good.
- I have prepared a draft for a contract.

272
00:43:01,658 --> 00:43:09,117
- I would like to have more money.
- Why don't you write your own proposal.

273
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:30,617
- Welcome to Philips.
- Thank you.

274
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:37,200
CAREER ROLLS

275
00:43:40,033 --> 00:43:42,367
ANOTHER SUCCESS

276
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,450
"It's brilliant to let Zetterlund
sing in Swedish."

277
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:08,450
"The song has a new energy and intimacy."

278
00:44:08,617 --> 00:44:13,575
"She sings a Stockholm Promenade,
which is like a light stroking on the cheek ."

279
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:19,450
"Now we know
that jazz can be sung in Swedish."

280
00:44:31,283 --> 00:44:34,117
Perfect .

281
00:44:34,283 --> 00:44:39,325
Isn't it crazy
to buy a large house -

282
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:42,533
- When I have an apartment
where we are living nicely?

283
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,533
It is for me and Eva- Lena's sake.

284
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,742
I would not be dependent on a man.
We'll take it.

285
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:58,533
Good. Once the payment is in,
we'll make an installment payment plan for the rest .

286
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,117
The payout is pretty considerable.

287
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:08,700
Why are you talking to him?
I'm the one who is paying - in cash.

288
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:14,950
- Just send the papers.
- Of course . Thank you.

289
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,742
- Are you coming, Vilgot ?
- Nice to meet you .

290
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,617
walk straight ahead.

291
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:33,617
Trust me. Here.

292
00:45:34,658 --> 00:45:39,117
Are you ready? Now you can see.

293
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,867
It's a castle.

294
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:52,033
- Here is the living room.
- Everything is big here!

295
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:59,408
The ceilings are high here, so that you
can breathe. What 's this? Candy .

296
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:07,950
Here we can dance and play.

297
00:46:10,117 --> 00:46:12,283
The dining room.

298
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,367
Here you can sit.

299
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:25,658
We 've saved the best for last .
There is one more small room up there.

300
00:46:28,283 --> 00:46:33,242
- Oh... - It's your room.
-But where are you going to sleep

301
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:39,242
I'll sleep in another room.
You can take a look at it later.

302
00:46:40,117 --> 00:46:44,200
God, it's so nice here!

303
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
A drink?

304
00:46:56,117 --> 00:47:00,117
Hi there.

305
00:47:00,242 --> 00:47:04,117
Peter.
And you have everything ?

306
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:13,450
- Gunilla, my wife.
- Welcome .

307
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:22,200
- Monica!
- Beppe.

308
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:27,867
Hey. It's so good to see you.
And it's so nice to see you again.

309
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:34,117
What a great house.
We have a housewarming gift.

310
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:38,575
A gift?
It isn't necessary.

311
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,658
What do we have here?

312
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:47,867
ALL OF SWEDEN'S MONICA
BUT MOSTLY MINE / Beppe

313
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:51,742
What a hideous picture of me!

314
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:57,575
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you. It will have the place of honour.

315
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:09,617
- Hello.
- Is this the new girl ?

316
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:15,533
Welcome.

317
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,117
Shall I take your coat?

318
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:26,200
- What will you drink?
- A whiskey maybe.

319
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,533
Knock, knock.

320
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,950
- Are you hiding here all night?
- I don't know .

321
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:45,617
- Come and say hello to my friends.
- Later. I have first to finish.

322
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:51,742
- It's not so easy with this noise.
- Can't you have a break?

323
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:57,658
Later,
I must finish this.

324
00:48:57,825 --> 00:49:03,325
Would you please take 5 min. to say hello to my friends?
or should I be ashamed of you?

325
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:08,867
- No, I'm coming later.
- You're such a hypocrite .

326
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,950
Is this for me? Thank you.

327
00:49:18,575 --> 00:49:22,617
-Oh, hey! -hey!
-You look so fine.

328
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,825
Can I help ?

329
00:49:31,783 --> 00:49:38,950
We raise the party level. It will be
nice to be Miss Zetterlund .

330
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:43,242
What do you think, Monica?

331
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:51,492
Hello, friends!
May I introduce the wonderful -

332
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:58,450
- Adventurous,
absolutely adorable Monica Zetterlund.

333
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,033
And here we have the sexy -

334
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,867
- Truly talented
actress Marika Nilsson.

335
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:35,283
Hello, Marika.

336
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,783
Monica.

337
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:44,242
Monica is with Vilgot Sjöman .
My girlfriend Lina .

338
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:48,450
-Hey. -Good evening.

339
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,950
I just hope that Monica does not hear this.

340
00:50:58,117 --> 00:51:01,575
You know how she is. Look at her .

341
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:08,117
Everyone has to love her.
She is so self-absorbed.

342
00:51:10,283 --> 00:51:16,283
She gets offended when someone
she likes has a girlfriend.

343
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:21,367
She cannot. She has Vilgot.

344
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:24,075
Cheers.

345
00:51:29,117 --> 00:51:34,825
-I heard both of your gigs in Stockholm.
they sounded great, both of them. -Thank you!

346
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:40,492
- Are you listening much to Fitzgerald ?
- Yes . I have always admired her.

347
00:51:40,658 --> 00:51:45,117
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Isn't she cute ?

348
00:51:45,283 --> 00:51:48,575
Yes, she's lovely.

349
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:56,950
Good morning honey. Did you sleep well?
Sit a little with me.

350
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,075
Are you tired?

351
00:52:01,242 --> 00:52:08,158
It's the best time of the day
when we are here together in the kitchen.

352
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,492
I made it again too thick.

353
00:52:15,325 --> 00:52:19,867
Isn't it suicidal to sing
a jazz song at the Eurovision Song Contest?

354
00:52:20,033 --> 00:52:23,200
No.

355
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:28,658
- I'm not a Eurovision singer.
- It's just once. You have to understand me as well,

356
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:33,325
It is enormously difficult to sell
jazz records as things are today.

357
00:52:33,492 --> 00:52:38,117
Now is your chance
to break through internationally .

358
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:42,658
A little free advertising on television will not hurt.
It is something that you really need.

359
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:49,742
A chance to reach a large audience, with Jazz,
you shouldn't miss a chance like that.

360
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,617
I would do it ,
but it is up to you, Monica.

361
00:52:53,783 --> 00:52:58,242
Hurrah, hurray , hurray , hurray !

362
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,783
Blow.

363
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:03,783
Beautiful!

364
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:16,742
They want me to sing at
the Eurovision song contest .

365
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:23,033
But I do not know if I should say yes.
What do you think, Dad?

366
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,033
- Yes, but it's so much fun.
- How it's going? how it feels?

367
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:31,325
-Good!
-It feels good?

368
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:38,617
It's great to be able to represent
Sweden in such a big competition.

369
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:48,117
Eurovision 1963

370
00:53:49,408 --> 00:53:54,367
Good evening, this is David Jenkins speaking
from the BBC television centre in London.

371
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:57,950
Viewers in the UK
will recognise this building ...

372
00:53:58,075 --> 00:54:00,992
... but it will be less familiar for
the 75 million viewers from the 17...

373
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,408
Exciting, isn't it?

374
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:08,783
... that are watching Eurovision Song Contest
grand prix of 1963.

375
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,783
On behalf of the BBC, welcome to the
eighth annual Eurovision song contest .

376
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:55,783
There's a telephone again. Hello?

377
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,950
So that is the final result?

378
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:06,992
Zero points for Monica Zetterlund -
one of the greatest failures.

379
00:55:07,158 --> 00:55:12,783
It is just before ,
one is ashamed of being Swedish.

380
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:18,083
"Viewers' verdict: Monica
should apologize to the Swedish people"

381
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,117
- It's just to take the bull by the horns.
- I cannot bear to meet any journalists.

382
00:55:41,283 --> 00:55:44,158
I'll stay here a bit.

383
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:50,783
I can stay. I'll stay with you.

384
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:55,575
Go and see if you can get them off.

385
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:02,700
Beppe, where's Monica?

386
00:56:03,992 --> 00:56:07,200
She is in London for few days.

387
00:56:37,158 --> 00:56:42,367
Have you never felt that
you just can lose it all again?

388
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:45,283
No.

389
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:53,200
I'm always afraid they remember -

390
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:57,242
- that I don't deserve this.

391
00:56:57,408 --> 00:57:04,283
As if it is just an air castle.
A scam.

392
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,700
Now Dad wil say: "What did I tell you? "

393
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:16,533
- Hold your head high. You were good.
- Do you think so?  -You were damn good .

394
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:22,283
I could sit here all day ...

395
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:28,492
... But I have to go.

396
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,075
Bye.

397
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,033
Bye.

398
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,408
- Do you come at eight o'clock?  - Of course!
- Would you bring Lina as well?

399
00:58:01,575 --> 00:58:04,325
Good. See you then.

400
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:17,533
- Does anyone else want?
- No thanks .

401
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:23,325
- Vilgot? Should I pour one gor you
- No, It's ok, thanks.

402
00:58:23,492 --> 00:58:28,367
God it's quiet here.
You could go down in the cellar and get few bottles of wine.

403
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:34,033
Why are you never satisfied ?
Do you know what time it is?

404
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,908
- It's called ambition.
- You didn't get it. I mean this in the glass!

405
00:58:39,075 --> 00:58:42,867
You shouldn't talk about that.

406
00:58:45,783 --> 00:58:50,450
Should we celebrate being last,
and being laughed at?.

407
00:58:50,617 --> 00:58:56,367
Do you remember when you were little and you
and your friends climbed the birch tree?

408
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,617
You always wanted to climb
all the way to the top! Every time!

409
00:59:02,283 --> 00:59:08,617
Then you fell down and nearly died!
While your ... Look at me!

410
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:17,200
While your friends just climbed up
to the first branch, then they climbed down.

411
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:23,200
- Because it was dangerous up there!
But you, would always go up!

412
00:59:25,908 --> 00:59:32,783
I can't understand that you don't
listen to what they say to you.

413
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,783
I'm going home now.

414
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:47,408
Bye Eva-Lena.

415
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:56,783
- Bye my friend.
- Bye Mom.

416
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,783
A failure.
Zero points. Why was it so bad?

417
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:26,200
You have to take it for what it is.
A singing competition.

418
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:30,117
It 's crazy to compete for music.

419
01:00:30,283 --> 01:00:34,950
It's a pity. I think it's such
a great song, with fantastic lyrics.

420
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:39,617
So, now there will be a party.

421
01:00:40,492 --> 01:00:46,533
Beppe ... Sofia said the kids are not able to fall asleep,
so I 'd better go home.

422
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:52,908
- Let them be awake and have fun.
- No, otherwise I feel like a bad mother.

423
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:59,242
What do you mean? So I am now a bad mother
because I let Eva-Lena stay up?

424
01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:04,200
No, I just meant that "I" feel like a bad mother .

425
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:10,325
I'm careless with time and homework,
but I'm as good a mother as you.

426
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:16,617
- But it's not what I meant!
- Eva-Lena ! Am I not a good mother?  - Yes.

427
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:20,700
I was only talking about myself.

428
01:01:20,825 --> 01:01:25,200
- Get out of here .
- But I haven't done anything .

429
01:01:25,367 --> 01:01:30,408
Say it straight instead of
always coming up with allusions.

430
01:01:30,533 --> 01:01:35,283
-You don't come to my house to say such things.
-But It's not about you, it's about me!  -Get out!

431
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:42,742
Kerstin!

432
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,533
Julia!

433
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,283
You could put Eva-Lena to bed?

434
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:52,950
Come on, toots. You've got to go to school tomorrow,
so you should sleep properly .

435
01:01:53,117 --> 01:01:56,200
Good night sweetie.

436
01:02:09,783 --> 01:02:14,742
Shall we dance? take a swing.

437
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:18,200
Aren't you going to ask me? Come on.

438
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:23,242
You sit so low.
I lift you up a little.

439
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,367
Come and dance with me.

440
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:34,617
No, I'm talking to Arne about film.

441
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:41,533
I'm in the middle of a conversation.
I do not want to dance.

442
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,700
You're boring!

443
01:02:58,158 --> 01:03:01,992
Hey. Where is Lina?

444
01:03:02,158 --> 01:03:08,450
She went. She is going to Malmö
for a recording session tomorrow.

445
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:15,992
-You've found yourself a nice girl. -You think so?
- A bit young maybe, but sweet and kind.

446
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:28,200
- Why did you kiss me?
- I do not know!

447
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:34,325
Just because you wanted to?

448
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:41,617
Well, you're still here, Sture.
I'm so confused.

449
01:03:41,742 --> 01:03:47,450
Monica ... I just want to say that ...

450
01:03:47,617 --> 01:03:51,950
- Monica!
- Yes, yes.

451
01:03:54,325 --> 01:03:59,408
- Yes?
- What's with you and Sture?

452
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:04,617
- I saw you kissing in the taxi.
- Isn't Vilgot Sjöman jealous?!

453
01:04:04,783 --> 01:04:12,200
No, I feel sorry for Sture.
It's only you who wants to be confirmed.

454
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:17,367
You are so unsympathetic,
When you are scared and in a killing mood.

455
01:04:17,533 --> 01:04:23,825
Scared?! YOU say this? you, who is not able
 to stay 3 minutes without hearing applause?

456
01:04:24,033 --> 01:04:26,908
You are begging for love from everybody.

457
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:31,450
You daren't show emotions...
you have in fact none!

458
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:37,658
- What the hell do you know about that?
- Like how you talk to Bergman.

459
01:04:37,825 --> 01:04:42,825
- Yes Bergman. Absolutely Bergman...
- What do you know about my relationship with Bergman?

460
01:04:43,033 --> 01:04:49,117
Not even dogs are so submissive.
You're so pathetic !

461
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:56,617
It has nothing to do with Bergman. you just want to hurt me,
so you don't have to answer my questions.

462
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:02,950
You get the prize for the
Best pathetic human being.

463
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:09,325
- But you might hope for better prizes!
- That I do not want to discuss now.

464
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:15,283
- Where the hell are you going?
- I've had enough .

465
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:20,908
I am 40 years old. I need a woman,
not a scared teenager.

466
01:05:21,075 --> 01:05:24,783
So take your damn Wagner with you!

467
01:05:24,992 --> 01:05:27,950
Are you just going to leave?!

468
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:33,783
Nobody leaves me like this!

469
01:05:33,992 --> 01:05:36,367
Monica ...

470
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:44,533
- Get me out of here.
- Yes , wait.

471
01:06:16,658 --> 01:06:23,075
How I have dreamed of singing this...
imagine singing with Bill Evans .

472
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:30,367
Why would the world's best pianist
ever want to play with me?

473
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:34,158
Why not?

474
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:39,533
You're sometimes beyond my comprehension.

475
01:06:39,658 --> 01:06:46,075
One second you are the world's
most self-absorbed person...

476
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:51,825
The next is as if you are
losing your enthusiasm.

477
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:56,450
As if you do not understand how good you are.

478
01:07:01,242 --> 01:07:05,367
Would you come a little closer?

479
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:15,075
You're so far away.

480
01:07:24,283 --> 01:07:27,033
No ...

481
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:34,450
Yes? What happened now then?

482
01:07:34,575 --> 01:07:39,075
I can't.

483
01:07:43,033 --> 01:07:49,658
When I asked why you kissed me
in the taxi, you said: "I don't know"

484
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:55,117
It's not good enough for me.

485
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:03,658
Me and Lina are engaged.
I'm getting married.

486
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,450
Monica ... What are you doing?

487
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:20,950
-I 'm not used to being rejected in this way...
-I didn't mean it! -Damn I feel so cheap!

488
01:08:21,117 --> 01:08:24,908
Wait! Sit down! Won't you stay?

489
01:08:25,075 --> 01:08:31,908
Are you asking me to stay after that?
Sorry Sture, but you're not my type.

490
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,992
What are you so awfully afraid of?

491
01:08:43,992 --> 01:08:45,367
Monica ...

492
01:09:45,075 --> 01:09:51,200
Monica, you have a lot going on now.
You have the premiere at "Hasse and Tages revue".

493
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:56,533
You have just recorded a new LP,
and you're on TV every other minute.

494
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,117
Yes, a lot is happening now.

495
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:04,617
Mr. Chambers is your new fiancé.
Could you tell me a little more?

496
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:12,200
Fiancé is a funny expression.
I have many relationships behind me.

497
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:17,575
- How many?
- As many as I wanted.

498
01:10:17,742 --> 01:10:24,742
You obviously prefer
self-employed men, soloists.

499
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:29,117
Are you okay?
He doesn't understand.

500
01:10:29,283 --> 01:10:34,825
- I'm sorry, I didn't ... you know ...
- You can just sit here.

501
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:39,033
- Or not?
- I like successful men.

502
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,367
But now I'll calm down,
and start a family for Eva-Lena.

503
01:10:43,492 --> 01:10:50,283
- So Mr. Chambers, you like it here in Sweden?
- Oh yes, it's been wonderful to me.

504
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,617
So you gonna stay?

505
01:10:53,783 --> 01:11:00,450
You know I... I don't like to think about those things.
I just uhm... everything is really great right now though.

506
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:03,950
You look great.

507
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:09,700
- Monica, are you ready?
- Just a moment.

508
01:11:10,825 --> 01:11:15,117
OK, quiet!

509
01:11:15,283 --> 01:11:18,408
Three, two ...

510
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,450
Stop!

511
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:53,367
- It is the same place every time.
- We'll take it from the start.

512
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:57,367
Three, two ...

513
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:19,492
- No.
- Stop!

514
01:12:19,658 --> 01:12:23,908
- I've never heard anything worse.
- Eurovision Song Contest broke her.

515
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:27,533
It's just too bad.

516
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:38,950
- You are opening another one?
- It's none of your business.

517
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:45,283
You can drink as much as you want,
but it should be enough with one.

518
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:58,283
Hey.

519
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:01,533
Hey.

520
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,117
How are you?

521
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:12,450
- I have heard that you're with Steve Chambers.
- Yes, lightning just struck.

522
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:23,825
- Would you say something?
- No, I ... I'll see you on stage.

523
01:13:38,325 --> 01:13:41,200
Steve!

524
01:13:42,825 --> 01:13:45,367
Steve!

525
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:55,825
Damn!

526
01:14:00,283 --> 01:14:03,033
Monica ...

527
01:14:04,325 --> 01:14:06,700
Get out.

528
01:14:06,908 --> 01:14:11,075
Get out , I said! It's over .

529
01:14:29,033 --> 01:14:33,283
"Now I want to settle down
and start a family for Eva- Lena."

530
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:41,033
Are we done?
Should we take it from the beginning?

531
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:54,908
O, o, o, all women can struggle

532
01:14:56,992 --> 01:15:04,200
If you want something
just don't stand there and stare

533
01:15:04,325 --> 01:15:08,117
Be like me, be fresh and awake

534
01:15:08,283 --> 01:15:11,825
Keep on moving
Shine the pole

535
01:15:12,033 --> 01:15:16,492
For o, o, o, where all women can ...

536
01:15:31,283 --> 01:15:34,450
Monica ...

537
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:39,408
Call an ambulance!

538
01:15:57,908 --> 01:16:02,283
Good evening. How are you?

539
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:06,200
Better. It doesn't hurt as much now.

540
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,825
You had a miscarriage.

541
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:16,242
It is not dangerous,
but you have lost a lot of blood.

542
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:19,325
So you must take good care of yourself.

543
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:24,200
There's a premiere. I have to ...
There is no substitute.

544
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:28,450
It is dangerous for you
doing theater now.

545
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:34,992
You leave at your own risk .
Think carefully about it.

546
01:16:35,783 --> 01:16:39,700
Can I get painkillers home?

547
01:16:39,908 --> 01:16:45,533
You get something to for sleeping,
and then we take it one day at a time.

548
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,908
Thank you.

549
01:17:40,242 --> 01:17:46,533
Help me now... If something must happen,
do something now...

550
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,783
So if you want a trip to the stars

551
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:55,492
Do you aim high among the trees

552
01:17:55,658 --> 01:18:01,575
O, o, o, where all women can struggle

553
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:10,783
If you want something
you can't just lay down and stare

554
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:14,533
Be like me, keep swinging

555
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,408
You can always sleep later

556
01:18:18,575 --> 01:18:20,950
For o, o, o...

557
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:26,492
How women can struggle

558
01:18:48,117 --> 01:18:52,617
Oh my... It was absolutely fantastic.

559
01:18:52,783 --> 01:18:59,575
- No one is better than Monica.
- Yes, it was fantastic.

560
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:05,908
- How are you?
- Fine. But I 'd better go home.

561
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,700
Go home and rest.

562
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:13,950
- I'll get someone to drive you.
- Would you? Thank you.

563
01:19:25,242 --> 01:19:30,742
- Should I follow you up?
- No , go home to your fiancee.

564
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:37,408
It can't go on like this anymore.
You don't feel good .

565
01:19:38,492 --> 01:19:44,700
- Was I bad ?
- No, but you need to take it a little easy.

566
01:19:44,867 --> 01:19:48,700
You shouldn't think that know everything
about me and my life.

567
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:54,950
I've got everything I dreamed of. And then there are
those who believe that it doesn't cost a thing...

568
01:19:55,117 --> 01:20:00,200
that it's free. But a mediocre person like you
probably won't understand!... Thank you!

569
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:05,242
There were 1,600 in the audience,
and they thought that I was wonderful .

570
01:20:05,408 --> 01:20:11,408
What if people think you are
wonderful when you are feeling bad?

571
01:20:17,242 --> 01:20:21,117
Close the door.

572
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,408
Why are you here, mom?

573
01:21:20,617 --> 01:21:23,617
Wake up.

574
01:21:31,075 --> 01:21:34,950
Good morning.

575
01:21:35,075 --> 01:21:39,575
I was waiting for the post,
then I fell asleep.

576
01:21:39,742 --> 01:21:43,492
Will you get the newspaper?

577
01:21:49,075 --> 01:21:50,950
Thank you.

578
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:56,950
Monica is successfull again!

579
01:22:00,992 --> 01:22:04,200
Monica Z - a comic genius

580
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:13,992
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

581
01:22:14,117 --> 01:22:17,950
- Even if I am what I am?
- Yes.

582
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,533
Come on, Mom, why don't we go in?

583
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:49,658
You arrived two hours late yesterday.

584
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:55,533
On Thursday, you didn't even come.
This cannot go on like this anymore.

585
01:23:55,700 --> 01:24:00,075
- You are stressing me out. Give me something .
- You do not get something to drink.

586
01:24:00,242 --> 01:24:06,950
We are concerned that you're not able to handle it.
And whether we should continue or stop.

587
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:10,450
It is not the first time we try it.

588
01:24:35,408 --> 01:24:38,617
Hey.

589
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:45,533
- You asked why I kissed you in the taxi.
- It doesn't matter now.

590
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:49,408
I did it because I like you -

591
01:24:49,575 --> 01:24:53,908
- And because ... I want to be with you.

592
01:25:06,033 --> 01:25:08,992
Sorry.

593
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:24,700
I 'll tell you something ...
About men. I have always thought -

594
01:25:24,867 --> 01:25:30,450
- That if I only I get him,
then I'll be happy.

595
01:25:30,617 --> 01:25:33,158
It's so stupid.

596
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:41,492
And my father didn't even listen to
a single song of mine in recent years.

597
01:25:44,992 --> 01:25:48,617
How can you do this to your child?

598
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:54,200
But ...

599
01:27:20,575 --> 01:27:26,617
Hey, it's Eva- Lena. Mother sleeps
on the toilet. What should I do?

600
01:27:56,533 --> 01:28:02,158
- Hey, little buddy. How are you?
- Good.

601
01:28:02,325 --> 01:28:07,033
- Where's Mom?
- In the bathroom.

602
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:14,200
Get your stuff and your jacket,
I'll be there soon.

603
01:28:33,492 --> 01:28:37,325
Monica ...

604
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:41,950
Father? Are you here?

605
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:46,367
I'm taking Eva-Lena with me to Hagfors.

606
01:28:58,325 --> 01:29:02,158
Hurry into the car.

607
01:29:02,325 --> 01:29:04,700
Wait!

608
01:29:08,783 --> 01:29:12,200
Lock the door.

609
01:29:12,367 --> 01:29:16,867
Stop!... Stop the car!...

610
01:29:17,033 --> 01:29:20,617
Tell him he needs to stop !

611
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:16,992
Monica ...

612
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,075
How are you?

613
01:31:25,283 --> 01:31:28,450
Are you okay?

614
01:31:58,075 --> 01:32:02,283
- Hello?
- Hey, Eva-Lena. It's mummy.

615
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:08,283
- Hi Mom. How are you?
- I feel much better now.

616
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:13,783
Marika has moved in with us
so I'm not alone.

617
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:18,783
I 'll pick you up as soon as
I feel better .

618
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:23,950
But I want to stay with grandma and grandpa.

619
01:32:24,117 --> 01:32:27,867
No problem, you may stay there.

620
01:32:28,033 --> 01:32:34,158
- I love you Mom.
- I love you darling.

621
01:32:35,367 --> 01:32:42,450
Say hello to grandma and grandpa and say
that I'll soon come to visit.

622
01:33:10,783 --> 01:33:15,450
- I WANT to make a record with Bill Evans.
- And why would he go along with it?

623
01:33:15,617 --> 01:33:19,200
Does he even know who Monica Zetterlund is?

624
01:33:19,367 --> 01:33:23,533
No, but I sent him a tape.

625
01:33:23,658 --> 01:33:29,158
Even if it's successful, you won't sell more than a few
hundred copies of the LP.

626
01:33:29,325 --> 01:33:32,742
Now everyone want to have rock'n'roll .

627
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:38,867
I want to do something for the soul, not for
the money. Beppe has written a text.

628
01:33:39,033 --> 01:33:44,283
- " Waltz for Debbie " - " Monica's Waltz ."
- Sounds good to me ...

629
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:51,408
- This is my next album. Are you in ?
- No, not this time.

630
01:33:51,533 --> 01:33:55,325
If you don't pay, I'll do it myself.

631
01:33:55,450 --> 01:34:00,450
But then there are no more
Monica Zetterlund on Philips. This you need to know!

632
01:34:00,617 --> 01:34:03,700
Monica!

633
01:34:03,908 --> 01:34:05,242
Yes.

634
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:09,450
Monica!

635
01:34:10,992 --> 01:34:13,533
Call from America.

636
01:34:14,533 --> 01:34:18,533
America is calling her!

637
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:27,075
- Hello?
- Hello Monica. This is Bill Evans.

638
01:34:27,242 --> 01:34:29,992
- How are you?
- Oh I'm fine, how are you?

639
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:35,617
-Good, thanks. I have your tape. -You got it?
-I got it. and I like it a lot!

640
01:34:35,742 --> 01:34:41,533
I was thinking, I have a gig at the Lenox Lounge coming up.
So would you like to come and sing with me?

641
01:34:41,658 --> 01:34:46,617
- Anytime Bill.
- It's great. It'll be fun.

642
01:34:48,367 --> 01:34:52,658
- Yes?
- That was Bill Evans.

643
01:34:52,867 --> 01:34:58,325
- What did he want?
- That I should come and sing with him.

644
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,992
This is fantastic !

645
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:17,992
Mummy!

646
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:20,950
Hey, baby.

647
01:35:20,917 --> 01:35:25,567
What are you going to do in New York?
Have you forgotten what happened last time ?

648
01:35:25,633 --> 01:35:29,200
It's different this time.

649
01:35:29,367 --> 01:35:34,533
- "It's different this time" !
- You do not know what I'm going to do.

650
01:35:34,658 --> 01:35:39,283
I thought that you've got everything you dreamed of.
Don't you ever get satisfied?

651
01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:42,700
I have to try new things.

652
01:35:42,908 --> 01:35:47,617
You don't to try a thing.
Try to calm down Monica.

653
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:52,325
Stop getting around bewildered .

654
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:55,325
Do you remember when you climbed the trees?

655
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:59,450
I did at least get to see
how the world looks like from above.

656
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:06,367
I feel sorry for you. Do you know that?

657
01:36:07,658 --> 01:36:11,867
- Why?
- You could have been something big.

658
01:36:12,033 --> 01:36:16,242
But you didn't even dare to try.

659
01:36:17,283 --> 01:36:21,450
The view up there is amazing.

660
01:36:25,075 --> 01:36:27,617
That's enough!

661
01:36:30,283 --> 01:36:35,158
- I'm meeting Bill Evans in the United States.
- Bill Evans?!

662
01:37:07,533 --> 01:37:12,075
- It's so beautiful here,
- And so big!

663
01:37:12,242 --> 01:37:15,992
Tiny lights that move.

664
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:22,200
- Do you see Hagfors?
- No.
- Neither do I.

665
01:37:22,367 --> 01:37:27,575
Because Hagfors is just
a tiny speck of dust in the universe.

666
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:57,783
Hi, Monica, Arne Thorén. I will present the concert
 for the Swedish radio listeners.

667
01:37:57,992 --> 01:38:01,950
Monica! So good to see you.
I'm looking foward to this.

668
01:38:02,117 --> 01:38:07,158
- This is my daughter Eva- Lena .
- Shall we? -Ready?

669
01:38:18,283 --> 01:38:24,867
The city's musicians have gathered to listen
when Monica Zetterlund will sing with world best pianist.

670
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:30,033
- It will be interesting, Bengt.
- Miles Davis stands at the bar.

671
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:33,700
Did you hear that? Miles Davis.

672
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:38,908
Ella Fitzgerald
and Sammy Davis Jr are here too.

673
01:38:39,075 --> 01:38:42,242
Now you are proud to be Swedish.

674
01:38:42,367 --> 01:38:47,658
Don't you want to listen
when your daughter is singing? Come on!

675
01:38:47,867 --> 01:38:52,867
Monica is nervous
back and forth out in the wings.

676
01:38:53,033 --> 01:39:00,533
I put the radio here,
so we both can hear... come on!

677
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:04,367
The hair is nicely styled.

678
01:39:04,492 --> 01:39:10,283
She lights another cigarette
and looks at the audience

679
01:39:11,283 --> 01:39:15,075
Now comes Bill Evans on stage.

680
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:20,033
Please welcome to the stage:
Monica Zetterlund.

681
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,450
Thank you.

682
01:39:32,617 --> 01:39:39,283
I wanna dedicate this song to a very special person
in Sweden, his name is Sture Åkerberg.

683
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:42,867
I hope he's listening right now.

684
01:42:54,783 --> 01:43:00,867
- Hello? -Good evening, You have an International call.
-Oh Thank you. -Standby, I'll put you through.

685
01:43:02,867 --> 01:43:05,450
-Hello? Who is it?
-Hello, Hi Monica...

686
01:43:05,617 --> 01:43:12,617
- Father! Has something happened?
- No, nothing happend.

687
01:43:12,783 --> 01:43:18,617
It's hard with the sound delay,
so I have to talk a little bit ...

688
01:43:18,783 --> 01:43:24,117
We heard you on the radio,
and it was wonderfull...

689
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:33,700
I would also ... I want to thank you Monica,
because you have shown me -

690
01:43:33,908 --> 01:43:37,283
- How things look like from the top.

691
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:42,200
Oh, dad ...

692
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:51,075
I'm probably going to have to hang up.
It will be so expensive.

693
01:43:53,325 --> 01:43:56,117
Goodbye.

694
01:44:21,908 --> 01:44:24,867
Thank you.

695
01:44:48,367 --> 01:44:53,658
- Hello. How are you?
- Good.

696
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:16,867
Come on, we have to go in.

697
01:45:58,450 --> 01:46:04,575
God, you look so serious!
It's worse than a funeral.

698
01:46:04,742 --> 01:46:08,200
Stop all that!

699
01:46:08,367 --> 01:46:12,450
When one makes the entry of a lifetime,
you have to be a little more cheerful.

700
01:46:12,617 --> 01:46:16,450
Otherwise, there would be no party!
