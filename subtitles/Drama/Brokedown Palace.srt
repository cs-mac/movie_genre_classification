1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,100
They've scheduled the hearing
for the Burmese.

2
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,200
- Where are you going?
- They should have a copy.

3
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,500
You're crazy.
It's pouring out there.

4
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,900
I know.

5
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,900
WOMAN: I'm not sure where to start.
You're probably fast-forwarding already.

6
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,900
We shouldn 't be here.

7
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,000
We're from Ohio. A dinky
little town called Upland.

8
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,700
I'm Alice Marano.
My best friend is Darlene Davis.

9
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,800
- I don't know about Hawaii anymore.
- What?

10
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,600
It's like a bunch of tourists
on family vacations.

11
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,800
We met as babies, crawled to each
other on a neighbor's lawn.

12
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,600
That's what my mom used to say.

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Get closer to your sister.

14
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,600
Teachers said I was the bad one,
Darlene was good.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,200
We didn 't care. It was a joke to us.
We knew how we were.

16
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
It was always the two of us.

17
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,500
Doug, could you take
a picture of me and Alice?

18
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Darlene was going to college.

19
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,400
We decided to have a knockout
trip together.

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,300
Celebrate our sorrows. After that...

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,000
...for the first time in our lives,
we wouldn 't be together.

22
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,500
So it had to be amazing.

23
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
Memorable.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Hawaii seemed so middle-class.
Like our parents ' version of fun.

25
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,700
I wanted it to be special.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Not that she would ever forget me.

27
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,300
Then someone mentioned Thailand.
It was as simple as that.

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,300
Strange how little things
make big things happen.

29
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,300
Ferg told us his brother spent
a summer in Bangkok for under $500.

30
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,200
I learned that Thailand means freedom.

31
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,000
A country named after
the exact thing we were looking for.

32
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,300
- I thought you wanted to go.
- I do. It's my dad.

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,200
- You're so afraid of him.
- He's already being a dick...

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,300
...about my off-campus apartment.
Now I'm going to Bangkok.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,300
- What'd you tell your dad?
- I said you were going, he said okay.

36
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,800
He doesn't care anyway...

37
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,400
...as long as I still have
my exciting career.

38
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,800
Just don't tell your dad.

39
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,200
Let him think we're in Hawaii.

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,800
It's only 11 days.
How's he gonna find out?

41
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,400
Dar worried about lying
for nine hours of the flight.

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,900
By the 24th hour,
she was too tired to care.

43
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,800
It took forever to find the hotel.

44
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Funny what forever used to feel like.

45
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,400
This is it?

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,100
- Doesn't look royal.
- How much royal do you want for $6?

47
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,300
Thank you very much.

48
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,700
Thank you.

49
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you.

50
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
- What is it?
- Oh, God!

51
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,100
It's a huge roach!

52
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,900
DARLENE: Thais have so much respect
for their monarch...

53
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,400
...that up until
Rama III changed the law...

54
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,500
...no one could utter
His Majesty's name.

55
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,600
Buying and then releasing
captive animals...

56
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,200
...is also considered meritorious.

57
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,800
A number of vendors around Bangkok
sell birds for this purpose.

58
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,700
- God, enough with this heat.
- Exactly.

59
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,700
I'm tempted to jump in the river.
How bad can raw sewage be?

60
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,000
They dump human waste, bathe
and drink, all in one river.

61
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,800
Give me that geek book.

62
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,400
Tell me you brought a bathing suit.

63
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,500
- But I'm not going in there.
- Come here.

64
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,100
DARLENE: What if we're caught?
ALICE: Go in like you own the place.

65
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100
Welcome to first class.

66
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Something to eat or drink?

67
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
- Two of those, please.
- What room number?

68
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,000
- We'll just pay cash.
- 414.

69
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,400
Come on. They don't care.

70
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,200
Lotion.

71
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,400
Thank you.

72
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,400
That's me.

73
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm gonna be her.

74
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm her divorce lawyer.

75
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,600
- I want both houses and the nanny.
- You've got to have her.

76
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,500
- The girls are crazy about Helga.
- Let's make him pay.

77
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,600
Damn right.

78
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,900
Exactly.

79
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
You say room number 414?

80
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,700
414? That man number 414.

81
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,400
I was sure...
Oh, it's 416. I'm sorry.

82
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,300
- You stay here?
- Our room's up there.

83
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
What's your name?

84
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,800
This is really inappropriate.
Our room...

85
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,300
God, it's right up there.

86
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,500
- What's your name?
- Room 333.

87
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Bloody hell, I can't take
you two anywhere.

88
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,100
Sorry, mate. It's been a bit
of a blur of hotel rooms.

89
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,500
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

90
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,400
I've got to shoot through.
You're scared straight now?

91
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,500
Excuse me.

92
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
- We'll pay you back.
- No worries, it's fine.

93
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,600
- Can we get you a drink?
- It's the least we could do.

94
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
Okay.

95
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,400
I'll take it for the wanker in 333
who left his key in the men's room.

96
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500
Come on.

97
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,300
But the man said it was solid wood.

98
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What?

99
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,300
Oh, great.

100
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Don't worry. You're in the fake Rolex
capital of the world.

101
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,000
- Some look better than the real ones.
- So you're new in town.

102
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,000
- Where are you from?
- Australia. But I'm never there.

103
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,200
I do seminars for a software
company all over Asia.

104
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,000
I do bugger all most days.
Getting paid to sun-bake.

105
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,900
I'd kill for a gig like that.

106
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,300
Oh, God. Quick, eat rice.

107
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,700
It makes it go away.

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
Eat more. It's like...

109
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,100
...your mouth's gonna explode.

110
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,500
Nobody's laughing.

111
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,800
Come on. Have some more.

112
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,800
- You forgot your drink.
- I've had enough.

113
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,400
Beautiful night, isn't it?

114
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Yeah.

115
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,000
Is this okay?
Are you okay with it?

116
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,900
Why would I care?
He's cute. Go for it.

117
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
Take notes. I want details.

118
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,600
I didn't know if you had keys.

119
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,800
- Where are you going?
- To the market. Coming?

120
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,100
No, I've got to get some sleep.

121
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,500
Sure. Okay.

122
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,200
- He wants to take us to Hong Kong.
- Us?

123
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,800
For the weekend.

124
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,600
He has to go on business and...

125
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Oh, God. Alice, it was great.

126
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,300
And weird. And intense.

127
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,000
- I'm not going to Hong Kong.
- It's just a day or two.

128
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,900
- The flight's only two hours.
- What about the beaches?

129
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,100
Please?

130
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
I really like him.

131
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,400
Then go. I'm not mad.
But I'm not going.

132
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,900
Go. Have a great, weird time.

133
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,800
Don't I always do shit
like this for you?

134
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,300
Please?

135
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,700
Okay, Dar.

136
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,100
I like the black one.

137
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,900
It's nice. It suits you.

138
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,500
Did Darlene tell you about Hong Kong?

139
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,600
Yeah, she might have.

140
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,300
I'm flying out there this afternoon.
You guys can fly out tomorrow.

141
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,900
I'll get all my business done...

142
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,900
...then we can just have a good time.

143
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,100
Come on. I want you to come.

144
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,000
I've made the ultimate sacrifice.

145
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,200
One first-class ticket
cashed in for three economy.

146
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,600
You have no idea what you've
ultimately sacrificed.

147
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,900
I'll get it. How much?

148
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,300
What did you get?
You were gone so long.

149
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,300
I got you something.

150
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,700
It's beautiful.

151
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,200
Thank you.

152
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,600
Thank you for coming to Hong Kong.

153
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,300
They said on CNN that it's gonna
be pouring in Hong Kong.

154
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,000
You still sure you wanna go?

155
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,500
We'll buy umbrellas.

156
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
My top got all wet.

157
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,600
Alice, hurry, we're gonna be late.

158
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
- Does this look okay?
- Perfect. I'll see you downstairs.

159
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,000

- Mr. Davis...
- You're a schemer.

320
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,000
You think I don't know you?
You are dead wrong.

321
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,700
Every word out of your mouth is a lie.

322
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,500
Six years old, paint on your hands,
on our couch.

323
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,500
"I didn't do it."

324
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,500
16 years old, the beer cans
in my car. "I didn't do it."

325
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,800
Let me hear you say it again.

326
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,300
Say it in here.

327
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,000
Come on, for old times' sake.

328
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,900
I didn't do it!

329
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
I'm so glad he's here.

330
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,900
He's being so great about it.

331
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,200
He really knows
how to grease the wheels.

332
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,900
He'll know what to do.

333
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,300
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

334
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,900
- Why aren't you excited?
- I am.

335
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,900
Did he tell you
he spoke to your dad?

336
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,000
Goddamn it!

337
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,200
You like?

338
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,800
Good fish heads.

339
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,300
No! It's a matter of days now.

340
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,900
DARLENE:
I told the detective the truth.

341
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,700
I told him about Nick Parks and all
the events leading up to our arrest.

342
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,400
I signed a statement...

343
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,400
...assuming it was just a translation
of what I said.

344
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,300
But these aren't my words.
I never said any of that.

345
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,300
That's the truth.

346
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
[SPEAKS IN THAl]

347
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
- What happened?
- Don't worry, we'll appeal.

348
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,400
You can request a pardon.
He found you both guilty.

349
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,500
- For how long?
- Good news. It wasn't life.

350
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,100
You both got numbered sentences.

351
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,600
- For how long?
- 33 years.

352
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,700
- Daddy!
- Honey, I'll take care of everything.

353
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,600
Yes, we're all over it.

354
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,900
Listen, I gotta go.

355
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,500
Sorry about that. Couldn't be helped.

356
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,200
- I know how you must feel.
- Fellas, look...

357
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,400
I know what goes on around here.

358
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,900
They take drugs seriously.

359
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,600
- There's no doubt...
- Come on.

360
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,400
Nobody here really wants
to stop the drugs. They're all...

361
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,400
I don't care if Thailand drowns
in heroin. That's their business.

362
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,400
Your business is to help
American citizens.

363
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,100
She didn't do anything.

364
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,200
They're not gonna make
an example of my little girl...

365
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
...with some trumped-up charge.

366
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,200
You pull strings all the time.

367
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,200
You could pull them for my daughter.

368
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,500
The DEA will continue
our investigation.

369
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,700
If we find the alleged man
who lured your daughter into this...

370
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,300
...we'll certainly
introduce that in an appeal.

371
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,400
I know this is difficult for you.

372
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,300
But the best thing
you can do is go home.

373
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,800
Go back to your family.

374
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,700
Nothing will fall through the cracks.
We'll keep you informed.

375
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
That's a promise.

376
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,500
ALICE:
So here we are.

377
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,600
Just two more drug smugglers.

378
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,600
I don 't even know why
I'm making this tape.

379
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,500
How do you do?

380
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm Henry Greene.

381
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,100
Hank Greene, actually.

382
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
- Who are you?
- Yankee Hank?

383
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,300
Yankee Hank, or Hank the Yank,
or whatever.

384
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,000
What can I do for you?
You want a cigarette?

385
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,500
- So you're like a lawyer?
- No, I am a lawyer.

386
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,800
Is this pro bono work that you do?

387
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,100
Pro bono? No.

388
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,700
So I listened to your narrative.

389
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,700
Forgive me if I'm blunt,
but there's nothing there.

390
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,800
You just claim you didn't know
about the smack. If you're lying...

391
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,500
...you're brainy and stupid.
If it's true, you're just stupid.

392
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,600
So I gotta ask a few questions.

393
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Who was carrying
the luggage with the drugs?

394
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,000
I was.

395
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,900
You had a couple kilos of heroin.
You didn't notice the extra weight?

396
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,600
- I didn't. I just didn't.
- We were late.

397
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah, of course.

398
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,600
- Who packed the bag?
- I did.

399
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,200
Alice, what does your father do?

400
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,200
Works at Bekins.

401
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,100
- Does he run a branch office?
- He rents trucks.

402
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,900
And your mom?

403
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,000
She died when I was 7.

404
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,900
Sorry to hear that.
What happened?

405
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,000
Car accident.

406
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,700
- And your dad?
- Insurance.

407
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,700
And my mom sells real estate.
Part-time.

408
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,700
I'll call to see
if they'll contribute...

409
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,700
...to their daughters' liberation
fund.

410
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,900
- What are you gonna do?
- Get you out.

411
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,500
Start writing letters
to lawmakers back home.

412
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,100
Congressmen. The president.
If you know a priest.

413
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,300
You want me to write
to my congressman?

414
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,500
That's right. I'll be in touch, girls.

415
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,700
- He's totally sleazy.
- Don't say that.

416
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,700
Greene? You say you're Thai?

417
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,700
HANK:
Well, I might as well be.

418
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,300
I'm American, but I know
their justice system.

419
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,500
- Now there's an oxymoron.
- Yeah.

420
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,600
My wife, Yon,
is also a practicing attorney...

421
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,500
...born in Bangkok.

422
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,600
We've helped a lot of families.
We could help your daughter.

423
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,100
What do you want out of this?

424
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,900
I'm just a broker.

425
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,100
We're looking for our usual retainer.

426
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,700
Which is...

427
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,500
...$ 15,000.

428
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,600
$ 15,000?

429
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,200
7500 to try to get a hearing
and 7500 if we do.

430
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,500
That's for both girls.

431
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,000
Wait, for both girls?

432
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,900
- Darlene needs her own trial.
- You don't want to do that.

433
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,700
The strongest point is
that Alice didn't sign a confession.

434
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,600
Separate them, and you're begging
for Darlene to be singled out.

435
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Do you wanna take a day or two?

436
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,800
No. God, no.

437
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,500
I'll get the money.

438
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,800
I'll call Marano
and wire it to you.

439
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,100
Great. We'll be in touch.

440
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,800
Who got you these tickets?

441
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,100
Same guy who introduced me
to these babies.

442
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,200
Well, hello there. Thank you.

443
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,000
Our next Minister of Justice.

444
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,300
He's worked hard for it.

445
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,200
He's working his fingers to the bone.

446
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,000
I love that guy!
I love that guy, man!

447
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,500
This is great.

448
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
No problem.

449
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,400
So when do I get the file
on Davis and Marano?

450
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,200
Those girls have no chance
of getting out of there.

451
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,100
Who's Nick Parks?

452
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,700
Who?

453
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,800
Why couldn't you find him?

454
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,900
The cops say the girls made him up.

455
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,800
Even if he did plant the six kilos...

456
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,900
...you know he'd never confess.

457
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,500
- Six?
- Yeah.

458
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,200
The shit was in their backpacks.

459
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,900
As far as the Thais are concerned,
they're guilty. Guilty or not.

460
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,300
Take a pass on this one.

461
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,700
After you give me the file, Roy.

462
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,800
Why not find out
who bought the plane tickets?

463
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,600
You'd think that'd be the easiest way
to catch this guy.

464
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
If he exists.

465
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
He sure doesn't exist in this.

466
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,500
What do you believe?

467
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,000
I believe that, either way...

468
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,400
...we'll be able to afford a new car.

469
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,900
This is Jagkrit's trophy photo.

470
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,300
Look at that, they're so arrogant,
they don't try to finesse it.

471
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,900
All that narcotic
in that little backpack.

472
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,800
I don't think so.

473
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:18,100
- That's great.
- It's just a hearing for a retrial.

474
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,200
I also talked to
the lady who runs the hotel.

475
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,800
Either she's not involved

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,000
What about Nick?

477
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,100
Parks isn't the magic bullet.

478
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,100
Even if we do find him,
it's your word against his.

479
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
But we're still looking.

480
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,600
Darlene, I need a moment with Alice.

481
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,000
Sure.

482
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,900
Nick was staying at
the Queen Victoria?

483
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,000
My wife found a maid there...

484
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:08,200
...who said there was a young man
there who matched Parks' description.

485
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,300
So, good, right?

486
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,400
The maid remembered him with a girl.

487
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,700
But when showed this picture...

488
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,300
...guess who the maid picked out
as the girl he was with.

489
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
Me.

490
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,900
Okay, I was at Nick's hotel.

491
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,200
And he came on to me,
but I told him to forget it.

492
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,700
He never even mentioned drugs.
I swear it.

493
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,900
- Is there anything else I should know?
- No.

494
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,100
Do you have to tell Darlene?
That would be really weird.

495
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,900
- I see no reason to tell anyone.
- Thank you.

496
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,800
Now I have a favor to ask you.

497
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,500
I haven't gotten your father's check.

498
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,500
I need you to talk to him.

Are you okay?

Where are you? You sound close.

505
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,100
I'm still here in Thailand.

506
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,300
I'm trying to get there.
I would have been there sooner...

I'm here with that lawyer,

He needs his money

00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,400
He wants the prosecutor
to bring in the backpack.

536
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,300
He says the backpack
was inadvertently destroyed.

537
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,900
Would you care to demonstrate
how six kilos...

538
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,000
...that's 13 pounds of powder...

...can fit in here?

He doesn't get it.

541
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,300
This backpack is from the same
manufacturer as the girl's.

542
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,400
Identical in every way.

If prosecutor and police can lie
about the amount of drugs involved...

...how can this sacred court
trust anything else they say?

545
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,700
The charges must be dismissed,
and these innocent, young girls...

It's an excellent idea,
a terrific idea.

Try to help my clients,
two young women like yourself...

596
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,700
...who may have been victimized by the
same person you dealt with.

597
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,000
What's your name?

598
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,700
Henry Greene.

599
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Hank.

600
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,300
Well, like I told
the gentleman from customs...

601
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,300
...it wasn't my bag.
I didn't try to bring anything in.

602
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,700
Somebody must have been trying
to mess me up.

603
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,300
All I know is the guy
bought my ticket to HK.

604
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,000
I didn't know it was
a stolen credit card.

605
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,700
So go arrest him.

606
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,700
- Nick Parks?
- Whoever.

607
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,400
- Are we done?
- No.

608
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,500
I'll wait for Charlie
to bring your wake-up dose...

609
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,700
...and snitch you both off
to the Chinese.

610
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,300
Or we can talk about Parks.

611
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,600
I don't know what you're
talking about, but...

612
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:25,200
...I may have heard stories
about situations like this.

613
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,400
And how does it happen
in these situations?

614
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,300
From what I understand,
he looks for suckers.

615
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,200
He comes on all nice and open.

616
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,200
When you're with him...

617
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:48,100
...if there's 100 people
in the room, it doesn't matter.

618
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,300
All he sees is you.

619
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:57,000
That's how this person
gets the girl to trust him.

620
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,400
Yes. Then, he...

621
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,200
He starts asking her things.

622
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,100
"Wouldn't it be great
to live in Switzerland?"

623
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,900
"Get married in Paris?"

624
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,200
By the time he pops
the real question...

625
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,000
...it's like you don't want
to disappoint him.

626
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,700
That's what I've heard.

627
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,600
You'll never find him, he's too smart.

628
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,900
Maybe. What's his name?

629
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,700
Nick something, you told me.
Now, please leave.

630
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,200
His name.

631
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,000
Hello, Darlene.

632
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,500
Great, you working for us again?

I don't know, maybe.

01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,100
Does the name Skip Carn mean anything?

635
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,000
Look, I had a lousy flight
back from Hong Kong.

636
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,900
I met another of Nick's or Skip's
or whoever's girlfriends.

637
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,300
- Be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?

638
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,100
You've been playing me all along.

639
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,300
I thought it was Alice, but the
come-on wouldn't work with her.

640
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,700
- But it worked with you, huh?
- No.

641
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,900
You fit the mold, Darlene.
He's done it 100 times.

642
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,400
- You're just 101.
- Look, you're wrong.

643
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,800
He wined you, he dined you,
he made love with you.

644
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,600
Then what? Asked you to
spend your life with him?

645
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,100
No, he never asked me that.

646
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,500
He didn't mentioned
getting married in Paris?

647
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:57,000
- What you'd do with a million bucks?
- Well, yeah, he did ask me that.

648
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,600
He asked me something
about that, but I never knew.

649
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,700
Who was it then? Was it Alice?

650
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,800
Alice was never even alone with him.

651
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,200
What do you want from me?

652
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,400
You want me to say I knew?

653
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,600
I planned the entire thing.
I'm the mastermind.

654
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,000
Does that make it easier
for you to walk away?

655
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,700
I don't care what you or anybody
thinks. I know I didn't do it.

656
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,700
Darlene? Darlene!

657
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,300
- You.
- What?

658
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,500
You did it, didn't you?

659
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,900
- What?
- The questions. Nick's questions.

660
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,600
"What would you do if you were rich?"

661
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
His little tests.
I flunked, so he asked you.

662
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,400
What are you talking about?

663
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,600
I wasn't groovy enough.

664
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,000
- It wasn't me. It had to be you.
- It wasn't me.

665
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,200
Did you fuck him too?

666
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,100
Of course you did. Why not?

667
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:28,100
And then you gave me a bracelet?
Was that a consolation prize?

668
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:33,300
What did he say?
"Oh, Darlene's a sweet girl, but..."

669
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,700
And you!
"Darlene's a really sweet girl...

670
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,100
...but she's no match for you."

671
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,100
You've ruined my life.
Do you understand that?

672
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,700
No more girlfriend?

673
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,500
Thai people is good friends.

674
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,800
No secrets between Thai friends.

675
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,200
Not like Yankee girls.

676
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,500
[VOICE COMES OVER LOUD SPEAKER]

677
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,800
- Ferg!
- Jason! Mary!

678
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Hey, babe. You look great.

679
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,400
Don't lie to a lifer.

680
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,100
We heard you couldn't
have anything in here...

681
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,800
...but we got you each a bra.

682
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,600
A little push-up in the padding.

683
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,800
- Alice?
- Great.

684
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,500
So you guys still
hanging out together?

685
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,200
No, we see Mary
at Christmas, spring break.

686
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,300
You're at college?
Do you like it?

687
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,700
It's just State.
I have this moronic roommate.

688
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I mean, the girl sleeps in her socks.

689
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,400
It's different than high school.

690
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,800
That's good. That's really good.

691
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,600
I saw your sister in the mall.
She's so big.

692
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,200
You guys look so good.

693
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,200
WOMAN:
Attention! Visiting hours are over.

694
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,000
All visitors must leave.

695
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,900
Darlene!

696
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,800
At least you're together.

697
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,700
At least you have each other, right?

698
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,500
Whatever she's on, I want some.

699
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,100
Darlene! Darlene!

700
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,800
She stay in infirmary.

701
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,000
They find cockroach.
It crawled in Darlene's ear.

702
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,000
It caused infection.
The doctor pulled it out from ear.

703
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,700
Can I make a wish?

704
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,600
Spirit house is not for wish.
Spirit house not joke.

705
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,800
Can I talk to the guard
who forgot to lock the gate?

706
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,100
- Help me.
- Do you want to die?

707
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,200
Velie, I've got money.

708
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,300
Leave me alone.

709
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,600
- Can I just talk to you?
- No.

710
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,100
The night I gave you the bracelet...

711
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,400
...I was with Nick that day.

712
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,500
And he kissed me.
We didn't do anything else.

713
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,300
He tried, but I wouldn't let him.

714
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,700
I should've told you he was a creep.

715
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,700
What if we had
just gone to Hawaii?

716
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:06,000
What if I let you buy those drinks?
What if I told you about Nick?

717
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,100
- There'd be no Hong Kong...
- And we wouldn't be here.

718
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:22,200
We won't be here much longer.
I set it up. We're getting out.

719
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,800
I need to go to the bathroom.

720
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,300
Where's the goddamn car?

721
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,800
I couldn't sleep.
The coffee's fresh.

722
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:45,200
"Customs was told Davis and Marano
carried narcotics...

723
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,000
...by an anonymous informant's
phone call.

724
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,100
Identification of the caller
was unsuccessful."

725
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,700
They tape those calls, don't they?

726
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,700
Do they?

727
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,900
I don't know.

728
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,200
Bud, check this out.

729
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,200
- Just had it installed.
- U.S. Tax dollars are hard at work.

730
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,300
- Hey, it's a living. Drink?
- I don't think so.

731
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,700
What's up?

732
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,100
Have you got a line
on a Skip K. Carn?

733
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,700
Why?

734
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,400
See? The letters, just rearranged.

735
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,300
It's an anagram. What's it prove?

736
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,000
- I think you know all about him.
- I do?

737
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:56,300
This is a recording from the
anonymous informant who called customs.

738
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,400
A young man
with a heavy Australian accent.

739
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,900
- It's Skip Carn. I'm sure.
- Prove it.

740
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,600
It could be anyone
with an Aussie accent.

741
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,500
Those girls didn't stand a chance.

742
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,600
This scumbag bought eight tickets.

743
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,300
His real couriers sailed by.

744
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,500
But your girls were
still carrying the smack.

745
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:25,900
Goddamn it, Roy!
They're gonna die in that shithole.

746
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,400
All I know about Skip Carn
is he's a low-level hustler.

747
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,400
A bottom-feeder with friends
in high places.

748
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,600
And that's it?

749
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,200
One friend...

750
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,300
...in a really high place.

751
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,900
So he had to give up two mules...

752
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,200
...to cover for six other mules
on the flight.

753
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:19,300
Could you stop saying that word?
We're not mules.

754
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,600
Yes. Nick Parks tipped off customs...

755
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,000
...to create a diversion.

756
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,700
They were too busy with you
to search the six other couriers.

757
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,100
It's insurance for
this kind of people.

758
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,300
The cops and customs guys
get paid extra money...

759
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,300
...when they make a dope bust?

760
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,800
So we were like a walking bribe.

761
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,000
Yes.

762
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,400
Now they'll add 15 more years
for trying to escape.

763
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,600
You have been busy, Mr. Greene.

764
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:09,800
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

765
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:15,100
Getting those two girls set free
has earned you a few shekels?

766
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,600
A few.

767
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,100
I believe I'm really the source
of your good fortune.

768
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,900
How's that, sir?

769
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,500
I catch drug smugglers,
and you defend them.

770
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:32,700
I feel I'm owed some sort of
tribute from you.

771
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,900
It's a regular food chain.

772
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,200
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

773
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:43,500
I guess Skip Carn would know
a thing or two...

774
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,400
...about paying tribute to you.

775
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,300
I expect a little more from you.

776
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,900
You're acting like...
What's that American expression?

777
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,400
An ambulance chaser.

778
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:04,100
I'm kind of a loose cannon.
Know that American expression?

779
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,800
I'd love to blow this
out of the water.

780
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:12,900
You have a cozy relationship
with a known drug trafficker.

781
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:16,400
This is exactly the kind of thing...

782
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,600
...Americans love watching on TV.

783
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,800
Two American girls' lives ruined
by a sleazy smuggler...

784
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,200
...and the greedy cop in his pocket.

785
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:33,600
You'll have to get ready for
Larry King. You'll love him.

786
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,200
Barbara Walters will probably
have pictures of you.

787
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,800
Barbara and the parents
will go into the bedroom:

788
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:47,600
"This is Darlene's room,
exactly as she left it."

789
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,700
- Teddy bears...
- Is there a point to this fantasy?

790
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:55,700
Yes, sir, it's a simple point.

791
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,300
I need your help.

792
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,500
That's a good accent.

793
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,900
My Spanish teacher always told me,
"Good ear, bad memory."

794
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,100
- How's Darlene doing?
- She's better.

795
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:26,200
- We'll just wait for her.
- Can I ask you something?

796
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,100
Since there's no money left,
why are you here?

797
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,100
No matter how I look at it,
you don't deserve this.

798
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:41,400
- Even if I did it?
- Yeah, but...

799
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,800
You didn't do it.
We both know it.

800
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,700
I wanted you to hear this
at the same time.

801
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
You're gonna get to go home.

802
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,900
- How?
- You'll have to sign a statement.

803
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,000
Admit you're wrong. Forget Nick...

804
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,200
- A statement?
- I can't do that.

805
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,500
This is the official,
face-saving confession.

806
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,600
You corroborate the police
version of events.

807
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,400
That's our part of the deal.

808
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,000
Then the crown will pardon you.

809
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,100
Then you get to go home.

810
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,300
All right.

811
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,000
It's okay.

812
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,100
No pardon: Narcotic offender.

813
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,500
- What's the problem?
- No pardon.

814
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,100
Your Minister of Justice has agreed.

815
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,900
You tell him that we have
an agreement.

816
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:53,800
I'm sorry.
They are narcotics smugglers.

817
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,100
You son of a bitch, we have a deal.

818
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:01,300
Yes, nicely done.
You really had me going.

819
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,800
But now there is no more Skip Carn.

820
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,100
No one will get to him, so no deal.

821
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,400
Wait.

822
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,400
No, get them off me.

823
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,300
You may speak English.

824
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,300
My best friend is not a drug smuggler.
She is innocent.

825
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,700
She's innocent.

826
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,900
All she ever did wrong
was to trust me.

827
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,100
Here you believe one friend
knows what the other does.

828
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,200
Maybe that's friendship...

829
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:16,800
...but I'm American, and I was not
that kind of a friend.

830
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,000
I know this.

831
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,700
Because I did it.
Because I was foolish...

832
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,400
...and jealous.
I was afraid she'd drift away.

833
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,800
I was afraid I was gonna lose her.

834
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,900
She never knew. It was all me.

835
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:42,500
She spent all this time
in your prison for my mistakes.

836
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,700
I'm sorry.

837
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:51,300
Please, if you need someone
to do the time, I'll do it.

838
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:55,900
I'll do her time and mine.
Just let her go, please.

839
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,500
Then you're of strong character
and would lie to save your friend?

840
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,600
No, I am of weak character.

841
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,300
And I just want to
make up for my mistakes.

842
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,900
If you're lying to
save your friend...

843
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,600
...then you're of sufficient character
to earn what you want.

844
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,200
If you're telling the truth...

845
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,800
...then your friend is innocent
and should go free.

846
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:41,300
If you are willing to serve
her term and yours...

847
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,100
...your friend is pardoned.

848
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,500
Thank you. Thank you.

849
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,800
Darlene must go soon.

850
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,800
You're a very good liar.

851
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,900
You didn't do it.

852
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,300
I know you didn't do it.

853
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,600
I don't think I can leave you.

854
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,700
If I say it was the truth...

855
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,700
...you'll hate me.
And if I say I lied...

856
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,100
...then when you go home,
all the time with your family...

857
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,400
You won't be able to just be happy.

858
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,000
So let's just say it was
the right thing to do.

859
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,300
Let's just leave it at that.

860
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,700
Come, Darlene.

861
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,400
- I'm going to get you out of here.
- I know.

862
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:06,100
Go, Dar. I need you to.

863
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,300
Please.

864
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,100
ALICE: A lot of people won 't
understand why I said I did it.

865
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,500
But for me, it was
the right thing to do.

866
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,800
Maybe more right than
anything I ever did.

867
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,600
Darlene and Hank won 't stop trying...

868
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,600
...till I'm out of here.

869
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,600
Until I'm free.
