MAN: All ready here, sir. Crew standing by
and awaiting your word. Over.

2
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,365
Right. Over and out.

00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,498
[SIREN WAILlNG]

4
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,837
MAN : Our man was brought down
at 2 a.m. this morning.

5
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,175
SHAEF, in their all-knowing wisdom,
didn't let us know until 10 a.m.

6
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,303
Damned idiots.
Damned idiots for not letting us know.

7
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,015
DoubIe damned idiots
for ignoring our advice in the first place.

8
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,518
Anyway, here he is...

9
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,187
...in a town called Werfen...

10
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,983
...at the Schloss AdIer,
the Castle ofthe Eagles.

11
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,820
And believe me, it's well-named,
because only an eagle can get to it.

12
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,866
Ourjob is to get inside there
and get him out as soon as possible...

13
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,286
...before they can
get the information from him.

14
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,163
How are you so sure that he's there, sir?

15
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,709
The Mosquito he was in
crash-landed only 10 miles away.

16
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,879
The Schloss Adler is the headquarters ofthe
German secret service in southern Bavaria.

17
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,257
Where eIse would they take him?

18
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,011
-How did the plane crash, sir?
-Through the most damnable ill luck.

19
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,347
We carried out a saturation raid
on Nuremberg last night.

20
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,518
There shouldn't have been a German fighter
within 100 miles ofthe Austrian border.

21
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,229
A wandering Messerschmitt patrol
got him.

22
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,898
Anyway, that's not important.

23
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,611
What is important is that
we get him out before he talks.

24
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,699
Or I should say, you get him out.

25
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,035
What about paratroops, sir?

26
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,872
The Schloss Adler
is inaccessible and impregnable.

27
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,083
It would require a battalion
of paratroops to take it.

28
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,918
We haven't got the time.

29
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,796
SteaIth and secrecy are our only hope...

30
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,717
...and you gentlemen are,
I trust, stealthy and secretive.

31
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,637
We realize of course that you've never
worked together before as a team...

32
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,142
...but you're familiarwith one another,
except for Lieutenant Schaffer here.

33
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,770
You probably noticed
that Lieutenant Schaffer...

34
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,898
...wears the shoulderflashes
ofthe American Ranger division.

35
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,442
I think that speaks for itself.

36
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,944
Major Smith wiIl lead the group in.

37
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,406
Now, you're alI expert
at survival behind enemy lines.

38
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,200
Smith, Lieutenant Schaffer...

39
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,620
...Sergeants Harrod and MacPherson
in their military capacities...

40
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,915
...the rest ofyou in other duties.

41
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,334
You all speak fluent German.

42
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,337
You've been trained
in different types of combat.

43
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,132
If anybody has a chance
of getting him out, you have.

44
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,468
There is, of course, another way, sir.

45
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,971
A way with a 100 percent guarantee
of success.

46
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,893
NeitherAdmiral Rolland or I
claim to be omniscient or infallible.

47
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,437
Is there an alternative that we've missed?

48
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,983
Whistle up a pathfinder squadron
of Lancasters with 10-ton bombs.

49
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,821
I don't think anybody in that castle
would ever talk again.

50
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,824
Nor do I think that you grasp
the realities ofthe situation.

51
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,494
The captured man, General Carnaby,
is an American.

52
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,664
Ifwe were to destroy him,
then l think General Eisenhower...

53
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,459
...might launch his second front against us
rather than against the Germans.

54
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,381
There are certain niceties to be observed
in our relationship with our allies.

55
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,846
Very well, then, gentlemen.
Ten o'clock tonight at the airfield.

56
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,349
-No more questions, I take it?
-Yes, sir.

57
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,186
Begging the colonel's pardon, sir.
What's aIl this about?

58
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,522
I mean, why is this man
so damned important?

59
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,524
-Why should--?
-That'll do, sergeant.

60
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,693
You have alI the information you require.

61
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,696
I think ifwe're sending a man
to what may be his death...

62
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,198
...he has a right to know why.

63
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,492
It's painfully simple, sergeant.

64
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,204
General Carnaby is one
ofthe overall coordinators...

65
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,748
...of planning for the second front.

66
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,044
He set out last night to meet
his opposite numbers in the Middle East...

67
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,006
...to finalize the plans
for the invasion of Europe.

68
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,092
The rendezvous with the Russians
was to have been in Crete.

69
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,053
Now, unfortunately, his plane
didn't get through.

70
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:57,809
Now, ifthe Germans can make him talk...

71
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,562
...it could mean no second front
this year.

72
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,900
-Do you understand, sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

73
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,778
-I'm sorry, sir.
TURNER: That's aIl right, sergeant. Forget it.

74
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,032
Now, ifyou have any more questions,
Major Smith wiIl answer them.

75
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,284
That's all, gentlemen.

76
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,525
PILOT: Get them ready.
We're approaching the drop area.

77
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,527
Stand by!

78
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,004
Green on! Go!

79
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,198
Where's Harrod?

80
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,998
Well, last time I saw him, he was drifting
towards those trees over here.

81
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,673
All right. Spread out.

82
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,007
Let's go and find him.

83
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,164
Major!

84
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,670
-His neck's broken.
-Damn it.

85
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:25,220
Well, what do we do now?
Do we bury him or do we leave him here?

86
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,890
We Ieave him here. The snow
will cover him in a coupIe of hours.

87
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,186
Get back and pick up the equipment.
I want to see ifthe radio's still working.

88
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,164
Well...

89
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,918
...the radio works aIl right. There's a barn
about a mile down the valley.

90
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,045
We'll use it to check our equipment.

91
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,839
-What about the people who live in it?
-There aren't any.

92
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,300
This is a high alpine pasture.

93
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,678
They bring the cattle up in May
and take them down in September.

94
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,806
The rest ofthe time,
the place is totally deserted.

95
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,434
Come on. Let's go.

96
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,721
Somehow, you know, thisjust isn't me.

97
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,642
It's not any of us, Jock.
You're the cook. Cook...

98
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,897
...some hot food and some hot coffee,
and then call London on the radio.

99
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,692
Damn it. I left that codebook
in Sergeant Harrod's tunic.

100
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,696
-I'lI go and get it for you.
-No, it's all right. It's my own stupid fauIt.

101
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,574
Sounds as if it's still blowing a bIizzard.
Yeah.

102
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,327
Well, if I'm not back in an hour...

103
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,414
...signal me with a flare pistol
four times every five minutes.

104
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,249
That should bring a blind man home.

105
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,835
Might aIso bring the best part
of a German regiment.

106
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,546
There's not a German within five miles.

107
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,132
Nobody leaves here until I come back.

108
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,468
-Jock, save me some coffee.
-It'll be cold by then.

109
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,431
They say that's an advantage.
You can't taste cold coffee.

Halt.

112
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,390
Turn around.

113
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,318
You took your time getting here,
didn't you?

114
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,821
Things to attend to.

115
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,365
-You enjoy your trip?
-Lovely.

116
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,659
I nearly froze to death
in that damn plane.

117
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:44,413
Why couldn't you have suppIied some hot
water bottles or an eIectrically heated suit?

118
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:48,501
-I thought you loved me.
-I can't help what you think.

119
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,795
You managed to bring your gear.

120
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,964
Is that all the greeting I'm going to get?

121
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,426
I'm afraid so, for the time being.
My radio operator was kilIed in the drop.

122
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,345
What happened?

123
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,639
Something struck him
in the back ofthe neck.

124
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,016
Either the haft of a knife
or the butt of a gun.

125
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,185
The skin was unbroken,
but badly discolored.

126
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,437
It means someone
broke his neck afterwards...

127
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,398
...to make it look like an accident.

128
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,402
Now listen, l'm taking the group at dawn
over the ridge into the next valley.

129
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,613
We'll stop in the woods until about 7.
Now, don't stumble into us.

130
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,367
As soon as it's dark,
we'lI move into the village ofWerfen.

131
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,412
In the village, there's a gasthaus
calIed Zum Wilden Hirsch.

132
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,373
Behind it and to the right,
there's a woodshed.

133
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,127
I'll meet you there
at exactly 8:00 tomorrow night.

134
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,339
-And after that, what?
-I'lI let you know when the time comes.

135
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,883
Ah.

136
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,261
-I see you've come fully prepared.
-Never mind about that.

137
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,974
How do you know about all these things,
Zum Wilden Hirsch and the shed?

138
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,935
I'm entitled to know.

139
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,730
You're entitIed to know nothing.

140
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,818
We've worked together for three years.
I'm a professional.

141
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,028
So am I.

142
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,281
If l were the marrying kind, which I'm--

143
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,625
-I thought you were in a hurry.
-So I am.

144
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,501
Aren't you?

145
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,779
SCHAFFER:
What kept you?

146
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,824
Well, I was very Iucky.

147
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,620
I ran into this fabulous blond.
She was lying on a snowdrift.

148
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,205
Does she have a friend?

149
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,791
No, I'm afraid you're out of luck.

150
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,838
-Thanks for waiting up for me, anyway.
-No problem.

151
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,894
Lieutenant, why don't you go to sleep?

Well, now that we're alI comfortable,
the first order of business...

Now, first the lieutenant.

...a member ofthe American
intelligence organization known as OSS.

His job was to shoot you, Colonel Kramer,
and you, General Rosemeyer.

658
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:59,189
Now, General Carnaby's mission
was twofold:

659
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:01,233
First, to allow himselfto be tortured...

660
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,986
...into giving you the wrong plans
for the second front.

661

And secondly, to afford the British...

662
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:09,324
...a perfect excuse to send in
a team of experts to rescue him.

Which brings us
to our three friends here...

...and were discovered and captured
by the British about a month ago.

...be sure that they fail in their mission...

would be taken to Berlin...

right in the heart ofthe Wehrmacht.

what were your orders on this mission?

First, if l'm not who I say l am...

the exposure ofthree spies. Who to?

they're supposed to be working for.

Also, ifthese people
are what they say they are...

700

...they would know the name
of our top agent in Whitehall.

-Yes.
-So why don't we ask them?
