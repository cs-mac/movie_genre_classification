4
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,676
How do you do?

5
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,985
I'm Takiguchi,
one of this film's characters.

6
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,684
This is the story of a woman
who calls me ''Brother.''

7
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,357
Her name? It's Sada.

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,427
Yes. That famous Sada. Sada Abe.

9
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:14,029
She insists on telling you
about herself.

10
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,079
Facts can easily become fiction
when recounted by someone -

11
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,011
even by oneself.

12
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:29,411
But with a bit of sincerity,
lies can become truth.

13
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,121
So, why not enjoy yourselves
this evening

14
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,855
by listening to Sada's story?

15
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,260
She's like a lovable kid sister to me.

16
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,462
I apologize for her rudeness.

17
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,769
I'd appreciate your generosity.

18
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,669
I'll see you again later.

19
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,440
Excuse me.

20
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,776
Step aside!

21

'''It starts to rain while I'm playing.

00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:18,147
It rains outside my lattice window.'

41
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,222
A literary fragment
by Chuya Nakahara.''

42
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:48,979
''Sada Abe really lived.

43
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,589
She is well known

44
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,922
because she sliced off
her man's sexual organ.

45
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:03,592
But of course, her life cannot be told
only through that episode.''

46
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,803
I, too, had a childhood.

47
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,610
But let's forget about that.

48
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,041
EARLY SUMMER 1 91 1

49
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,339
Either way,

50
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,451
maybe I lived thinking of myself

51
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,814
as neither happy nor unhappy.

52
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:29,854
But in any case, I hated rainy days.

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,995
My story begins here.

54
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,306
SUMMER 1 91 9

55
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,038
Open up. Please!

56
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,340
I have a question!

57
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,823
How many times must I repeat this?

58
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,123
I won't leave until you answer!

59
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,731
Yes?

60
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,235
You a maid?

61
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,393
As you can see.

62
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,871
I must talk to your mistress!

63
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,443
She's home.
I saw her just now.

64
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,546
Listen. Tell me!

65
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,776
Her son, a college boy,

66
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,616
dragged my daughter into an inn!

67
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,557
Do something!
If worst comes to worst, she'll die.

68
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,754
She's just a schoolgirl.
She's only 1 4.

69
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,366
You hear me, eh?

70
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,266
She's only 1 4!

71
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,342
You think you can deceive us like this?

72
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,814
Because she's a merchant's daughter,
you think she isn't human?

73
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:12,224
Being here with a man
means you know what happens.

74
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,958
Okay?

75
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,134
Stop.

76
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,628
It's too late to stop.

77
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,548
I'm scared.

78
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:12,381
Silly. This isn't the first time
for you, eh?

79
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,226
It is.

80
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,693
Liar! You're well-known among us.

81
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,596
At your age you already have a man.

82
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,035
That's not true!

83
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,606
I'll make it true.

84
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,270
No!

85
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,444
That hurts!

86
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,436
That hurts!

87
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,978
Who are you?

88
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,719
How rude to barge into my room.

89
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,364
Toshihiko.

90
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,995
Aren't you the one who's being rude?

91
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,003
You Okada?

92
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,880
She needs treatment.

93
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,624
- Call a doc.
- Don't do that.

94
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,456
It'll cause trouble.

95
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,229
I have money.

96
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,230
Use this to take care of it.

97
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,795
We're friends, right?

98
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,903
I don't like weepy women.

99
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,022
Take it easy.

100
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,801
I'm a medical student.

101
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,799
I'll treat you.

102
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,132
This is my aunt's place.

103
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,070
Stay here.

104
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,206
Please.

105
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,846
Stay by me.

106
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,751
You're bleeding.

107
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,330
It's all right now.

108
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,894
Rest for a while.

109
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,336
Stay here.
Stay here, please.

110
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,675
If you leave me,

111
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,371
I'll kill myself with this.

112
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,915
I don't want to be left alone.

113
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,450
Look at my blood.
It's scarlet.

114
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,087
Look at that.

115
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,449
I'll bleed even more.

116
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,436
I bought these for my aunt.

117
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,372
Have one.

118
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,640
Eat it.

119
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,561
It's sweet.

120
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,026
FATAL DISEASE

121
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,068
How odd!
Raining on a lucky day.

122
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,035
A lucky day?

123
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,109
You're here.

124
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,677
You don't have to talk.
Just stay by my side.

125
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,946
I've never met anyone like you.

126
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,148
I detest him.

127
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,386
Not you.

128
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,192
That student.

129
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,387
To think how he tricked me.

130
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,836
I can't get married now.

131
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,906
Will you marry me?

132
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,009
Sorry, I can't.

133
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,974
Then die with me.

134
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,480
Die?

135
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,577
Yes. Double suicide.

136
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,315
Listen.

137
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:40,390
Why do you wear dark glasses
all the time?

138
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,132
I know you have lovely eyes.

139
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,606
Why hide them?

140
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,072
Sada.

141
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,205
You should know this:

142
00:16:55,581 --> 00:17:01,918
Though we just met,
we mustn't meet again.

143
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,951
Why not?

144
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,853
Tell me.

145
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,850
Why not?

146
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,296
I won't tell you.

147
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,057
Tell me!

148
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,940
You're nice.

149
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,510
An honest girl.

150
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:32,440
Don't go astray
just because of this.

151
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,678
Wherever I am,

152
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,916
I'll watch over you in my heart.

153
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,656
We'll say good-bye here.

154
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,728
Find happiness.

155
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,263
No! You're lying!

156
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,936
You don't care about me at all!

157
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,470
Watch over me in your heart?
Where is the heart, really?

158
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:11,083
You're right.
Even X-rays can't show where it is.

159
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,868
Use this and cut out my heart.

160
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,638
Do like this.

161
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,161
Look.

162
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,667
This is my heart.

163
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,171
It's yours.

164
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,367
Take it with you.

165
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,747
The knife too.

166
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:17,549
Then you can believe
you took my heart yourself.

167
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,491
Blood gushes

168
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,854
from my heart too.

169
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,098
Now let's part here.

170
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,292
I'll be going far away.

171
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,201
I'll never

172
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,400
come back again.

173
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,276
Good-bye.

174
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,743
I hate rainy days.

175
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,618
Hansen's disease.

176
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,784
Okada suffered from it.

177
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,718
It was regarded as incurable.

178
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,020
Its patients were isolated.

179
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,922
Okada was secretly sent away
to a remote island,

180
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,693
and ada never knew.

181
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:41,439
Okada lived during ada's lifetime,
but did they meet and part like this?

182
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,377
ada spoke little about it,
and no one actually knows.

183
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,114
This film trespasses
in the mysterious realm of ada.

184
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,523
Are you going
to sell those kimonos again?

185
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,157
Yes.
What's wrong with selling mine?

186
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,860
Now you're just quibbling.

187
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,802
You quit school.
You're a truant.

188
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,102
Your dad says
he might make you a geisha.

189
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,303
Really? Why not?

190
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,809
How can I ignore my dad?

191
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,521
Stop asking that student to marry me.

192
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,548
He'll never marry me.

193
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,659
I'll have a miserable life!

194
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,820
But we must make him pay

195
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,031
for what he did
to our precious daughter.

196
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,691
It's me he did it to.

197
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,800
Don't try to sell my virginity to him.

198
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,999
That's so lowdown.

199
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,303
Then what am I to do?

200
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,345
He said you made eyes at him.

201
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,207
Like this?

202
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,717
Money isn't the issue.

203
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:05,016
We should've made him
apologize in public.

204
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,753
Don't you agree?

205
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,755
But what's done is done.

206
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,729
I can't regain my virginity anyway.

207
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,232
Sada.

208
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:26,202
Tell Dad I'll be glad to be
a geisha or anything.

209
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,376
Out of my way!

210
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,243
I was still the person
I had always been,

211
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:40,983
but perhaps the world
saw me differently now.

212
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,424
Anyway, it didn't really concern me.

213
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,264
I could be more at ease than before.

214
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,870
In a way, I was enjoying myself.

215
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,633
- Wait!
- Run!

216
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,475
Two cops against the seven of us.

217
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,210
They'll never get us.

218
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,673
Try to get us!

219
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,544
Hey, wait!

220
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,199
Only idiots wait for cops!

221
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,168
Try to get us!

222
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,234
Let's go!

223
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,334
Wait!

224
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,099
Wait!

225
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,919
That student looked rich,
but he was broke.

226
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,659
Let's blackmail
rich old men next time.

227
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,002
Where are you, Okada?

228
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,969
Did you run away?

229
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,605
Cops!

230
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,578
Which way?

231
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,879
That way!

232
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,280
Wait!

233
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,623
Run! Sada, run!

234
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,559
Get away!

235
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:14,499
My childhood was over
before I even knew it.

236
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,870
I never thought of you as this sexy.

237
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,340
Sexy?

238
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,778
You've matured.

239
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,680
Your dad told me.
A lot has happened, eh?

240
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,310
Your brother left home
with a woman.

241
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,818
Your dad had a big tatami shop,

242
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,423
but he closed it to pay debts.

243
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,853
Anything can happen in life.

244
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,656
Business is slow in Japan.

245
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,391
Recession is everywhere.

246
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:46,697
But there's no recession
where you're going to work.

247
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,872
Men can't resist
as long as they have money.

248
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:58,213
A geisha's job is
to sell her art, right?

249
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,040
Yes. ''Art.''

250
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,018
A very feminine art.

251
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,119
Can she play the samisen?

252
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,722
She doesn't just play music, ma'am.

253
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,595
She dances well too. Right?

254
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,564
Then play this.

255
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,739
Play anything you like.

256
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,345
All right?

257
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:25,402
''Cat''is slang for geisha

258
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,205
They call me cat

259
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,703
But do you think a cat comes
wearing clogs and kimono

260
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:12,575
THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF 1 921

261
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,646
My mind is elsewhere.

262
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,415
Only my body is hot.

263
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:36,498
An endless stream of men came and went,
and endless days as well.

264
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,134
SUMMER 1 929

265
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,675
It's been 1 0 years.
I've moved all overJapan.

266
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,905
I've used aliases.

267
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,118
Geishas sell their bodies too,

268
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,878
so why not just be a whore instead?
I felt more at ease that way.

269
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,416
I don't dislike this racket,

270
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,228
and I get to choose my clients too.

271
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,407
Miyako,

272
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,741
there's a client for you.

273
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,139
A client at this hour?

274
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,246
All right.

275
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,493
Why, it's you, Brother!

276
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,864
I heard you were ill,
so I came to see you.

277
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,438
Thank you for coming all this way.

278
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:59,578
This racket and this illness
go together.

279
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,244
There's an offer for you.

280
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,888
Why not work at Kusatsu spa?

281
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,526
It'll cure your illness.

282
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,154
I know.

283
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,590
That's what you came for.

284
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,232
You'll make more money off me.

285
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:25,666
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come
all the way to Osaka to see me.

286
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,206
You're a real professional now.

287
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,311
Meaning?

288
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,153
Do I look so sexy?

289
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,057
You've always been sexy
and a straight talker.

290
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:52,793
Doesn't it bother your clients?
I'm amazed.

291
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,936
Why not become one of them?

292
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,042
Silly!
You're like my sister.

293
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,906
You want to lay me
as long as it's free, huh?

294
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,806
Your face says so.

295
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,310
I'm old enough to see that.

296
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,184
It's my long experience.

297
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,430
Sonomaru, a client.

298
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,489
- A client?
- Yes.

299
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,431
He says it won't take long.

300
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,002
It's my job.

301
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:30,998
Brother.

302
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,334
Hurry!

303
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,486
Come in.

304
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,749
Please take good care of him.

305
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,392
I'm being sent to Manchuria tomorrow.

306
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,270
I'm embarrassed to say it,
but I've never had a woman.

307
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,173
I put myself in your hands.

308
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,574
His father's waiting downstairs.

309
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,867
Yes.

310
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:12,342
Once I taste a woman,
I won't let myself be killed easily.

311
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,314
That's what Dad said.

312
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,846
Manchuria, eh?

313
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,352
For your country?

314
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,676
Yes.

315
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,889
I'll serve my mother country.

316
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,186
How great!

317
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,362
Men serve their country.

318
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,795
I never thought of it.

319
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,163
But...

320
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,329
I'll make you a real man.

321
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,305
Thank you.

322
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,482
Relax, all right?

323
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,322
Just do as I say.

324
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:02,859
Let's go to Manchuria together.

325
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,161
Yes, let's.

326
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,954
No.

327
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,626
Let's go.

328
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,290
- We can't go.
- Yes, we can.

329
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,902
Yes, we'll go.

330
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,699
No. No.

331
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,874
I can't hold it.

332
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,340
Not yet.

333
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,174
Take it slow.

334
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,872
Slow.

335
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,380
We'll go to Manchuria.

336
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,711
That's right.

337
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,585
It feels so good!

338
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,240
You're amazing, Sada! Irresistible!

339
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,419
It really got me excited.
when you touched him down there.

340
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,521
Soldiers are special.

341
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,847
Thanks.

342
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,386
Okayo, a client.

343
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,121
A client?

344
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,832
Some tea?

345
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,103
No, thanks. I'm in a hurry!

346
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,482
One, two -

347
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,342
Boss!

348
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,746
You're doing well, eh?

349
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,793
What are you doing?

350
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,295
How can I control myself now?

351
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,160
You'll catch what I have.

352
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,527
Who cares?

353
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,731
- Brother.
- Who cares?

354
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,270
Why are you speaking
with an Osaka accent?

355
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,932
Who cares?

356
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,845
Thank you for your hard work, Kimie.

357
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:48,785
Thanks.

358
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,988
Your box sure is great.

359
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,798
It's more than just experience.

360
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,904
Sorry about this.

361
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,432
What'll we do? Shall I pay you?

362
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,110
How can I take money from you?

363
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,209
Instead,

364
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:18,285
there's a man I want to lay me free.

365
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,947
You love him?

366
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,455
No.

367
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,395
He's the one who stole my virginity.

368
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,991
Why for free?

369
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:34,032
If a whore refuses money from a man,
it's a big insult to him.

370
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,873
I'll get back at him that way.

371
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,271
Look for him and bring him to me.

372
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,086
You're an interesting woman.

373
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,551
No.

374
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,626
You're a dreadful woman.

375
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,932
Thus time passed once again.

376
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,346
Do you know why flowers
are so lovely like this?

377
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,489
Pardon?

378
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,381
SUMMER 1 91 5

379
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,788
Flowers are like a woman's equipment.

380
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,291
Oh, madam -

381
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:36,024
Flowers bloom just for that purpose.

382
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,469
They attract bees,
then their petals fall away.

383
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,832
It would be sad
if people were the same way.

384
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:47,935
People are different because
they have something called a ''heart.''

385
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,306
Understand?

386
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,673
Where did you hear that?

387
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,147
I read it in that magazine.

388
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,110
HOUSEWIVES' FRI END

389
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,052
The master's back.

390
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,754
And don't call me madam.

391
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,531
I'm just a concubine.

392
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:27,308
She knows what to do,
so have a nice time.

393
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,918
Welcome back.

394
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,821
Welcome. My name is Sada.

395
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,390
Welcome back.

396
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,228
Mr. Tachibana.

397
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,898
Pleased to meet you.

398
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,575
A bath first, or something to eat?

399
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,042
A bath first.

400
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,042
Let him change his clothes and relax.

401
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,817
Excuse me.

402
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,883
See you later.

403
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,961
I'll do it.

404
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:21,898
Sorry.

405
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,040
Excuse me.

406
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,042
I'll do it.

407
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:42,893
Listen.

408
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,755
You were wrong.

409
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:54,537
You weren't formal enough
when introducing yourself.

410
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:01,911
You must speak more politely
to men in my position.

411
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,160
Another thing.

412
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,794
I can take of myself.

413
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,301
Leave me alone.

414
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,006
I felt he had made a fool of me.

415
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,684
I decided to conquer him for revenge.

416
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,531
Don't touch me there.

417
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,666
I'm a man, after all.
It makes me feel strange.

418
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:14,210
Then why not just feel strange?

419
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,989
You have soft hands.

420
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,561
No. You mustn't do this.

421
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,592
Master.

422
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,798
Don't.

423
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,701
What's your name?

424
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,107
It's Sada.

425
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:41,709
You were wrong again.

426
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,139
Why not be wrong with me?

427
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,040
Sada.

428
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,863
Aren't you Sada?

429
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,306
Mom!

430
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,668
It's me.

431
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,543
I came home to see you.

432
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,944
It's been so long.

433
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,116
Could this really be true?

434
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,652
Yes, it is.

435
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,230
You're seeing the real Sada.

436
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,764
A gift for you.

437
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,501
Thank you.

438
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,899
When you wrote
you were coming home,

439
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,336
your dad didn't believe it.

440
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:54,382
I believed it.
I prayed to Buddha.

441
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,576
And I told your dad you'd come.

442
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,154
Of course I'd come home.

443
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,813
But still!

444
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,688
I never lied to Dad or you.

445
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,021
That's why I got scolded so often!

446
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,359
Let's go.

447
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,171
You're really beautiful.

448
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,474
I'm a lady.

449
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,710
I'll carry your things.

450
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:25,144
No. It's part of my outfit.

451
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,277
What a nice day!

452
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,963
How's Dad doing these days?

453
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,532
He sits and looks out
on the landscape all day.

454
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:47,601
Good.

455
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,171
We owe you so much.

456
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,567
You send us money.

457
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:57,339
We can buy medicine
and pay doctors.

458
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,851
No one else here sees a doctor.

459
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,284
This way.

460
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,550
What about you?

461
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:11,820
I met a big shot for the first time.

462
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,556
I know. Takiguchi told us.

463
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,591
You're fortunate.

464
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:24,104
You worked hard
and it brought you good fortune.

465
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,072
His name is Tachibana?

466
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:32,181
He's a school principal.
He'll be in parliament too.

467
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:36,683
But he didn't tell me that.
I found out on my own.

468
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,223
Maybe he wants to hide what he is.

469
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:45,953
He pays me and teaches me lots.

470
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,292
He told me to go see my parents.

471
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,230
He said to be a dutiful daughter.

472
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,828
I'm so grateful to him.

473
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,076
After I leave here,

474
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,144
he told me to be an apprentice
in a Tokyo restaurant.

475
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,441
A restaurant?

476
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,209
To study cooking.

477
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:14,552
Then he'll give me enough
to run a small restaurant.

478
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,260
Let's race, Mom.

479
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,096
Ready?

480
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:31,868
Go!

481
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,698
Dad!

482
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,866
I feel better.

483
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:12,147
Japanese kimonos are something.

484
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:16,480
This dress suits you too.

485
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,850
It's the ''modern girl'' style.

486
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,648
It's the rage now.

487
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,159
I wanted to surprise you.

488
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,095
Actually, I hate it.

489
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,330
Why not show it to your dad?

490
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,637
It'd shock him to death.

491
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,742
I always wanted to tell you this.

492
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,380
What?

493
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:58,020
That college student
who made you suffer so -

494
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,686
He died.

495
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:06,762
He became a pilot
and crashed during a drill.

496
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,201
He was punished.

497
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,206
And the other student you mentioned -

498
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,973
His name was Okada.

499
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,145
I thought you knew this.

500
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,913
He suffered from Hansen's disease.

501
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,559
He was sent to an island.

502
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,058
These things happen.

503
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,863
Hansen's disease?

504
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,903
Such lovely flowers!

505
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,802
This paper's lovely too.

506
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:52,038
Sulfate paper.
It's the rage, too.

507
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,121
Rain again.

508
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,963
Dad.

509
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,901
What are you looking at?

510
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:22,081
Mountains?

511
00:51:25,759 --> 00:51:26,885
Trees?

512
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:31,921
The sky?

513
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:39,271
Or the rain?

514
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:46,935
Dad.

515
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:53,476
What about the heart?

516
00:51:55,922 --> 00:51:57,287
The heart?

517
00:51:57,524 --> 00:52:00,152
Can you see a human heart?

518
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,520
Smile.

519
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:10,329
Smile more, Sada.

520
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,238
I can see it.

521
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:23,306
Your heart is smiling.
Sada's heart is smiling.

522
00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:27,651
Dad.

523
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:29,581
Listen.

524
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:32,384
When you smile,

525
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,726
mountains, trees,

526
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:39,127
the sky, the rain -

527
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,091
everything smiles too.

528
00:52:45,005 --> 00:52:47,906
That's a human heart.

529
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:00,951
Dad.

530
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:16,929
Why did you buy them?

531
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:24,941
You're no ordinary woman.

532
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:27,207
Sir.

533
00:53:28,214 --> 00:53:29,772
Will you do me a favor?

534
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:35,020
Money? I'll give you some now,
then more at year-end.

535
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,715
Learn the trade
and open a restaurant.

536
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:39,620
That's not it.

537
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:41,690
Then what?

538
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,057
I must return to the conference.

539
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,064
Find a man who's in isolation
for Hansen's disease.

540
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:56,502
You can do it.

541
00:53:56,743 --> 00:54:00,873
I know what your conference is for.
I know all about you.

542
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:03,914
You can do anything.

543
00:54:05,218 --> 00:54:07,550
Listen, Sada.

544
00:54:08,755 --> 00:54:10,245
I'm a school principal.

545
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:14,288
I'll be finished
if we're seen together.

546
00:54:14,928 --> 00:54:20,423
I can't walk on the street
with you openly.

547
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:24,529
My fate depends on you.

548
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:26,297
Then find him.

549
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,642
Okada. A medical student.
I met him in 1 91 9.

550
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,278
His aunt is the proprietress
of an inn.

551
00:54:33,446 --> 00:54:35,539
That's all. Look for him.

552
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:37,478
A student named Okada?

553
00:54:38,418 --> 00:54:40,978
I must see him at any cost.

554
00:54:44,758 --> 00:54:46,419
If you promise,

555
00:54:46,593 --> 00:54:50,120
I'll work at the restaurant
you recommended.

556
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,131
I'll leave this life
and run a small restaurant.

557
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:57,827
I'll do whatever it takes to learn
the trade, even washing dishes.

558
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:04,905
But Hansen's disease is a secret.

559
00:55:05,078 --> 00:55:09,572
I can't do it.
That's why I'm asking you.

560
00:55:09,749 --> 00:55:13,116
All right. I'll do what I can.

561
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,917
You sure are a nice person.

562
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:22,252
I love you!

563
00:55:23,062 --> 00:55:25,030
That's enough.

564
00:55:25,665 --> 00:55:27,155
All right.

565
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:31,636
We'll stay in contact
through this place.

566
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:35,738
I'll ask the madam.

567
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,236
Keep quiet till I'm elected.

568
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,672
I'll make it.

569
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:44,616
I know.

570
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:48,510
Mr. Tachibana.

571
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:52,181
See you again.

572
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,905
Here comes the fateful man -

573
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,744
Tatsuzo Kikumoto.

574
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,283
February 1 916.

575
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:23,980
It was three months
before it happened.

576
00:56:24,157 --> 00:56:27,126
She was 11 and at her best.

577
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:33,121
ada is walking along the street

578
00:56:35,134 --> 00:56:39,594
Passersby turn to look at her

579
00:56:42,008 --> 00:56:47,878
But ada keeps on walking

580
00:56:48,815 --> 00:56:50,442
Hello?

581
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:06,187
Did you dream ofher

582
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:13,738
Then you don't love her enough

583
00:57:13,907 --> 00:57:21,211
If you really fall for her

584
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:27,283
You can't sleep at night

585
00:57:35,795 --> 00:57:37,194
What are you doing?

586
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:41,725
Come in.

587
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:13,091
Hey!

588
00:58:16,102 --> 00:58:17,160
I'm Sada.

589
00:58:18,304 --> 00:58:20,864
There's a Sada here.
See to her.

590
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:57,372
I'm here to work as an apprentice.

591
00:58:57,543 --> 00:58:59,204
My name is -

592
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:00,903
I know already.

593
00:59:02,448 --> 00:59:05,246
Who was that gentleman?

594
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:09,350
He owns this place.

595
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:13,083
He's my husband, Tatsuzo.

596
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:14,891
Be careful.

597
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:17,386
He's fast with women.

598
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:22,962
Shinkichi!

599
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,503
Help her.

600
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:48,856
FEBRUARY 1 2

601
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:17,979
Will this do?

602
01:00:20,593 --> 01:00:21,992
Not yet.

603
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:24,423
Ass!

604
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:27,765
How can you polish a square dish
with circular motions?

605
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:29,731
Use square strokes.

606
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,169
You have nice, lovely hands.

607
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:43,112
You've never worked
in a kitchen, have you?

608
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:52,880
Here she comes.

609
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:07,797
How is she?

610
01:01:10,643 --> 01:01:12,008
She's doing all right.

611
01:01:12,178 --> 01:01:13,577
She is?

612
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:18,380
We never let a woman
touch finished food before.

613
01:01:19,819 --> 01:01:23,277
It's Mr. Tachibana's wish.

614
01:01:23,456 --> 01:01:25,515
Mr. Tachibana?

615
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:27,952
Sada, how old is he?

616
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:32,792
He's tough, isn't he?
I admire him.

617
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:36,560
My kids will come home
from school soon.

618
01:01:36,769 --> 01:01:38,703
Give them a snack.

619
01:01:39,672 --> 01:01:40,639
All right?

620
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,318
She's jealous.

621
01:01:54,554 --> 01:01:57,717
Who wouldn't be, with you here?

622
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,448
Come now.

623
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:01,359
I can tell.

624
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:09,728
By the way,
what do you think of the master?

625
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:14,533
I already have someone to love.

626
01:02:15,575 --> 01:02:19,102
Someone beside Tachibana?

627
01:02:19,979 --> 01:02:23,710
Tachibana's your patron then?

628
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:26,313
I must be careful.

629
01:02:33,392 --> 01:02:42,164
Did you dream ofher

630
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:48,766
Then you don't love her enough

631
01:02:51,244 --> 01:02:52,472
Not bad.

632
01:02:53,412 --> 01:02:59,442
If you really fall for her

633
01:03:01,554 --> 01:03:05,490
You can't sleep at night

634
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:20,600
Good at this, eh?

635
01:03:20,773 --> 01:03:23,537
No. I'm not used to it yet.

636
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:26,368
But I'm trying.

637
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:28,673
That's good.

638
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,679
''Upright and steadfast,'' eh?

639
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:33,012
Oh, Shinkichi.

640
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:37,314
The next party starts at 8:00 sharp.
Okay?

641
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:03,709
What was the situation from the time
the accused began working for Kikumoto

642
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:06,408
until she became involved
with Tatsuzo?

643
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:12,522
When I first met Tatsuzo,

644
01:04:12,992 --> 01:04:16,553
he looked very nice.
I liked him.

645
01:04:16,962 --> 01:04:19,522
But I didn't show it.

646
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:23,692
About 1 0 days later,

647
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:26,767
he began to tap me on the neck

648
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:32,204
and stand in my way
in the kitchen or hallway.

649
01:04:32,645 --> 01:04:35,205
I thought he liked me.

650
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:38,875
till, maybe he was just teasing me.

651
01:04:56,235 --> 01:05:00,001
Let's see what happens.

652
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:11,377
FEBRUARY 28

653
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:39,905
MARCH 1 7

654
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:05,931
APRI L 1 9

655
01:06:22,822 --> 01:06:28,692
Even after I started working there,
I never forgot Tachibana.

656
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:31,826
I expected a bright future.

657
01:06:32,331 --> 01:06:36,768
One night I was writing to him

658
01:06:36,936 --> 01:06:38,699
when Tatsuzo came in.

659
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:49,412
''I wish I knew what happened
regarding what I asked you about.''

660
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,461
You're writing to Tachibana, eh?

661
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,803
Damn him!

662
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:40,549
The light's still on.

663
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:49,990
We made love for the first time there.

664
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:53,258
We did it,

665
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:55,330
but it was no fun.

666
01:09:59,371 --> 01:10:01,999
Everyone knew about your affair,

667
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:05,741
so you two decided to stay at an inn?

668
01:10:06,211 --> 01:10:10,580
Mr. Tachibana phoned me
the morning of April 23.

669
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:14,014
I took leave and went to see him.

670
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:23,187
APRI L 21

671
01:10:26,799 --> 01:10:27,697
Listen.

672
01:10:29,635 --> 01:10:30,829
About Okada -

673
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,134
''February 26 Coup d'Etat''

674
01:10:37,342 --> 01:10:39,003
Answer my question!

675
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:43,777
I don't like your attitude.

676
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:47,749
Some young military officers
rose up on February 26.

677
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,354
It shocked the whole nation.

678
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:53,447
You should take more interest
in current events.

679
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:58,858
I don't understand anything
about such affairs.

680
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:01,559
I understand only Okada.

681
01:11:01,734 --> 01:11:04,134
He misses me. I must see him.

682
01:11:15,047 --> 01:11:19,609
He's in an asylum
in Okayama Prefecture.

683
01:11:19,785 --> 01:11:21,446
Where is it?

684
01:11:22,454 --> 01:11:23,580
On an island.

685
01:11:25,858 --> 01:11:27,951
Is he well?

686
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:31,323
I don't know.

687
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:33,328
What do you mean?

688
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:34,932
About Hansen's disease -

689
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,091
I asked about him, not the disease.

690
01:11:37,269 --> 01:11:42,229
Understand about the disease first,
or I won't tell you anything.

691
01:11:43,308 --> 01:11:44,400
The cause is unknown.

692
01:11:46,145 --> 01:11:50,514
Hansen's disease
is considered hopeless.

693
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:52,646
It's incurable.

694
01:11:54,553 --> 01:11:59,217
The patients are isolated
from their families.

695
01:11:59,725 --> 01:12:03,320
Nothing is reported about them.

696
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:07,687
Then I can't see him if I go?

697
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,394
No, you can't.

698
01:12:10,235 --> 01:12:12,635
He won't see you either.

699
01:12:14,173 --> 01:12:15,640
It's too much.

700
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:20,040
Nevertheless,
that's how today's Japan is.

701
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:23,510
Then I can understand those officers.

702
01:12:23,682 --> 01:12:25,775
They tried to improveJapan!

703
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:27,680
Not so loud.

704
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:34,221
When someone plots something,
he first needs the world's help.

705
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:36,455
It's not easy.

706
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:38,227
Definitely not.

707
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:39,329
It's sad.

708
01:12:39,498 --> 01:12:40,795
That's life.

709
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:52,844
Why aren't we meeting
at the usual inn?

710
01:12:55,514 --> 01:12:58,915
I hate this place.

711
01:13:00,219 --> 01:13:03,382
I must leave soon.

712
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:07,691
I brought your favorite food.

713
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:21,001
Physical love has only secondary meaning
between a man and woman.

714
01:13:21,173 --> 01:13:24,904
A close rapport should come first.

715
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:28,675
Just someone holding your hand
seems to excite you.

716
01:13:28,847 --> 01:13:30,508
You're easily aroused.

717
01:13:30,682 --> 01:13:34,379
When you're with a man,
you must control yourself.

718
01:13:35,721 --> 01:13:36,847
Good-bye.

719
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:57,305
I found his theories boring,

720
01:13:57,476 --> 01:14:01,776
but at the same time
I regarded him as a great person.

721
01:14:02,915 --> 01:14:06,976
ada is telling us her story

722
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:12,719
It surprises people greatly

723
01:14:14,226 --> 01:14:19,129
he never stoops along the way

724
01:14:19,298 --> 01:14:21,289
Why is this, Okada?

725
01:14:22,567 --> 01:14:24,933
I can't remember your face.

726
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,760
It hurts.

727
01:14:56,768 --> 01:14:59,464
It pains my body, but -

728
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:11,314
I walked on the beach alone.

729
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:16,782
Tatsuzo gave me a note
as I was going out.

730
01:15:16,955 --> 01:15:20,948
I went to the inn
he mentioned in his note.

731
01:15:32,804 --> 01:15:35,466
''See you at Yoshinoya Inn''

732
01:16:11,143 --> 01:16:13,907
So you came.

733
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:16,604
I knew you'd come.
Come in.

734
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,050
Wasn't it cold?

735
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:21,713
Sit over here.

736
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,286
Though I must say,

737
01:16:24,656 --> 01:16:27,853
when you're standing,
I can look at your cute butt.

738
01:16:32,964 --> 01:16:34,591
Give me some sake too.

739
01:16:34,766 --> 01:16:37,064
Sure. You drink?

740
01:16:39,071 --> 01:16:40,629
You believe in omens?

741
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,598
Omens?

742
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:45,470
Drink up. I'll get more.

743
01:16:50,048 --> 01:16:51,447
Why?

744
01:16:51,616 --> 01:16:52,981
Omens?

745
01:16:53,452 --> 01:16:56,080
I like to believe in omens.

746
01:16:56,655 --> 01:17:00,853
Like: ''She who drinks with me
will never leave me.''

747
01:17:01,693 --> 01:17:06,494
There are hundreds
of restaurants in Tokyo,

748
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:11,459
and lots of women
are training in them.

749
01:17:11,636 --> 01:17:13,069
I know.

750
01:17:13,305 --> 01:17:17,036
You chose mine.
That in itself was destiny.

751
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:19,172
Is that what you meant?

752
01:17:19,344 --> 01:17:20,470
Yes.

753
01:17:20,812 --> 01:17:23,975
- You're smarter than you look.
- My mind isn't my only strong point.

754
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:25,741
You really speak your mind!

755
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:29,420
What happened?

756
01:17:52,644 --> 01:17:54,202
We're getting drunk.

757
01:17:55,814 --> 01:18:00,751
Want to go to bed
before we're too drunk?

758
01:18:01,353 --> 01:18:04,481
Is that what you wanted after all?

759
01:18:04,656 --> 01:18:07,284
What are you saying?

760
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:13,291
What else would a married man
like me want from you?

761
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:16,333
We could enjoy talking

762
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:19,595
and then just say good-bye.

763
01:18:19,771 --> 01:18:21,170
Talk?

764
01:18:21,339 --> 01:18:24,797
About that coup d'etat
or things like that.

765
01:18:25,644 --> 01:18:27,612
Don't try to sober me up.

766
01:18:28,346 --> 01:18:30,041
You care about that?

767
01:18:30,215 --> 01:18:33,946
It's big news, isn't it?

768
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,084
That's enough.

769
01:18:36,988 --> 01:18:39,456
As I told you -

770
01:18:40,358 --> 01:18:43,521
You know, right? I'm -

771
01:18:44,996 --> 01:18:46,827
I know.

772
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:50,462
You're married and have children.

773
01:18:50,936 --> 01:18:54,599
You can't spend money endlessly,

774
01:18:55,006 --> 01:18:57,668
even if you own a restaurant.

775
01:18:58,476 --> 01:19:02,674
Can you pay for this place?

776
01:19:03,848 --> 01:19:07,443
You're mean when you're drunk.

777
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:09,246
What if I am?

778
01:19:10,255 --> 01:19:14,692
Can you drop me just like that?

779
01:19:19,164 --> 01:19:22,031
I can, and I will.

780
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:24,331
I'll drop you.

781
01:19:24,502 --> 01:19:25,901
Thank you.

782
01:19:33,712 --> 01:19:34,940
What's this?

783
01:19:35,213 --> 01:19:36,145
Give me that.

784
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:39,412
What is it? Show me.

785
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:40,710
No.

786
01:19:48,727 --> 01:19:50,194
Master.

787
01:19:53,398 --> 01:19:55,457
Don't call me that.

788
01:19:58,203 --> 01:20:01,798
I've liked you since I first met you.

789
01:20:03,108 --> 01:20:06,441
I like you too.

790
01:20:06,945 --> 01:20:10,176
We'll hold a wedding today.

791
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,483
We'll call geishas.

792
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:17,586
I'm glad. It sounds like fun.

793
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:43,873
That night we made love
over and over again.

794
01:21:47,645 --> 01:21:52,844
That night I could relax
for the first time in a long time.

795
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,078
Before I realized it,

796
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:01,190
I found that my body
couldn't do without a man.

797
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,787
How many men had I known?
They were countless.

798
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:09,365
They had left me craving
a man's body.

799
01:22:10,168 --> 01:22:14,764
Among the many
I had affairs with,

800
01:22:15,006 --> 01:22:18,840
Tatsuzo was the best
in a sexual sense.

801
01:22:19,244 --> 01:22:22,042
Even when dozing off,

802
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:25,808
he gently stroked my body all over.

803
01:22:26,184 --> 01:22:28,414
For the first time,

804
01:22:28,586 --> 01:22:33,046
I had met a man who could
care for me and really excite me.

805
01:22:33,258 --> 01:22:37,490
I loved him and didn't want
to be apart from him.

806
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:40,798
But without money,
what could we do?

807
01:22:43,902 --> 01:22:45,836
More, please.

808
01:22:51,709 --> 01:22:52,698
Sada.

809
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:03,085
Okada...

810
01:23:15,733 --> 01:23:18,600
You know how many men ada has had?

811
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:20,135
No need to be mean.

812
01:23:20,305 --> 01:23:21,203
APRI L 2 4

813
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:23,533
How dare you talk like that?

814
01:23:24,209 --> 01:23:27,508
I've been patient
as a favor to Mr. Tachibana,

815
01:23:27,879 --> 01:23:30,211
but I'll fire that bitch.!

816
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:32,406
Give that to me.!

817
01:23:33,284 --> 01:23:38,483
Are you plotting to take over
by sleeping with the master?

818
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:43,190
If I were, wouldn't it be better
to go after you?

819
01:23:44,762 --> 01:23:47,925
What a thing to say!

820
01:23:53,004 --> 01:23:55,131
You're terrible.

821
01:24:04,349 --> 01:24:07,045
You heard us, eh?

822
01:24:09,454 --> 01:24:15,324
Why did you seduce my husband?
You're just kitchen help!

823
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:18,862
Can't the kitchen help
sleep with men?

824
01:24:19,564 --> 01:24:22,328
He started all this.

825
01:24:23,134 --> 01:24:25,762
Perhaps if his wife
were more attractive -

826
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:28,201
What? Bitch!

827
01:24:29,407 --> 01:24:30,499
Stop that!

828
01:24:31,242 --> 01:24:34,234
You started it, you villain!

829
01:24:34,913 --> 01:24:36,107
Nonsense!

830
01:24:41,152 --> 01:24:45,020
What's the difference who started it?

831
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:47,883
Was he that good?

832
01:24:48,426 --> 01:24:51,918
He was great!
And he said I was better than you.

833
01:25:40,478 --> 01:25:42,070
Shall I call the police?

834
01:25:42,246 --> 01:25:43,474
Idiot!

835
01:25:57,061 --> 01:26:00,462
What did you think of Yoshi,
the madam?

836
01:26:14,145 --> 01:26:19,082
I thought she was a fool
for bad-mouthing her husband.

837
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:29,059
What a mess!

838
01:26:47,111 --> 01:26:49,511
Sada, wait!

839
01:26:51,382 --> 01:26:52,508
Are you hurt?

840
01:26:52,717 --> 01:26:56,915
No. It's nothing,
compared to the other pain.

841
01:26:57,455 --> 01:27:00,117
What do you mean, the other pain?

842
01:27:00,858 --> 01:27:02,689
Men wouldn't know.

843
01:27:03,361 --> 01:27:06,159
Were you kicked out, too?

844
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,099
I was just an heiress's husband.

845
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:15,831
They say, ''Never marry an heiress.''

846
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:18,532
Don't make fun of me.

847
01:27:19,544 --> 01:27:20,909
What'll you do now?

848
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:24,810
I have no idea.
What about you?

849
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:29,014
''My sorrow is stained.

850
01:27:29,554 --> 01:27:33,149
What do I want?
What can I wish for?''

851
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:35,188
What's that?

852
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:36,587
A poem.

853
01:27:37,228 --> 01:27:40,026
Ayoung man wrote that sad poem.

854
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:45,067
''Stained sorrow...

855
01:27:46,003 --> 01:27:48,062
dreams of death in lassitude.''

856
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:49,433
''Lassitude''?

857
01:27:49,607 --> 01:27:50,505
Yes.

858
01:27:52,243 --> 01:27:53,710
It means feeling tired and dull.

859
01:27:53,878 --> 01:27:56,346
So you want to die?

860
01:28:01,786 --> 01:28:04,152
No, it's just a poem.

861
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:06,380
I'm all right.

862
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:10,588
Let's go to that inn again.

863
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:14,389
While you were fighting with Yoshi,

864
01:28:15,299 --> 01:28:17,927
I stole some money.

865
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:53,869
I wish you happiness.

866
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:01,738
Doughnuts, please.

867
01:29:06,284 --> 01:29:09,515
How come you like that stuff?

868
01:29:19,197 --> 01:29:20,687
Thank you.

869
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:07,371
Hey, Sada.

870
01:30:09,881 --> 01:30:11,075
Yes?

871
01:30:12,216 --> 01:30:13,979
Why not toss those doughnuts?

872
01:30:15,853 --> 01:30:16,751
Toss them?

873
01:30:17,455 --> 01:30:18,854
Look.

874
01:30:19,857 --> 01:30:21,882
I'll catch them.

875
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:26,722
Idiot!

876
01:30:32,003 --> 01:30:35,268
You see? I'm still young, eh?

877
01:30:41,012 --> 01:30:44,504
One, then two

878
01:30:44,849 --> 01:30:48,410
Two, then three

879
01:30:48,853 --> 01:30:52,289
Then four

880
01:30:52,857 --> 01:30:56,884
Then five

881
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:03,863
Then finally six

882
01:31:05,403 --> 01:31:06,927
What's that song?

883
01:31:08,539 --> 01:31:10,166
It was years ago.

884
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:14,075
Maybe I sang it when I was a child.

885
01:31:16,314 --> 01:31:17,440
It's coming back to you now?

886
01:31:17,615 --> 01:31:19,139
No.

887
01:31:20,418 --> 01:31:22,477
Now is like the past.

888
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:29,526
How many did you count

889
01:31:30,261 --> 01:31:33,822
How many and how many

890
01:31:35,466 --> 01:31:39,334
Count many numbers

891
01:31:41,839 --> 01:31:45,605
They can bring tomorrow

892
01:31:48,412 --> 01:31:53,179
They can bring back yesterday

893
01:31:54,919 --> 01:31:56,147
That picture.

894
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,255
I've seen it somewhere.

895
01:32:01,325 --> 01:32:02,314
It's by Yumeji.

896
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:05,987
He drew it.

897
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,863
Whether a poem or a painting,

898
01:32:12,603 --> 01:32:15,163
I envy those who leave behind
something important.

899
01:32:17,308 --> 01:32:18,935
I, on the other hand,

900
01:32:20,611 --> 01:32:23,205
spend my life in vain.

901
01:32:24,482 --> 01:32:25,949
As for me,

902
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:30,751
I'm beginning to find something
to live for.

903
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:48,997
What's Okada to you?

904
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:55,870
You called me Okada the other day.

905
01:32:57,214 --> 01:32:59,011
You said his name.

906
01:32:59,884 --> 01:33:01,181
I did?

907
01:33:03,587 --> 01:33:05,145
Who is he?

908
01:33:09,226 --> 01:33:12,252
He may not be you...

909
01:33:13,731 --> 01:33:15,631
or he may be you.

910
01:33:22,606 --> 01:33:24,870
What can it be?

911
01:33:26,243 --> 01:33:28,575
I mean, a man's name.

912
01:33:30,548 --> 01:33:33,574
What did you do
while you were with Tatsuzo?

913
01:33:33,951 --> 01:33:39,082
For two weeks,
from April 2 4 to May 7,

914
01:33:39,256 --> 01:33:42,054
we moved from inn to inn.

915
01:33:42,693 --> 01:33:45,161
Normally people would get
tired of each other,

916
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:51,561
but I actually grew
more and more fond of him.

917
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:56,466
He went back to Yoshi to get money.

918
01:33:56,807 --> 01:33:59,799
I was left alone for three days.

919
01:34:00,478 --> 01:34:02,844
I was sojealous and impatient.

920
01:34:03,614 --> 01:34:08,813
That was the hardest time of my life.

921
01:34:20,164 --> 01:34:25,192
MAY 8

922
01:36:13,777 --> 01:36:18,942
MAY 9

923
01:36:46,477 --> 01:36:48,172
MAY 1 0

924
01:36:48,345 --> 01:36:55,148
One, then two

925
01:37:00,491 --> 01:37:05,588
Two, then three

926
01:37:12,102 --> 01:37:16,505
Then four

927
01:37:22,579 --> 01:37:27,039
Then five

928
01:37:30,688 --> 01:37:36,524
Then finally six

929
01:38:05,289 --> 01:38:10,659
Those three days seemed
like a month to me.

930
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:24,501
MAY 1 1

931
01:38:24,742 --> 01:38:26,004
Did you miss me?

932
01:38:27,911 --> 01:38:29,139
Yes.

933
01:38:30,748 --> 01:38:32,443
Did you miss me too?

934
01:38:35,185 --> 01:38:36,846
Yeah, but it was a rough time.

935
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:40,183
A horse went wild.

936
01:38:40,357 --> 01:38:42,416
It kicked a girl.

937
01:38:44,261 --> 01:38:46,058
I hope she's all right.

938
01:38:47,231 --> 01:38:49,290
Was that the ''rough time''?

939
01:38:50,801 --> 01:38:53,065
No, that wasn't all.

940
01:38:56,874 --> 01:38:59,604
Are you angry?

941
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,142
In a bad mood?

942
01:39:05,015 --> 01:39:07,176
I was upset too.

943
01:39:07,985 --> 01:39:12,115
You know Yoshi.
She was hard to convince.

944
01:39:12,356 --> 01:39:14,586
Did you lay her too?

945
01:39:20,097 --> 01:39:24,124
Did you let her feel you?

946
01:39:26,603 --> 01:39:29,970
What?
Why do you let that bother you?

947
01:39:32,176 --> 01:39:36,272
I know.
That's why she got jealous.

948
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,382
If we balanced our love on a scale,

949
01:39:40,551 --> 01:39:44,544
I loved Tatsuzo
more than he loved me.

950
01:39:45,556 --> 01:39:47,524
Hey, Tatsuzo!

951
01:39:55,499 --> 01:39:57,467
I'm mad at you.

952
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:05,706
I'll never let you go back
to your wife again.

953
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:11,142
If you do, I'll kill us both!

954
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:25,219
As a joke,
I bound his wrists with a sash.

955
01:40:25,696 --> 01:40:28,597
It made him happy.

956
01:40:28,765 --> 01:40:32,257
He tickled me with his bound hands.

957
01:40:32,436 --> 01:40:38,102
We hardly slept.
We made love till morning.

958
01:40:38,575 --> 01:40:39,837
Tatsuzo.

959
01:40:44,548 --> 01:40:49,110
He couldn't get money from his wife.

960
01:40:49,786 --> 01:40:54,780
I decided to ask Tachibana for some.

961
01:41:00,964 --> 01:41:04,593
I'm sorry to make you come so far.

962
01:41:04,935 --> 01:41:05,993
MAY 1 6

963
01:41:06,336 --> 01:41:09,169
I have work to do here anyway.

964
01:41:11,408 --> 01:41:13,035
You're looking well.

965
01:41:14,144 --> 01:41:19,104
That woman told me she fired you.
I was worried about you.

966
01:41:19,983 --> 01:41:22,884
I didn't know where you were.

967
01:41:23,053 --> 01:41:25,078
Are you here for another conference?

968
01:41:26,023 --> 01:41:27,012
No.

969
01:41:27,925 --> 01:41:30,792
I'll go to the usual inn with you.

970
01:41:31,995 --> 01:41:33,895
Then I'll go home.

971
01:41:34,064 --> 01:41:36,396
Welcome.

972
01:41:36,567 --> 01:41:37,591
Coffee, please.

973
01:41:37,768 --> 01:41:39,235
Is this your ''work''?

974
01:41:40,103 --> 01:41:42,765
A Calpis, please.

975
01:41:46,276 --> 01:41:47,834
It's raining.

976
01:41:49,846 --> 01:41:52,178
Let's take a trip together

977
01:41:53,784 --> 01:41:56,378
for a few days.

978
01:41:57,087 --> 01:42:00,181
We'll go to the Seto Inland Sea.

979
01:42:01,058 --> 01:42:04,255
We'll see the island
where that student is.

980
01:42:04,928 --> 01:42:07,863
We might get
some information on him.

981
01:42:10,133 --> 01:42:13,261
What's wrong?
You were so eager before.

982
01:42:14,871 --> 01:42:19,604
Don't bother about him anymore.

983
01:42:19,776 --> 01:42:22,973
If he doesn't see me or write to me,

984
01:42:23,146 --> 01:42:24,545
I feel as if

985
01:42:25,682 --> 01:42:30,415
he were here all the time.

986
01:42:35,959 --> 01:42:37,119
Please enjoy.

987
01:42:41,331 --> 01:42:46,860
I'm beginning to understand
the things you tell me.

988
01:42:47,938 --> 01:42:49,166
So please don't bother.

989
01:42:50,007 --> 01:42:51,133
I see.

990
01:42:52,409 --> 01:42:53,637
Then

991
01:42:54,077 --> 01:42:59,071
let's not go to that inn together.

992
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:02,177
That's better, eh?

993
01:43:04,021 --> 01:43:05,454
I'm sorry.

994
01:43:07,724 --> 01:43:11,160
Here's 200 yen for you.

995
01:43:12,663 --> 01:43:14,563
Keep in touch.

996
01:43:15,432 --> 01:43:17,423
I'll send more.

997
01:43:18,035 --> 01:43:21,630
Excuse me.
Would you have a match?

998
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,007
Thank you.

999
01:43:32,816 --> 01:43:36,684
Isn't a man waiting for you?

1000
01:43:38,588 --> 01:43:41,751
If you have a beau, tell me.

1001
01:43:42,826 --> 01:43:45,818
I'll inquire about him.

1002
01:43:45,996 --> 01:43:47,293
I'll sponsor your wedding.

1003
01:43:48,298 --> 01:43:53,031
I think of you as my kid sister.

1004
01:43:53,203 --> 01:43:55,364
I'll take care of you even if I die.

1005
01:43:55,972 --> 01:44:00,102
It's as if you belonged
to another world.

1006
01:44:17,461 --> 01:44:20,225
I missed Tatsuzo so badly

1007
01:44:20,397 --> 01:44:23,730
and hurried back to him.

1008
01:44:25,969 --> 01:44:29,632
I'm lonely. So lonely.

1009
01:44:29,873 --> 01:44:33,070
What's wrong with you?

1010
01:44:34,377 --> 01:44:38,245
I'm very lonely somehow.

1011
01:44:38,782 --> 01:44:40,340
I'm here.

1012
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,016
Just like usual.

1013
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:46,116
It's odd, very odd.

1014
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:50,482
I've never been so lonely.

1015
01:44:53,897 --> 01:44:58,459
You won't go away.
You won't leave me, will you?

1016
01:44:59,069 --> 01:45:02,732
Why not tie me up so I can't leave?

1017
01:45:05,509 --> 01:45:08,171
I wish I were a sash myself.

1018
01:45:08,812 --> 01:45:11,679
I could tie you up with my body.

1019
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:21,050
Please strangle me.

1020
01:45:21,958 --> 01:45:26,418
Squeeze my throat.

1021
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:28,695
Strangle me.

1022
01:45:37,941 --> 01:45:38,999
Let's stop.

1023
01:45:42,579 --> 01:45:43,841
Let's stop.

1024
01:45:44,247 --> 01:45:45,874
I feel sorry for you.

1025
01:45:47,284 --> 01:45:50,742
Then I'll strangle you.

1026
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:54,553
I'll use this sash.

1027
01:45:54,724 --> 01:45:57,659
I'll stop you from breathing.

1028
01:45:57,828 --> 01:46:01,389
Stop it!
You're tickling me.

1029
01:46:04,935 --> 01:46:06,664
How can I make love like this?

1030
01:46:07,871 --> 01:46:08,963
Stop!

1031
01:46:09,139 --> 01:46:11,471
At first he enjoyed it.

1032
01:46:11,641 --> 01:46:14,735
He slapped his forehead
and made faces.

1033
01:46:14,911 --> 01:46:16,173
He was having fun.

1034
01:46:17,047 --> 01:46:20,073
When I squeezed his throat,

1035
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:22,980
his belly trembled nicely.

1036
01:46:23,153 --> 01:46:24,484
I told him so.

1037
01:46:24,654 --> 01:46:26,417
If you like it,

1038
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:31,620
I'll endure it,
even thought it hurts.

1039
01:46:31,795 --> 01:46:33,422
That's what he said.

1040
01:46:33,597 --> 01:46:38,557
I don't care what happens to my body.

1041
01:46:39,603 --> 01:46:40,831
He said that, too.

1042
01:46:49,246 --> 01:46:52,340
Hey, it's shrunk.

1043
01:46:56,586 --> 01:46:58,349
What happened?

1044
01:47:00,724 --> 01:47:02,715
My neck's hot.

1045
01:47:56,112 --> 01:47:59,081
Look what you did to me.

1046
01:48:02,652 --> 01:48:04,017
They're dead.

1047
01:48:07,123 --> 01:48:09,591
They got wet in the rain, huh?

1048
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,948
Human life is short.

1049
01:48:32,615 --> 01:48:36,051
How long can birds live?

1050
01:48:36,886 --> 01:48:41,084
How brief!.
They were alive just a while ago.

1051
01:48:42,459 --> 01:48:45,792
Everything dies someday.

1052
01:48:47,597 --> 01:48:49,462
I'm 42 already.

1053
01:48:50,633 --> 01:48:55,070
I've done almost everything
a man can do in his life.

1054
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,632
As for the rest,

1055
01:48:59,309 --> 01:49:03,302
my assets are mortgaged.

1056
01:49:04,914 --> 01:49:06,814
It'll take a while,

1057
01:49:07,784 --> 01:49:10,252
but I'll help you open a restaurant.

1058
01:49:11,087 --> 01:49:13,920
Not a bad way
to spend the rest of my life.

1059
01:49:14,691 --> 01:49:18,593
I'm glad, but I'm sad, too.

1060
01:49:19,496 --> 01:49:22,056
- I suppose.
- If-

1061
01:49:24,901 --> 01:49:26,027
If-

1062
01:49:26,202 --> 01:49:27,362
Don't say that.

1063
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:33,170
There are no ''ifs'' in life.

1064
01:49:35,011 --> 01:49:39,641
To live, you must stop saying ''if.''

1065
01:49:40,383 --> 01:49:42,180
Really?

1066
01:49:42,952 --> 01:49:44,385
Absolutely.

1067
01:49:45,188 --> 01:49:48,316
Let's drop this gloomy subject.

1068
01:49:49,159 --> 01:49:51,184
There may be no ''ifs,''

1069
01:49:51,361 --> 01:49:54,922
but you're here, and that's for sure.

1070
01:49:57,634 --> 01:49:59,568
Let's go to bed.

1071
01:50:00,837 --> 01:50:03,135
Let's do it again.

1072
01:50:04,607 --> 01:50:06,438
Staying with you,

1073
01:50:07,644 --> 01:50:09,475
I'll end up a skeleton.

1074
01:50:15,218 --> 01:50:17,049
On the 1 7th,

1075
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:20,189
you strangled Tatsuzo to death
in his sleep.

1076
01:50:20,356 --> 01:50:21,846
Tell us how it happened.

1077
01:50:22,425 --> 01:50:23,858
He kept saying

1078
01:50:24,661 --> 01:50:27,926
that he was sleepy.

1079
01:50:29,566 --> 01:50:32,296
As I watched him sleep,

1080
01:50:32,469 --> 01:50:34,596
MAY 1 7

1081
01:50:34,771 --> 01:50:36,204
he opened his eyes

1082
01:50:37,006 --> 01:50:39,497
and was glad to see me.

1083
01:50:39,676 --> 01:50:41,143
Listen.

1084
01:50:42,745 --> 01:50:44,645
After I fall asleep,

1085
01:50:45,949 --> 01:50:47,883
I'll bet you strangle me again.

1086
01:50:48,418 --> 01:50:50,010
He said so.

1087
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,512
Then I said -

1088
01:50:54,824 --> 01:50:56,052
Yes.

1089
01:50:56,793 --> 01:50:58,351
I said so, laughing.

1090
01:50:58,528 --> 01:51:00,393
When you strangle me,

1091
01:51:02,098 --> 01:51:04,532
don't loosen your hands.

1092
01:51:06,469 --> 01:51:09,097
Otherwise it will hurt afterwards.

1093
01:51:09,772 --> 01:51:11,262
That time,

1094
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:15,275
I wondered
if he wanted me to kill him.

1095
01:51:15,445 --> 01:51:16,935
I thought so.

1096
01:51:17,113 --> 01:51:18,740
But soon afterward,

1097
01:51:18,915 --> 01:51:22,112
I thought he was onlyjoking.

1098
01:51:23,286 --> 01:51:26,653
Before long, he fell asleep.

1099
01:51:26,823 --> 01:51:32,659
I reached with my right hand
and grabbed a pink sash.

1100
01:51:32,829 --> 01:51:36,822
I slid the end under his neck
and wound it twice.

1101
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,230
I gripped both ends

1102
01:51:40,603 --> 01:51:43,299
and slowly strangled him.

1103
01:51:43,473 --> 01:51:46,101
Tatsuzo opened his eyes.

1104
01:51:49,179 --> 01:51:52,580
aying that, he tried to hug me.

1105
01:51:52,749 --> 01:51:57,982
I pressed my head

1106
01:51:59,289 --> 01:52:01,519
to Tatsuzo's chest.

1107
01:52:06,796 --> 01:52:09,264
Forgive me!

1108
01:52:13,136 --> 01:52:14,433
I cried.

1109
01:52:16,072 --> 01:52:21,942
I pulled on the sash
as hard as I could.

1110
01:53:18,334 --> 01:53:21,997
Then I went downstairs
and looked around.

1111
01:53:23,206 --> 01:53:25,606
I saw a clock in the office.

1112
01:53:26,409 --> 01:53:29,674
It was a little past 2:00 a.m.

1113
01:53:45,495 --> 01:53:49,192
Why did you slice off his penis?

1114
01:53:49,365 --> 01:53:51,356
I thought if I carried it with me,

1115
01:53:51,901 --> 01:53:54,369
he would always be with me,

1116
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:58,636
and I wouldn't feel lonely.

1117
01:54:46,356 --> 01:54:49,621
Why did you carve
your name into his flesh?

1118
01:54:49,792 --> 01:54:53,785
I wanted him to carry me
with him forever.

1119
01:54:53,963 --> 01:54:55,988
So I carved my name.

1120
01:54:56,165 --> 01:54:59,100
What did you do with his penis?

1121
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:02,396
It was a keepsake he left me.

1122
01:55:02,972 --> 01:55:06,373
I wrapped it in special paper

1123
01:55:06,709 --> 01:55:09,109
and tucked it under my waistband.

1124
01:55:09,278 --> 01:55:11,769
What about the weapon?

1125
01:55:12,682 --> 01:55:17,085
I put it in my bag
and carried it with me.

1126
01:55:18,654 --> 01:55:24,524
It was a gift from someone special.

1127
01:55:32,568 --> 01:55:37,733
MAY 1 8

1128
01:56:06,769 --> 01:56:09,567
I'm going out for a while.

1129
01:56:09,739 --> 01:56:14,176
He's sleeping.
Don't wake him till noon.

1130
01:56:33,362 --> 01:56:35,091
If it isn't Sada!

1131
01:56:36,432 --> 01:56:37,865
Such a long time.

1132
01:56:38,134 --> 01:56:40,967
What a surprise!
You, in Tokyo?

1133
01:56:42,338 --> 01:56:43,862
What's up?

1134
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:46,299
You look happy.

1135
01:56:46,909 --> 01:56:48,809
Has something good happened?

1136
01:56:50,713 --> 01:56:56,481
I feel as if something heavy
that had been here a long time

1137
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:00,816
suddenly disappeared.

1138
01:57:00,990 --> 01:57:02,321
Is that so?

1139
01:57:03,693 --> 01:57:06,856
I heard your father died.

1140
01:57:07,964 --> 01:57:10,125
I didn't make it to his funeral.

1141
01:57:10,833 --> 01:57:13,597
Eighty-two? A nice long life.

1142
01:57:16,405 --> 01:57:18,669
A lot happens in this life, eh?

1143
01:57:20,243 --> 01:57:21,767
Where are you going?

1144
01:57:26,616 --> 01:57:27,640
Never mind.

1145
01:57:27,884 --> 01:57:31,342
We'll meet again.
Good-bye.

1146
01:57:31,921 --> 01:57:35,322
Good-bye. Take care.

1147
01:57:36,559 --> 01:57:38,026
Thank you.

1148
01:57:38,494 --> 01:57:39,927
Same to you.

1149
01:58:47,163 --> 01:58:48,858
What's this?

1150
01:58:49,665 --> 01:58:51,394
What happened?

1151
01:58:51,567 --> 01:58:54,559
His member has been cut off.

1152
01:58:59,275 --> 01:59:01,766
Cut off with a knife, perhaps.

1153
01:59:02,712 --> 01:59:04,304
A murder case?

1154
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:06,675
- I'm not sure yet!
- Double suicide?

1155
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:09,642
I wonder.

1156
01:59:10,553 --> 01:59:15,183
I've been a cop a long time,
but I've never seen anything like this.

1157
01:59:15,925 --> 01:59:19,019
Let's look for this woman Sada.

1158
01:59:19,729 --> 01:59:23,096
What were you doing
before your arrest?

1159
01:59:23,566 --> 01:59:28,230
That day,
I strolled along the riverbank.

1160
01:59:28,437 --> 01:59:30,462
Then I went to Asakusa

1161
01:59:31,273 --> 01:59:34,970
and saw a historical drama
at the movies.

1162
01:59:39,682 --> 01:59:42,617
Didn't you plan to run away?

1163
01:59:48,391 --> 01:59:51,827
Tatsuzo was dead, so I must die.

1164
01:59:51,994 --> 01:59:53,723
I thought so vaguely.

1165
01:59:54,296 --> 01:59:57,163
Besides, it started to rain,

1166
01:59:57,333 --> 02:00:00,791
so I didn't run away
but just wandered around town.

1167
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:04,598
I sat on a park bench, thinking.

1168
02:00:04,774 --> 02:00:09,677
Then I decided
to meet Tachibana at his inn.

1169
02:00:09,845 --> 02:00:12,905
He happened to be in Tokyo.

1170
02:00:14,717 --> 02:00:18,676
Where are you going in this rain?

1171
02:00:20,556 --> 02:00:23,491
I can't just stay and get wet.

1172
02:00:32,535 --> 02:00:33,559
He said-

1173
02:00:33,736 --> 02:00:36,728
Then why not come here?

1174
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:42,343
I insisted on going
somewhere we'd never been.

1175
02:00:42,511 --> 02:00:45,674
We took a taxi towards Otsuka

1176
02:00:45,848 --> 02:00:49,284
and took a room at an inn.

1177
02:00:49,452 --> 02:00:53,218
I didn't tell him
that I'd killed Tatsuzo.

1178
02:00:53,389 --> 02:00:54,651
I was very vague.

1179
02:00:54,824 --> 02:00:58,089
Whatever may happen,

1180
02:00:59,462 --> 02:01:02,920
just think that you bought a whore.

1181
02:01:04,133 --> 02:01:05,862
You paid me.

1182
02:01:06,035 --> 02:01:08,469
I kept repeating things like that.

1183
02:01:08,637 --> 02:01:11,834
I knew how he felt at that time.

1184
02:01:12,007 --> 02:01:13,531
Let's go to bed.

1185
02:01:14,543 --> 02:01:17,410
I slept with him merely out of duty.

1186
02:01:22,551 --> 02:01:28,421
This has a secondary meaning
for you, right?

1187
02:01:31,427 --> 02:01:33,019
I hate to say this,

1188
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:37,331
but you sort of stink.

1189
02:01:40,503 --> 02:01:45,634
MAY 1 9

1190
02:01:46,142 --> 02:01:48,372
Then we parted.

1191
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:52,036
I moved to another inn by myself.

1192
02:01:52,515 --> 02:01:56,952
Although I tried
to kill myself there,

1193
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:01,715
the transom was
too low to hang myself.

1194
02:02:01,891 --> 02:02:04,155
I couldn't die.

1195
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:11,695
So I wrote to Tachibana and Tatsuzo,
who was already dead.

1196
02:02:13,536 --> 02:02:16,562
''You whom I loved most have died.

1197
02:02:17,072 --> 02:02:19,438
You became mine.

1198
02:02:20,376 --> 02:02:22,173
I will join you.

1199
02:02:22,845 --> 02:02:24,779
You are mine.

1200
02:02:25,815 --> 02:02:27,180
From ada. ''

1201
02:02:28,918 --> 02:02:31,819
''Dear Mr. Tachibana:

1202
02:02:32,154 --> 02:02:35,385
You said you'd help me
to live decently.

1203
02:02:35,558 --> 02:02:37,992
You treated me with love,

1204
02:02:38,227 --> 02:02:41,196
though you didn't satisfy me.

1205
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:45,296
But it's for another reason
that I'm going to die. ''

1206
02:02:45,467 --> 02:02:46,661
MAY 20

1207
02:02:46,836 --> 02:02:50,237
I couldn't mail the letter to Tatsuzo.

1208
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:54,173
I asked a maid

1209
02:02:54,343 --> 02:02:56,334
to post my letter
to Tachibana the next day,

1210
02:02:56,512 --> 02:03:01,472
and thus his name
was disclosed to the world.

1211
02:03:01,650 --> 02:03:06,383
It caused him troubles,
and I'm sorry for that.

1212
02:03:07,022 --> 02:03:08,080
Then

1213
02:03:08,958 --> 02:03:11,222
I drank two bottles of beer.

1214
02:03:12,194 --> 02:03:15,960
I lay in bed, wondering how to die.

1215
02:03:16,765 --> 02:03:20,394
The police came about 4:00 p.m.

1216
02:03:38,921 --> 02:03:43,858
Yes, I'm Sada Abe.

1217
02:03:46,028 --> 02:03:48,428
Then they arrested me.

1218
02:03:50,966 --> 02:03:53,434
Here's a strange picture.

1219
02:03:53,936 --> 02:03:55,904
It was taken when she was arrested.

1220
02:03:56,071 --> 02:04:00,337
he's smiling, feeling relieved,
as she stated in her confession.

1221
02:04:00,509 --> 02:04:05,572
The cops are smiling too.
I wonder what that implies.

1222
02:04:06,215 --> 02:04:10,914
Actually, the ada case was
looked upon favorably by the public.

1223
02:04:11,086 --> 02:04:14,817
ada became a heroine,
a winner in love.

1224
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:19,859
''This incident tells that
their plus and minus

1225
02:04:20,029 --> 02:04:21,553
satisfied each other.''

1226
02:04:22,665 --> 02:04:23,597
Meaning?

1227
02:04:23,766 --> 02:04:27,395
The man and woman fit each other.

1228
02:04:28,003 --> 02:04:33,703
''Their plus and minus
satisfied each other

1229
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:37,377
and led to this rare outcome.''

1230
02:04:37,546 --> 02:04:39,309
It's the talk of the town.

1231
02:04:39,481 --> 02:04:41,210
Her lawyer's speech

1232
02:04:41,383 --> 02:04:45,251
softened up the public prosecutors.

1233
02:04:45,421 --> 02:04:49,448
She staked her life on love.
I envy her.

1234
02:04:49,625 --> 02:04:51,456
It was an act of love.

1235
02:04:51,627 --> 02:04:55,028
It sure is something great
in these gloomy times.

1236
02:04:55,197 --> 02:04:57,427
I'll applaud.

1237
02:04:57,599 --> 02:04:59,191
Loud enough for all to hear.

1238
02:05:01,403 --> 02:05:03,234
''What a problem for Mr. Tachibana!''

1239
02:05:21,323 --> 02:05:23,052
Last question:

1240
02:05:23,625 --> 02:05:27,425
You, the accused,
loved Tatsuzo, the victim,

1241
02:05:28,364 --> 02:05:32,733
so much that you wanted
to have him all for yourself,

1242
02:05:33,736 --> 02:05:37,228
even if you had to murder him?

1243
02:05:45,214 --> 02:05:47,205
What is the meaning of that?

1244
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:50,676
I don't know.

1245
02:05:52,488 --> 02:05:55,116
I don't even know myself.

1246
02:05:56,692 --> 02:06:01,288
At that time, I did as I wished.

1247
02:06:03,065 --> 02:06:04,965
That's all.

1248
02:06:10,506 --> 02:06:11,871
Come to think of it,

1249
02:06:12,408 --> 02:06:14,876
it's hard to know

1250
02:06:16,345 --> 02:06:20,782
how anyone feels - even myself.

1251
02:06:22,885 --> 02:06:26,048
The trial began on May 20, 1 936,

1252
02:06:26,255 --> 02:06:28,655
and ended on December 2 1.

1253
02:06:29,758 --> 02:06:33,455
The accused shall serve six years.

1254
02:06:42,738 --> 02:06:46,367
Do you have anything to say?

1255
02:06:50,979 --> 02:06:52,571
No.

1256
02:07:02,758 --> 02:07:05,693
A long time passed once again.

1257
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:08,495
Everyone forgot about it.

1258
02:07:09,665 --> 02:07:12,156
If forgetting means dying,

1259
02:07:12,334 --> 02:07:15,929
I guess I died at that time.

1260
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:20,500
On April 1, 1 996,

1261
02:07:20,676 --> 02:07:25,079
the Anti-Leprosy Law,
which caused bias and segregation,

1262
02:07:25,247 --> 02:07:28,739
was abolished
90 years after it was enacted.

1263
02:07:31,253 --> 02:07:33,847
The island was opened to everyone.

1264
02:07:34,756 --> 02:07:38,055
But no one knows
where Okada went.

1265
02:07:43,999 --> 02:07:48,402
Sada's term was shortened
to five years.

1266
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:52,438
She was released on May 1 7, 1 941 .

1267
02:07:54,276 --> 02:07:58,975
Some say she changed her name
and got married,

1268
02:08:00,048 --> 02:08:06,977
or that she staged a drama
about herself and toured Japan.

1269
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:12,850
But everything faded
with the passing of time.

1270
02:08:13,962 --> 02:08:17,420
Few people know about Sada now.

1271
02:08:19,134 --> 02:08:21,967
Japan is in a dark age again.

1272
02:08:22,137 --> 02:08:26,665
But theJapanese
were beautiful in those days.

1273
02:08:27,109 --> 02:08:29,339
I felt that way.

1274
02:08:30,512 --> 02:08:32,503
It's been all of 61 years.

1275
02:08:32,881 --> 02:08:35,475
Sada's days are over, I guess.

1276
02:08:36,618 --> 02:08:38,643
I who fret like this

1277
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:42,789
am no longer needed these days.

1278
02:08:44,293 --> 02:08:49,731
It's about time to exit this stage.

1279
02:08:52,801 --> 02:08:56,532
Well, then, good-bye, everyone.

1280
02:09:00,742 --> 02:09:02,175
Be careful.

1281
02:09:04,012 --> 02:09:08,073
How many did you count

1282
02:09:08,750 --> 02:09:12,686
How many and how many

1283
02:09:13,288 --> 02:09:17,554
Count many numbers

1284
02:09:18,026 --> 02:09:22,326
They can bring tomorrow

1285
02:09:22,497 --> 02:09:24,488
1 998

1286
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:30,395
They can bring back yesterday

1287
02:09:32,541 --> 02:09:36,841
If ada's still alive,
she'd be 93 years old.

1288
02:12:04,059 --> 02:12:09,929
