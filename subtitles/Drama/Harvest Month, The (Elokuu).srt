2
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,153
Yeah.

3
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:32,288
- Incoming.
- Here you go.

4
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,028
- Iqbal, order up!
- Hey!

5
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,696
Hey, did Humera get that promotion yet?

6
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,531
The boss is gonna think about it.
It's looking good.

7
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,632
Nice.

8
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,068
Lon. Lon. Lon!

9
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,773
Jimmy Buffett. Who?

10
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,575
Sleeping, buddy?

11
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,677
No, adjustmenting.

12
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,181
Crikey, is it time to close this bitch
or what?

13
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,816
We got about another hour.

14
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,952
Lon, you ever thought about
getting the laser eye surgery?

15
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,055
They say only about one in 1,500 people
don't see results.

16
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,625
That's a risk I'm not willing to take.

17
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,726
See you.

18
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,097
- Mom, can I get this?
- No, honey, it's too expensive.

19
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,499
Please. But I really want this.

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,568
Actually that's 40% off. Open box policy.

21
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,538
- Today's your lucky day, buddy.
- Wow, tell him thank you.

22
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,839
Thank you.

23
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,078
- Hi, Zack.
- Hey. What's up, Semi?

24
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,846
My mom made you some blueberry muffins.

25
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,515
Oh, what a sweetheart.

26
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,184
That is where you get your charm from,
isn't it, Semi?

27
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,685
I guess so.

28
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,556
Damn it!

29
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,227
Not this month, Zack. Not this month.

30
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,071
Who's Anal?

31
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,441
It's anal, dumb-ass.

32
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,142
Anal? You do?

33
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,480
Since when are you in the business
of asking me questions?

34
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,248
This is cashier number one.

35
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,885
Tell Zack he's messed with the bull
one too many times.

36
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,455
The bull's in the china shop.

37
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,125
I am the bull, he is the china shop.

38
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,828
My uncle had a bull. Big cojones.

39
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,629
Jorge's uncle had a...

40
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:25,133
Do not speak to me when I am on-line.

41
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,076
Hey, man. Looks like you're in trouble, guy.

42
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,913
Let's just focus here, okay, Russell?
Let's look what we got here.

43
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,082
My dented deviled ham

44
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,385
for your crushed bread
and broken peanut-butter-and-jelly jars.

45
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,922
Wait a minute.
PB and J, that's like gold, man.

46
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:48,623
Deviled ham is almost a spiritual meal.

47
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,996
Okay, fine. You're on.

48
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,436
- Well, let's go then.
- Let's go.

49
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,072
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

50
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,441
- Paper covers rock! All me!
- Damn.

51
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,877
Cameron, bag up my stuff for me.
I'll take that.

52
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:10,415
- Now, that's not part of the deal, guy.
- Heads up.

53
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,816
It smells like ass.

54
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,419
He's so...

55
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,125
- Have you seen Zack?
- No?

56
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,995
Well, I bet if he were covered
in chocolate and had a nougat inside,

57
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,496
you'd know exactly where he were at.

58
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,705
- That your pen?
- I don't know.

59
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,141
- Well, where did you get it?
- I don't know.

60
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,844
- Who gave it to you?
- I don't know.

61
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,848
Is your name Semi because you're the size
of a huge Mack truck,

62
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,117
or because you're semi-retarded?

63
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,853
- I don't know.
- Idiot.

64
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,989
Attention Super Club shoppers.
We're closing in five minutes.

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,761
So if you could please
finish in five minutes, that would be great.

66
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,030
- There you are.
- You're in deep, homes.

67
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,867
- He does not do anal.
- That's too bad for you, Jorge.

68
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,268
Do you know what this is?

69
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,471
Yes. That is a 10-times-larger-than-life
replica of your penis.

70
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,072
Oh, that's hilarious.

71
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,045
I realize that you don't care about
your job, but I do.

72
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,147
And I want to thank you
for caring about my job, really.

73
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,982
My job, jerk-off.

74
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,017
You know, it's funny. For the past 10 years,

75
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,654
I've been climbing
the Super Club food chain, as planned.

76
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,757
But you, you haven't moved at all.

77
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,726
I'm almost at the top.

78
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,831
It goes manager, section manager,
head cashier, cashier, stocker,

79
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,802
clean-up crew, night clean-up guy,
and lastly, box boy.

80
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,537
- That's what you are.
- That's me.

81
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:42,274
Yeah. That's why you can't
come into the cashiers' lounge.

82
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,675
You know, after all this time,

83
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,211
you'd think you'd understand
that you're the lowest of the low.

84
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,413
Yeah, the lowest of the low.

85
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,115
Aren't you a box boy, too, Jorge?

86
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,251
Oh yeah, but he's my box boy.

87
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,453
Yeah, I'm his box boy.

88
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,722
Your love for him
concerns and confuses me.

89
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,957
You listen to me, jerk-off,
and you listen well.

90
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,360
- Chill, boss, it's Glen.
- Mr. Gary.

91
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,295
- Mr. Gary.
- Hey, what do you say, boss-man?

92
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,064
Good evening, gentlemen.
Meeting in 60 seconds,

93
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,700
and I've got big news.

94
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,669
Thanks for being prompt.

95
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,006
Well, we got the call from Corporate,
and it's official.

96
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,341
Today Vince broke
the check-stand speed record

97
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,913
and has been officially recognized
as the fastest in the southwest region.

98
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,849
Needless to say,
you've earned this one, Vince.

99
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,486
Dirk, go ahead. Put the star up.

100
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,755
Congratulations to Vince,

101
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,191
employee of the month
for 17 months in a row.

102
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,595
- Yeah. Yeah.
- He always wins.

103
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,298
As most of you know,
if Vince gets to number 18,

104
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,300
he'll go into the hall of fame,

105
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,969
he'll be put on
the fast track for management,

106
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,141
and he'll win a brand-newish
2005 Chevy Malibu!

107
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,642
- Yeah!
- All right!

108
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,048
I realize that Vince has won
the last 17 in a row, but hey,

109
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,582
it's anybody's ball game.

110
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,452
And I like to encourage
everyone to compete.

111
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,790
A little extra effort could earn you a star.
It really could.

112
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,428
So grab a broom, help a lost customer,
pick up a spill.

113
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,197
Don't be afraid to go above and beyond.

114
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,166
I welcome all challengers.

115
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,535
"I welcome all challengers."

116
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,637
I am so proud of you.

117
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:23,942
Well, nobody has ever been to the magic 18
before, so this is a really big deal, people.

118
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:28,647
The store will close early on the 30th
for a special banquet award show.

119
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,748
Yeah.

120
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,785
Now, it'll be semi-formal and mandatory,

121
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,754
which means
church clothes, please, everyone.

122
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,990
- Mandatory?
- It'll be fun to dress up.

123
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:44,730
Corporate will be there and we need
everybody to be at your very best behavior.

124
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,633
- Sorry, sir.
- Why'd you do that?

125
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:53,905
Lastly, we'll have a new cashier
joining the team tomorrow.

126
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,841
- Her name is...
- Amy Renfroe.

127
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,942
Amy...

128
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:01,043
So please make her feel welcome.

129
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,684
Yeah, let's give her
a warm Super Club welcome.

130
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,985
- Super Club!
- Super Club!

131
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,890
- Yeah, Super Club.
- Super Club.

132
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,991
Thank you, Vince.

133
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,262
All right, everybody, be safe out there.

134
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,966
Now, don't forget to sign-up
for the softball game against Maxi-Mart,

135
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,268
'cause we need players.

136
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,603
How could you do that?

137
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:29,141
Hey, guy, we're headed over
to the Steaksmith for a drink. You in?

138
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,009
No. I'm having dinner
with the old lady tonight.

139
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,610
Need a lift?

140
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,547
No.

141
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:53,465
- Where's that beautiful lady of mine?
- Right in here. I'm on my last Scratcher.

142
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,333
Grandma, I think it's time that you invest

143
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,703
in something a little less speculative.

144
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:02,340
You really think I should take
financial advice from you?

145
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,841
One-nothing, Grandma.

146
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,722
What have we got here?
Okay, pay attention.

147
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,523
Where's it going? What's that?

148
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,864
Oh, Lean Pockets.
Somebody takes care of themselves.

149
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,301
Oh, well, now, I refuse to believe
that's not your natural hair color.

150
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,702
Oh, stop it!

151
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,037
Oh, that's a lot of lotion.

152
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,306
Somebody's gonna
pamper themselves tonight.

153
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,474
Maybe I will.

154
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,844
Your total is $69.60... Just kidding, $24.08.

155
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,447
Oh, gosh, did you get these
here at Super Club?

156
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,517
Oh, they smell wonderful. They really do.

157
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,354
Look at them.
Like moths around a dim yellow bulb.

158
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,256
Yeah, he's like Cirque du Soleil over there.

159
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,158
Oh, the Zumanity.

160
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,695
Anyone can do that. Anyone could do that.

161
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,999
Okay, and you've been
employee of the month how many times?

162
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,467
He's got a point.

163
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,702
Wait a second here.

164
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,304
You have no idea how much planning
and energy it takes

165
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,808
to keep such a low profile, okay?
It's practically an art, what I do.

166
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,178
- Zack, boxes needed at checkout four.
- I'm on it.

167
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,513
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, what's up, Semi?

168
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,416
Do me a favor. Can you bring
some boxes over to checkout four?

169
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,517
Okay.

170
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,520
- Yeah.
- It's quite an art.

171
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,392
Now, that's art.

172
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,971
She is totally untouchable.

173
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,841
No, she's hot,
but every girl's got a vulnerable place.

174
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,944
Yeah, it's called the dingly.

175
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,380
I'll see you guys later.

176
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,617
Hey, Zack, don't forget Sasha... Tasha...
Mikhal has soccer practice at 11:00.

177
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,119
- You're covering for me.
- Got it.

178
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,321
Excuse me,
do you have a membership card?

179
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,522
Sir, I work here.

180
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,426
- Really?
- What's going on, Joe?

181
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,362
This lady doesn't have a membership card.

182
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:09,401
- Oh, I'll take it from here, bro.
- Yeah, go to it, Zack.

183
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,403
Listen, I'm gonna let you pass this time,

184
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,674
but next time you might want to use
the "my dog ate it" excuse.

185
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,342
Maybe wear an eye patch or something.

186
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,277
Because nobody's gonna believe
you work here.

187
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:23,448
No seriously, it's supposed to be
my first day. I just transferred from 232.

188
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,750
- You're the new cashier?
- I'm Amy.

189
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,851
Hey.

190
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,321
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- It's okay.

191
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:34,092
Nobody would believe...
'Cause you don't look like you would...

192
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,393
I'm Zack.

193
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,562
I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen.

194
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,497
Yeah, he gets a little stubborn sometimes.

195
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,966
You give a guy a badge and suddenly gets

196
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,634
- this false sense of power.
- ...a false sense of power.

197
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,436
- Jinx, you owe me a Coke.
- Jinx, you owe me a Coke.

198
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,438
- No way.
- No way.

199
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,739
Hi, there.

200
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,309
Check stand number one.
Head cashier, Vince Downey.

201
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,378
Vince Downey? I've heard of you.

202
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,747
You have the fastest hands
in the southwest.

203
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,449
8.9 pass-through rate, huh?

204
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,387
Oh, boy. Well, I guess my reputation
has preceded me once again.

205
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,521
It's actually 9.1,

206
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,458
now that I set the southwest regional
speed ring competition record.

207
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,729
- That's amazing. I'm Amy Renfroe.
- Oh, wow. Renfroe.

208
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,630
Is that Nordic?

209
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,599
I don't think so.

210
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,003
Well I was just judging from
your Romanesque stature.

211
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,905
I assumed you were from Nordica.

212
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:25,410
Nordica, that's just north of Timberland,
right, Vince?

213
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,912
Oh, he's quick with a joke
or to light up your smoke.

214
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,448
I see you met Zack.
He's one of our box boys.

215
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,350
Yeah, he's in charge of the boxes.

216
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,086
- Box boy?
- Well, more of a Zack of all trades.

217
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,323
Zack, we still need some boxes
at check stand 10.

218
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,424
Minute.

219
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,661
So many boxes, so little time.

220
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,031
You know I just started my break.
I'd love to show you the store, if you'd like.

221
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,034
- Oh, my God. That'd be great.
- Yeah, let's start off in the cashiers' lounge.

222
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,971
- Okay. Nice to meet you, Zack.
- Nice to meet you too, Amy.

223
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,707
Wow. That's got to hurt.

224
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,877
Man, he is always doing that to you.
Stealing your thunder.

225
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:03,181
Remember the redhead in Gardening?
Bonked her behind the monkey grass.

226
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,018
And the Asian in Automotive.
Did her on a pile of carburetors.

227
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:13,391
Oh, and the blond in Frozen Foods
with the "Turkey's done!"

228
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,561
- You remember her?
- Yeah. But it ain't over yet.

229
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,662
Okay.

230
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,733
Russell, I need all the 411 on Amy Renfroe.
She's the new cashier.

231
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,134
- And I need that stat.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,235
- On it.
- Good.

233
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,537
Lilly, Daddy's coming home.

234
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:04,757
Pleasure doing business with you.

235
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,705
Come on, guys,
let's respect the sanctity of the clubhouse.

236
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:41,792
- How's that B-52 coming along?
- Oh, cherry.

237
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:45,998
Hey, guy, I got the 411
on your little Aphrodite.

238
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:46,766
All right.

239
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:49,902
I made some calls.
Got a buddy on the inside.

240
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:53,175
Cost me a dented cheese pallet,
but I got the scoop.

241
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,378
All right, come on, come on.

242
00:14:54,479 --> 00:15:00,509
Apparently she requested the transfer
due to some romantic issues.

243
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,881
Okay, what kind of issues?

244
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:06,600
Well, I think she has a thing
for the employee of the month.

245
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:07,701
No way.

246
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:10,768
Yeah, that picture goes up on the wall,

247
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:16,737
she slides into the sack like a singed koala
looking for an all-night burn center.

248
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,376
- No shit.
- Yeah.

249
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:20,822
You know what? I don't believe it.

250
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:24,523
I know this. We had a moment.

251
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:29,838
Well apparently
your girl's having another moment.

252
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:34,039
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Oh, boy.

253
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,190
The bad news, you got carpel tunnel.

254
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:43,324
Check it out, guy.
He's the alpha male of the store.

255
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:49,111
Chicks always go after the alpha male.
They're like lions, kings of the desert.

256
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:52,792
And you,
you're just a little, tiny field mouse

257
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:57,347
dangling in the teeth of the lion,
while he's banging your chick.

258
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,365
No, wait a minute, box boy.

259
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:02,798
You're like the little hairy nutsack
on the little hairy field mouse,

260
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,831
swinging back and forth while
he's banging your chick, going back...

261
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:06,932
Russell.

262
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:10,498
Yeah?

263
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:15,941
Your metaphors are magical,
but shut the hell up, please.

264
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,042
Roger.

265
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:23,765
Just going back and forth, hairy
Kalahari-style, in and out with his big...

266
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:27,266
- Pete!
- Discovery Channel...

267
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:33,303
Well, fine. I'll win employee of the month.

268
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:39,180
What? Come on.
Seriously, how hard could it be?

269
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:44,252
Oh, you're kidding, right? You know,
you can't ever be late, ever, at all.

270
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:47,588
- Easy.
- And you can't get any complaints, guy.

271
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:48,689
Fine.

272
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:50,525
- Yeah, but you also have to...
- Go above and beyond...

273
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,294
- ...with your job description. Go beyond...
- ...and use your job description.

274
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:54,762
- ...the duties of your job.
- Way above.

275
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:59,867
I'm serious, you guys.
I'm gonna win employee of the month.

276
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,737
Having fun? I hope you wore protection.

277
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:06,407
You know, maybe you should listen
to your loser buddies, okay?

278
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,811
- You ain't got a shot.
- Okay, who's calling me a loser?

279
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:13,047
Easy there, Hubble Telescope.
No need to get physical.

280
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,150
No, I'm serious.
I can't see who's calling me a loser.

281
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:18,019
Well, I'll give you a hint.
He waxes his forearms,

282
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,355
and he lost his virginity in the Boy Scouts.

283
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,358
- Uncle Donny?
- Perhaps you've forgotten,

284
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,494
I have the fastest check stand
in the southwest region.

285
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:27,562
Southwest, man.

286
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,665
I'm gonna obliterate
the employee-of-the-month record.

287
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,067
- Obliterate it, boss.
- You're a dink.

288
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,802
You will not stand in my way.

289
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:37,872
- Bring it.
- I'll bring it, 'cause game is on.

290
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,909
And someone's going to get hurt.
But the someone is not gonna be me.

291
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,410
That means you, man.

292
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,350
I am the boss and I get the last word.
Damn it.

293
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,387
- All right, boss. I'm sorry.
- Jorge, shut up.

294
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,155
- Sorry.
- Jorge!

295
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,956
- Okay.
- God damn it!

296
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,560
He's going down. I'm gonna win.

297
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:19,242
Hey, Grandma.
Gram, come here, check this out.

298
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:25,386
- Remember this guy?
- Yeah. Didn't he have his own place?

299
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:28,387
I love you too, Grandma.

300
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:31,685
Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,490
What?

302
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,292
Hey!

303
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:43,231
Wow.

304
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,734
I was just warming it up for you, boss.

305
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:51,535
You wanna see what gets me warm, Jorge?

306
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:59,878
It's sweet. Is it leather?

307
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,749
Oh, no. It's pleather. Way better.

308
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,289
It won't fade or crack with age.

309
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,390
Hey, come on, stay off the glass.

310
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,163
So what are you gonna do
with your set of wheels?

311
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:17,064
Sell, most likely.

312
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:18,933
- How much?
- I don't know.

313
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,802
It's probably going to be
a multi-bid situation. Are you interested?

314
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:25,072
Of course. It means the world to me.

315
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,173
I'm gonna think.

316
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,311
No way.

317
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,381
Hey, good morning.

318
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,983
Good morning, Super Club people.

319
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:38,119
Zack Bradley just punching
in on the bright.

320
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,889
Extra effort. Doing it the Super Club way
by getting here nice and early.

321
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,790
And I'm punching my very own
on-time indicator.

322
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:52,900
Holy crap. You're really serious about this?

323
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:58,301
I told you I could do this. I can do this.

324
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:05,907
Here you go, Sam. Boxes, Mike. All you.
Here you go, Nick.

325
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:07,748
- Hey, what's up, Amy?
- Hi.

326
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,149
Do you need any more boxes?

327
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,287
No, thank you.

328
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:16,357
Okay. Well, listen, if there's anything else
you need, I'm gonna be here...

329
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,758
Five minutes or I'm buying!

330
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:41,982
Oh, please.

331
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:47,751
Like I said, five minutes or I'm buying.

332
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:51,223
And ten, nine, eight, seven,

333
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:54,761
six, five, four,

334
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,231
three two, one!

335
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,169
Come on!

336
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,482
See, you can't beat a guy like that.

337
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,983
Yes, I can.

338
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:17,151
$230.45.

339
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,423
He'll take care of that.
I got to take my union-mandated break,

340
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:25,924
so, next show in 15 minutes.

341
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:27,661
Bye, Vince.

342
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,863
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah.

343
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:36,804
Eagle Eye, this is Brown Trouser.
We are go. How?

344
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:42,705
Eagle... This is Brown... Brown Eye.
It's a go.

345
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,681
Clean-up on aisle 313.

346
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:04,963
You've gotta be kidding me!

347
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:20,448
- Not today!
- Oh, yeah. It's today, Vince!

348
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,949
- No way, Zack!
- I got it!

349
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:47,574
I almost had him.

350
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:56,350
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Here you go, Zack.
If you pass out, you call 911.

351
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,451
Got it.

352
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,492
Let me guess. Vince?

353
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:12,095
You know I can't say. You know the rules.

354
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,582
Look away.

355
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:37,124
Pretty.

356
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:48,602
Yeah.

357
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,404
Looks like it's gonna be harder
than you thought.

358
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:53,407
Not to worry.
I've got 29 more days to leave a mark.

359
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:55,242
Looks like you already have.

360
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:57,845
Hey, don't forget.
Party at my house tonight.

361
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:00,047
Ain't no party like an Iqbal party.

362
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,148
Word.

363
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,255
Amy!

364
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,526
- Amy, hey.
- Hi.

365
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:15,262
- How you doing?
- Good.

366
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:18,732
Listen, I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to this party tonight.

367
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,735
I know you don't know a lot of people.
There's gonna be a lot of people there.

368
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,605
It might be kind of cool
if you want to go with me.

369
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:28,142
Oh, I actually have dinner plans with Vince.

370
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:30,511
Oh, well, that's cool. That will be good.
It'll be fun.

371
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,114
I gotta go to this thing. Going to be
a lot of friends and stuff like that.

372
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:38,519
I don't have to go, but... I mean, I do, but...

373
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,622
- I guess I'll just... I'll see you later.
- All right.

374
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:46,093
- And where's he taking you?
- Steaksmith?

375
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:48,028
- Classy.
- Yeah.

376
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,498
All right, my break's over,
so I'm gonna get some more water.

377
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,367
- Gotcha.
- It's free in there.

378
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,868
- Do you want some?
- Water?

379
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,140
No. I don't want any water. I'm good.

380
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,243
- Okay. All right.
- All right. All right.

381
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:04,044
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.

382
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,145
Enjoy your water.

383
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:12,853
Oh, hey, boxy lady.
Are you looking for your lounge?

384
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:15,155
I think it's over there.

385
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:17,256
Yeah, over there.

386
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:19,593
Over there.

387
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:23,197
Amy!

388
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,468
- Excuse me.
- How can I help you?

389
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:30,237
I dropped my glasses off this morning.
Are they ready?

390
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,841
- No.
- Isn't this "Glasses in an Hour"?

391
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:38,642
No. This is "Glasses in About an Hour".

392
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:44,985
- So when can I pick them up?
- In about an hour.

393
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:48,686
Are you staring at my breasts?

394
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:51,424
I don't know.

395
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:53,727
Freak.

396
00:26:57,265 --> 00:26:58,565
Hey, Vince.

397
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,905
Vince! Hey, what's up, man?

398
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:09,343
There is a massive rumor going around
that you have a hot date tonight.

399
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:12,913
As a matter of fact, I do. With Amy.

400
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:14,348
Nice, man! Yeah.

401
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,717
- Whoa. What is this?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

402
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:18,252
You hitting the gym?

403
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,821
Yeah, I'm hitting the gym.
I like to do some core work.

404
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,490
- Doing some squats?
- Yeah, I do. I squat it out.

405
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:26,594
Wow, it is working. What is that, pecs?
Doing some of that?

406
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:27,695
Yeah.

407
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:30,431
Okay! Just lay off, buddy.

408
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,932
- All right.
- Okay?

409
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:36,070
Listen, I'm going to tell you something.
You probably already know,

410
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:41,208
but first dates are so important, you know?
It's really crucial

411
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:45,045
that you make an amazing first impression.
I know you know that.

412
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:46,814
Are we through here?

413
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:51,085
That's it, man,
just have a good time tonight.

414
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:53,586
You are working out.

415
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:06,900
Jesus Christ. Where the hell are we,
Chuck E. Cheese-istan?

416
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:10,337
How many kids you got there, eight balls?

417
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,674
- Just 22.
- So, whose birthday is it anyhow?

418
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:18,278
Whoever blows the candles out first,
they get the presents.

419
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:25,152
Hey, Zack, that employee of the month
thing isn't really working out for you, is it?

420
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:26,953
What the fuck?

421
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,957
Come on. Come on, you guys.

422
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,993
I think it's great.
There's honor in a good day's work.

423
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:35,996
There is no honor
working in that black hole.

424
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:37,398
Think about it, guys.

425
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:42,336
We could be working over there
at Maxi-Mart, and that place really sucks.

426
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:44,238
Pass me the chips there, eight balls.

427
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,208
Plus, I hear they make you wear
those house-arrest ankle-bracelet things,

428
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,411
the dog collars, on your ankles.

429
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:52,980
So they know where you are all the time,

430
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:56,784
and if you leave the main floor
you get a little shocker.

431
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:57,885
True.

432
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:01,722
I knew a guy in upper management, man,
went crazy.

433
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,825
Strapped one of those things
around his hairy ball sack,

434
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:09,630
ran out into the parking lot and blew a $3
Hawaiian wonder cooler all over the place.

435
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:10,964
Ids-kay. Ids-kay.

436
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:14,201
Knocked a little Korean kid
right out of his shopping basket.

437
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:17,404
Oh, speaking of $3
Honolulu wonder coolers,

438
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,574
isn't Vince going out with Amy tonight?

439
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,243
Yes, yes, he is.
But that could prove problematic,

440
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,244
since I have his wallet.

441
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:30,117
You want to get some pizzas
and some hookers?

442
00:29:30,218 --> 00:29:33,520
I mean, why climb Everest
when you can set a land speed record?

443
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:37,621
- That's my goal.
- Here you go.

444
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,364
Zack.

445
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,752
I must have forgotten my wallet
in my other car.

446
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,690
Oh, well, for the fastest checker
in the southwest, it's on the house.

447
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,526
Wow. Thanks, Sandy,
that's really nice of you.

448
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,562
Are you kidding me?
A freebie is the least I can do.

449
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,599
You know what,
how about I go get you a dessert menu?

450
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,800
Oh, that'd be great, huh? Dessert.

451
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,643
She's one of my regulars
on check stand one.

452
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,946
Wow, your customers
seem to really like you.

453
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:21,247
You know, I care. Maybe that's my downfall,

454
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,922
but I think it's important.

455
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:30,323
Wow. Those are amazing.
So big and inviting.

456
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,699
Supple. Are they veneers? Is it a porcelain?

457
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,901
- These?
- Yeah.

458
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,002
Oh, they're mine.

459
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,238
It's like you have ivory smuggled in
or something.

460
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,508
It's intoxicating. I'm intoxicated by it.

461
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,609
Wow.

462
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,684
Well, that was a good evening, huh?

463
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,986
Yeah, it was great.

464
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,721
It's nice and early still.

465
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,423
You're not going to go to bed now,
are you?

466
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,624
Yeah, I think so.

467
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Alone?

468
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,595
Okay. Okay. You sure?

469
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,334
Going once. Going twice.

470
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:18,739
Going three times. Okay, here we go.

471
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:30,888
- All right, good night. Good night.
- Okay, all right, okay.

472
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,489
Yes. See you at work, kitten.

473
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,537
- Hey, Vince.
- Zack.

474
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,943
Oh, I found your wallet
in front of the herpes medication.

475
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,079
Wanted to get that back to you.

476
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,215
Yeah, I was probably shopping
for your Christmas present there.

477
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,518
I don't know if you want the stuff
that was in it, but...

478
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:01,919
Very funny.

479
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,220
Oh, hey, Zack.

480
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,491
My date last night with Amy,
it was spectacular.

481
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,192
I mean, she is a good kisser.

482
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,899
Hey, good luck
getting one of those gold stars.

483
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,502
You got a little schmaltz
or something right...

484
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,539
- I don't buy it.
- Well, I wouldn't lie to you, it's a lot.

485
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,474
I don't fall for jokes.

486
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:28,375
Okay. Just right there. Just one... Okay.

487
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,152
I didn't fall for that.

488
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:49,633
- Wow, I really love this song.
- Oh, it's the best.

489
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,803
- Ten grand, huh?
- Oh, yeah, it's a steal.

490
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:57,875
This is the car that started it all.
And I got low miles. It's only got 33,000.

491
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,145
But you told me you flipped it, twice.

492
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:04,746
Exactly. 233,000. All highway.

493
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:13,484
That's nothing for an '81.
She runs like a top. Totally mint.

494
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,427
Mint?

495
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,297
I'll tell you what.
If you can find this particular model

496
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,034
with these low miles for less money, buy it.

497
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,735
Don't think about it, buy it.

498
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,312
- Can I take it for a spin?
- No.

499
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,650
- Well, can you give me a ride home later?
- No.

500
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:45,122
- Can you give me a ride to the bus stop?
- Absolutely not.

501
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,292
Well, can I stay here with you
and listen to the rest of the song?

502
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,593
Absolutely.

503
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,938
Hey, Zack. Oh, Sustan's got soccer practice
at 11:00. Can you cover for me?

504
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,373
- You got it.
- You're a pal.

505
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,941
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

506
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,579
Can you be on the lookout for a little boy
in a red shirt? He's really lost.

507
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,681
- Vince know about this yet?
- No.

508
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,484
Okay, could you keep this on the QT
for, like, two minutes?

509
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,985
I guess so.

510
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,354
That's probably him.

511
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,755
I'll check it out.

512
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,672
Come on! Yeah!

513
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,109
- No unauthorized use of the equipment!
- You want a piece of me?

514
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,745
- Get away from the machine!
- You'll never take me alive!

515
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:46,016
- Relinquish your weapon!
- Bring it, bitches!

516
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,117
Suckers!

517
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,987
Oh, that's nice.

518
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,361
Oh, no! You were hit by a ricochet.

519
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,862
I brought it, bitch.

520
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,166
All right!

521
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,428
Sorry, Zack.

522
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:35,332
- Oh, thank you. Let's go.
- Mom!

523
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:40,233
Hey, Zack, I brought you the small pack.

524
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,350
Hey there, Mr. Gold Star.

525
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,253
- How are you, bright smile?
- Good.

526
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:02,854
I guess I'm gonna to have to
crank this up a notch.

527
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,179
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,183
I know. I know. I missed drinks last night.

529
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,786
I'm not here for that.

530
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:39,187
I came outside to pass gas.

531
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:50,033
Man, this employee-of-the-month thing
is a lot harder than I thought.

532
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,237
Maybe you should just do it for yourself,

533
00:37:53,338 --> 00:38:00,438
for your pride, and the rest will come,
including the girl.

534
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,079
The universe always has a plan, Zack.

535
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,758
Told you.

536
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:21,027
Damn! The thing's heavier than it looks.

537
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:26,737
- Hi, do you need some help with that?
- Yes, thank you.

538
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:30,140
- It's for my husband.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that.

539
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,676
Oh, he's not dead. Not yet.

540
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,578
It's just too good a deal to pass up.

541
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,080
Well, do you need some help
getting it to your car?

542
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,350
No, thank you.
The lazy prick's waiting for me.

543
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,386
I'm gonna make him load it.

544
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,855
Well, good luck murdering your husband.

545
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:48,356
If you need my help, holler.

546
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,361
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

547
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,797
That young man is wonderful.

548
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,333
I'll be back for sure, just because of him.

549
00:38:56,434 --> 00:39:01,234
- Oh, that man there? No surprise.
- No.

550
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,543
This is the guy. He's a wonderful fella.

551
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,544
Well, thank you.

552
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,281
May I help you find your way to your car?

553
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,582
I know where it is, idiot.

554
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,437
Hey, Vince. What, they kick you
out of the cashiers' lounge?

555
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,474
No, just here to watch
as I get ever closer to victory.

556
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:42,913
Five more days and I seal the deal.
Once I get to 16, it's over.

557
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,882
Your math skills are astonishing, Vince.

558
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,419
All right, here he is. The man of the hour.

559
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,120
Soon that Malibu will be mine.

560
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:01,062
Hey, what... Give me this.

561
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,066
Okay, you've made a big mistake.

562
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,536
No mistake. Zack has shown
a real improvement over the last week.

563
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,672
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah.

564
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,573
You're welcome.

565
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,511
Oh, no. Vince, not now.

566
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:19,916
- Hey, you gotta listen to me.
- Vince, I can't talk to you right now.

567
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,017
Yes!

568
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,922
I'm on the board, come on!

569
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,691
- You the man.
- Yeah.

570
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,794
Wow, Zack, you got a star. Fantastic.

571
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,296
Oh, that's nothing really.

572
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,233
Nothing? What do you mean, "nothing"?
We should be out celebrating.

573
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:39,936
- Want to grab a drink after this?
- Yeah, sure.

574
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,637
Really? Great.

575
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,108
I'm late shift,
so why don't you pick me up around 9:00?

576
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,376
- Perfect.
- Okay.

577
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,577
- All right.
- Bye.

578
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,078
Yeah, later.

579
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,817
- Holy shit.
- What'd I tell you?

580
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,421
The female lioness
gets a whiff of that gold star,

581
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:01,258
and just like that,
she's crawling into your den of desire.

582
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,895
- You think? Really?
- I got a gold star once.

583
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,464
- No. No I didn't.
- Nice.

584
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,499
Pretty impressive
how you snuck one in on me.

585
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,668
But don't get used to it. It was a fluke.

586
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,970
No box boy's ever won
employee of the month.

587
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:20,143
You got to be the QB to win the MVP, baby.
Can't be the punter.

588
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,244
Yup.

589
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,048
Iqbal, hey. Just double-checking.
We still on for tonight?

590
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,217
Yeah, sure, of course. I got you covered.

591
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,720
Thanks, man. You're a good friend.

592
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,656
Zacky, what do you want for din-din?

593
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,557
I can't. I have a late dinner.

594
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,329
With whom? A girl?

595
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:46,670
New girl at work. Cashier.
Her name's Amy. She's very pretty.

596
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:50,071
Why, you look very handsome.

597
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:54,344
- Amy's a very lucky girl.
- Thanks, Grams.

598
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,713
Maybe you should plant the seed tonight.

599
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,383
- What?
- Plant the seed of love.

600
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:04,921
You know,
when you get ready to kiss her, don't.

601
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,791
Because you mustn't rush things.

602
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:14,164
Take it easy, because then the seed of love
will blossom into something beautiful.

603
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,599
Thanks, Grams.

604
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,034
- And don't forget...
- Yes?

605
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,435
To wash your balls.

606
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,505
You're the best.

607
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,351
- Buenas noches.
- Hey.

608
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,824
How about me, you and a bottle of wine?

609
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,693
I got a sweet deal
on some tampered cabernet.

610
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,763
I actually have dinner plans
with Zack tonight.

611
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,864
- Zack? The box boy, Zack?
- Yes.

612
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,536
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

613
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,209
That's awesome. Where's he taking you?

614
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,010
I don't know.

615
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:07,517
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Awesome.

616
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:12,289
It's like...
Smell so good, now, and I want to...

617
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,490
I wanna kiss you all over

618
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,130
Now, that is some of the best
chicken parmesan I've ever had.

619
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:24,801
Not a lot of people know about this place.
It's kind of a hidden gem.

620
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:26,436
I won't tell.

621
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,406
Amy, could I offer you
another box of Merlot?

622
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:32,475
- No, thanks. Yeah.
- Okay.

623
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:35,645
So what's on this evening's agenda?

624
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:39,049
Okay, this evening's agenda,
I'd thought that we would catch a flick,

625
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,553
and before that, maybe take a few laps
around the race track, play nine holes.

626
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,255
Sounds ambitious.

627
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,757
But we should probably get going
if we're gonna catch the movie.

628
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,293
I don't think we're in any shape
to be driving.

629
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:57,794
Don't worry about that, Amy.
I've got it all taken care of.

630
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,406
Did you have restricted airflow
when you were in the birthing canal?

631
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:10,280
Focus. If they're not at the Steaksmith,
where do you think he took her? Think.

632
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:14,284
I don't know, bro. Her car is still here.

633
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,220
And I don't think he even has a license.

634
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,389
I'm clearly the driver.

635
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:26,590
You were supposed to provide intel.
You have not done that.

636
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:49,752
Since the invention of the kiss,
there have been five kisses

637
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,589
that were rated the most passionate,
the most pure.

638
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,290
This one left them all behind.

639
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:01,830
The end.

640
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:03,966
This is what we gotta do, okay?

641
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:07,503
You see the lamp post in the middle
of the parking lot? Number seven?

642
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:11,440
You got to hit the ball,
it's gonna bank off that post.

643
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,075
And if you do that, you win a free game.

644
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:14,577
All the way
in the middle of the parking lot?

645
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,312
- I'm gonna show you. No more questions.
- No way.

646
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,180
No more questions, just examples.
Watch this.

647
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:20,781
- No way.
- Yes way.

648
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,994
- Holy shit!
- That's it! Yes!

649
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:35,531
Oh, my God, that's amazing!
You spend too much time up here.

650
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,701
I've paid my dues,
but it's your turn, go ahead.

651
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:42,802
All right, free game. Hit it off.

652
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:47,775
My head! My head!

653
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:53,379
Where did that come from? Shut up!

654
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:55,983
We're under attack.

655
00:45:56,286 --> 00:46:00,556
This is an '81 Honda! How dare you!

656
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:04,560
You know, most guys I meet
try really hard to impress me.

657
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:08,797
But there's something different about you.

658
00:46:08,898 --> 00:46:10,798
It's my tongue.

659
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,236
- Oh my!
- I know.

660
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:17,507
No, what I was trying to say is that

661
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:22,008
with you, it's just effortless. Easy.

662
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:32,522
What about you? Drop-dead gorgeous,
totally cool. How does that happen?

663
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,990
I'm serious.

664
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,127
Most girls that are 9's or 10's, you know,
can't even open a door for themself.

665
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,963
They have everything handed to them.

666
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:43,164
Not you. You're different.

667
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:48,538
And you seem to treat everybody the same.
It's really nice.

668
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,639
- Check this out.
- Okay.

669
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,378
Holy shit!

670
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,149
- You have huge ears.
- I know, right?

671
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,150
You have huge ears, Amy!

672
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,622
Gosh, I heard it all through grade school.

673
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:09,423
Dumbo. Baby New Year. Big ears.

674
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:12,896
Wow.

675
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,632
Good thing I don't have a complex about it
or anything.

676
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:19,069
I'm sorry. It must have been tough.
It must have been tough.

677
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,638
I did go through a lot.

678
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:25,008
So should I... I should, like, whisper
when I talk to you? I don't wanna...

679
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:28,509
Shut up! They're not bionic.

680
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:37,514
No, really, I probably hear even less
because of all this hair.

681
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:41,721
Well, I like everything about you.

682
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,834
Come on, we have a few more stops
on the agenda.

683
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:54,635
- Okay.
- All right, after you.

684
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,175
Oh, you should work for the government
in a think tank.

685
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,676
You call yourself my protege.

686
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,983
- I guess I had you pegged all wrong.
- Really?

687
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:10,186
All right, well,
what was your first impression of me?

688
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:14,924
That you were just that guy that has been
skating by for the past 10 years.

689
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,561
Probably still lives with his mom.

690
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:23,299
Ouch, me? No. No, no, no, no.
I do not live with my mom.

691
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,336
All right then, let me ask you.

692
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:29,937
Why are you still a box boy?

693
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:33,743
There is an answer to that. But...

694
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:34,944
But what?

695
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:44,950
No, it's okay, it's all right. Just listen.

696
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:40,543
- Have you ever kissed a boy?
- No. But I have thought about it.

697
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,644
Sir!

698
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,348
- What is it?
- I've got bad news.

699
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,283
Well, spit it out, Dirk.

700
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:50,453
Apparently, your brother,
Glen Ross, is on his way here.

701
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,256
He wants to do a quick audit.

702
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,557
Jesus! No.

703
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,493
I know.

704
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,462
Okay. Okay. That's fine.

705
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,566
We're fine. Right?

706
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,003
The only problem is that we just lost Janet
on check stand three.

707
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,940
- Her shift is about to begin.
- Where is she? Go find her.

708
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,610
Lost as in dead, sir.
She passed away last night.

709
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,980
So, she's not coming in then?

710
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,881
I don't think so, sir.

711
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:23,720
Oh, God and Jesus. Rest her soul.

712
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:27,290
Call an emergency staff meeting. Now.

713
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,059
- Don't lollygag!
- Yes, sir.

714
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,595
I've called you in here for two things.

715
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:37,133
First of all, the girl on check stand 13
has passed away.

716
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,068
- Oh, my God, Mary's dead!
- I don't believe it.

717
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:43,506
- Oh, Lord, why?
- Sir, it's Janet from three.

718
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:47,207
Sorry, I meant Janet on three.

719
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:50,547
- Oh, thank God!
- Thank God.

720
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:55,318
But my big brother, Glen Ross,
is coming in today

721
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,320
- to see how we're all doing.
- Corporate.

722
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,689
And, yes, he can be very intimidating.

723
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,459
But don't let him get to you.
Do not let him get to you.

724
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,628
It's just his way.

725
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,866
So, we cannot let the lines
get above 25 shoppers. Okay, people?

726
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,801
We really need everybody to just step it up.

727
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,837
That's impossible. We're short one checker
and it's a Saturday.

728
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,941
Nobody panic.
We are out of options, people.

729
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:19,542
I'll do it.

730
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:20,977
Oh, God.

731
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,146
I'll work check stand number three.

732
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,382
- Is that legal?
- Yeah. Actually he can, yeah.

733
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,452
Great, Zack.
We'll toss you into training immediately.

734
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,354
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah.

735
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,855
He will never be ready by next shift.

736
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,059
I mean, you can't just walk in off the street
and do what we do.

737
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,561
It takes years and years of training.
I mean, let's just let him

738
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,230
perform a tracheotomy while we're at it.
I mean, this is ridiculous.

739
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:44,231
I am up against a wall!

740
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:00,048
Hey, how you doing?

741
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,337
Are you okay, sir?
I've never seen you like this before.

742
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:24,907
Well, you don't know what it's like, okay,
to come home from school every day

743
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:28,211
and have your big brother
physically torture you, day in, day out.

744
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,579
It was awful.

745
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,382
- Well, I'm sure he's changed, sir.
- No, he's worse.

746
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,718
He can be so emasculating.
And I don't appreciate you siding with him.

747
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,953
- I'm not siding with him.
- You just did.

748
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:39,088
- I didn't, sir.
- Well, good.

749
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,458
Bigger smile.
Make a note, old guy should be older.

750
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,859
Straighten that tie.

751
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,562
Get back to work.

752
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,700
- Hello, sir, how are you? Nice to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

753
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:54,801
Check his receipt on the way out.

754
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:58,973
You, grab a rag now. Now!

755
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,613
- Little brother.
- Hey, there.

756
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,482
Bend over.
Like you haven't heard that before.

757
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:10,319
- I really don't think that it's appropriate...
- Come on, get down here.

758
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,321
- Please don't...
- Come on, get down here.

759
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,922
- Please.
- Come on. Come on.

760
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:20,997
Who's your boss? Who's your boss?
I am, aren't I?

761
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:23,032
You are. You are.

762
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,803
- Good to see you!
- It's great to see you.

763
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,504
It really is.

764
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,374
So what brings you in here, so early?

765
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:33,576
I thought you were only coming in
for the banquet.

766
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,279
I want to make sure you're running
this place up to my standards.

767
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,816
I don't wanna have to get rid
of my own kin.

768
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:46,122
- Lines look a little long.
- No, no, no. Never more than 25.

769
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,023
Nice to meet...

770
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,683
Damn it! What the frick is going on?

771
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:17,687
- I am going over your head.
- Vince.

772
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:20,490
- I got two.
- Hey, Zack.

773
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,425
Here's your new cashiers' lounge card.

774
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:26,429
You just slide it in the machine
and you'll get full access.

775
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,530
Great.

776
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,933
Thanks. Thanks, Dirk.

777
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:35,838
Slide 'em in.

778
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:45,748
They gave me one of those stupid cards
with the slide thing.

779
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:53,149
- Like I'd ever use that.
- Congratulations on the star, man.

780
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,107
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

781
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:13,242
You can't tell the guys
that I shop here, okay?

782
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,145
Because I'm pretty picky about what I eat.

783
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:20,016
Zack, honey, I can't seem to find
the Smooth Move laxative tea.

784
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:22,785
Yeah, it's over in
the disgusting section, Grandma.

785
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:26,055
You must be the big-eared girl.

786
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,525
- This, Amy, is my beautiful grandmother.
- Nice to meet you.

787
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,862
I'll meet you outside. Don't be late.

788
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:38,267
- Boy, is she smoking hot.
- Don't listen, right now, please.

789
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,102
So you don't live with your mom, huh?

790
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,738
I never said anything
about my grandmother.

791
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,875
Now, can we please finish
this conversation in organic vegetables?

792
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:46,976
Yeah.

793
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:54,283
Ten years ago, I had a start-up, a dot-com.

794
00:55:54,384 --> 00:56:00,456
And I had a computer, I had a product,
I even had a PO box at Mail Boxes Etc.

795
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,892
- You? Come on.
- I know, right.

796
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:08,331
I was a hotshot straight out of college,
and I thought I knew everything,

797
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:11,267
- but, boy, was I wrong.
- What happened?

798
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,203
Borrowed a lot of money to get it started,
and then I lost it all.

799
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,005
People know there's a risk.

800
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:19,542
Except for my grandmother,
who didn't have the money to risk.

801
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:23,179
That's why she kind of lives with me now.

802
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,649
After that I thought I'd do something
with a little less responsibility.

803
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,052
You know, something that
wouldn't jeopardize anybody's future.

804
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,053
Except your own.

805
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,225
Yeah, thanks, Dr. Phyllis. I get your point.

806
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:39,028
Zacky, what's my PIN number?

807
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:43,132
1-2-3-4, Grandma.
Now we got to change it again.

808
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,870
Anyway, I got to get going.
I'll see you later.

809
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,071
- See you.
- Bye.

810
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,007
I'm a professional.

811
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,279
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

812
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,749
six, five, four, three, two...

813
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,059
It's free then.

814
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,695
We're going to need some insurance...

815
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,630
- That's not good.
- Yeah. Should I help him?

816
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,731
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay.

817
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,533
Are you okay, Vince?

818
00:57:53,870 --> 00:58:00,170
Am I losing it?
What could she possibly see in him?

819
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,980
Well, apparently they have a lot in common.

820
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,449
And they even finish
each other's sentences.

821
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,150
What? Where did you hear this?

822
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:16,492
Why haven't you told me about this?
I knew it had to be something.

823
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,793
Everybody knows, home slice.

824
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:28,199
Well, I'm going to have
to turn this up a notch.

825
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:36,879
Push, push, push.
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

826
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,380
- Boss?
- I got it.

827
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:43,418
Save your energy.

828
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:48,858
Don't cry, okay? I'll cry for you, okay?

829
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,559
Get someone who speaks English.

830
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,880
Oh, hey. I didn't see you sitting there.

831
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:13,381
- You didn't?
- No.

832
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:20,517
Oh, my God, we ordered the same thing.
How serendipitous.

833
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:28,661
- How are you?
- Good. It's all good.

834
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,034
All right, well, my break's over,
so I'm gonna

835
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:34,203
- take off.
- Take a dump?

836
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:38,708
- Excuse me?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

837
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,310
- Are you feeling all right?
- All... Okay?

838
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,011
Jinx, you owe me a Coke or...

839
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:49,085
- You can't talk till I...
- What?

840
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:50,687
- It's a jinx.
- Bye.

841
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:53,890
Buy low, sell high.
That's not what you were gonna say.

842
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:57,360
- I'll see you later.
- See you later, alligator.

843
00:59:57,461 --> 00:59:58,461
Okay.

844
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:14,711
What are we gonna do then?
My brother is gonna flip out.

845
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:16,846
You gotta find a place to put those pallets.

846
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:19,415
I've checked the entire store, sir.
There isn't room available anywhere.

847
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:23,486
We can't afford to send these back, okay?
It will kill our margins.

848
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:24,687
You don't have a big brother.

849
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,256
You don't know what it's like
getting hit in the shins with a little cane.

850
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,959
I have a little sister, sir,
and she can be very cruel.

851
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,794
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

852
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:36,265
Hey, guys.
How many pallets are we talking about?

853
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,601
Well, where the hell is he?

854
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:43,573
You know, we can't keep playing
Texas Hold 'Em with three. It sucks.

855
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:46,342
- Cashiers have different break times.
- Yeah, well, it sucks.

856
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:48,878
I think he's gone to the dark side, guys.

857
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:53,179
- He wouldn't do that.
- It sucks.

858
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,217
- What?
- Okay.

859
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:59,856
There's only four people in the world
that know about this place.

860
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,891
And I don't think either one of us did this.

861
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:06,696
- So, who's the odd man out, huh?
- Sucky Zack.

862
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:14,197
He wouldn't do it on purpose, guys.
This is his lounge, too.

863
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:17,673
Not anymore.

864
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,376
- What, is it Zack?
- Check it out, eight balls.

865
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:25,977
- Tell me it's not Zack.
- I said it's him.

866
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,784
I knew it. He sucks ass.

867
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:32,822
Hey, what's up?

868
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,024
I have plans for tonight,
if you're interested.

869
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,125
Love to.

870
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,894
All right, I'll pick you up at your place
at 9:30.

871
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:40,495
- Okay, cool.
- Okay.

872
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:47,336
Excellent.

873
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,072
Hey, buddy, take a seat.

874
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,143
Welcome.

875
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:57,912
I won't bite. Come on.

876
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,483
- Nice, huh?
- Yes.

877
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:06,122
Downright decadent.
You know, the soda machine's free.

878
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,025
Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.
That's amazing.

879
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:11,194
Please, have a drink.

880
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:15,798
Yeah, yeah, thank you. Thanks very much.
Look at this, no dents.

881
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,399
Not in here.

882
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,569
Nice, huh? Cheers.

883
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:23,205
Oh, boy.

884
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:27,910
Look at us here, just a couple of soldiers
on the field of battle.

885
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:31,447
Sitting here like a couple of old gay sailors.

886
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:33,015
What are we doing?

887
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:37,253
I'll tell you what. Let's, you and I,
put our differences behind us.

888
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:42,525
You back off, I win E of M.
I get my car. Malibu.

889
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:45,445
I get the girl, I get the promotion.

890
01:02:45,546 --> 01:02:47,947
When they buck me up
to assistant manager,

891
01:02:48,048 --> 01:02:52,719
I'm gonna do you a solid.
I'll let you keep your job.

892
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,820
What do you say?

893
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:02,227
Thanks for the Coke.

894
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:06,432
Well, I've got something to say to you.

895
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,702
Nobody is going to stand in the way
of me and my Malibu.

896
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:11,904
Not a wall of fire.

897
01:03:12,005 --> 01:03:16,042
And as for butter buns, she's all mine.
So you can forget about that.

898
01:03:16,143 --> 01:03:20,480
- And does Jorge know about her?
- Jorge's none of your business.

899
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:22,014
Who do you think she'd rather be with?

900
01:03:22,115 --> 01:03:25,985
Some little lowly box boy
who fell ass-backwards into a job title,

901
01:03:26,086 --> 01:03:29,055
or King Dick, head cashier and winner

902
01:03:29,156 --> 01:03:31,591
of the southwest regional
speed ring competition?

903
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:34,460
Let me think about that for a second.
Hmm. I would say...

904
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:40,032
- The answer is me. Head cashier, smart-ass.
- I wouldn't be too sure about that, Vince.

905
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:44,904
I got bad news, bro.
Game over. I'd watch my back if I was you.

906
01:03:45,005 --> 01:03:46,773
- Were.
- What?

907
01:03:46,874 --> 01:03:49,974
- "Were you."
- Watch out.

908
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,260
Hey, guy.

909
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:12,496
What the hell happened
to our lounge, man?

910
01:04:12,597 --> 01:04:14,231
I know what you guys are thinking,
all right?

911
01:04:14,332 --> 01:04:16,901
But I'm three days away
from winning this thing.

912
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:19,136
I just gotta do what it takes, all right?
Small sacrifices.

913
01:04:19,237 --> 01:04:20,571
If I put some cheese up in the clubhouse,

914
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:22,006
you guys got to suck it up for a little bit.

915
01:04:22,107 --> 01:04:25,676
You know, it's just a temporary thing.
You with me, yes?

916
01:04:25,777 --> 01:04:27,678
Trust, is it right there?

917
01:04:27,779 --> 01:04:29,413
This is what I'm thinking.
At the end of this thing,

918
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:31,382
if it goes the way I think it's gonna go,

919
01:04:31,483 --> 01:04:35,419
I'm gonna be able to get you guys
into that lounge.

920
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,520
I know it. Cool?

921
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:41,192
I can see it. It's cool. All right.

922
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:42,293
Ass.

923
01:04:52,337 --> 01:04:53,837
- Hey.
- Hi.

924
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:59,139
- You look nice.
- Thank you. So do you.

925
01:05:02,147 --> 01:05:04,915
Clear. Come on. Come on.

926
01:05:05,016 --> 01:05:07,351
- Do you know the plan?
- Si. Got it.

927
01:05:07,452 --> 01:05:08,452
Okay.

928
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:15,259
- What is that smell?
- It smells funny. I don't know.

929
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,060
- Oh, God, did you fart?
- No.

930
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:31,034
- Where did you get these pantyhose?
- I got it from my mom's gym bag.

931
01:05:44,189 --> 01:05:47,789
- Did you get them all?
- Si.

932
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:53,063
- What are you eating?
- I don't know. It's like a salmon churro.

933
01:05:53,164 --> 01:05:58,164
- It's rancid.
- It's pretty good, homes.

934
01:06:05,277 --> 01:06:12,177
What are you doing?
There are no weapons in this mission.

935
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:25,095
I will not do time for you.
I will roll over on you.

936
01:06:25,196 --> 01:06:30,568
You said you were a Mexican,
not a Puerto Rican.

937
01:06:30,669 --> 01:06:32,770
Thanks again. I had a lot of fun.

938
01:06:32,871 --> 01:06:35,739
Yeah, I did... Did, too.

939
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,375
I didn't know anybody really ever won
these things.

940
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:43,614
- Well, I've tossed a lot of dimes in my day.
- I bet you have.

941
01:06:43,715 --> 01:06:47,615
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

942
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:48,919
All right.

943
01:06:53,058 --> 01:06:56,058
- All right.
- All right.

944
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:01,764
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

945
01:07:22,854 --> 01:07:25,654
What? No! No! No! Shit!

946
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:31,327
Twelve minutes! Shit!

947
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:40,971
Vince.

948
01:07:46,678 --> 01:07:53,278
Oh, I love the smell of a championship
in the morning.

949
01:08:00,091 --> 01:08:03,894
Have you guys seen Zack this morning?

950
01:08:03,995 --> 01:08:05,796
- What?
- Nothing.

951
01:08:05,897 --> 01:08:11,097
We haven't seen
box boy Zack this morning.

952
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:22,977
Move. Move. Move. Coming through.

953
01:08:23,348 --> 01:08:24,548
Excuse me.

954
01:08:26,184 --> 01:08:28,684
Too close. Too close.

955
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:39,029
Move!

956
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:32,081
Is that all you got?

957
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:40,224
Where's my card? Where...

958
01:09:40,325 --> 01:09:41,325
No. No.

959
01:09:43,128 --> 01:09:46,328
Yes! It's over. Of course.

960
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,398
Hey, Zack.

961
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:53,337
Mikhal's championship game is this Friday.

962
01:09:53,438 --> 01:09:55,038
On it, Iqbal.

963
01:10:01,646 --> 01:10:05,146
- You are...
- Right on time.

964
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:08,417
Thank you, Iqbal.

965
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,620
No!

966
01:10:12,924 --> 01:10:15,993
It's a large item.
I'll have someone bring it up.

967
01:10:16,094 --> 01:10:18,362
It's a great shirt.

968
01:10:18,463 --> 01:10:20,963
There you are. Radio.

969
01:10:21,499 --> 01:10:23,834
Check stand one. We've got a bulk item.

970
01:10:23,935 --> 01:10:26,670
"Piece o' shit Honda" on aisle 116.

971
01:10:26,771 --> 01:10:27,771
On it.

972
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:32,876
Vince, I think you're gonna wanna see this.

973
01:10:32,977 --> 01:10:36,577
Watch the stand for me, Jorge.

974
01:10:40,552 --> 01:10:42,853
What kind of a sick animal?

975
01:10:42,954 --> 01:10:45,289
God damn it. Someone get this down.

976
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:49,259
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, that is my car.

977
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,729
No, no, no, I bought it. Here is my receipt.

978
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,164
The only thing that you own
is that crazy Hawaiian shirt.

979
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:55,632
This is my vehicle.

980
01:10:55,733 --> 01:11:02,233
Hey, I need to see a manager right now!
Where is he?

981
01:11:10,882 --> 01:11:15,753
Technically, if it's on the rack and in
the system, we're required to sell it to him.

982
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:22,154
If we don't,
he's threatening to write a complaint.

983
01:11:31,169 --> 01:11:33,669
- Fine.
- I'm sorry.

984
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:50,580
Sometimes third gear sticks a little.
You gotta give it a little wiggle.

985
01:11:50,922 --> 01:11:53,222
I... Oh, all right.

986
01:11:57,629 --> 01:12:00,130
I can't believe you sold your wheels
to that dude.

987
01:12:00,231 --> 01:12:02,633
- You promised.
- I had to.

988
01:12:02,734 --> 01:12:07,171
And for $9,980 less
than what you would have charged me?

989
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:13,277
If I didn't, he was going to write me up.
One complaint, I'm out of the game.

990
01:12:13,378 --> 01:12:15,678
I'm sorry, wingman.

991
01:12:16,281 --> 01:12:19,781
I'm not your wingman anymore.

992
01:12:22,787 --> 01:12:25,189
You can't be serious.

993
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,590
You're nothing without me. You're...

994
01:12:36,701 --> 01:12:39,469
Yeah, baby. Read 'em and weep.

995
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:44,408
Looks like somebody's gonna need
a ride home.

996
01:12:44,509 --> 01:12:47,809
Well, well, well, 15 to 14.

997
01:12:49,881 --> 01:12:52,316
You gave me a pretty good run
back there, buddy.

998
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:54,318
But tomorrow is the last day.

999
01:12:54,419 --> 01:12:58,555
When I step out onto that softball field,
pop a couple dingers,

1000
01:12:58,656 --> 01:13:02,159
it's going to be celebration time
in my new Malibu.

1001
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:07,231
Well, Vince, you know what they say.
It ain't over till your mama sings.

1002
01:13:07,332 --> 01:13:12,032
Bad news, guy. Mama don't sing at all.

1003
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,471
Face.

1004
01:13:17,775 --> 01:13:21,478
As you know, Corporate,
a.k.a. My big brother, Glen Ross,

1005
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:23,080
will be attending the game.

1006
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:26,750
So, it's very important to me
and to all of you

1007
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:29,453
that we beat Maxi-Mart today.

1008
01:13:29,554 --> 01:13:32,856
- And, since the passing of...
- Janet.

1009
01:13:32,957 --> 01:13:39,529
...Janet, we are in dire need
and could really use an outfielder.

1010
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:43,730
Anyone? Anyone. An outfielder, so...

1011
01:13:45,703 --> 01:13:47,603
Anyone? Somebody?

1012
01:13:48,873 --> 01:13:52,976
Anyone at all? Some... Zack Bradley.

1013
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:55,178
- You're our guy.
- Yeah.

1014
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:56,780
- Okay. That's good.
- Yes.

1015
01:13:56,881 --> 01:14:02,381
Okay. All right.
Everybody, be safe out there.

1016
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:04,087
Wish me luck.

1017
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:10,594
- Hey, hey, Zack. What are you doing?
- I'm going to the softball game.

1018
01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:13,430
You were going to cover for me.
Mikhal's game, remember?

1019
01:14:13,531 --> 01:14:15,999
I'm sorry, I can't.

1020
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,000
But it's a championship.

1021
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:23,907
- I got it.
- You sure?

1022
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:26,009
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- You're a good friend.

1023
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:27,110
Thanks.

1024
01:14:27,912 --> 01:14:29,712
All right, bud.

1025
01:14:35,019 --> 01:14:37,619
35, 36, 37, 38, 39...

1026
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:46,763
Damn it. Why are our uniforms pink?

1027
01:14:46,864 --> 01:14:49,666
We accidentally washed them
with the red socks.

1028
01:14:49,767 --> 01:14:52,269
Play ball. Super Club, take the field!

1029
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:53,470
- Take the field!
- Oh, no.

1030
01:14:53,571 --> 01:14:58,671
Seven, eight, nine... Dang it! We're short.

1031
01:14:58,776 --> 01:15:01,445
You know, I didn't mean that. We're...
You know...

1032
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:05,048
I meant, where is Zack?
Please don't point the stick at me.

1033
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:10,049
- I'm gonna call Mom.
- Don't call Mom.

1034
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:28,101
Look alive out there, for Christ's sake!

1035
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:30,540
No batter! No batter!

1036
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:38,541
Act like you've held a stick that big before.
You know you have.

1037
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,485
What do you call that?

1038
01:15:41,586 --> 01:15:43,053
I call that my best.

1039
01:15:43,154 --> 01:15:45,489
And I heard you out there,
and I didn't appreciate it.

1040
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:47,290
Just get back.

1041
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:50,427
Who's up?

1042
01:15:58,803 --> 01:16:00,903
I'm out of here.

1043
01:16:03,508 --> 01:16:05,375
Renfroe, looking good.

1044
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:09,546
Looking real good. Nice. Super good.

1045
01:16:09,647 --> 01:16:11,448
Put it in his curve tank, buddy. Come on.

1046
01:16:11,549 --> 01:16:15,649
- Come on, Jorge.
- Come on, baby.

1047
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,794
That's what I'm talking about, Zack.

1048
01:16:23,895 --> 01:16:25,095
Pull your head out of your ass, ump!

1049
01:16:25,196 --> 01:16:29,896
It hit the ground. The ball's no good!

1050
01:16:35,606 --> 01:16:39,206
That's right! Way to go! Yes!

1051
01:16:40,678 --> 01:16:45,978
This is baloney! Check the bat, it's corked!

1052
01:16:53,357 --> 01:16:59,529
Here we go, boys. We're down by a few.
Only down by a few. We can do this.

1053
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,630
Not in my house.

1054
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:03,500
Nice, Glen Gary. Nice.

1055
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:07,401
Yes, come on! Way to come back!

1056
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:13,210
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1057
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:15,011
Shut up, Mary.

1058
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:18,646
Why won't you trust me?

1059
01:17:22,653 --> 01:17:24,053
You're out!

1060
01:17:24,989 --> 01:17:27,858
- What? Are you kidding me?
- I said you're out!

1061
01:17:27,959 --> 01:17:30,794
- What are you talking about?
- Can't you hear me, you're out!

1062
01:17:30,895 --> 01:17:33,864
Iqbal, please report to Electronics.

1063
01:17:33,965 --> 01:17:37,265
Iqbal to Electronics, please.

1064
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:44,137
Come on, guys,
just got to hold them here.

1065
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:49,279
You work for me. Get out there and get it.

1066
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,849
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Time.

1067
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:56,887
What? Time out? Can we please respect
the sanctity of this game?

1068
01:17:56,988 --> 01:18:00,858
Everybody take a knee. Hop down here.

1069
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,326
Grab a knee, come on.

1070
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:05,727
All right, we can win this.

1071
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,932
And we can win this
the Super Club way, okay?

1072
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:10,868
And until today,
I didn't even know what that meant.

1073
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:14,438
In fact, I still don't, but I do know this.

1074
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:17,741
We're a team out here. I mean, look at us.

1075
01:18:17,842 --> 01:18:20,377
Glen Ross, I thought you
were going to be a stuffed shirt out here.

1076
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:22,646
The way you took down that catcher,
are you kidding me?

1077
01:18:22,747 --> 01:18:24,948
You're the balls, man!
You're the balls and the taint.

1078
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:26,416
You're that whole region.

1079
01:18:26,517 --> 01:18:28,586
And you, I don't even know you
on a personal level,

1080
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:31,489
but you sign off on my paychecks.
That's a good thing.

1081
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:35,359
Amy, you're wonderful.
Don't change a thing.

1082
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,428
Glen Gary, you got us pink uniforms, yes,

1083
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:39,864
but, you know what? That's what unites us.

1084
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,632
These uniforms unite us,

1085
01:18:41,733 --> 01:18:44,502
because we are all pink
on the inside, right?

1086
01:18:44,603 --> 01:18:48,203
Yeah, we're pink like vaginas.

1087
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:54,746
Good guess, Vince. We're Super Club.

1088
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:58,015
- Where buying in bulk is what?
- Our God-given right!

1089
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:01,816
- Let's win this game!
- Yeah!

1090
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:06,257
Come on, guys, two outs. We're up by one.
We just got to hold them right here.

1091
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:09,460
You all better get your umbrellas out
because there's a storm coming.

1092
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:13,461
Come on, Jorge, give it to them!

1093
01:19:31,617 --> 01:19:32,817
I got it.

1094
01:20:02,781 --> 01:20:06,117
- Okay, people!
- Quiet down, everybody!

1095
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,921
Let's get down to business. Okay.

1096
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:12,223
Thank you, Zack,
for coming through for us.

1097
01:20:12,324 --> 01:20:13,524
- A sweet victory.
- Yeah.

1098
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:15,960
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, yeah!

1099
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,861
Good job, Zack.

1100
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:21,465
What this means is a tie
for employee of the month,

1101
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:24,669
which has never happened before, ever.

1102
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:26,337
Now, we've decided
tomorrow at the banquet

1103
01:20:26,438 --> 01:20:29,974
we're going to have a check stand ring-off.
Winner take all.

1104
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:34,278
Now back to work.
Be safe out there. Nice job.

1105
01:20:34,379 --> 01:20:37,979
Thank you. Nice job! Nice job!

1106
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,800
I can't do this alone.

1107
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:01,738
I'm gonna need you.

1108
01:21:03,175 --> 01:21:05,275
Please. Come home.

1109
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:19,991
I'm gonna need some time to think.

1110
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:22,392
I understand. I do.

1111
01:21:24,896 --> 01:21:29,396
I'm gonna give you your space, homes.

1112
01:21:56,795 --> 01:22:00,097
I did it. I did it. I tied it up.

1113
01:22:00,198 --> 01:22:03,834
I tied it up. What's going on?

1114
01:22:03,935 --> 01:22:06,203
- They fired him.
- Why?

1115
01:22:06,304 --> 01:22:09,507
Apparently, Action Media
did a special on dirty electricity,

1116
01:22:09,608 --> 01:22:14,078
and there was a mad rush on power strips
while he was at Mogala's soccer game.

1117
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,581
- But I was...
- You were supposed to cover for me.

1118
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:18,950
We had a deal.

1119
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:21,485
Okay, now wait a minute, all right,
I was taking your advice.

1120
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:22,653
Taking pride in my work.

1121
01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:29,593
But that is a little bit harder
when I'm taking pride in your work, too.

1122
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:37,535
- Wait a minute. Let me just say something.
- I think you've done enough, guy.

1123
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:41,036
I can see right through you.

1124
01:22:43,642 --> 01:22:44,842
Hey, Zack.

1125
01:22:44,943 --> 01:22:50,214
We're taking all the cashiers out
to the Steaksmith. Come on, let's go.

1126
01:22:50,315 --> 01:22:51,315
Come on.

1127
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:58,522
You made me so proud out there today.
Come on.

1128
01:22:58,623 --> 01:23:01,292
- Look at him.
- No, don't.

1129
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,194
He's at the big boys' table.

1130
01:23:03,295 --> 01:23:04,295
Vince.

1131
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:07,331
Didn't realize it was going to be
such a competition for you.

1132
01:23:07,432 --> 01:23:09,667
You're like a skilled surgeon
behind that register.

1133
01:23:09,768 --> 01:23:10,801
You guys seen his counter?

1134
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:13,604
Not a speck of dust,
not a single tool out of place.

1135
01:23:13,705 --> 01:23:19,176
- I guess I can get a little anal.
- Actually, I hear he gets a lot.

1136
01:23:19,277 --> 01:23:21,477
Now, that's funny!

1137
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,181
Hey, why don't we send the little lady
to get some drinks?

1138
01:23:24,282 --> 01:23:26,584
I don't think that Amy appreciates you
referring to her...

1139
01:23:26,685 --> 01:23:30,185
I'm talking about you, Nancy.

1140
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:33,958
- It's okay, I'll go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

1141
01:23:34,059 --> 01:23:35,059
Oh, boy.

1142
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:38,429
Hey, I read that girl's personal file.

1143
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:43,667
I hear she only likes to go after
the employee of the month.

1144
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:44,968
Excuse me.

1145
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:48,472
What's up, fellas?

1146
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:52,977
I don't know who threw the lime,
but that was a good shot.

1147
01:23:53,078 --> 01:23:55,446
Check it out, Iqbal. Listen to this.

1148
01:23:55,547 --> 01:23:58,849
I know you got fired, but I'm getting
in pretty tight with management now,

1149
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:01,552
and I think that I could
turn this thing around.

1150
01:24:01,653 --> 01:24:04,955
That's it? You're in tight with management?

1151
01:24:05,056 --> 01:24:08,059
You used to be tight with us,
with your friends.

1152
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,428
You used to be someone
we could count on.

1153
01:24:10,529 --> 01:24:14,265
Not anymore. I'm sick and tired
of sticking up for you, Zack.

1154
01:24:14,366 --> 01:24:16,200
Yeah, what happened to you, man?

1155
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,170
You're like the drummer
from REO Speedwagon.

1156
01:24:19,271 --> 01:24:21,372
Nobody knows who you are.

1157
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,941
You're becoming one of them.
You're turning into Vince.

1158
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:28,279
- Wait a second. I am not like Vince.
- No, you're worse.

1159
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,681
At least Vince isn't pretending
to be an asshole.

1160
01:24:30,782 --> 01:24:31,782
But you,

1161
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:35,352
you're pretending to be one of them
just so you can get into Amy's pants.

1162
01:24:35,453 --> 01:24:37,253
Step off, okay?

1163
01:24:38,056 --> 01:24:40,591
The Zack we know wouldn't have sold out
his friends

1164
01:24:40,692 --> 01:24:44,395
just because some slinky-ass blond tart

1165
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,932
would sleep
with the employee of the month.

1166
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:50,233
So, just step off.

1167
01:24:54,039 --> 01:24:55,639
Is that true?

1168
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:03,747
Hey, Amy.

1169
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:07,750
Is that the blond tart?

1170
01:25:09,387 --> 01:25:11,387
Did she hear me?

1171
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:15,691
Amy, Amy, wait. Amy.

1172
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:18,429
You actually thought
that I would sleep with you

1173
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:24,930
if you won employee of the month?
Who told you that?

1174
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:28,070
Your personal file.

1175
01:25:30,475 --> 01:25:31,475
I see.

1176
01:25:31,943 --> 01:25:35,679
So that's why you've been
working so hard, huh?

1177
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:37,880
No. Yes. Kind of.

1178
01:25:41,019 --> 01:25:45,956
I heard that,
and then I saw you with Vince, and...

1179
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,392
- I thought you were different, Zack.
- Amy...

1180
01:25:48,493 --> 01:25:51,462
You want to know if I screwed the
employee of the month at my last job?

1181
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,699
- No.
- Well, I did. But he was also my boyfriend,

1182
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,804
and a lying, conniving, asshole-user,
just like you.

1183
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:05,376
You employees of the months
are all the same.

1184
01:26:05,477 --> 01:26:06,577
Amy. Amy.

1185
01:27:24,189 --> 01:27:29,927
Why aren't you dressed for work?
Isn't today the big day?

1186
01:27:30,028 --> 01:27:32,028
- I quit.
- Why?

1187
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:39,003
I screwed up, Grams.
Amy hates me. My friends hate me.

1188
01:27:39,104 --> 01:27:41,939
Everybody's right about me. I'm a loser.

1189
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,909
- Well, you're certainly dressed for the part.
- Thanks, Grams.

1190
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:50,247
You know that loser that lost
all my retirement money?

1191
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:54,948
Well, at least that guy actually tried.

1192
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:59,253
I'll take the old Zack any day.

1193
01:28:07,966 --> 01:28:11,201
Wow, it's only been a day.

1194
01:28:11,302 --> 01:28:13,402
You look terrible.

1195
01:28:13,838 --> 01:28:17,374
- Are the boys in there?
- Yeah. Guys.

1196
01:28:17,475 --> 01:28:18,475
Go play.

1197
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:29,887
- What are you doing here, guy?
- Just hear me out, all right, guys?

1198
01:28:29,988 --> 01:28:33,924
I'm sorry for what happened,
and I apologize for my behavior.

1199
01:28:34,025 --> 01:28:36,126
I forgot who my real friends are.

1200
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:40,664
Iqbal, I talked to Glen
and I gave my resignation.

1201
01:28:40,765 --> 01:28:43,200
I took full responsibility
for what happened.

1202
01:28:43,301 --> 01:28:45,135
You got your job back.

1203
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,272
- I don't want the job back.
- What?

1204
01:28:48,373 --> 01:28:50,274
Turns out me getting fired
gave Humera the courage

1205
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:53,544
to demand a promotion last night.
I'm a stay-at-home Daddy now.

1206
01:28:53,645 --> 01:28:59,145
Can you believe it?
I should be thanking you.

1207
01:29:00,785 --> 01:29:02,319
You know, Iqbal,
you said something the other day,

1208
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:06,123
and you were right.
The universe has a plan.

1209
01:29:06,224 --> 01:29:08,092
I'm going to win that competition.

1210
01:29:08,193 --> 01:29:09,593
And I'm not going to do it
for employee of the month,

1211
01:29:09,694 --> 01:29:10,861
I'm not going to do it to beat Vince,

1212
01:29:10,962 --> 01:29:14,264
I'm not even going to do it for Amy.
I'm going to do it for myself.

1213
01:29:14,365 --> 01:29:18,165
For pride. But I need you guys.

1214
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:21,070
Are you with me?

1215
01:29:23,675 --> 01:29:25,008
We never went anywhere.

1216
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:30,047
Yeah, but wait a minute, Zack.
You just said you quit.

1217
01:29:30,148 --> 01:29:32,082
Yeah, that does pose a problem, doesn't it?

1218
01:29:32,183 --> 01:29:35,683
Hey, we got you covered, guy.

1219
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:41,120
Nothing a little broken chocolate won't fix.

1220
01:29:41,326 --> 01:29:42,826
Thanks, guys.

1221
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:03,313
Hey, watch it.

1222
01:30:07,218 --> 01:30:08,618
Nice wheels.

1223
01:30:18,396 --> 01:30:21,131
- I'll come back on one condition.
- Name it.

1224
01:30:21,232 --> 01:30:25,202
You give me full access
to the cashiers' lounge.

1225
01:30:25,303 --> 01:30:26,303
Done.

1226
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:33,908
It's good to have you back.

1227
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:38,747
It just feels right.

1228
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,351
Okay.

1229
01:30:45,623 --> 01:30:46,923
Home slice.

1230
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,260
You can do it, boss.

1231
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:54,731
You know, we're like
shampoo and conditioner, you know.

1232
01:30:54,832 --> 01:31:02,232
We're like ham and cheese.
We're like bread and pumpernickel.

1233
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:11,014
So, I heard about you and Zack.
I am so sorry.

1234
01:31:11,115 --> 01:31:16,186
The guys who cut corners
cannot be trusted.

1235
01:31:16,287 --> 01:31:22,059
But I want you to know something.
I'm willing to fight to save our relationship.

1236
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,596
I hope you are, too, because I love you.

1237
01:31:25,697 --> 01:31:26,697
Face.

1238
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:34,104
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go defend your honor.

1239
01:31:34,205 --> 01:31:37,774
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

1240
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:40,611
I have a sad announcement.

1241
01:31:40,712 --> 01:31:43,347
Zack Bradley quit this morning.

1242
01:31:43,448 --> 01:31:45,048
Yes! Come on!

1243
01:31:47,218 --> 01:31:52,418
So, it looks as if Vince is going to be...

1244
01:32:19,251 --> 01:32:20,384
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1245
01:32:20,485 --> 01:32:24,922
No, he already quit, you said.
And everyone heard and then...

1246
01:32:25,023 --> 01:32:29,694
Technically, the papers were never filed.

1247
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:32,396
Oh, my goodness,
you sold yourself for a candy bar?

1248
01:32:32,497 --> 01:32:34,732
Is that true? Is he still employed?

1249
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:35,833
How could you?

1250
01:32:35,934 --> 01:32:37,702
Put that chocolate bar down
and do your job.

1251
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:39,270
Let's get this party started.

1252
01:32:39,371 --> 01:32:44,375
All right. Okay. Now we're talking.
It's a virtual tie for employee of the month.

1253
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,511
Today's work will determine the winner.

1254
01:32:46,612 --> 01:32:49,947
Now, we've placed the exact same amount
of product in each cart,

1255
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:53,584
along with a curveball or two.
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

1256
01:32:53,685 --> 01:33:00,185
So whoever has the fastest ring rate
will win it all.

1257
01:33:02,628 --> 01:33:05,328
Juan, give me the gun.

1258
01:33:06,064 --> 01:33:07,664
Give me that.

1259
01:33:09,101 --> 01:33:11,802
Listen, I know you have every reason
to hate me.

1260
01:33:11,903 --> 01:33:15,103
I lied, and I regret that,

1261
01:33:15,807 --> 01:33:18,376
because I was that slacker
who lived with his grandmother,

1262
01:33:18,477 --> 01:33:20,578
and had everybody do his job for him.

1263
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:23,080
So I wanted to apologize
and I want to thank you.

1264
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,281
Thank me?

1265
01:33:25,384 --> 01:33:32,584
Because if it wasn't for you, Amy,
I'd still be that guy.

1266
01:33:33,158 --> 01:33:34,225
All right, let's do this.

1267
01:33:34,326 --> 01:33:35,826
Put it back.

1268
01:33:36,261 --> 01:33:39,163
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I need somebody to box for me.

1269
01:33:39,264 --> 01:33:41,732
Okay, you know what? I'll do it.

1270
01:33:41,833 --> 01:33:45,069
Come on. Come on, dingle eyes, take a left.

1271
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:46,771
Hey, man. Thanks, brother.

1272
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:50,872
Okay, everyone, be safe out there.

1273
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:52,043
Go!

1274
01:33:52,277 --> 01:33:57,877
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on. Go get him!

1275
01:33:57,983 --> 01:33:58,983
Wow.

1276
01:33:59,084 --> 01:34:00,484
Go, go, go.

1277
01:34:02,688 --> 01:34:03,788
Come on, Zack.

1278
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:08,089
- Zack!
- You're doing a good job.

1279
01:34:11,496 --> 01:34:13,896
You're getting weak.

1280
01:34:14,299 --> 01:34:15,299
Tampon.

1281
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:20,800
- All right! Way to go!
- You are fantastic.

1282
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,448
Vince, there's one more item.

1283
01:34:30,549 --> 01:34:32,483
- Come on, let's go.
- Zack!

1284
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:33,985
Watch out below!

1285
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:36,686
- Jorge!
- What? What?

1286
01:34:43,628 --> 01:34:45,997
- Curveball.
- What to do?

1287
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:47,765
No price-checking available!

1288
01:34:47,866 --> 01:34:49,767
- Come on, get out of there, dude, go.
- Come on, guys.

1289
01:34:49,868 --> 01:34:52,068
Come on, run, run.

1290
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:59,810
Zack!

1291
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:05,082
- Open-ended cart!
- What do you do? What do you do?

1292
01:35:05,183 --> 01:35:06,183
Come on!

1293
01:35:08,253 --> 01:35:10,553
Restock the shelves.

1294
01:35:10,689 --> 01:35:13,789
Be careful with the items.

1295
01:35:21,867 --> 01:35:22,967
Surrender!

1296
01:35:23,268 --> 01:35:25,468
Surrender, box boy.

1297
01:35:27,739 --> 01:35:32,777
- Come on, guys, come on.
- Yeah, yeah. You got it.

1298
01:35:32,878 --> 01:35:33,978
Curveball.

1299
01:35:35,113 --> 01:35:41,413
Old woman in need of assistance.
Bunion pads, please.

1300
01:35:50,896 --> 01:35:51,996
Yes! Yes!

1301
01:35:55,033 --> 01:36:00,433
Here we go! Back to the registers! Let's go.

1302
01:36:15,287 --> 01:36:19,023
And the tiebreaker goes to Vince Downey!

1303
01:36:19,124 --> 01:36:21,624
Now, that's teamwork.

1304
01:36:29,067 --> 01:36:30,768
Man, you did your best, dude.

1305
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:33,537
Be proud. You did great.

1306
01:36:33,638 --> 01:36:37,138
It wasn't enough. I blew it.

1307
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:58,829
- Excuse me, everybody. Excuse me.
- Well,

1308
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:02,833
never in the history of Super Club
has anyone won employee of the month

1309
01:37:02,934 --> 01:37:04,535
18 times in a row.

1310
01:37:04,636 --> 01:37:07,536
But tonight, someone has.

1311
01:37:08,507 --> 01:37:10,708
The complaint box, please.
Just to make sure.

1312
01:37:10,809 --> 01:37:12,109
Sure. Sure.

1313
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:17,579
Oh, there is something here.

1314
01:37:18,884 --> 01:37:23,254
- "Super Club blows."
- That was close, huh, Vince?

1315
01:37:23,355 --> 01:37:27,591
Our champion and winner
of a brand-newish Chevy Malibu,

1316
01:37:27,692 --> 01:37:31,892
Vince Downey. Downey! Downey! Downey!

1317
01:37:42,574 --> 01:37:46,777
Thank you. You are such an inspiration.

1318
01:37:46,878 --> 01:37:50,181
And all of you, the little people
that make Super Club

1319
01:37:50,282 --> 01:37:51,916
- the place it is.
- You're an ass.

1320
01:37:52,017 --> 01:37:55,619
You are the scaffolding on top of which
I stand so high right now.

1321
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,420
And you, Zack,

1322
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:00,324
you made it a race.

1323
01:38:00,425 --> 01:38:02,460
Thank you. But I won.

1324
01:38:02,561 --> 01:38:04,962
Excuse me, sir.
I think there's something you ought to see.

1325
01:38:05,063 --> 01:38:07,665
Okay, big 'uns, why don't you go kill
a couple of sandwiches there?

1326
01:38:07,766 --> 01:38:10,267
Go ahead, find your way back
to the desert cart and graze a little bit.

1327
01:38:10,368 --> 01:38:12,536
Not right now, Semi.
We're in the middle of something.

1328
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,105
Surveillance footage
of the competition, sir.

1329
01:38:15,206 --> 01:38:17,908
We're in the middle of a celebration.
Okay, all right.

1330
01:38:18,009 --> 01:38:19,443
Well, he is very large.

1331
01:38:19,544 --> 01:38:24,114
This is unconventional. Listen.
But I just want to recap.

1332
01:38:24,215 --> 01:38:26,417
I did some amazing things today.

1333
01:38:26,518 --> 01:38:28,418
Sir, watch this.

1334
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:33,023
That's the kind of speed that won me
the southwest regional competition.

1335
01:38:33,124 --> 01:38:34,892
I'm embarrassed, actually.

1336
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:41,993
Sir, I'll rewind it again.
But this time, watch the oats.

1337
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:46,537
- Well, what? I...
- Hold on.

1338
01:38:46,638 --> 01:38:47,638
- Look at this one.
- What?

1339
01:38:47,739 --> 01:38:49,539
Watch the oats.

1340
01:38:52,644 --> 01:38:56,847
He tampered with it.
I mean Zack clearly paid the retard.

1341
01:38:56,948 --> 01:38:58,315
It's a forgery.

1342
01:38:58,416 --> 01:39:02,186
- Am I seeing this correctly?
- You see, sir, he didn't rung it up.

1343
01:39:02,287 --> 01:39:04,588
Not only did he cheat
during the competition,

1344
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,625
he's been giving away free stuff
all year long.

1345
01:39:07,726 --> 01:39:08,726
Absurd.

1346
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:12,296
- You see, I got the tapes to prove it, sir.
- What a ridiculous allegation.

1347
01:39:12,397 --> 01:39:15,065
Sir. He's right, sir.
These are from the registers.

1348
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:18,168
Same carts, same amount of items.
Different totals.

1349
01:39:18,269 --> 01:39:19,470
Vince Downey.

1350
01:39:19,571 --> 01:39:22,506
You're the fastest, all right.
Fastest criminal in the southwest.

1351
01:39:22,607 --> 01:39:23,607
Hey.

1352
01:39:26,911 --> 01:39:29,246
That's why they call you Semi.

1353
01:39:29,347 --> 01:39:33,851
Vince Downey, you are a disgrace to me
and to the Super Club chain!

1354
01:39:33,952 --> 01:39:36,752
I am not proud of you.

1355
01:39:37,622 --> 01:39:40,391
Get that scum out of here
before I kick his ass myself.

1356
01:39:40,492 --> 01:39:41,492
Yeah!

1357
01:39:52,671 --> 01:39:56,273
Ladies and gentlemen,
it looks like employee of the month

1358
01:39:56,374 --> 01:39:59,944
will go to the runner-up, Zack Bradley.

1359
01:40:00,045 --> 01:40:02,945
Yes! Yes! Congratulations.

1360
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,515
You've won everything.

1361
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:15,391
That is wonderful.

1362
01:40:17,328 --> 01:40:23,567
- Hold on, he's going in, he's going in.
- He's going.

1363
01:40:23,668 --> 01:40:24,868
Thank you.

1364
01:40:26,638 --> 01:40:28,272
- Listen, I just wanted...
- Listen, I just wanted...

1365
01:40:28,373 --> 01:40:30,274
- You go.
- You go.

1366
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:31,375
Okay.

1367
01:40:37,515 --> 01:40:40,284
So does this mean
that you only go for the...

1368
01:40:40,385 --> 01:40:45,685
I guess you'll have to find out next month.

1369
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:47,324
- Are they kissing?
- They're kissing.

1370
01:40:47,425 --> 01:40:52,525
- They're kissing, yeah.
- They're kissing.

1371
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:17,050
- I love this song.
- It's the best.

1372
01:41:21,192 --> 01:41:25,062
So, Maxi-Mart really makes you wear
those things, huh, bro?

1373
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:29,233
Maxi-Mart? No. Jorge, I am on probation.

1374
01:41:29,334 --> 01:41:30,601
I'm under house arrest.

1375
01:41:30,702 --> 01:41:35,472
I can't go more than a mile away
from my home and/or work.

1376
01:41:35,573 --> 01:41:38,873
It's cool though, I'm out.

1377
01:41:40,712 --> 01:41:44,815
I gotta hand it to you. The car looks tip-top.
It really is immaculate.

1378
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:45,916
I know.

1379
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:50,587
- Hey, can I take it for a spin?
- No.

1380
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:55,426
- Well, can you give me a ride to...
- No.

1381
01:41:55,527 --> 01:41:58,729
How about a ride to the bus stop?

1382
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,030
Absolutely.

1383
01:42:00,498 --> 01:42:03,000
Jorge, blinks mean it's the border.
No, are you going past...

1384
01:42:03,101 --> 01:42:04,134
All right, you got to let me out.

1385
01:42:04,236 --> 01:42:11,236
Jorge! Go back! Go back!
We're past the mile. God. Jorge!

1386
01:45:04,236 --> 01:45:11,236
THE END
