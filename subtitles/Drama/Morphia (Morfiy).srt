We waited so long for Your Majesty!
For so many days!!

3
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
I'm not any Majesty.

4
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,920
Call me a doctor or Michal Alekseyevich.

5
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,600

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720

10
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,600

11
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,080
Good Morning mr. Doctor!

13
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,600
Be so kind and put the samovar on

14
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,720
let me introduce myself...

15
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,320
Anatolij Lukicz Demianienko.

16
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,040
Local surgeon.

17
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,040
Dr. Polakov, nice to meet You.

18
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
We are awaiting You .. from spring.

19
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,679
We were writing and writing...
Yours predecessor, Leopold Leopoldowicz,

20
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
began to make efforts but...

21
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,520
but how to work without doctor?

22
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,720
Necessary to send patients...

23
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,199
- to the town.
- Yes.

24
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Please I take Your coat.

25
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,200
They noticed us at last.

26
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,519
Or we have to wait till spring again.

27
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,040
But that's understendable, now You
can't drag here anybody even by force.

28
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes... please let me introduce.

29
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,720
Our midwifes...

30
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,400
and also sisters of mercy.

31
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
Anna Nikolajewna...

32
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
Pelagia Iwanowna.

33
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,640
Doktor Polakow... Michal Alekseyevich.

34
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,760
I... You know... I've frozen a bit

35
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
and like to warm up.

36
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,160
- Warm up...
- Oh, yes, on God!

37
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,080
Yes of Course. This is Your home

38
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll take Your things. Quiet!

39
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,600
Right away... right away
Come in, please.

40
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,319
Aksinia will be your cook.

41
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,280
You'll warm up soon.

42
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,800
I'll put the samovar on...

43
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
and Aksinia.. and she'll cook the rooster.

44
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,880
Maybe a bit of vodka?

45
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,240
Here!

46
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Here is a study...

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
Leopold's ...that means now it's Yours.

48
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,240
Earlier, gentleman from...
here...

49
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,000
Nikolski district patronized us.

50
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,200
Leopold Leopoldowicz constantly
ordered the books...

51
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,599
from catalogue.

52
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
And we have enough medicines
for two revolutions.

53
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,640
And when this in february happened,
he disapeared... at once!

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
He left even the gramophone.

55
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,520
Records... also his.

56
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,200
He liked russian music.

57
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,240
Here he slept.

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,400
Here please...

59
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,880
And it is our pharmacy.

60
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,760
Careful!

61
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,960
Can You hold it?

62
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,200
It... here is our pharmacy

63
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,200
ointments... acids... leeches.

64
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
We have them also!!

65
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,200
Painkillers...

66
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,720
cafeine... campfor...

67
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Morphine.

68
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Incipine... the last jar...

69
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,720
left.

70
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
Please here...

71
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Ju¿, ju¿, ju¿...

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
And here is operating/surgery room.

73
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,800
And... how many they
bring to delivery here?

74
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,760
Well... people aren't educated here,
they still call for witch doctors first.

75
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
They bring them here after
their so called... operations.

76
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,800
Once one of them decided

77
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,799
to cut the bag of waters...

78
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,600
they bring the child here after 24 hours

79
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,480
whole head cutted by knife.

80
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,920
But... Leopold Leopoldowicz
was great specialist...

81
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,200
on complicated child births.

82
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,000
You have decent equipment here.
Yes!

83
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
Sometimes it happened that he
operated from dusk till down.

84
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,320
He ordered only the best
equipment from Germany, yes!

85
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,520
- And what was Leopold's family name?
- A... family name?

86
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,120
We always called him by fathers name...

87
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,000
after fathers name... hm...

88
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,400
So how he signed the receipts?

89
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,200
Usually... Leopold.

90
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,200
Let's go there... o!

91
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,033
I made bed for You upstairs,
and if it will be

92
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:14,160
too cold, an extra duvet
is in the cabinet.

93
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,640
And if You wake up and need something
please tap onto the oven doors,

94
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,040
we will be here, downstairs, on that side

95
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,120
a bell which someone torn off...
ah yes, Leopold Leopoldowicz, yes...

96
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,760
Let the God protect You
please rest,

97
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Maybe they won't bring anyone tonight.
Chamber pot is there too.

98
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, thank You.

99
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,440
Thank You... let the Christ protect You.

100
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,000
FIRST INJECTION

101
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Your Majesty!

102
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
Your Majesty!

103
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Your Majesty, Disaster... your majesty!

104
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
Doctor! A man is dying there!

105
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,999
Dying? What's happening?

106
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,320
He tosses on the floor,
and he is blue already.

107
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600
Doctor!

108
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,159
- Where is surgeon?
- He sleeps there.

109
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,600
Please wake him up.

110
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,840
Anatolij Lukicz!

111
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,040
It's the end.

112
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
Heart stopped to beat.

113
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
So what was the reason of his death?
We have to write a certificate.

114
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,120
Eh better don't bother with it.

115
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,120
His family will moan, they'll
say that he was butchered in hospital!

116
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,920
They don't need any certificate.

117
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Anyway they won't agree with what's in it.

118
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,960
What a nonsence, You know that he died
of diphtheria, they should know about it.

119
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,400
He died of heart attack.
He get sudden attack and died.

120
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,400
Diphtheria!
Diphtheria have nothing to do with it.

121
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,639
Diphtheria...

122
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,320
I understand.

123
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,200
Heart attack or they'll keep telling that I
was unable to cure him from child illness.

124
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,119
I killed my first patient.

125
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,200
Michal Alekseyevich, I prepared You a
vaccine against diphteria.

126
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,439
Tell Anna Nikolajewna, that it looks like
I have alergic reaction for vaccine,

127
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,498
so let she come and
take a morphine with her.

128
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,200
I understand.

129
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,599
So what I have to tell her?

130
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,120
- That I got illness from vaccine.
- Aha...

131
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,600
Just... give her that.

132
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Thank You.

133
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,160
WINTER

134
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,400
Michal Alekseyevich!

135
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,840
- How You slept?
- Excellent. Thank You.

136
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,719
Why haven't you woke me?
Is there anybody to examine?

137
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
There was one, with a tooth.

138
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,360
Michal Alekseyevich, people are talking
that in Petersburg...

139
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,950
is a new revolution, again.

140
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:38,560
I havn't heard about it...
they are talking about it?

141
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,520
Yyy... Yes they are talking.

142
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,200
Wlas!
Put on samovar and water to wash!

143
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,983
How are You,
Michal Alekseyevich?

144
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:19,800
You have precious
hands, Annoa Nikolajewna!

145
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
Excellent!
I wake up completely healthy.

146
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,680
Michal Alekseyevich, won't You try
my jam from gooseberry?

147
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,439
From gooseberry? With pleasure.

148
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,120
I decided to make jam from
goosberry this year.

149
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,960
Pelagia Iwanowna make jams better...

150
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
Yes... probably better

151
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,840
I'm not sure, not sure...

152
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,000
Anatolij Lukicz, how many
patients were today?

153
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,360
22 persons.

154
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Two of them we left in hospital.

155
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,548
But when the snow storms
starts, it happens,

156
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,800
that no one cames
here even for a week.

157
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,720
Please drink You tea, Michal Alekseyevich,
before it gets cold.

158
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,000
In whole it's time to go to sleep,
You must be tired.

159
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
O... someone is coming!

160
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,240
Yees...

161
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,400
Looks like we wanted to
go to sleep too early.

162
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,800
I'll go and see... Delivery for sure.

163
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,200
Well?
They drove a breeding woman, from Zalewsk.

164
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,908
Please look, looks like

178
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,120

179
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,960

210
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,600

Pliers.

218
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,480
Maybe we shouldn't touch the second leg?

219
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,502
Only bandage it... You
know, then they won't

220
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:11,400
say that she died
on operating table.

221
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,240
Prepare plaster.

222
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
Is she dead?

223
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,560
Alive.

224
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,640

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,600

Please call me if she dies.

227
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
- Even Leopold wouldn't do that better!
- Yes!

228
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,080
And You... call the father.

229
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,480
BLIZZARD

230
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,200
Good morning, Your Majesty!

231
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,720
And where is Anna Nikolajewna?

232
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,000
- So, is she alive?
- Alive, alive.

233
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,600
I think all will be OK, she's sleeping now.

234
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,840
- Good morning, Anna Nikolajewna.
- Good morning, doctor

235
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,080
Anna Nikolajewna, I...

236
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,199
I want only to say...
They have bring a several more.

237
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,080
Turn Your head to my side.

238
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,480
I didn't want to disturb You after...
such operation...

239
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,280
One of them have a inflammatory condition,
maybe we should do...

240
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,800
an ear wax removal?

241
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,160
Yes, of course, please perform it.
Please perform it.

242
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,520
Anna Nikolajewna, I think, that
You have to do injection again.

243
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,800
- To whom?
- One more injection.

244
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,640
- Morphine.
- Pops, I'm dying!

245
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,800
Please let me go home, let
me die in my own bed.

246
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,040
Just a moment, doctor.

247
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,160
I'm feeling so weak, and
something is squeezing my chest.

248
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,640
Will You drink tea with me,
Anna Nikolajewna?

249
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm almost sure that somebody will arrive.

250
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,360
I feel it.

251
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,480
Pretty woman.

252
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,640
- It's your wife?
- No.

253
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,080
It means... a friend... an ex one.

254
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,039
- A singer.
- Pretty woman.

255
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,760
You are also a pretty
woman, Anna Nikolajewna.

256
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,200
Are You German?

257
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,800
Yes.

258
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,800
- Were You in Moscow, in Bolszoj Theathre?
- Yes I were. Two times.

259
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,320
- And where is Your husband?
- He is a war prisoner in Germany.

260
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,200
And as I predicted - someone has arrived.
He's alone.

261
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
So it means that he come for you doctor,

262
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,959
So I would go? But where?

263
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,800
- You shouldn't go now.
- I must admit that I don't want to.

264
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,520
- Stop, where are You going?
- Leave me!

265
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,919
- Doctor, a letter to You.
- Why are You in helmet?

266
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,800
I'm a firefighter, from Szalomietiev.

267
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,124
A letter? From whom?

268
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:11,200
From agronomist, who came
for our clerk wedding.

269
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,600
Agronomists daughter is marring the clerk,
yesterday was engadement party.

270
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,840
And soon after the clerk wanted
to give bride a ride in sleigh

271
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,440
a trotter suddenly breaked...

272
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,440
a she was shaken hard,
her head hit the stud, and she fell out.

273
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,995
We must watch the clerk
all time so he won't

274
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:28,920
hang himself. He
completely went apes!

275
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,480
Let's go doctor, I have fine horses,
we will arrive in no time!

276
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,200
But theres blizzard!

277
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,480
Doctor, my dove, please hurry!

00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,440

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,040

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Please sir!

281
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,800
Lew Aronowicz... I heard about You.
You are the nearest doctor.

282
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,280
- All our doctors...
- Where is she?

283
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,600
Prepare horses to the return journey.

284
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,400
She's gone... please frorgive me
that I called you upon.

285
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,640
Fracture of the skull base, I
thought that... - What You thought?

286
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,840
Doctor Bomgard held high opinion about You.

287
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,200
Misza Bomgard? Where is he now? I attended
to the same school, he's two Years older.

288
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,160
I was his surgeon, in hospital
in Simonowce, and he...

289
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,800
how to say that... he went A.W.O.L.

290
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
- Misza?
- Please give me a coat.

291
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,840
Can't be. How?

292
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,800
When?

293
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:52,760
It will be a good month since he went
to Moscow and havn't returned.

294
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,080
Maybe was killed or maybe he drawn,
I really don't know.

295
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,920
- We were friends.
- I understand.

296
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,600
I was expecting your arrival.

297
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,559
Only I don't know what to do with clerk.

298
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,080
- Let's go. Does he know that she...?
- No.

299
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,119
You must allow us to
give You a medicine .

300
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,800
I killed her, I killed her!

301
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,160
Stop moaning!
You're disturbing us!

302
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,280
Jacket!

303
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,840

304
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,480

306
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Fiedienka, it's all over... my dear...

307
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,000
You won't die, You won't die You will live.

308
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,040
I killed her...

309
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,600
It's all over Fiedienka, get up.

310
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,880
Get up, get up, You will lie on sofa.

311
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,440

313
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,920
All is over, calm down.

314
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,679
So, are we going?

315
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,560
Your High Majesty, Mr. Doctor,
we can't go! Blizzard!

316
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,520
It's only 12 km and there are
ill people there. We will go!

317
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,021
You know the way?

318
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,880
I know, but maybe we
better stay for the night?

319
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,280
Mr. Polakow, there is much farther
to district, than to Your hospital,

320
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,200
Can You borrow me 5 grams of Morphine?

321
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,040
I already ordered in district pharmacy,
will return it immidiately.

322
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,840
I have 30 beds filled, and no doctor.

323
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,840
All right, lets go!

324
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,440
Go! It will be merrier in company.

325
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,040
WOLVES

326
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,880
- So are we arrived?
- No way!

327
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,920
I was telling to stay for the night,
but You sir said - no we must go

328
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,040
you don't feel pity nor for
human nor for animals.

329
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,600
We lost the highway.
A road is nowhere to be seen.

330
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,240
Why are you shouting?
Get to the sleigh, I will go first.

331
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,320
Drink some spirit, you
will warm yourself up.

332
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,000
A highway!

333
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,000
Thank you very much!

334
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,640
- Och, it's very strong!
- Pharmaceutical, the best one!

335
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,240
Get in! We can go?

336
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,800
We get luck that we went aside not so far.

337
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,080
Something is chasing us!

338
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,920
I hear something!

339
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,120
Look, what's that... dogs?

340
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,360
Wolves! Chasing us!

341
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,400
Wolves!!
Wolves! They're catching us!

342
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,480
Faster... faster!

343
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,400
We escaped!

344
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,880
Doctor, we owe You our lives!

345
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,800
KUZIAJEWO

346
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,800
And so...?

347
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,800
You think, Wlodzimierz Andriejewicz,
that this new coup d'état will last?

348
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,479
Yes I think that.
We need to go abroad, Wasyl Osipowicz.

349
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,440
- Oho!
- To England.

350
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,640
There're no revolutionary ideas there.

351
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,200
Your High Majesty, that young doctor from
Szalomietiew, with surgeon have arrived.

352
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,400
They lost their way in blizzard, and froze
to stiff. Do You wish to see them, sir?

353
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,600
Ask the doctor here!

354
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,400
We will chat about revolution with him.

355
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,400
Maybe he's of German origin!

356
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,400
Ah ...and order to bring us wine.

357
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,000
Please gentleman.

358
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,919
I'm glad to meet You.

359
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,200
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

360
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,120
Doctor Polakow.

361
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,320
Beg Your forgiveness,
but we lost our way.

362
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,199
Wolves scared our horses.

363
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,520
- Wolves?
- Ah our nice doctor nearly get killed.

364
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,999
I will introduce with him in a while.

365
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,440
He's a wonderful doctor,
first - he rescued me,

366
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,080
second, he's dearest
and most courageus man.

367
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,480
Only just pour him a
glass of champagne first.

368
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,479
Good Morning, Jekatierina Karl...

369
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,240
You, Jekatierina Karlowna,
are a pure aristocrat.

370
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,800
Give him some Vodka, Siemion, a vodka!

371
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,600
JEKATIERINA KARLOWNA

372
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,840
It looks like I have only two km left...

373
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,240
So it is Kuziajewo?

374
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,320
You get complete lost, Michal...
Alekseyevich.

375
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,479
Michal Alekseyevich,
a lucky odd threw You

376
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,200
to Kuziajewo estate, in Obliczewski
district, and Jaroslawska province.

377
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,200
The estate owner is our dear host,
Wasyl Osipowicz Sobolewski.

378
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,840
- A well respected politician.
- Nice to meet You.

379
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,600
And here is his charming heir, Osia.
Osip Wasiliewicz.

380
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,239
Wlodzimierz Andriejewicz Faworski,
man of the world,

381
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,519
traveller, just returned from Spain.

382
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,840
A future of great Russian painting.

383
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,080
I am a graphic.

384
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,320
And here is Tanieczka, she
lovely sing and dance.

385
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,880
And... this is my friend,
Lew Aronowicz Gorenburg.

386
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,320
A German?

387
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,280
A Jew... but Christened.

388
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,720
I remember You.

389
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,199
You are from Simonowce hospital,
from Doctor Bomgard,

390
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,920
- That was you that...
- Yes It was me.

391
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,400
- Are You... from new Inteligence?
- No.

392
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,000
- I' a RSDWP member.
- Aha!

393
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,759
Well... I know what RSD mean,

394
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,800
- but what mean WP?
- Workers Party.

395
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,480
But somehow You don't look like a worker.

396
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,520
- Tanieczka wanted to sing us something.
- Yes, Yes, I remember.

397
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,920
Seems that some dances were also announced?

398
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,680
Please tell me, that really were a wolves?

399
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,320
Oh... forgive me my lovely,
play, daughter, play.

400
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,840
Please tell me, if such
complicated organism, like a state,

401
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,680
can be managed by
uneducated workers?

402
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,480
A legal system, for example,
or economy, a war matters?

403
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,320
A new lawyers will emerge...

404
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,280
new commanders, financiers...

405
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,240
So in which these old are worse then?

406
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,320
Gentlemen, please listen:

407
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,000
Why they want to crush an old regime?

408
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,720
Becouse, the current officials

409
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,520
takes bribes and trades vodka.

410
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,680
Why they want to destroy
those nice noble palaces, ?

411
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,200
Becouse, the order and responsibilities
were violated there.

412
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,600
Palace, which can be destroyed,
is no a palace.

413
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,800
Kreml, which can be razed
it's no Kreml at all.

414
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,000
A Tsar, which himself throw down from
his throne, is not a Tsar not anymore.

415
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,720
And it's not me who said
that, it's a "white rhyme".

416
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,520
Aleksander Blok.

417
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,280
It's cold today, isn't it?

418
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,840
What can I serve, Your Majesty?

419
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,120
Well... maybe give me some vodka?

420
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,600
- How are You, recovered already?
- All right.

421
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,400
I warmed myself up a bit,
but I won't today...

422
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,480
go anywhere, no way.

423
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,200
- Listen, brother, where is mensroom?
- Your majesty... here.

424
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,000
And then he took out his gun
and started to shoot.

425
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,600
Brothers, pour me another one,
I just can't warm myself up.

426
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,840
Pour him, pour.

427
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,040
I don't like this surgeon.
And where is doctor?

428
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,720
Peasants said that he went to mens room.

429
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,439
- He's not there.
- Maybe he went outdoor?

430
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,679
You shove up again and again with those
stupid jokes.

431
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,279
And that whore of yours
is behaving obscene!

432
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,440
- A You still force her to everybody!
- Tanieczka, please calm down.

433
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,680
- Please let me in, I have to...!
- Go outdoor then!

434
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,720
Where have You been, Doctor?

435
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,320
For sure You flirted with Tanieczka?

436
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,400
- Just wait and You see that Yourself.
- Aha!

437
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,039
Well... everything is
undertandable from a surgeon.

438
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,279
And you Doctor, for which
class you stand for?

439
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,240
I know two classes - the
ill and the healthy.

440
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,480
Tanieczka, please sing.

441
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,680
YWhy are you crying today, a lonely,
stupid child,

442
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,640
Stunned by cocaine,
on wet Moscow boulewards,

443
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,600
Your childish neck
barely covers by a stole,

444
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,000
Worn out... and all wet,

445
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,360
And laughable as are You.

446
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,280
Dazed by the rainy autumn
weather of the boulewards,

447
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,200
I know, that by crying,
you can lost Your senses.

448
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,040
And when You die on that
nightmarish bench,

449
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,760
your lily body.

450
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,000
A fog will surround like fence.

451
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,520
GORENBURG

452
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
- So, she's alive?
- No, she died just before my arrival.

453
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,440
Gentlemen. It's Your collegue.

454
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,400
Lew Aronowicz Gorenburg.

455
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,480
Surgeon from district hospital.

456
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,200
- We already met.
- Good morning.

457
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,879
They are out of morphine, Please ask
Anna Nikolajewna, to lend him 5 grams.

458
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,640
To returning of course.

459
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,400
You are beautiful.

460
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,400
- What do You want?
- Call Anna Nikolajewna!

461
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,320
Anna Nikolajewna, please make me injection.

462
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,800
Another one, Michal Alekseyevich?

463
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,720
I won't be preparing a solution for You
anymore.

464
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,800
Annuszka, I...

465
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,160
I need it now, I'm ill.

466
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,880
- So You need to cure, Michal Alekseyevich.
- Where?

467
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,080
You can go to the district,
You won't cure Yourself by morphine.

468
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,640
I can't forgive myself, that than
I prepared You the second one.

469
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,200
Annuszka, so according to You.
I am a morphinist, or what?

470
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,000
- You become.
- So will You, or not?

471
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,400
No.

472
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,880
Anna Nikolajewna, please give me
the keys to pharmacy.

473
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,199
Michal Alekseyevich, You must not
please, supress yourself.

474
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,400
So you give me the keys, or not?

475
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,120
No!

476
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,400
You are only sister of mercy here,
I command You, as a doctor!

477
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,160
Please immidiately give me
the keys to pharmacy!

478
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,000
Will You prepare it for me, or not?

479
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,920
Registrations opens.

480
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,880
- I'd like to see a doctor...
- Please wait.

481
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,440
- Whats the boy name?
- Kowalow.

482
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,640
How long does it hurt?

483
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,640
It don't hurt for some time, pops.

484
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,399
- So why do You come?
- Becouse a hand rots.

485
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,200
It will rot for shure! We will cut
it off and than You will understand.

486
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,920
What about You were thinking earlier?

487
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,960
Earlier I have a lot of work, pops.

488
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,240
You will go to do Anatolij Lukicz,
our surgeon with that paper.

489
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,320
And call the next one.

490
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,400
Good morning.

491
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,360
- Leave, I'll take it.
- Yes lets take it.

492
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,160
- I take myself, go leave.
- I'll take from that side...

493
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,560
ANNA NIKOLAJEWNA

494
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,400
Forgive me.

495
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,800
It's my fault.

496
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,240
I shouldn't do a second injection then.

497
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,600
It's my fault.

498
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,599
You lost and I lost with You.

499
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,160
Don't cry.

500
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:39,120
Ania, I already reduced dose.
I will lose the habit.

501
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,000
And if no I can go to district, cure
myself, I have doctor friend there.

502
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,440
Surgeon is suspecting something, he spotted
the lack of morphine in pharmacy.

503
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,039
Tomorrow I'll go to district and order
as much as is needed.

504
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,880
You should go to Moscow.

505
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,560
If You want I'll go with You.

506
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:06,000
Annuszka, give me a break, I'm not
a morphinist, I reduced the doses.

507
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,600
What are you about?

508
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,200
What?

509
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,080
I for You...

510
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,360
Maybe... that Your singer can recsue You?

511
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,840
I don't need anybody apart You, Annuszka.

512
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,239
I want to get a Morphine injection myself!!

513
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,000
I want to understand why
You like it so much.

514
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,360
PHARMACY

515
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,040
Get off my wayi!

516
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,280
Impudent!

517
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,640
PHARMACY

518
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,839
- 40 grams of Morphine?
- Yes.

519
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,000
We don't have as much.
I can give You 10 grams.

520
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,480
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

521
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:56,998
Good Morning.

522
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:59,320
Youare from Simonowski
hospital, what do you need?

523
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,280
Comerades, is it a conspiracy or what?
We don't have such quantities.

524
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,279
Excuse me but I ordered it,
a month ago.

525
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,680
I submitted order, and here's receipt!

526
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,999
Comrades, priority is for the front.
I have only 17grams to dispose

527
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,960
10 grams for him and the
rest 7 grams for You.

528
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,080
In my hospital there is only 30beds,
and I have 47 patients at the moment

529
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,480
I'm sure that in my collegues
hospital is much less.

530
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:36,240
Mr. Bomgard... please believe me, that
for me is all the same whom I'll give it.

531
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,833
- Please agree it with
your collegue. - I

532
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:41,464
don't think that mr.
Bomgard needs that much.

533
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,800
Besides, you still owe me
the 5 grams.

534
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,920
- From when, You...
- What?

535
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,480
- Well, with doctor.
- What?

536
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,600
I understand, he's young, handsome...

537
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,680
So why don't You marry Anatolij Lukicz?

538
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,320
He proposed marriage to You too.

539
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,840
And you said that he's too old.

540
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,000
Faster we get old, than he.

541
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,040
I'll probably leave...
to Moscow for holiday.

542
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,440
It's not my concern, in Moscov is
nor better nor worse than here.

543
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,720
Misza, syringes need sterilization.

544
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,920
You already have spots,
You can get infection.

545
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,800
Yes, Yes... sterylize them.

546
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,480
I'm not a sister I'm a doctor.

547
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,519
You have golden hands, you
wonderfully inject needle.

548
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,680
To tell the truth I even don't know
how to prepare solution.

549
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,400
Do... please.

550
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,399
And... most importand...
don't increase the dose!

551
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,480
I was increasing at the beginning, and now,
as you can see, I decreased.

552
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:42,800
Addiction to Morphinum Hydrochloricum
is a serious matter.

553
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,520
A nasty feeling.

554
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,840
It works.

555
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,240
Good...

556
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,720
Morphine is a good drug.

557
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,000
But I have feeling, Misza...

558
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,880
That it will destroy us.

559
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,040
You are talking bullshit, Annuszka.

560
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:51,320
It's a higher step to show
strenght of human spirit.

561
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,800
You must go.

562
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,320
You... must go.

563
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,520
TRACHEOTOMY

564
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,679
- How are You feeling, Michal Alekseyevich?
- Wonderful. A lot of patients?

565
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,079
- About 15 persons.
- Any serious cases?

566
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,480
A girl, just arrived.

567
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,400
I'll be in a moment.

568
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,880
Diphtheria.
Laryngeal diphtheria.

569
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,239
- How many days is she ill?
- Fifth, fifth, pops.

570
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,719
- Shut up and don't interfere!
- It started last Sunday.

571
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,920
So what about were you
thinking for five days?

572
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,726
Help! Give her some drops!

573
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:04,319
So maybe You suggest
me what kind of drops?

574
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,199
Pops, You know all better,
She will choke up!

575
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,840
Shut up! And you stand up or
I'll won't bother to talk with you at all.

576
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,760
Yes... they are all the same.

577
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,600
They'll starve their children.
Pelagia!

578
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,320
So, she will die?

579
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,160
- She will.
- Oh God, God!

580
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,599
Pops... she will choke up!

581
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,509
Well, it's too late, she
has stucked throat, She

582
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:33,264
can't breethe, we must
perform the operation.

583
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,600
We'll slit the throat and put a
silver tube in it. Or she will die!

584
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,999
Don't agree fo operation, don't agree!

585
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,591
If You won't give me
permission in next 5

586
01:12:43,616 --> 01:12:45,296
minutes, I won't be able
to help her anymore.

587
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,480
- No, no operation!
- Well then, Anatolij Lukiczu...

588
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,439
Anatolij Lukiczu, throw them out
to the hall, they can wait there.

589
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,480
Well... hags, get out of here!

590
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,120
When my husband returns... and
learn about it... he will kill me.

591
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,840
He will kill me I'm telling the truth.

592
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,337
Anatolij Lukicz, prepare
equipment and bandages,

593
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:54,624
and please call Anna
Nikolajewna to surgery room!

594
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,320
So... they agreed?

595
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,200
You feel bad, Anatolij Lukicz?

596
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,040
A... no, no, no... it's nothing, nothing.

597
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,799
How can You, pops, what's for?
Why you want to slit her throat, pops?

598
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,840
- Take that hag from here!
- She's stupid!

599
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,840
- I don't agree, pops!
- Go away you hag! Away!

600
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,439
- Go away, Everything will be fine!
- I don't allow You!!

601
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,360
All will be fine,
A doctor knows what is he doing.

602
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,080
Prepare me one more dose
for the evening.

603
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,600
Calm down! I'm telling You!

604
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,800
Grip!

605
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,600
Hooksi!

606
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,040
Anatolij Lukicz, please gape!

607
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,200
Scalpel!

608
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,720
- I'll hold!

609
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,000
- Please hold.
- I hold.

610
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,920
Gape.

01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,240
I hold now.

613
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,600
Thank You.

614
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,240
Remove hooks.

615
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,680
Please stitch.

616
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,280
Cheers!

617
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,320
Lets the God grace be with You!

618
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,400
- My wife also prays for You to him!
- Wlas, take it!

619
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,360
O mighty God have the Doctor under
your protection. Thank You.

620
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,880
So, how are you feeling?

621
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,320
- Let the Christ protects you.
- Good.

622
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,640
Listen, your father is rich enough.

623
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:28,840
I can give You adress in Moscow,
they will do you a prothesis there.

624
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,760
Really good.

625
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,880
Ok.

626
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:55,000
FIRE

627
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,200
Excuse me.

628
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,360
Doctor!

629
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,199
Your Majesty, Kuziajewo's on fire!

630
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,800
- What's that?
- Stay in bed.

631
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,160
Doctor!
Our master is badly burned!

632
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,200
Drive to hospital.

633
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,480
Why did You set me on fire?

634
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,680
Brothers!
I always were with You.

635
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,080
Brothers! I always...

636
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,560
Why did You set me on fire??

637
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,800
Brothers...

638
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,480
Always with You...

639
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,280
Why did You set me on fire??

640
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,320
Room for wound dressing, prepare
room for wound dressing!

641
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,959
- Everything is ready!
- Morphine, Morphine!

642
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,160
Ready.

643
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,080
Tania... Tanieczka...

644
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,440
My daughter...

645
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,488
Anatolij Lukicz, who
is in worst condition?

646
01:22:40,513 --> 01:22:42,359
Wasyle Osipowicz.
It's bad with him.

647
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,972
And his daughter, I
havn't seen the rest yet.

648
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:45,199
And where is Anna Nikolajewna?

649
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,080
Doctor, I... later.

650
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,560
Wlas brought three more!

651
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,400
Patient... is dead!

652
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,200
Heart stoped to beat.

653
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,520
And a daughter?

654
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,320
Looks like she's dead too.

655
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,280
She died.

656
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,040
There was no morphine.

657
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,800
I lied to you, when I talked,
about reducing doses.

658
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:04,280
You made 2 percent solution,
and I secretly prepared 4 percent one.

659
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,640
And to the empty jars I poured...

660
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,520
so they died from it.

661
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,800
- So I'm their killer!
- No, Misza, You're just ill.

662
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,760
- Now they'll send me to ordeal.
- No.

663
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,800
No these days
they won't do you any harm for that,

664
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,840
becouse they were landowners, the Kulaks.

665
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:38,280
Misza, You must leave and cure yourself.

666
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,160
Doctor!

667
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,559
A guests!

668
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,080
I'll lay the table in dining room.

669
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:58,400
I bring You my debt, doctor Polakow.

670
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,200
So?

671
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,360
Maybe we drink some vodka?

672
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,440
It don't think so.

673
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,160
I must go to district.

674
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:45,520
UGLICZ

675
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,228
Tell Anna Nikolajewna,
that I'll write to her.

676
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

677
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,880
HOSPITAL

678
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,400
nowadays a psychiatric clinic
is the calmest place.

679
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,200
Besides it's more quiet
here than in Moscow.

680
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:18,319
Wher some people are dreaming about
a so called "Revolution storm",

681
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,520
and we here have a calm and peace.

682
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,400
In one word - province.

683
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,200
Good Morning, Good Morning, collegue!

684
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,800
Wait... again to pharmacy?

685
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,760
No, no this time I come to You.

686
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,399

01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,680

From which room?

695
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,440

of the day. They will call for You.

699
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,160
I can give You a bit of vodka.

700
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,800
I'll pour it to the cup.

701
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:32,120
