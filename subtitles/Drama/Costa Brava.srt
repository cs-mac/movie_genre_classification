00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:48,439
Good morning, my queen.

3
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:50,204
Good morning, Ding-Dong.

4
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:52,478
I think today
can be a special one for you.

5
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:54,522
I think you're right, Pammy.

6
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,897
I found some backwash
from this one.

7
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:00,796
Nice.

8
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,362
Come on, Dinger,
I'm serious,

9
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:05,252
I sense a change coming,
something for the better.

10
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,805
Pammy, you're the only thing
that's good for me.

11
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:10,495
No, Dinger, something
really good for you.

12
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:12,388
Just be open to it.

13
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,462
So now you gotta go
to the other guy, huh?

14
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:16,510
Hey, come on, sweetie.
Don't be jealous.

15
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,169
You know you're my only
fully-interactive fantasy.

16
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,181
Just remember, carpe diem.

17
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:23,296
Carpe Diem.

18
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,403
God, I love it when
you talk dirty to me.

19
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:30,467
You are the sexiest thing that's ever
been on this beach.

20
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,760
We have waves,
palm trees, man.

21
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,769
My kind of school.

22
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:26,060
Yo. Whoa, who, who's this babe
right here?

23
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:30,185
Hi, handsome.
How are you?

24
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:31,662
You look beautiful.

25
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,289
Thank you.

26
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:36,556
Yeah, you're no Aunt Carla.
You got body karate.

27
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,309
That's Tasty.

28
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:42,127
And that's Doobie.

29
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:43,567
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,023
Those aren't names
for good students.

31
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:47,757
You know the drill.

32
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:52,170
Free room, board and tutoring
in exchange for some really hard work.

33
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,666
You could take a lesson from
our resident surf pro,

34
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,391
but unfortunately, he's a little
comatose these days.

35
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,184
You guys heard
of Dinger Doolittle?

36
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,555
Dinger Doolittle,
the former World Champ?

37
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,564
Yeah, the guy
used to be my hero.

38
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,321
Hm, now he'd be
in Lindsay Lohan's hero.

39
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,988
Hi, Carla.

40
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,300
Hi, girls.

41
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,832
I see the boys
are here.

42
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,972
We are going
swimming now,

43
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:31,259
so maybe after you unpack you
want to cool off? Ya?

44
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:32,982
Ya.

45
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:44,407
Okay, we go
unpack, yeah? Y eah.

46
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,045
We are going fishing
for Swedish fish.

47
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,567
Twenty, twenty-one.

48
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,686
Ready to play?

49
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,692
Ready.

50
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:30,077
Ya, you boys are such good
strong swimmers.

51
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:33,567
Yeah, wonderful.

52
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,462
You boys want
to play pool game?

53
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,641
Yeah.

54
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:37,727
Strip poker!

55
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,776
That is not
pool game.

56
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,857
Oh, with you and some plastic
cards, it is.

57
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,945
Yeah.

58
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,001
I am lnga.

59
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:46,312
I am Rikki.

60
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,386
I can move.

61
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,013
No need.

62
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:52,775
As long as you let me
read in peace.

63
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,555
You're not Swedish.

64
00:06:56,621 --> 00:07:00,199
And you're not
Ietting me read in peace.

65
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,212
Sorry.

66
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:05,898
We were thinking about playing
Marco Polo. We against you.

67
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,139
Uh, okay. And we come
and grab you

68
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:10,182
Ya.

69
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:11,630
Okay, I'm in.

70
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,583
Yeah.

71
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:18,472
But I think this make
the game more fun.

72
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,750
Ya?

73
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,607
Ya.

74
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,016
Ya.

75
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,675
Oh.

76
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,089
Ya.

77
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,911
Ya.

78
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,540
Ya. Okay,
Iet's play it.

79
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,435
I could ask them to stop.

80
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,955
You could, but you won't.

81
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:36,109
You're a surfer.

82
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:38,091
Not exactly
in your character.

83
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:43,248
Bye.

84
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,189
Marco.

85
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:48,271
Polo.

86
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,718
Marco.

87
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,246
Polo.

88
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,727
Marco.

89
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,222
Marco.

90
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:55,574
Polo.

91
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,049
Marco.

92
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:58,291
Marco!

93
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:59,409
Polo.

94
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,040
Marco.

95
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,123
Marco.

96
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:12,211
Polo.

97
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,746
Marco.

98
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:25,558
Marco?

99
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,973
Polo.

100
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,862
Marco?

101
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:30,684
Polo.

102
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:32,662
Marco.

103
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:33,817
Polo.

104
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,351
Marco.

105
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,735
Polo.

106
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,315
Whoa.

107
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,848
Was I just dreaming?

108
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,312
Are you knuckleheads
ready to surf Costa Rica?

109
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,036
Whoo-hoo!

110
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,937
Bro', I think
I saw a mermaid.

111
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,523
Dude, those waves are
carved out of marble.

112
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:59,180
Dude, I can't believe how warm
this water is.

113
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,877
Told yo,
Costa Rica, baby,

114
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,354
I can't wait
to meet Dinger.

115
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,646
Hans.

116
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:12,882
Looks like you've got
a cocktail frank in there.

117
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,326
Or maybe it's a little
wiener schnitzel.

118
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:35,601
No, get outta here.
I'm serious.

119
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,608
You fuck-up. You.

120
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:03,545
I don't think Fedex even delivers
a package that small.

121
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,991
Forget school
and just surf.

122
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:09,527
Shred.

123
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:12,668
One day you'll learn about
priorities, Tasty,

124
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,706
life's not just about
catching waves.

125
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:16,826
Oh-ho.

126
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,425
That's the day
that Doobie and I

127
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,020
say, check, please. We're going
to pipeline heaven

128
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,131
in the sky.
Thank you

129
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,113
It's like surf
or die, brother.

130
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:27,774
Hey, guys. Let's go talk
to Dinger Doolittle.

131
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:28,958
Ah, Dinger.

132
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,108
Hey, Ding-Dong.

133
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,443
I think today could be a special
for one for you.

134
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,252
European men will no longer be allowed
to wear Speedos on the beach.

135
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,108
Thank God.

136
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:41,761
'Cause if I see another banana
hammock around here, l

137
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:45,029
I 'll never eat fruit again.

138
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:48,893
Whoa! Who the heck
are you squids?

139
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:53,193
We came
to meet... you.

140
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,647
We're helping
out Carla.

141
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:57,414
Now, that's a woman
that the Dinger

142
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,523
needs to get to know
up close and personal

143
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,912
'cause she is one
tasty tuna tartar.

144
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,410
She's a sexy
salmon surprise.

145
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:08,682
Just the classiest
clam I've ever- Oh.

146
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,227
Who are you again?

147
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:15,150
I'm Kyle. Her nephew.

148
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:18,827
Oh. Magnificent woman.

149
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:21,284
Upstanding character.

150
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,484
I mean, I've never even thought about
playing hiding the halibut with her,

151
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:30,343
or fondle the flounder, or grinding
the grouper on her-

152
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,978
Okay. Got it.
Got it.

153
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,946
Aunt Carla tell you about Brad
the Butt-munching butt-muncher?

154
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,394
No. Who
is that?

155
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:41,683
Some ex-surf pro's ass I used to kick
on the reg.

156
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:46,156
Now he inherited all of his daddy's dinero
and he bought up half this coast.

157
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:49,711
And you're aunt's falling
behind on her payments.

158
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,691
That's why she
needed the help.

159
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:55,411
Yep. Your Aunt Carla sure got her tit
in a ringer.

160
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,527
What?

161
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:58,771
Whoa. That was
just a metaphor.

162
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,510
I would never talk about your aunt's
gorgeous gua was like that.

163
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:06,774
I mean, with the ample size
of those merry melons,

164
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:10,006
I don't think I could even get
'em in a ringer.

165
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:11,219
What?

166
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,567
Who?

167
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:17,362
Hey, before Carla
has a titty tantrum,

168
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,891
check out this shit
I swiped from my dad.

169
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,241
Whoo-hoo!

170
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:23,642
All right.
Home brewed.

171
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,834
Dad keeps it in the garage refrigerator
at 38 degrees. Smell it.

172
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:29,495
Whoa.

173
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:32,763
Dude, it smells like gasoline
and vomit.

174
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:34,205
Right?

175
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,613
Old school
potent shit.

176
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,784
You know my dad used to be a pimp
in the '70s?

177
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,383
Nice.

178
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,685
He said this would set him up
for the takedown every time.

179
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:44,159
Yeah.

180
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:47,095
Would definitely take a girl down,
that's for sure.

181
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,218
Might kill one, too.

182
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,429
Yeah. Take it
down treasure Iane.

183
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:57,305
What do you
two have on?

184
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:04,514
It's his dad's
super pimp potion.

185
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:08,444
Well, it smells more
like gasoline and vomit.

186
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:11,071
See, it just
takes time

187
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,662
for it to work on hot babes like
you, you know.

188
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,125
Honey, I don't have enough time
in the day for that

189
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,055
Go shower before I hose
you off myself.

190
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,463
Yeah, but how are you gonna go crazy
for us with hot teacher desire?

191
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:25,887
Hamilton!

192
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,034
You wanna watch us
take a shower?

193
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,841
I'm, you can do it Iater.

194
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:50,376
# Everything's gonna
be alright

195
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:54,124
Sat back
and close my eyes #

196
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,679
Hey, bro',
sit down, man.

197
00:14:56,752 --> 00:15:01,422
You know, you have real artists
out there, huh?

198
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:06,411
Ripping it up. I can feel it.
I can see it.

199
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:09,798
Man, that's what
brought me here.

200
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,625
Six months ago, dude,

201
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:16,336
working at a Pizza Hut,
making six bucks an hour.

202
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:21,162
And I came to this ledge,right, and looked
down and it was a long way to go.

203
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,434
And I just-

204
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,633
I chose to fly, man.

205
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:29,611
And if I was to sit
back on that ledge

206
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:33,364
and not jump,

207
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,294
I might have been
waiting a lifetime.

208
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:42,159
And a lifetime's
a Iong time to wait, bro'.

209
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,390
This is
a conscious revolution.

210
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,057
And know this,

211
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:53,815
# Everything's gonna
be alright

212
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:56,469
# Sat back
and closed my eyes

213
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,410
# And found the reason why

214
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:02,103
# I chose to fly

215
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:04,694
# Some things just
have to change

216
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:08,028
No, no, I said sell it. Man,
it's hot here, huh?

217
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,917
Okay. So this is
what I want, brother.

218
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:14,010
I want condominiums back here.
Remove all this stuff.

219
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,869
Dinger Doolittle?

220
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:17,594
Remove him, please.

221
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:19,934
Do you understand?

222
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:21,824
Hey, Brad.

223
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,021
Got my rent check, bro'?
I stuffed it in one of my bottles

224
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,578
and should be floating
your way in a few days.

225
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:35,745
Couldn't we just build
around this, sir? I mean-

226
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,755
No, no, no.
Did you hear what I said?

227
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,164
I said,
remove it all. Okay?

228
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,139
Dinger.

229
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:44,800
Pelican. 5:00.
Happy hour?

230
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,717
Beers on me, bro.

231
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:51,100
Mr. Taylor.

232
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,900
Later.

233
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,593
Dick.

234
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:58,473
Come on, let's get back
on top, Dinger.

235
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:01,920
Don't you think it's time to set some goals?
Stop drinking, get a job?

236
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:03,587
You know, maybe a shower?

237
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:06,790
Jeez. Can't we just stick
to the fantasy stuff, Pammy?

238
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,477
There's no need for you to go all
Hasselhoff on me.

239
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:41,287
We make a good team,
you and I, you know?

240
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:43,664
That's real
romantic, Brad.

241
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:47,565
All right.

242
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,090
Let me
get this straight.

243
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:51,822
I sleep with you,

244
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:56,333
I get to keep my motel.
I don't, you foreclose.

245
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:58,773
God. You make me sound
like such a beast.

246
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:01,326
You know what?
Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

247
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:05,228
I mean, couldn't I maybe
be a romantic good guy?

248
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:08,817
Couldn't I be a man who's crazy about
you and sees a future together?

249
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,980
I mean, is it, is it that terrible
to explore the possibility?

250
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:16,112
Is it?

251
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,811
Uh-huh.

252
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,833
Everything all
right here?

253
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:27,282
You need us to do some kung fu
or anything like that?

254
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:31,796
Oh, we could totally
take him down.

255
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,683
Pow.

256
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:39,419
You guys, everything is fine.
This is Brad Taylor.

257
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,597
Brad Taylor?

258
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,197
That's right, man.

259
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:47,868
I had your poster. Potty trained
my puppy on it.

260
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,489
Whoa.

261
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,975
That's Dickwad Taylor

262
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,674
Exactly.

263
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,877
Ha-ha. Compliments galore today,
huh, boys?

264
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,833
You really
are good, man,

265
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:05,242
you just managed to always lose to
Dinger Doolittle.

266
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:09,210
Ah. And you must
be the nephew?

267
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:12,929
Dinger Doolittle might have gotten lucky
and won a few surf contests,

268
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:16,641
but he certainly didn't turn out too good
in the end, now, did he?

269
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:20,452
In fact, I think I can smell him
on the beach from here.

270
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:27,042
Look, I don't wanna do this. In fact,
I would be ecstatic for you to keep this place.

271
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,665
Let me prove it to you over dinner
tomorrow night.

272
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,808
Pick you up
at 7:00.

273
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,303
Come on.
What do you say?

274
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:40,930
Fine.

275
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:42,431
Great decision!

276
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:48,901
You see boys?
The good guys always win in the end. Hmm.

277
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:58,723
Whoa. Dickwad
was a good name.

278
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,771
If going to dinner
with Brad Taylor

279
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,530
means that I get
to keep this place

280
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,244
for another day,
another minute,

281
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:10,095
that's a small
price to pay.

282
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:15,083
I Iove this place.

283
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:17,455
Yeah, but he's such a jerk.

284
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:18,984
Tell me about it.

285
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:21,993
This place is cool.

286
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,304
It is cool.

287
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:27,405
Just ask your mother about her hapless
little sister.

288
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:31,631
I was a failure as a wife.
I was a failure as a teacher.

289
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:37,037
Apparently I'm about to be a failure
as a motel owner in paradise.

290
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,117
You haven't failed
as my coolest aunt.

291
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:41,711
You've always been that.

292
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:45,677
Thank you.

293
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:49,909
I just wish being a cool
aunt paid better.

294
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:56,242
All right. Enough about
my miserable life.

295
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:58,736
Stanford, huh?

296
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:02,706
Uh, mmm.

297
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,358
Is that about
that surfing dream

298
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:09,592
that your parents are so relieved
you gave up?

299
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,149
They're right.

300
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,977
I mean,

301
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:18,487
Dinger was the best and look
what happened to him.

302
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,242
Can't get sidetracked
trying to surf pro.

303
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,028
It's, it's Stanford.

304
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,325
It is Stanford.

305
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:29,881
But it's your life.

306
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:35,005
All right, I'm off to class.

307
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,929
You know, my friend,

308
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:40,704
I thought I couldn't reach my students
before and they were on planet Earth.

309
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,219
You have sent me
on a mission to Mars.

310
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:45,602
Uh, I know.

311
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:46,682
Thank you.

312
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:59,805
Dinger, Brad is taking
Carla to dinner tonight.

313
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:03,141
Brad? The butt-munching
butt-muncher?

314
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:06,557
Yeah, he wants to foreclose the hotel
if she doesn't, you know.

315
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:09,448
Play bury the barracuda?

316
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:11,269
Or tickle the tuna?

317
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:14,152
Dinger, she needs
your help.

318
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:16,257
My help?

319
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:19,528
Yeah. Brad hates you because you kicked
his ass on the surf tour.

320
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:20,904
Damn Skippy.

321
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:22,859
If you challenge him
to a surf contest,

322
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,779
he'll accept no matter
what the bet is.

323
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,161
I mean, look at you.
He, he's gotta think

324
00:22:28,237 --> 00:22:30,147
you can barely stand,
much less surf.

325
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:33,255
Well, aren't you just the little
ego-booster from hell.

326
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,886
You know what?
Forget about me.

327
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,901
You challenge him
to a surf-off,

328
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:40,838
bet the hotel,
you win, she wins.

329
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:44,108
Why don't we just build a spaceship
and go to Pluto?

330
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:46,544
Are you gonna
help Carla or not?

331
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:49,358
Your Aunt Carla
is a goddess.

332
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:52,241
I'd lay down my life
for a woman like her.

333
00:22:55,378 --> 00:23:00,617
And there's a time where she
might even have noticed.

334
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:03,376
Maybe the time is now.

335
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:10,676
You're the reason
I became a surfer.

336
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:13,710
Low blow, bro'.

337
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:15,538
Kid playing
the hero card.

338
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,778
Too bad Dinger
doesn't play cards.

339
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:20,782
You'd play a little strip poker with me,
wouldn't you, honey?

340
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:22,579
We have time
for a game or two.

341
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,518
It is getting awfully hot and
this shirt is suffocating.

342
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:29,368
Oh, yeah,the girls look
like they're over-heating.

343
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:33,428
You wanna play strip poker,
I'll play strip poker.

344
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,369
Well, just take my hand,
baby then we can play.

345
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,881
Go ahead. Take it.

346
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:47,605
I 'm sorry, bro'.

347
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,466
I don't know
what I 'm thinking.

348
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,606
You know what though?

349
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:53,052
I'm in.

350
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:05,278
Okay, guys. I really don't
have time for nonsense.

351
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,581
You wanna pass this test
that'll allow you

352
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:10,617
to repeat your senior
year at Malibu High, right?

353
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,593
Okay. Well, I've gone
over all the material

354
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,293
and I think
I could help you.

355
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:20,033
But you have to be willing
and open to learn.

356
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,173
Hamilton?

357
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:24,416
I would be more
open to learning

358
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:29,374
if you were more open to wearing
a bikini to class.

359
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:31,651
Whoa.

360
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:35,974
I'd be down for,
like, a G-string.

361
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,837
Okay. Lesson
number one, boys.

362
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:44,320
If you ever say anything sexually
related to me again,

363
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:47,208
you're on the first
plane back home. Comprende?

364
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,239
Si.

365
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,005
And you, Richard.

366
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:55,621
You're gonna omit the word
"whoa," from your vocabulary.

367
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,673
Wh-

368
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,504
No! One more time

369
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,703
and you're outta here.

370
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:04,772
I can see why you quit teaching,
Ms. Terminator.

371
00:25:04,845 --> 00:25:08,457
No wonder you and your friend are on
the way to a special school.

372
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:10,282
You two are like
the village idiots.

373
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,652
I 'm sure it's really cool
when you were young.

374
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:16,166
But right now,
it's really pathetic.

375
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:24,208
She's a horrible teacher.

376
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,695
Whoa.

377
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,827
Chicks dig us, right?

378
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,671
Thanks.

379
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,521
Marco.

380
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:46,988
Okay. I guess
I was a little-

381
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,175
Harsh?

382
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:50,450
Judgmental? Rude?

383
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:52,820
How 'bout focused?

384
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,894
How 'bout
rudely focused?

385
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,236
I can live with that.

386
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:59,955
Okay. Truce.

387
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:02,446
I'm Eva.

388
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,798
I'm Kyle.

389
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:07,411
I know. Your aunt
was raving about you.

390
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,516
So you're like a pro surfer,
whatever that is?

391
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,036
I'm not really a pro.

392
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,596
I just graduated high school
and, believe it or not,

393
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:18,294
I'm starting college
in the fall.

394
00:26:18,364 --> 00:26:20,022
Me, too. Where?

395
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:23,290
It's gonna
kill your stupid
surfer hypothesis.

396
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:25,146
Stanford.

397
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:26,741
Stanford?

398
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:29,465
That's too weird.

399
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,185
Don't tell me out of all the great
bastions of academia,

400
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:34,590
you chose the same school as a stupid
surfer boy?

401
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:38,234
CIose. I'll be right down the road
at Berkeley.

402
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,280
Neighbors.

403
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:42,622
Not a bad school.

404
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,729
Hmm, it's no Stanford.

405
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:47,584
Okay. I'm an idiot.
We already established that.

406
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:49,786
What about the truce?

407
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,004
Yeah.

408
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:04,289
I would like to apologize
for yesterday.

409
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:06,846
I should have been
more patient.

410
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,418
You hear anything?

411
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:16,798
I'm willing to give it another
shot if you guys are.

412
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:18,880
But you have realize
you've gotta change.

413
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:22,335
If you wanna go back to your high school,
you have to wanna learn.

414
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:28,549
Wow.

415
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,720
Look, Brad.

416
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,147
There's not enough space for both
of us in Costa Rica.

417
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,962
Heck. There's barely enough room for us
in Central America.

418
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:40,843
Maybe adequate
space in Europe.

419
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,561
I heard Antarctica's nice.

420
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,900
Dinger, you suck.

421
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:49,263
Okay, butt-muncher.
You best be on the next wave outta here

422
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,083
'cause there's
a new sheriff in town

423
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:53,607
and his name's
Dinger Doolittle.

424
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:57,035
Brad?

425
00:27:57,105 --> 00:27:58,512
Buddy?

426
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,577
You couldn't possibly
Iend me a few colones

427
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,210
just until payday?

428
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,537
A six-pack of Imperial?

429
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,189
You disgust me.

430
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,456
What happened
to the real Dinger?

431
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:15,346
Where did he go?

432
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,607
I can't do this.

433
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,882
I can't do this.
What happened?

434
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,016
Where is the real Dinger?

435
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:26,956
Oh. Looky who's here,

436
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,861
our favorite
young men. Oh, ya.

437
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:34,383
We want to play today. You
want to play with us?

438
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:35,983
Ya.

439
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:39,734
Ya? Well, you should come by our room
after breakfast, ya?

440
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,558
Ya.

441
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:44,693
I'll with you
later, Rikard.

442
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:48,058
All right.

443
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:49,367
Ya.

444
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,983
Come on, dude. Enough
with the nature watch.

445
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,264
Okay. We, we, we, we've
gotta play it cool.

446
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:05,531
Like, uh,
like Rico Suave.

447
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:06,580
Whoa.

448
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:07,637
Yeah.

449
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,330
Rico Suave.

450
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,603
Who is Rico Suave?

451
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:15,836
He's this Latin dude who gets,
like, tons of babes.

452
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,595
All right. Let's go.

453
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:22,908
Hello?

454
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,636
W- w-
We're here.

455
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:27,074
Oh. We'll be with you
in one minute.

456
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:32,865
We are
in panty heaven.

457
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:36,031
Hey, Iook at this.

458
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,224
Oh, so sorry.

459
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:48,004
We leave our laundry out.
That is so rude.

460
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:50,439
Oh, how rude of us.
We apologize.

461
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:52,643
It's- It's okay.

462
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:59,112
Oh, yeah.
We won't tell anybody.

463
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:02,145
Good. You ready?

464
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:04,586
We are up here.

465
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:05,600
Huh?

466
00:30:05,675 --> 00:30:07,912
They're just breasts.

467
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,323
You have nipples,
we have nipples.

468
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:15,211
Oh, we like those better.

469
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:16,585
Okay, we go
play now, ya?

470
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:17,636
Ya.

471
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:18,854
Ya. Ya.

472
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:19,907
Oh, ya.

473
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,055
Yeah.

474
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:27,823
So you boys know how much we like,
uh, games, ya?

475
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:30,125
Ya. Ya.

476
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:32,014
And we know how much
you American boys

477
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,383
like to see
an older woman's body.

478
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,205
Ya.

479
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:40,169
Wa, we play
strip games, ya?

480
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,446
Ya!

481
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:45,067
Oh, ya.

482
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,595
A movie?
Two word.

483
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:51,050
Second word. Uh,three syllables.
First syllable.

484
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,875
Prayer. Gods,

485
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:56,624
uh, oh, it's second
and third syllable.

486
00:30:56,693 --> 00:31:00,436
Baby. Mother.
Sounds like a mother.

487
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:05,938
It's a father.Ya. Oh, oh, oh.
Godfather, The Godfather!

488
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:08,430
21 seconds, boys.

489
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:11,222
Your turn, boys.

490
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:06,937
All right. How do I look?

491
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,440
Wow, you
Iook beautiful.

492
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:09,662
Thank you.

493
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,359
It's not too late.
I could cancel.

494
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:15,074
I can call him that you have,
like, jungle fever. Fatigue. Plague.

495
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,703
Honey, it's just dinner.

496
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:18,268
Hello, beautiful.

497
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:20,677
Whoo. Wow.

498
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:23,110
You look like
the mother of my children.

499
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,445
Too early in the date
to propose?

500
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:26,592
Just a little.

501
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:28,737
What's up, Kyle?

502
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:32,518
Well, guess we should
be going, yeah?

503
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,007
Wait, why the rush?
I mean,

504
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:37,985
I have Brad Taylor here,
surf Iegend.

505
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,906
You know, when you
beat Slater in '97

506
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,266
with that 360 degree turn,
man, that was epic.

507
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:46,437
Yeah. Yeah, it was, man.

508
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,323
I remember sitting out there
with him waiting for a set.

509
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:51,014
You know,
and I just felt it.

510
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,060
I turned
to Kelly and I said,

511
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:59,277
"Second place isn't so bad.
Enjoy it, fool."

512
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:01,547
Yeah. You're
really cool.

513
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:02,727
Thanks.

514
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,426
Well, you ready?

515
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:05,673
Yeah.

516
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,533
Not so fast, Brad.

517
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:10,056
What are you doing
here, Doolittle?

518
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,847
Isn't it about time
to fall down drunk again?

519
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:16,688
I'm here to call out
the alleged surf champion.

520
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:19,242
That must
eat you up inside.

521
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:22,065
No matter how many
championships you've got,

522
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,548
you never won
one against the Dinger.

523
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,475
Dinger, don't.

524
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,475
Because you quit,ran away, right
into the bottle.

525
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,720
And you're still in it.

526
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,488
What do you want, wino?

527
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,461
I want you.
One on one.

528
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:45,271
Surf-off.Three waves,
one champion.

529
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:49,428
I hate to tell you this,but we're a little
bit too old to play for fun.

530
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:52,531
What are you gonna bet?
Your moldy mattress?

531
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:55,766
No.

532
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,973
If I win,

533
00:33:58,043 --> 00:33:59,984
Carla keeps the motel.

534
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,476
Is he delusional?
I mean, actually,that's a silly question.

535
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:08,535
And you, you eat
the rest of that mortgage.

536
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,994
Look, this
is ridiculous. Stop.

537
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:14,299
I know I don't deserve
to love you right now,

538
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,926
and I'm a little down
on my luck.

539
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:18,454
A little? Whoof.

540
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:23,383
But the Dinger's back.
I am back.

541
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:27,902
Okay. All right.
You're on, wino.

542
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:31,199
You win, I won't foreclose
on Carla for a year.

543
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:32,443
I said-

544
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:34,172
That's the best
you're gonna get.

545
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:39,328
But when I win,
you leave Costa Rica forever.

546
00:34:39,395 --> 00:34:43,519
We'll call it my, um, beach
beautification project.

547
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:45,148
Leave Costa Rica?

548
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,637
Yeah. You know, go bye-bye?

549
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:51,743
This is ridiculous. Stop.

550
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:55,877
You're on,
butt-muncher.

551
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:58,464
Fine. Two weeks
from Saturday.

552
00:34:58,535 --> 00:35:02,878
You got one chance to beat me and that's
gonna take an act of God.

553
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:05,124
Let's go, Carla.

554
00:35:06,953 --> 00:35:08,262
Please don't go.

555
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:11,330
I know you're not quite
ready to just be with me,

556
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,224
but don't be with him.

557
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,039
Man, you gotta work on your pecs.
You got man tits.

558
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:17,831
Hm.

559
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:21,347
You need some Grecian
for that grey, dude.

560
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,330
Ugh.

561
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:25,030
Ugh!

562
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:28,966
Oh, Dinger,

563
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:30,314
oh, that's foul.

564
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:31,691
Ah- Ah-

565
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:34,148
You're not just
one big hair.

566
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,606
You know, I should
have studied like you.

567
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,430
According to my ex-boyfriend,
no one studies like me.

568
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:46,766
I guess that's why
he's my ex-boyfriend.

569
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:49,354
Well, there's plenty more where
that came from.

570
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:50,800
You're on vacation now.

571
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:54,031
I know. My cousins
keep reminding me.

572
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:57,264
I just wish
I could relax.

573
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:01,293
Well, we could hold you
down and take your book.

574
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:05,194
I'm a black belt. It could get ugly.
I fight like I study.

575
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,473
Kyle could give you
a surf Iesson.

576
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,575
Oh, you mean, the relatively
attractive nephew

577
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:13,516
who you forgot to mention
is going to Stanford?

578
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,406
I figured you would
find out on your own.

579
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:19,221
He seems cool, but sorry.
There's no love connection.

580
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:21,655
We're practically
gonna be neighbors, you know.

581
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,022
Word spreads.
I don't need that kind of trouble.

582
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,385
All right. Suit yourself.
Study hard.

583
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:33,845
I feel cold, brah.

584
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:36,020
What? It's like
90 degrees.

585
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:37,914
Cold.

586
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,566
So cold.

587
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:43,834
Is that
a white light?

588
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,032
A velvety white light?

589
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,838
I'm on the road
to Shambala.

590
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:55,831
There's Jehovah.
Hey, big Daddy.

591
00:36:55,904 --> 00:36:58,042
Sweet robe.

592
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:00,349
Dinger's coming
home to Papa.

593
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,589
Got any Cap'n Crunch
around here?

594
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:05,526
Dinger, you're
going to do this

595
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:08,220
you gotta go sober.

596
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,232
You're not gonna let
Carla down, right?

597
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:11,768
Right.

598
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:14,462
Your hero's gonna need
a little help on this one, brah.

599
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,254
I know.
I'll help you.

600
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:18,659
I did good
today, huh?

601
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:20,001
Yeah.

602
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,403
Except for blowing
the chunks all over her.

603
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,492
Oh, God, you heard
what I said about Carla.

604
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:29,763
I love you.
I want you.

605
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,646
It's okay, honey.
She's real. I understand.

606
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:35,843
You're real. So real.

607
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:41,638
You're my one
and only love.

608
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:46,440
So what
are you doing?

609
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:49,256
Just walking with my beautiful
aunt on the beach.

610
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:51,778
I mean, what
are you doing?

611
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:55,463
Dinger shows up to challenge Brad,
professes his love for me?

612
00:37:55,532 --> 00:37:59,591
You're a believer, right? It's just
the universe at work.

613
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,733
With a little help
from you. Look.

614
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:04,009
I made this mess,

615
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:06,926
I don't think you and Dinger should
get involved.

616
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,292
No, I think we
should, I mean,

617
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,937
what do you want Dinger to do?
Just lie down on the beach drunk?

618
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,462
Kyle, he said
he Ioved me.

619
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,991
So, he's
got good taste.

620
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:21,611
Isn't your generation the one that believed
love is all you need?

621
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:25,806
No, that's the generation before
mine. Mine needs money.

622
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:29,737
This plan is silly.

623
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:33,107
Got anything better?

624
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:43,055
Oh, yeah.

625
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:46,354
AIways good
to use protection, Pammy.

626
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:50,929
Oh, yeah, rub it
right there. Oh. Oh, yeah.

627
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,000
I think you missed a spot.

628
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:56,755
Oh, yeah, that's it,
right there, baby.

629
00:38:56,824 --> 00:38:59,574
It'd be much nicer to have a real girl
do this for you.

630
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:01,103
Like Carla.

631
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:03,795
No, this is great.

632
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:05,525
Real is better.

633
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,213
Not when it's real
versus Pamela Anderson.

634
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:10,323
Honey, I'm not really
here, you know that?

635
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:12,981
Say what?

636
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,190
You create the fantasy.
The reality is,

637
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,715
I'm at Little League game
with my boys right now.

638
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,381
Stop it.

639
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:21,558
I think you can stop it.

640
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:24,891
But you Iook so good wet.

641
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:28,342
You have
the prettiest skin.

642
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,422
Goofy.

643
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:46,234
Dinger.

644
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:49,306
Running in place,
in slow motion,

645
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:50,459
won't help.

646
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:54,591
I feel the burn, brah.

647
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,689
Come on.

648
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:59,291
Okay.

649
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:01,700
That's... one.

650
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:06,076
You are killing me, Osama. What's next,
waterboarding?

651
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,230
Ah!

652
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:10,951
Dinger, you
got this.

653
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:14,016
You used to have the best balance
in the world.

654
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:16,838
I don't know what you've
been smoking lately, brah

655
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:18,814
But I'm with Ringling
Brothers here.

656
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:20,831
What's next,
a flying trapeze?

657
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:24,681
I mean, you might as well shoot me
out of a cannon.

658
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,518
I'm back.
Whoo-hoo!

659
00:40:32,542 --> 00:41:02,542
...:::Lord Sadler:::...
lordsadler2012@gmail.com

660
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:36,695
Try and get
these clothes off.

661
00:41:43,386 --> 00:41:44,761
Ya!

662
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,270
Name the seven
continents.

663
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:15,963
Pancho Willa.

664
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:17,374
Catalina.

665
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,600
Oh.

666
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,795
Explain Einstein's
Theory of Relativity.

667
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:27,039
Define existentialism.

668
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:28,864
Freud's interpretation
of dreams.

669
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:31,714
Keynesian Theories
of Macroeconomic Management.

670
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,964
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if
a woodchuck could wood?

671
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:42,558
Show time!

672
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:44,868
It better be a big show.

673
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:57,765
It's so little.

674
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:01,860
If it'd be any smaller,
it would be invisible.

675
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,571
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

676
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:09,539
He's hung like a hamster.

677
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,652
Stupid is no fun.

678
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:14,376
We don't take our clothes off
for stupid American boys.

679
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:17,348
Y eah. Why don't you just take your
honey buns out of my sight?

680
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:19,626
Take a long walk
on a short pier.

681
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:23,405
Yeah. And while you're at it, take your
cocktail vieners outta here.

682
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:27,214
Dude, I totally knew that woodchuck
question, man.

683
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:33,194
Come on, work.

684
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:37,389
All right.

685
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,564
North America.

686
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:41,740
South America.

687
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:44,878
Antarctica.

688
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:46,509
Africa.

689
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,843
Australia.

690
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:51,535
What about Australia?

691
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:53,231
Uh, nothing.

692
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,758
What's wrong, guys?

693
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:59,605
We really
are idiots.

694
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:05,073
ldiots, with, like,
a capital-

695
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:10,963
What's wrong? Your date with the Swedes
didn't go very well?

696
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:13,401
We need to Iearn.

697
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:16,020
Not just so we can
stay in our school,

698
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,953
but just so we're not
pathetic kooks.

699
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:24,763
And, you don't even
have to, like, seduce us

700
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,098
or anything like
that, you know?

701
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,882
I mean, look, if you wanted
to, you could.

702
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:32,983
But. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it. Oops.

703
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:48,507
Hey.

704
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:50,138
How's it going?

705
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,836
Okay.

706
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:55,135
Think you might have time for
a surf Iesson?

707
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:56,412
Thought you had
to focus.

708
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:58,140
It's just
a surf lesson.

709
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:03,001
I think I'm smart enough to Iearn how to
do your little surf thing.

710
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,590
This has nothing to do
with book smarts.

711
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,247
PIease.

712
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:14,021
How hard can it be? Your brain-dead
friends can do it.

713
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,883
Okay. I think I will give you
that lesson in humility.

714
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,051
Okay. Wait a second.

715
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,680
I talked to your aunt.

716
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:26,404
She told me what you're
trying to do with Dinger.

717
00:45:26,472 --> 00:45:28,098
I think it's really cool.

718
00:45:28,168 --> 00:45:32,479
I'm not trying to add to that frustration
or anything, I promise.

719
00:45:32,554 --> 00:45:34,529
I come in peace.

720
00:45:34,602 --> 00:45:37,799
When you see that friendly
little wave coming that you want

721
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,755
you align yourself
up on the wave.

722
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:44,076
When you're paddling, you're basically
gonna be doing a crawl stroke.

723
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,962
And coming over the top.

724
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:47,370
Got it.

725
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:48,419
All right.

726
00:45:48,493 --> 00:45:49,736
Looks good.

727
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:51,212
And once you feel the glide,

728
00:45:51,277 --> 00:45:53,416
you kinda do
a push up like this.

729
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:55,374
Knees slightly bent,

730
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:57,773
arms out to the side
for balance

731
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,108
and that's your
first surf lesson.

732
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:01,670
Your turn.

733
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:04,232
Okay.

734
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:06,858
Feet off the edge
of the board.

735
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:08,872
Nose out of the water.

736
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:09,961
Kick.

737
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,238
Paddle.

738
00:46:12,306 --> 00:46:13,483
Think I got it.

739
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:15,245
That's good.
Just like a pro.

740
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:08,730
Well, that
went well.

741
00:47:08,798 --> 00:47:10,685
You actually
did pretty good.

742
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,467
Paddling's looking good.
Balance is nice.

743
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:16,797
It's all good.

744
00:47:16,864 --> 00:47:19,199
I'm just not ready.

745
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:21,631
It's okay.

746
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:31,482
So, do you guys understand what Dickens'
Tale of Two Cities is about?

747
00:47:31,554 --> 00:47:34,402
Yeah. Kind
of about us.

748
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:37,020
It's about
you and Richard?

749
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:40,059
Well, the guy in the book,
Sidney, he loves Lucy,

750
00:47:40,132 --> 00:47:42,042
but Lucy
loves Charlie.

751
00:47:42,116 --> 00:47:47,781
And that is, like,pretty much,
like,the story of our lives.

752
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:53,182
See, the babes that we love, usually
Iove someone else.

753
00:47:53,255 --> 00:47:57,893
Okay, good. I mean,
not good, but-

754
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:02,694
Dickens was exploring the concept
of unrequited love,

755
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,503
when you love someone
and they don't Iove you.

756
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:08,391
You guys really got it.

757
00:48:12,746 --> 00:48:14,919
Come on, Dinger!
You're almost here!

758
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,329
Can't I just enroll
in Jenny Craig?

759
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,786
Or take a Jazzercise class?

760
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:23,876
Come on.

761
00:48:23,949 --> 00:48:25,892
Come on, baby, into my arms.

762
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:28,070
I'm coming, sweetheart

763
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,825
You can't tell me
this isn't for real.

764
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:32,105
Dude, this is gay.

765
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:33,222
Dinger!

766
00:48:37,135 --> 00:48:39,754
Have a good surf,
bro'. Get 'em.

767
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,883
Wow.

768
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:06,187
Wow. Back to tease me?

769
00:49:06,262 --> 00:49:09,361
No, just watching him surf.

770
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,082
I remember watching you
in Hawaii. You were amazing.

771
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:14,256
That was a long time ago.

772
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:17,459
Not so long. I see the way
he Iooks at you.

773
00:49:17,528 --> 00:49:19,536
He remembers. They all do.

774
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,464
You know, Pammy,
for a fantasy girl,

775
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:24,148
you can be a real
pain in the ass sometimes.

776
00:49:24,218 --> 00:49:29,074
How about
a little less pressure
and a Iot more suntan oil?

777
00:49:29,147 --> 00:49:32,977
Okay, okay. But maybe this whole thing,
you know, the changes, the challenges

778
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:36,019
maybe this
is your fantasy. Not me.

779
00:49:36,092 --> 00:49:41,047
Uh, that would be
a no, Dr. Anderson.

780
00:49:41,116 --> 00:49:43,965
You're my fantasy.

781
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,714
Well, we are making
some progress.

782
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:50,580
We just had an entire conversation
without you trying to grope me.

783
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,794
Yeah, I guess.

784
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,519
Oh, Pam. Finally, Pam.
Oh, oh, oh.

785
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:05,528
Hey, Dinger. Spring.

786
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,188
Ugh!

787
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:09,273
Dinger!

788
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:10,427
You tease!

789
00:50:10,499 --> 00:50:11,644
Puto!

790
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:14,875
Oh, Ernesto.

791
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:19,043
Lo siento mucho.

792
00:50:19,108 --> 00:50:20,897
I'm sorry, brah.

793
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:23,421
I'm hallucinatin'
from this sober thing.

794
00:50:23,494 --> 00:50:25,250
You look exactly
like Pammy though.

795
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:41,383
Do you mind
if I sit down?

796
00:50:41,448 --> 00:50:43,522
Take a seat.

797
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:51,937
Things going
any better with Dinger?

798
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:53,605
No.

799
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,294
So,

800
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:59,877
what's in your brain
that has to change?

801
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:02,185
Don't you have
some studying to do?

802
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:04,644
I'm a surfer
now. Remember?

803
00:51:07,374 --> 00:51:12,427
Sometimes it's easier to tell a stranger,
or a near stranger.

804
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:17,712
I'm just thinking about
maybe putting off Stanford.

805
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:21,553
I always dreamed
of surfing pro.

806
00:51:21,618 --> 00:51:25,644
I don't wanna look back
on life and have any regrets.

807
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:29,906
But I don't wanna turn out
like Dinger either.

808
00:51:29,971 --> 00:51:32,110
You're not him.

809
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,403
You don't think
it's crazy?

810
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:40,660
I should, I guess.

811
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:43,628
But I don't.

812
00:51:45,623 --> 00:51:48,340
Watching you surf,

813
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:50,381
it's beautiful.

814
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:53,653
I mean, it's a gift.

815
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,746
I thought I'd be the last person
to see it that way.

816
00:51:57,816 --> 00:51:59,573
But, look.

817
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:03,832
I've been studying fanatically since
I can remember.

818
00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:08,242
And I guess maybe it's not so bad
to take a break.

819
00:52:08,316 --> 00:52:10,520
Maybe it doesn't
forever damn you

820
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:14,451
into a future in fast food.

821
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:20,058
So, not to change the subject,
but I kinda have an idea.

822
00:52:20,126 --> 00:52:22,231
Are you crazy?

823
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:26,133
Setting your cool aunt up on a date
with Dinger Doolittle?

824
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:30,682
Maybe you'll inspire him.
I mean, he is risking everything for you.

825
00:52:30,752 --> 00:52:32,760
It's more
of a Don Quixote approach.

826
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:35,102
You're Dulcinea and he's your
knight errant.

827
00:52:35,169 --> 00:52:37,307
He deserves
an audience.

828
00:52:37,377 --> 00:52:40,727
Don Quixote was insane,
as is Dinger.

829
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:42,810
lnsane is
a little extreme.

830
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:45,403
I'd say
he's more eccentric.

831
00:52:45,475 --> 00:52:47,035
Right!

832
00:52:47,108 --> 00:52:49,890
Since when
did the two of you

833
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:52,291
become a tag team?

834
00:52:52,356 --> 00:52:54,745
Aren't you supposed to be
studying or something?

835
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:57,723
I believe a wise and beautiful
hotel owner

836
00:52:57,797 --> 00:53:00,318
once told me
to take a study break.

837
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,245
Come on,
it's just dinner.

838
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:06,085
He's willing to give up
his home for yo

839
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:09,021
I really think that we should
cancel this whole thing.

840
00:53:09,096 --> 00:53:12,064
I mean, he can't, he can't possibly
win, can he?

841
00:53:12,136 --> 00:53:14,111
He's a four-time
world champion.

842
00:53:14,184 --> 00:53:15,843
He's got a chance.

843
00:53:15,914 --> 00:53:18,401
All he needs
is a little time.

844
00:53:18,473 --> 00:53:20,448
Your time.

845
00:53:20,522 --> 00:53:24,713
The two of you are too smart for your
own good, and for mine.

846
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:31,530
Okay. My typical
first date.

847
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:33,571
Maybe we shouldn't
use me as a model.

848
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:35,750
Let's take a slightly
different approach.

849
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:37,512
Just be yourself,
you know,

850
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,877
the non-perverted part of yourself
that won't try to jump her bones.

851
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:44,489
God, I want you so bad.

852
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:47,975
Kid, figuratively speaking.

853
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:49,575
Look, Dinger.

854
00:53:49,647 --> 00:53:52,496
If you want any chance
with a woman like Carla,

855
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:55,115
you're gonna need
some updating.

856
00:53:55,185 --> 00:53:57,357
And you're gonna be
doing this updating?

857
00:53:57,427 --> 00:53:59,499
Me and my two
Swedish cousins.

858
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,221
Swedish cousins. Wow.

859
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,942
Are you guys gonna be wearing
something like G-strings

860
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:07,400
for my updating comfort?

861
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:11,274
Maybe, uh, after this updating
you'll hit on someone other than me.

862
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:15,827
So, this Plato isn't the stuff
made out of clay.

863
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:18,862
It's a Greek guy,
a philosopher.

864
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:21,586
Good job, Hamilton.

865
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:24,951
And, he believed

866
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:28,945
in inherent intelligence.

867
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:32,791
And that we were born knowing all
the stuff that we need to know.

868
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:35,126
We just have
to call on it.

869
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:42,426
We're, like, smart
as Asian kids.

870
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:46,420
You guys, I'm really proud of you.
You're working really hard.

871
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:53,786
So, I hear you have a big
date tonight. Oh.

872
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:55,926
Oh, no, no.
It's not a date.

873
00:54:55,998 --> 00:54:58,716
Well, don't let him
get to second base

874
00:54:58,782 --> 00:55:01,149
without finishing
the shrimp cocktail.

875
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,452
Shrimp cocktail.

876
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,416
Look, I'm just
not in the mood.

877
00:55:19,491 --> 00:55:21,597
Well, that's a surprise.

878
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:24,799
Don't take offense or anything. You're
still my Pammy, right?

879
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:26,722
If you say so, honey.

880
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:28,217
I 'll just leave you alone,

881
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:30,911
maybe just head down the beach
and go skinny-dipping.

882
00:55:30,981 --> 00:55:32,672
You're testing me.

883
00:55:39,912 --> 00:55:41,766
You're testing me.

884
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,553
Dinger, we got
to train.

885
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,927
I am training, bro'.

886
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:56,929
For what,
the next life?

887
00:55:57,002 --> 00:55:59,271
In a matter
of speaking, yes.

888
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:03,529
Maybe I'm praying
for you to loosen up.

889
00:56:03,595 --> 00:56:06,182
I've seen you surf.

890
00:56:06,252 --> 00:56:08,107
You could be great.

891
00:56:08,172 --> 00:56:10,311
You just gotta
Iet it flow.

892
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,503
But when I win, you leave
Costa Rica forever.

893
00:56:22,575 --> 00:56:25,642
I know.

894
00:56:25,712 --> 00:56:28,298
Are you gonna help
Carla or not?

895
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:30,923
I know what matters.

896
00:56:30,993 --> 00:56:35,337
It's okay, honey. She's
real. I understand.

897
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:39,666
When you love someone
and they don't love you.

898
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:42,120
Mind over matter.

899
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:45,043
Maybe the time is now.

900
00:56:45,108 --> 00:56:48,720
You know, go bye-bye.

901
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:50,383
You just gotta
let it flow.

902
00:56:56,311 --> 00:57:00,370
Oh! What's that? Ow! Oh.

903
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:05,554
How's it going?

904
00:57:05,624 --> 00:57:07,600
Um, well,

905
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:10,226
Iet's just say
no felony charges yet.

906
00:57:10,297 --> 00:57:12,305
A few misdemeanors maybe.

907
00:57:12,378 --> 00:57:14,320
I'm sure he'll be fine.

908
00:57:14,395 --> 00:57:16,729
No, don't.
Give Kyle my stuff.

909
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:19,250
Oh.

910
00:57:19,322 --> 00:57:20,850
Oh!

911
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:24,023
He wanted me to give you this stuff.
I found it in his hair.

912
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:27,606
I'd give you the plate, but we're going
through his underarm hair now

913
00:57:27,676 --> 00:57:29,749
and I'll probably need it.

914
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:30,967
All right.

915
00:57:31,038 --> 00:57:32,761
Yeah. He likes
Britney Spears.

916
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,548
Don't lose my Britney,
Baby One More Time.

917
00:57:35,614 --> 00:57:37,819
You owe me another
surf lesson after this.

918
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,131
You got it.

919
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:40,377
Mom, help!

920
00:57:40,447 --> 00:57:42,389
Uh, I should probably
get back to that.

921
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:43,839
Good luck.

922
00:57:43,904 --> 00:57:46,076
I wanna go back
to the beach!

923
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:53,118
Oh, my God.
You look amazing.

924
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:55,553
Thank you.

925
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:59,481
All right. If this goes bad, I'm gonna
kill you, you know that, right?

926
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:01,923
Come on. Just give it
a chance. You might like him.

927
00:58:01,988 --> 00:58:03,647
I think you will.

928
00:58:03,716 --> 00:58:06,947
You know when I first moved here
about 12 years ago I, I

929
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:11,771
met Dinger Doolittle and he was
the resident surf god.

930
00:58:11,846 --> 00:58:13,634
He was something.

931
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:18,300
I mean, not my type,
of course.

932
00:58:18,376 --> 00:58:19,783
Of course.

933
00:58:19,848 --> 00:58:21,539
He was
a stupid surfer.

934
00:58:21,608 --> 00:58:23,463
Yes.

935
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:27,716
Oh, my God.

936
00:58:30,154 --> 00:58:31,976
Dinger, is that you?

937
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:35,840
I think so.
Can't be a 100 percent,

938
00:58:35,915 --> 00:58:38,304
but, it sure
bears a resemblance.

939
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:42,690
Uh, you, you look-

940
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:44,259
Human again?

941
00:58:44,332 --> 00:58:47,595
Uh, you Iook great.

942
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:50,443
Well, you Iook amazing without my vomit
all over you.

943
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,063
Oh.

944
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,053
Here's a peace offering
for blowing the chunks.

945
00:58:59,855 --> 00:59:02,606
That, these grow up
by my house.

946
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,615
Mattress.

947
00:59:04,689 --> 00:59:08,432
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

948
00:59:10,578 --> 00:59:13,034
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

949
00:59:13,107 --> 00:59:15,562
Yeah.

950
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:17,458
Yeah.

951
00:59:17,524 --> 00:59:19,466
You kids
be back early.

952
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,428
We'll be waiting.

953
00:59:28,342 --> 00:59:30,709
We want
to apologize.

954
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:33,622
Yeah, we were rude.
You are not so stupid.

955
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:36,590
Ya. Come.
We will play.

956
00:59:36,663 --> 00:59:37,678
Ya.

957
00:59:37,752 --> 00:59:39,159
We go skinny
dip, ya?

958
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:40,304
Oh, ya.

959
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,100
We're trying
not to be so stupid.

960
00:59:42,169 --> 00:59:43,314
Yeah.

961
00:59:43,385 --> 00:59:45,360
We'll pass.

962
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:52,145
Bro', put it in the books. I'm gonna
split the atom one day.

963
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:56,148
Hey, we have to review Stalin's
reign of terror, too.

964
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,627
Oh, yeah.

965
00:59:57,692 --> 00:59:59,832
Wat if we said

966
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,032
that we do
go skinny-dipping.

967
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:06,484
So you can see
our hooters, ya?

968
01:00:06,558 --> 01:00:09,176
Ya. Maybe touch. Ya?

969
01:00:09,246 --> 01:00:11,898
Ha. We'll take
a rain check.

970
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:15,001
Okay. We show
you now.

971
01:00:19,872 --> 01:00:22,972
Dude, l found a dangling
participle right here.

972
01:00:24,865 --> 01:00:26,524
Oh!

973
01:00:28,994 --> 01:00:30,881
Was that a dream?

974
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:42,881
You did an amazing job.
I can't believe it's him.

975
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:44,476
Thanks.

976
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,300
You don't have to be doing
this, you know.

977
01:00:47,366 --> 01:00:50,301
You could
be studying.

978
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:53,309
I think I needed
a study break.

979
01:01:13,163 --> 01:01:17,157
What's going on with you and this
bet, Dinger?

980
01:01:17,229 --> 01:01:21,058
I mean, I appreciate the sentiment,
but it's wrong.

981
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:23,173
It feels
right to me.

982
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:26,792
It's not your
problem, it's mine.

983
01:01:26,862 --> 01:01:30,245
What if helping you with your problem
helps me with mine?

984
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:35,273
Look, I don't wanna be
like I've been.

985
01:01:35,344 --> 01:01:36,970
I can't.

986
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:40,075
And if this is the reason
to change, you,

987
01:01:40,144 --> 01:01:43,494
it's as good as any.

988
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,293
Better.

989
01:01:49,075 --> 01:01:51,410
Thanks for doing this
with me, Carla.

990
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:53,231
Thank you.
I had a really
nice time.

991
01:01:53,299 --> 01:01:54,281
Really?

992
01:01:54,355 --> 01:01:55,763
Really.

993
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:04,782
Oh, wow.

994
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,610
Someone's smiling.

995
01:02:06,678 --> 01:02:08,882
I'm not doing
this with you guys.

996
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,511
Come on.

997
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,386
Okay.

998
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:16,790
Let's kick
butt-muncher's butt.

999
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:30,745
Come in.
We want to play.

1000
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:32,754
PIease, we're studying.

1001
01:02:32,827 --> 01:02:37,368
Well, study
anatomy. Ours.

1002
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:40,023
Dude, I can't
concentrate here.

1003
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:44,600
Yeah, let's leave these aquatic
recreational facilities.

1004
01:02:57,632 --> 01:02:59,127
Come on, Dinger.

1005
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:01,089
PIease, let
him get up.

1006
01:03:07,107 --> 01:03:09,628
Two words.

1007
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:13,662
Okay. First word.

1008
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:17,280
That's it, Richard.
Okay. Um,

1009
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:19,389
two syllables.

1010
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:23,455
Excellent! Yes.

1011
01:03:23,527 --> 01:03:24,988
All right.

1012
01:03:25,062 --> 01:03:26,077
Miss Dante.

1013
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:27,231
Yeah?

1014
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,085
Oh, come on, girls.
Get outta here!

1015
01:03:36,553 --> 01:03:38,593
Hey, what's up, brah?

1016
01:04:24,275 --> 01:04:26,894
My God.

1017
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:40,076
Carla.

1018
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,132
Hey.

1019
01:04:41,207 --> 01:04:43,029
You wanna talk to me?

1020
01:04:43,094 --> 01:04:45,461
Yeah, um,

1021
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:48,561
Look, everybody in town knows
that I have rooms available

1022
01:04:48,632 --> 01:04:52,178
and I think it's only right
that you have one.

1023
01:04:52,249 --> 01:04:53,940
Stay here?

1024
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:56,212
In an actual room?

1025
01:04:56,281 --> 01:04:58,223
Yes.

1026
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:01,080
And sleep in the bed?

1027
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:02,390
With sheets?

1028
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:03,986
Yes.

1029
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:05,520
And use the bathroom?

1030
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:07,832
Yes, you can even use the shower
if you want.

1031
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,557
And the soap?

1032
01:05:09,627 --> 01:05:11,221
Yes.

1033
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:15,483
Well, Carla, you know, this is
kind of a surprise to me.

1034
01:05:15,549 --> 01:05:17,884
You wanting me to move
on so fast and all.

1035
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,056
I mean, I had
a great time on our date.

1036
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,549
And the kiss
was certainly erotic.

1037
01:05:22,622 --> 01:05:26,453
But you know a guy usually has to play
a little hard to get.

1038
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:30,270
You're asking me to be your live-in
boy toy.

1039
01:05:30,335 --> 01:05:33,533
No. I am offering
you a room.

1040
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:36,471
Not my room.

1041
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:38,619
Yes or no.

1042
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:41,658
Yes.

1043
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:45,561
Okay.

1044
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,853
Oh!

1045
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:35,824
A bed. With sheets.

1046
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:37,011
Yeah.

1047
01:07:37,082 --> 01:07:39,090
Light!

1048
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,051
Yeah! Light!

1049
01:07:43,323 --> 01:07:45,331
Okay. You can let go
of me now.

1050
01:07:47,741 --> 01:07:51,287
God. She really
loves me, doesn't she?

1051
01:07:53,086 --> 01:07:54,973
Love is
a little strong.

1052
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:58,138
I would say
it's more,

1053
01:07:58,206 --> 01:07:59,668
more of a like.

1054
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:02,843
Love, like, they all start
with the letter L, right?

1055
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,286
Yeah, that
they do.

1056
01:08:04,352 --> 01:08:05,629
All righty then.

1057
01:08:07,136 --> 01:08:10,072
Wow, there's water
in this toilet.

1058
01:08:10,144 --> 01:08:12,633
Oh, man. Soap.

1059
01:08:12,706 --> 01:08:14,779
Soap.

1060
01:08:17,474 --> 01:08:19,841
Was I really
your hero once?

1061
01:08:19,907 --> 01:08:22,941
Yeah.

1062
01:08:26,884 --> 01:08:28,379
Look, Big Brah.

1063
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:30,558
I never asked
you for anything.

1064
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:34,078
And it's not like I'm asking
for that much now.

1065
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:37,315
Maybe just a little karma.

1066
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:41,149
You're not coming
home tonight?

1067
01:08:41,223 --> 01:08:44,540
Well, she offered
and I felt kinda obligated.

1068
01:08:44,616 --> 01:08:47,170
I mean, it can't
hurt the filly.

1069
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,111
It's just one night.
I'll be back, Pammy.

1070
01:08:50,185 --> 01:08:52,193
Good night, Dinger.

1071
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:53,827
Good night.

1072
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:54,127
He's close.

1073
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:57,777
Eva, the competition
is tomorrow.

1074
01:09:57,847 --> 01:10:02,191
CIose means Dinger
leaves here forever.

1075
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:06,324
CIose means Carla
Ioses the hotel.

1076
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:10,964
Are you all right?

1077
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:14,450
Yeah. Maybe
a little scared.

1078
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:16,432
Well, a little
scared is normal.

1079
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:18,875
You know, I wanted
to apologize to you, Pam.

1080
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,249
For what?

1081
01:10:20,315 --> 01:10:22,967
For treating you like
a fantasy all these years.

1082
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:25,109
You know, an object.

1083
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:27,701
The hottest object
in the history of mankind.

1084
01:10:27,773 --> 01:10:30,741
I mean,those 11 Playboy
covers confirm that.

1085
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:32,724
It's 13.

1086
01:10:32,798 --> 01:10:34,740
Anyway, the truth is

1087
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:37,598
while most of us are scared
to death of love,

1088
01:10:37,663 --> 01:10:39,933
you at least
give it a chance.

1089
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,422
You take your boys
to Little League games.

1090
01:10:42,497 --> 01:10:44,766
You rescue animals.

1091
01:10:44,832 --> 01:10:48,827
You've been the best friend
a Iost soul could ever have.

1092
01:10:48,898 --> 01:10:51,932
Thank you, Dinger.

1093
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:53,824
I have to go.

1094
01:10:55,428 --> 01:10:57,403
I know.

1095
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,565
I could call it off.

1096
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:10,208
No. We're ready.

1097
01:11:10,278 --> 01:11:12,667
The legend returns,
right brah?

1098
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:16,355
Look, Dinger, you don't have
to do this.

1099
01:11:16,424 --> 01:11:19,685
A hero's more
than a sandwich, kid.

1100
01:11:19,752 --> 01:11:21,061
Look at you guys.

1101
01:11:21,129 --> 01:11:23,714
You all look like Lindsay Lohan
without a beer.

1102
01:11:23,786 --> 01:11:26,503
Come on.
Have some faith.

1103
01:11:26,569 --> 01:11:29,090
Tomorrow the Dinger
rides again.

1104
01:11:29,162 --> 01:11:31,399
Just like
that Plato dude said.

1105
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:33,923
It's all
inside me, right?

1106
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:36,036
Yeah.

1107
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,561
And Carla.

1108
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,035
Yeah?

1109
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,134
I wrote
a song. Do you
mind if I play it?

1110
01:11:44,206 --> 01:11:45,581
Sure.

1111
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:55,562
Oh.

1112
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:09,965

Will lead him to victory

1126
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:13,723
Whoooo

1127
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:19,358
# I love my family
In Costa Rica

1128
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:25,056
# This is my family
In Costa Rica

1129
01:13:25,762 --> 01:13:28,632
# This is my family-

1130
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:32,634
Wow.

1131
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,359
What a tender moment
for a bunch of losers

1132
01:13:35,429 --> 01:13:37,917
on the verge
of complete annihilation.

1133
01:13:37,988 --> 01:13:40,378
So, Carla,
I heard about
your little date.

1134
01:13:40,453 --> 01:13:43,355
You really that hard up you have to do
a makeover on the wino?

1135
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:46,332
I'd leave now,
butt-muncher.

1136
01:13:48,295 --> 01:13:50,302
You're the only one
leaving, Doolittle.

1137
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,165
And I'm sure with
a little bit of luck,

1138
01:13:52,232 --> 01:13:55,428
you'll soon have your very own shopping
cart in downtown Detroit.

1139
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,223
After I destroy
your drunk boyfriend,

1140
01:14:00,298 --> 01:14:04,073
my lawyer will begin foreclosing
on your little hotel.

1141
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:06,081
You had your
chance, baby.

1142
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:08,611
You blew it.

1143
01:14:08,683 --> 01:14:11,498
Wow. Congratulations, Brad.

1144
01:14:11,564 --> 01:14:15,307
That was perhaps the best dick speech
in the history of all dicks.

1145
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:18,122
Which is appropriate
'cause your fly's open.

1146
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:23,054
That's right.
Made you look.

1147
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,244
You guys get a good
night's sleep.

1148
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:31,109
'Cause tomorrow, you and your girlfriend
lose everything.

1149
01:14:31,183 --> 01:14:36,040
Oh, that's right.
You do have that one chance.

1150
01:14:36,113 --> 01:14:38,960
Yeah. I remember.

1151
01:14:39,024 --> 01:14:41,895
That's right.

1152
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:50,568
# This is my family
In Costa Rica

1153
01:15:34,812 --> 01:15:36,787
You know, Brad.

1154
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:42,365
You should be real
careful with karma.

1155
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:44,570
It can bite you in the ass.

1156
01:15:44,638 --> 01:15:47,290
Pearls of wisdom
from the wino.

1157
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,387
Well, well. You and your sorry-ass
entourage have actually shown up

1158
01:15:51,456 --> 01:15:54,174
Let's keep this simple so even
you can understand

1159
01:15:54,241 --> 01:15:57,275
Three waves,
best two out of three wins.

1160
01:15:57,345 --> 01:16:01,983
Translation? After two quick rides,
you leave Costa Rica forever.

1161
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:05,150
Now, can you tell my beautiful friends
what happens if I win?

1162
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:08,700
Yeah, yeah, of course. If there happens
to be an act of God,

1163
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:13,791
Ms. Dante here will not have to pay her
mortgage for one year.

1164
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,650
You sober enough to begin?

1165
01:16:15,717 --> 01:16:18,401
Let's do this.

1166
01:16:21,927 --> 01:16:25,472
Thanks for everything,
brah. You okay?

1167
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,278
Yeah.

1168
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:31,491
You can do this.

1169
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:34,310
The Iegend returns.

1170
01:16:36,553 --> 01:16:38,081
Come on, fatso.

1171
01:16:38,154 --> 01:16:40,358
After you, Brad.

1172
01:16:43,787 --> 01:16:48,360
Come on, Dinger! Okay, Dinger, come on.
You can do it!

1173
01:17:08,112 --> 01:17:11,690
Ah-ha-ha.
You better pray, Doolittle.

1174
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:21,325
What's he doing out there?

1175
01:17:21,394 --> 01:17:23,085
Just wait. It's cool, man.

1176
01:17:23,156 --> 01:17:24,530
What's he doing?

1177
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,488
Great. He's
praying again.

1178
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:39,404
Whoa. Wha-
What's going on?

1179
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:41,967
This doesn't look good.

1180
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:50,929
Think God's crying.

1181
01:17:53,018 --> 01:17:55,385
Whoa! Whoa!

1182
01:17:57,466 --> 01:17:58,328
Oh!

1183
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:02,359
Di- did you see
that lightning bolt?

1184
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,834
Oh.

1185
01:18:03,899 --> 01:18:05,874
He just got struck
by lightning.

1186
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:07,378
I'll save you, Brad!

1187
01:18:07,452 --> 01:18:08,500
Help.

1188
01:18:08,572 --> 01:18:10,166
Grab my board.

1189
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:23,064
Oh, my God.

1190
01:18:23,136 --> 01:18:26,038
Don't worry, everyone. He's
not dead.

1191
01:18:26,112 --> 01:18:28,763
Miss Dante? We don't
have to know anything

1192
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:33,504
about supernatural phenomenas
for the exam, do we?

1193
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:39,451
Anyone wanna
help him?

1194
01:18:39,523 --> 01:18:41,890
I think he shit
his pants.

1195
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:46,873
Whoo-hoo!

1196
01:18:46,948 --> 01:18:48,126
You did it!

1197
01:18:48,196 --> 01:18:49,986
We did it, brah!

1198
01:18:50,053 --> 01:18:52,224
You did it!

1199
01:18:54,598 --> 01:18:56,933
No way.
The Dinger's back.

1200
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,658
Is that what you
were praying for?

1201
01:18:58,726 --> 01:19:01,279
Yes, and you were in there,
too, brah.

1202
01:19:01,351 --> 01:19:04,035
I'm gonna need a surf
coach if I go pro.

1203
01:19:04,104 --> 01:19:06,658
You got it.

1204
01:19:06,728 --> 01:19:09,991
I know I didn't beat him the way I used
to back in the day,

1205
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:13,800
but I still won
for the woman I love.

1206
01:19:13,866 --> 01:19:17,958
That's what they call unrequited love.
Dickens wrote about that.

1207
01:19:18,026 --> 01:19:20,994
Yeah, that's
when you love somebody

1208
01:19:21,067 --> 01:19:23,402
but they don't
love you back.

1209
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:27,211
That might not
apply here, boys.

1210
01:19:32,237 --> 01:19:34,955
Sorry about that. I just wanted
to say goodbye.

1211
01:19:35,022 --> 01:19:39,016
God, I'm so
proud of you.

1212
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:41,161
Well, you always
wanted that kiss.

1213
01:19:49,168 --> 01:19:51,984
Is that all you got, Dinger?

1214
01:19:54,066 --> 01:19:56,335
Not even close!

1215
01:20:14,678 --> 01:20:17,199
Book. Uh, Seven words.

1216
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,645
First word.

1217
01:20:18,712 --> 01:20:20,981
Okay. One syllable.

1218
01:20:21,048 --> 01:20:24,016
Prayer. Prayer.
Uh, uh, chicken.

1219
01:20:24,088 --> 01:20:27,122
Uh, hen, hen.
Okay. Sounds like,

1220
01:20:27,193 --> 01:20:29,812
uh, Zen. Zen. All right. Uh,
second word, second word.

1221
01:20:29,882 --> 01:20:31,508
Enough! We give up.

1222
01:20:31,578 --> 01:20:32,952
Enough!

1223
01:20:33,018 --> 01:20:34,612
We, we respected
your minds.

1224
01:20:34,682 --> 01:20:39,867
Yes. So now, we give to you
our bodies. Ya?

1225
01:20:39,932 --> 01:20:44,089
Uh, if l remember correctly,
I think you guys called us

1226
01:20:44,157 --> 01:20:45,749
uh, stupid Americans?

1227
01:20:45,821 --> 01:20:50,425
You're on
the lame train. We've
seen this show before.

1228
01:20:51,998 --> 01:20:57,945
You boys like
to go motor boating?

1229
01:20:58,015 --> 01:20:59,063
Ya.

1230
01:21:01,408 --> 01:21:04,638
Oh, yeah, we
love you boys.

1231
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:05,687
Come on.

1232
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:25,111
