1
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,110
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

2
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,472
Willy?

3
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:09,351
It's all right.
I came back.

4
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:12,437
Why, what happened?
Did something happen, Willy?

5
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:14,981
- Nothing happened.
- You didn't smash the car?

6
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:17,608
I said nothing happened!

7
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,194
- Didn't you hear me?
- Don't you feel well?

8
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:23,156
I'm tired to the death.

9
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:26,742
I, uh, I couldn't make it.

10
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,536
I just couldn't make it, Linda.

11
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:30,955
Where were you all day?
You look terrible.

12
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:33,875
Oh, I got as far
as a little above Yonkers.

13
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,252
I stopped for a cup of coffee.

14
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,796
- Maybe it was the coffee.
- What?

15
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:41,007
I suddenly couldn't drive anymore.

16
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,259
The car kept going off
onto the shoulder.

17
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,677
Maybe it's the steering.

18
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,054
I don't think
Angelo knows the Studebaker.

19
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:50,309
No, it's me. Suddenly I realise
I'm going 60 miles an hour

20
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:53,019
and I don't remember
the last five minutes.

21
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,479
I can't seem to keep my mind to it.

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,567
Maybe it's your glasses.
You never went for new glasses.

23
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,360
I see everything.
I came back ten miles an hour.

24
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,863
It took me nearly four hours
from Yonkers.

25
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:07,701
You just gotta take a rest.
You can't continue like this.

26
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,202
Aw, I just got back from Florida.

27
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:12,204
But you didn't rest your mind.

28
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:15,500
Your mind is overactive
and the mind is what counts, dear.

29
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,337
I'll start out in the morning.
Maybe I'll feel better in the morning.

30
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,214
Oh, these... these arch supports
are killing me.

31
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,841
Take an aspirin.

32
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,385
Should I get you an aspirin?
Lt'll soothe you.

33
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:29,656
I was driving along, understand?
I was fine.

34
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:32,641
I was even observing the scenery.

35
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:36,480
You can imagine me looking at scenery
on the road every week of my life.

36
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:38,773
But it's so beautiful up there, Linda.

37
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,941
The trees are thick and the sun is warm.

38
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:44,237
I just open the windshield
and let the warm air bathe over me.

39
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,839
And then all of a sudden I'm...

40
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,116
...l'm going off the road.

41
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,953
I'm telling you,
I absolutely forgot I was driving.

42
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,457
If I'd have gone the other way
over the white line

43
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,059
I might have killed somebody.

44
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:03,381
So, I went on again and five minutes
later I'm dreaming again and I nearly...

45
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:09,262
I have such thoughts.
I have such strange thoughts.

46
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,681
Talk to them again, Willy.

47
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,727
There's no reason
why you can't work in New York.

48
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:18,688
I'm the New England man.
I'm vital in New England.

49
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:22,567
You're 60 years old. They can't expect
you to keep driving every week.

50
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,695
I'll have to send a wire to Portland.

51
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:29,950
I'm supposed to see Brown and Morrison
tomorrow morning to show the line.

52
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,159
- Oh, I could sell them.
- Now, Willy.

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,620
Go down to that place again.
Talk to Howard.

54
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:37,999
Tell him you gotta work in New York.
You're too accommodating.

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,711
If old man Wagner was alive,
I'd have been in charge of New York now.

56
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,338
That man was a prince.
He was a masterful man.

57
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,924
That boy of his, Howard,
he don't appreciate.

58
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:48,676
When I went north the first time,

59
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:51,512
the Wagner Company didn't know
where New England was.

60
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:53,806
Why don't you
tell these things to Howard?

61
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,534
Oh, I will. I definitely will.

62
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,898
- Oh, is there any cheese?
- I'll make you a sandwich.

63
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,233
Go to sleep. I'll take some milk.

64
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,210
Geez.

65
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,589
Maybe he smashed up the car again.

66
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:14,244
He's gonna get his licence taken away
if he keeps that up.

67
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,787
I'm getting nervous about him, you know.

68
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:19,373
- His eyes are gone.
- No, I've driven with him.

69
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:22,335
He sees all right.
Just, he doesn't keep his mind on it.

70
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,628
I drove into the city
with him last week.

71
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,339
He stops at a green light.
It turns red and he goes.

72
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,174
- Maybe he's colour blind.
- Pop?

73
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,844
He's got the finest eye for colour
in the business.

74
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,221
- The boys in?
- They're sleeping.

75
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,974
- Happy took Biff on a date tonight.
- Is that so?

76
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:39,811
It was so thrilling,
seeing them shaving together,

77
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:43,189
one behind the other in the bathroom
and going out together.

78
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:45,190
- Did you notice?
- Hm?

79
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,236
The whole house smells
of shaving lotion.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,112
Figure it out.

81
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:53,283
Work a lifetime to pay off a house.
You finally own it.

82
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:55,367
There's nobody to live in it.

83
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:57,870
Life's a casting off.
It's always that way.

84
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,539
No, no, some people
accomplish something.

85
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,250
Did Biff say anything
after I went this morning?

86
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:06,838
You shouldn't have criticised him,
after he just got off the train.

87
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,425
- You must not lose your temper at him.
- When did I lose my temper?

88
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,968
I simply asked him
if he was making any money.

89
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:16,348
- Is that criticism?
- Willy, how could he make any money?

90
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:18,807
There's such an undercurrent in him.

91
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,312
He became a moody man. Did he apologise
when I left this morning?

92
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:26,149
He was crestfallen, Willy.
Now, you know how he admires you.

93
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:30,278
I think when he finds himself you'll
both be happier and you won't fight.

94
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,988
How can he find himself on a farm?
Is that a life?

95
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,115
A farmhand in the beginning
when he was young,

96
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:39,079
I thought, a young man, it's good
for him to travel, take differentjobs.

97
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:42,457
It's more than ten years and
he has yet to make 35 dollars a week.

98
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,583
He is finding himself, Willy.

99
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,377
Not finding yourself at the age of 34
is a disgrace.

100
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,880
- Shh!
- The trouble is, he's lazy!

101
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:53,343
- Willy, please, they are sleeping.
- Biff is a lazy...

102
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,302
...bum!
- Go down!

103
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:58,013
Get yourself something to eat
and be quiet.

104
00:06:58,014 --> 00:06:59,848
Why did he come home?

105
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,184
I would like to know
what brought him home.

106
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:05,355
Well, I don't know.
I think he's still lost, Willy.

107
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,272
I think he's very lost.

108
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:10,318
Biff Loman is lost
in the greatest country in the world.

109
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,571
A young man with such
personal attractiveness gets lost?

110
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:16,866
And such a hard worker.

111
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,493
There's one thing about Biff.
He's not lazy.

112
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,804
Never.

113
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:26,251
I'll see him in the morning, have
a talk with him, get him a job selling.

114
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,043
He'd be big in no time.

115
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:31,506
Remember the way they used to
follow him around in high school?

116
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:35,802
Oh, when he just smiled at them
their faces lit up.

117
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:40,306
When he walked down the
street with a crowd of kids behind him.

118
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,641
Will you ever forget that?

119
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,018
- You smoking?
- You want one?

120
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,872
I can never sleep when I smell it.

121
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:52,443
It's funny, Biff, you know... us.

122
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:56,155
Sleeping in here again, huh?
The old beds.

123
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,116
All the talk that went across
those two beds, huh?

124
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:01,343
- Our whole lives.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:03,412
A lotta dreams and plans.

126
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:06,875
About 500 women would like to know
what was said in this room.

127
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:11,004
- Remember that big Betsy something?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:14,007
What the hell was her name?
Over on Bushwick Avenue.

129
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,967
- With the collie dog.
- Yeah, that's the one.

130
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,014
- I got you in there, man.
- That was my first time, I think.

131
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:24,017
Boy, there was a pig.

132
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,604
You taught me everything I know
about women. Don't forget that.

133
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:31,316
I bet you forgot how bashful
you used to be, especially with girls.

134
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,444
Oh, I still am, Biff.
I just control it, that's all.

135
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,571
I think I got less bashful.

136
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:39,615
You got more so.

137
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:43,244
What happened, Biff?
Where's your old humour?

138
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:47,081
The old confidence?
What's the matter?

139
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,878
- Why does Dad mock me all the time?
- He's not mocking you, Biff.

140
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:55,590
Everything I say there's mockery
on his face. I can't get near him.

141
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:58,091
I think the fact
that you're not settled,

142
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:59,926
that you're still up in the air.

143
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:02,471
I think there's other things
depressing him.

144
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,265
- What do you mean?
- Never mind. Don't lay it all to me.

145
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,601
But I think if you just got started...

146
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,563
I mean, is there any future
for you out there?

147
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:14,609
I don't know what the future is.
I don't know what I'm supposed to want.

148
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:16,193
What do you mean?

149
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:21,240
I spent six or seven years after
high school trying to work myself up.

150
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:24,660
Shipping clerk, salesman,
business of one kind or another.

151
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,953
It's a measly manner of existence.

152
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:30,458
To get on that subway
in the hot mornings in the summer,

153
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,796
to devote your whole life
to keeping stock or making phone calls.

154
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,214
And the selling, the buying.

155
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:41,594
To suffer 50 weeks of the year
for the sake of a two week vacation,

156
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:46,808
when all you really desire
is to be outdoors with your shirt off.

157
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:50,186
And always to have to get ahead
of the next fellow.

158
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,396
Still, that's how you build a future.

159
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:56,359
I bought a new kind
of American type cheese. It's whipped.

160
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:58,360
Why do you get American?
I like Swiss.

161
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:01,447
- I thought you'd like a change.
- I don't want a change.

162
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,118
- Why am I always being contradicted?
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

163
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:08,746
- Why don't you open a window in here?
- They're all open.

164
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,333
They boxed us in here.
Bricks and windows, windows and bricks.

165
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,835
We should have bought
the land next door.

166
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,880
There's not a breath of fresh air
in the neighbourhood.

167
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:20,799
The grass don't grow anymore.
You can't raise a carrot.

168
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,719
They should have had a law
against apartment houses.

169
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,890
Remember those two beautiful elm trees?

170
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:33,020
When I and Biff
hung the swing between them, huh?

171
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,438
Like being a million miles
from the city.

172
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,901
They should have arrested the builder
for cutting those down.

173
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,670
They massacred the neighbourhood.

174
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:48,703
More and more I think of those days,
Linda, this time of year.

175
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:51,496
It was lilacs and wisteria

176
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:54,667
and then the peonies
would come out... daffodils.

177
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,502
What fragrance in this room.

178
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,673
- People had to move somewhere.
- There's more people now.

179
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:03,341
- I don't think...
- There's more people!

180
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:07,513
That's what's ruining this country!
Population is getting out of control!

181
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:10,348
The competition is maddening!

182
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:14,979
Smell the stink from that apartment
house and another on the other side!

183
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,960
How can they whip cheese?

184
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:25,197
Go down, try it and be quiet.

185
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:33,748
You're not worried about me,
are you, sweetheart, huh?

186
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:39,003
No, you've got too much on the ball
to be worried about, my darling.

187
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:43,883
You're my foundation
and my support, Linda.

188
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:47,970
Oh, just try to relax.
You make mountains out of molehills.

189
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,846
I won't fight with him anymore.

190
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,931
If he wants to go to Texas, let him go.

191
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,558
- He'll find his way.
- Sure.

192
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,520
Certain men just don't get started
till later in life.

193
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:59,649
Like Thomas Edison, I think,

194
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:02,417
or B.F. Goodrich.

195
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,171
One of them was deaf.

196
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:08,865
I'll put my money on Biff.

197
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:12,745
And Willy, if it's warm Sunday
we'll drive in the country.

198
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:15,413
We'll open the windshield,
we'll take lunch.

199
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:18,083
The windshields don't open
on the new cars.

200
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:21,420
- But you opened it today.
- Me?

201
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,315
I didn't.

202
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:29,236
Now, isn't that peculiar?

203
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:35,184
- Isn't that remarkable?
- What, dear?

204
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:39,814
That is the most remarkable thing.

205
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:43,041
What, darling?

206
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:46,169
I was thinking of the Chevy.

207
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:52,618
1928, when I had that red Chevy.

208
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,306
Isn't that funny?

209
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,752
I could have sworn
I was back in that Chevy today.

210
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:06,465
That's nothing.
Something must have reminded you.

211
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,693
Remarkable.

212
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,946
Remember those days, huh?

213
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:17,101
The way Biff used to simonise that car?

214
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:20,688
Dealer refused to believe
there was 80,000 miles on it.

215
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:25,568
Close your eyes.
I'll be right up.

216
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:28,570
Now, you be careful on the stairs.

217
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:31,824
- The cheese is on the middle shelf.
- Eighty thousand mi...

218
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:34,760
Eighty-two thousand.

219
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:43,252
No, I've always made a point
of not wasting my life.

220
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:47,131
Whenever I come back here I know that
all I've done is to waste my life.

221
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:49,966
You're a poet, Biff.
You know that?

222
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:54,722
- You're an idealist.
- No, I'm mixed up very bad.

223
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:57,725
Maybe I ought to get married, right?

224
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,935
Maybe I ought
to get stuck into something.

225
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:02,478
Maybe that's my trouble.

226
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:06,233
I'm like a boy.
I'm not married, I'm not in business.

227
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:09,044
I'm just like a boy.

228
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,530
Are you content, Hap?

229
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:15,200
You're a success, aren't you?
Are you content?

230
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:18,077
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You're making money.

231
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,665
All I can do now is wait for
the merchandise manager to die.

232
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:30,382
Listen, kid, why don't you
come out West with me?

233
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,216
And you and I?

234
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:36,221
Maybe we can buy a ranch,
raise cattle, use some muscles.

235
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:39,223
Men built like we are
should be working in the open.

236
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:41,809
- The Loman brothers?
- We'd be known all over.

237
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,479
Biff, Biff, that's
what I dream of sometimes.

238
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,651
Sometimes I want to rip my clothes off
and outbox the merchandise manager.

239
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,152
I can outbox, out lift,
outrun anybody in the store

240
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:53,696
and I have to take orders
from those sons of bitches.

241
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,531
If you were with me I'd be happier.

242
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:59,203
Everybody around me is so false
that I am constantly lowering my ideals.

243
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:02,915
Together we'd stand up for one another.

244
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:06,001
We werert brought up to grub for money.
I don't know how.

245
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,419
- Neither can I.
- Let's go.

246
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,089
The only thing is,
what can you make out there?

247
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,090
Hap!

248
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,678
I got to show some
of those pompous executives there

249
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,613
that Hap Loman can make the grade, huh?

250
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:21,491
Then I'll go with you, Biff.

251
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,018
We'll be together yet.

252
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:26,913
I swear, huh?

253
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:31,060
But take those two we had tonight.
Werert they gorgeous creatures?

254
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,603
Yeah, most gorgeous I've had in years.

255
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:36,857
I get that any time I want, Biff.
Whenever I feel disgusted.

256
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:40,069
The only trouble is,
it gets like bowling or something.

257
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:43,364
I just keep knocking them over.
It doesn't mean anything.

258
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,532
- You still run around a lot?
- Nah.

259
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:49,703
I'd like to find a girl steady,
somebody with substance.

260
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:52,664
- Mm-hmm. That's what I long for.
- Go on.

261
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,958
- You'd never come home.
- I would.

262
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,960
Somebody with character, like Mom.

263
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,838
You're gonna call me a bastard
when I tell you this.

264
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,675
That girl Charlotte I was with,
engaged to be married.

265
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,592
- No kidding.
- Sure.

266
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:07,178
Guy's in line
for the vice-presidency of the store.

267
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,680
I don't know what gets into me.

268
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:11,642
Maybe I have an overdeveloped
sense of competition.

269
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,728
I went and ruined her.
Furthermore, I can't get rid of her.

270
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,980
He's the third executive
I've done that to.

271
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:19,107
Isn't that a crummy characteristic?

272
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:22,252
And to top it all,
I go to their weddings.

273
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,031
Don't get your sweater dirty!
Biff!

274
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,074
Doesrt he know Mom can hear that?

275
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:31,662
Oh, what a simonising job. Huh?

276
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:34,665
Look, Biff, don't leave again, will you?

277
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:37,041
You'll find a job here, Biff.

278
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,085
- You gotta stay.
- Hey, Biff-o!

279
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,963
I don't know what to do.
It's getting embarrassing.

280
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:44,800
Oh, boy, what a simonising job.

281
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:50,139
Look, you go to sleep now but
talk to him in the morning, will ya?

282
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:53,559
- With her in the house?
- We should have a good talk with him.

283
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:56,645
- That selfish, stupid...
- Shh. Sleep, Biff.

284
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:04,377
No kidding, Biff.
You got a date?

285
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:13,704
Listen, um, you just want
to be careful with those...

286
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,914
...those girls, Biff.
That's all.

287
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:18,583
Don't make any promises,
no promises, Biff.

288
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,127
No promises of any kind.

289
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:24,924
'Cause the girls, you know,
they always believe what you tell them.

290
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,342
You're very young, Biff.

291
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:32,348
You're too young
to be talking seriously to girls.

292
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:35,893
You want to watch your schooling first.

293
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,602
Stand where you were.

294
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:40,396
When you're all set, though,

295
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:45,319
there will be plenty of girls

296
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,922
for a boy like you.

297
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:51,841
That so?

298
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:54,511
The girls pay for you?

299
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:58,598
Boy, you must really be making a hit.

300
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,586
I've been wondering why
you polished the car so careful there.

301
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,831
Uh...

302
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:12,462
Don't leave the hubcaps.
Get the chamois to the hubcaps.

303
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:17,108
Happy, use newspaper on the windows.
It's easy.

304
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,844
Use it like a pad.

305
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,072
That's it, good work.
You're going all right.

306
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,727
Biff, um...

307
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,354
First thing we gotta do
when we get time,

308
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,857
we gotta clip that big branch
over the house.

309
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,710
I'm afraid it's gonna fall on the roof.

310
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:40,173
Tell you what, we get a, uh...

311
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,242
We get a rope and sling her around,

312
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:45,953
we climb up there with saws
and take her down.

313
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,664
Soon as you finish the car, boys,
I want to see you.

314
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:50,291
I got a surprise for you, boys.

315
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:54,421
- What do you got, Dad?
- No, no, you finish first.

316
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,550
Never leave a job till you finish.
You remember that.

317
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,319
Biff?

318
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:06,850
Up in Albany I saw a beautiful hammock.
I think I'll buy it next trip

319
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:10,411
and we'll hang it
between those two elms there, huh?

320
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:13,164
Wouldrt that be...
Huh?

321
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:15,191
Wouldrt that be something?

322
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:19,905
Just hanging... Just swinging there
under those branches?

323
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:21,989
Oh, boy, that would be something.

324
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,784
How's that, Pop? Professional?

325
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:27,954
Terrific. That's a terrific job, boys.

326
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,401
- Good work, Biff. - Where's the
surprise? - In the back seat of the car.

327
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:37,130
What is it? Tell me. What did you buy?
-Never mind, something I want you to have.

328
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,507
- What is it, Happy?
- It's a punching bag.

329
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:42,719
- It's got Gene Tunney's signature.
- How'd you know?

330
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:45,638
- The finest thing for the timing.
- I'm losing weight.

331
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:48,307
- Jumping rope is good, too.
- See the football I got?

332
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:51,228
- Where'd you get a new ball?
- Coach told me to practice passing.

333
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,231
- He gave you the ball?
- I borrowed it from the locker room.

334
00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:56,732
- I want you to return that.
- I told you.

335
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:59,661
- I'm bringing it back.
- He's gotta practice with a ball.

336
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,288
Coach will congratulate you
on your initiative.

337
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,375
- He keeps congratulating my initiative.
- He likes you.

338
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:08,295
Somebody else took that ball,
there'd be an uproar.

339
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:11,172
What's the report, boys?
What's the report?

340
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:14,426
Where'd you go this time, Pop?
We were lonesome for you.

341
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,471
I'll tell you a secret, boys.
Don't breathe it to a soul.

342
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:21,224
Someday I'll have my own business
and I'll never have to leave home.

343
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:24,226
- Like Uncle Charley?
- Bigger than Uncle Charley.

344
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:28,490
Charley is not liked.
He's liked but he's not well liked.

345
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:32,319
- Where'd you go this time?
- I went to Providence. Met the mayor.

346
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,071
- The mayor of Providence?
- He was in the hotel lobby.

347
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:37,698
- What did he say?
- He said, "Good morning".

348
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:39,867
I said, "You got a fine state here".

349
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:43,205
He had coffee with me,
then I went to Waterbury.

350
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:47,150
Waterbury is a fine city, a big clock
city. The famous Waterbury clock.

351
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:53,131
Sold a nice bill there. And then Boston.
Boston was the cradle of the Revolution.

352
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,508
A fine city.
A couple other towns in Mass,

353
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,843
on to Portland, Bangor
and straight home.

354
00:20:57,844 --> 00:21:00,054
- Love to go with you.
- As soon as summer comes.

355
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:03,350
- Promise?
- You, Hap and I, I'll show you.

356
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,226
One thing, boys, I have friends.

357
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:09,022
I can park my car on any street
and the cops protect it like their own.

358
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:11,983
This summer we'll take
our bathing suits...

359
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:14,193
- We'll carry your bags.
- That'd be something,

360
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:17,447
coming to the Boston stores
with you boys carrying my bags!

361
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,240
A sensation.

362
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:22,244
- You nervous about the game?
- Not if you're gonna be there.

363
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,578
What do they say
now that you're captain?

364
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,331
There's a crowd of girls around him
when classes change.

365
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:30,794
This Saturday, just for you,
I'm gonna break through for a touchdown.

366
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:33,671
- You are supposed to pass...
- I'm doing one play for Pop.

367
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:36,633
When I take off my helmet
that means I'm breaking out.

368
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:39,886
- Watch me cross that line.
- Wait till I tell this in Boston.

369
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,680
- Biff, where are you?
- Hey, look at Bernard!

370
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:44,598
What are you looking so anaemic about?

371
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:47,519
Gotta study, Uncle Willy.
He's got Regents next week.

372
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:48,894
Come on, let's box.

373
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:51,689
I heard Mr. Birnbaum say
if you don't start studying math

374
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,735
he's gonna flunk you and you won't
graduate. -You better study with him.

375
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:59,114
- Pop, you didn't see my sneakers.
- A beautiful job of printing.

376
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:03,660
Just because he prints University of
Virginia doesn't mean they gotta graduate him.

377
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:07,289
With scholarships to three universities
they're gonna flunk him?

378
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:10,124
- I heard Mr. Birnbaum say...
- Don't be a pest.

379
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,685
What an anaemic.

380
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:17,265
I'm waiting for you in my house, Biff.

381
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,308
Bernard is not well-liked, is he?

382
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,144
He's liked but he's not well-liked.

383
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:24,480
Bernard can get
the best marks in school,

384
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:28,318
but when he gets out to the business
world you'll be ahead of him.

385
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:31,946
That's why I thank Almighty God
you're both built like Adonises.

386
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,823
The man who makes an appearance
in the business world,

387
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:38,369
the man who creates personal interest,
is the man who gets ahead.

388
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:41,555
Be liked and you will never want, hm?

389
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:45,502
Take me, for instance. I never
have to wait in line to see a buyer.

390
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:48,253
Willy Loman is here,
that's all they have to know.

391
00:22:48,254 --> 00:22:50,589
- I go straight through.
- Did you knock 'em dead?

392
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,510
Knocked them cold in Providence,
slaughtered in Boston.

393
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:57,055
- I'm losing weight, Pop.
- Hello, dear. - Sweetheart.

394
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,433
- How'd the Chevy run?
- Chevrolet's the greatest car ever.

395
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:03,060
Since when do you
let your mother carry wash?

396
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:06,973
Where to, Ma? -Just hang it on the
line. Biff, you gotta go to your friends.

397
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,769
- The cellar is filled with boys.
- When Pop comes home they can wait.

398
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:14,606
- Better go tell them what to do, Biff.
- Sweep out the furnace room.

399
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:18,568
- Good work, Biff. - The way they
obey him. - That's the training.

400
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,528
I was selling thousands,
but I had to come home.

401
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,198
The block will be at that game.
You sell anything?

402
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,077
I did 500 gross in Providence,
700 gross in Boston.

403
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,030
Wait, wait, I got a pencil.

404
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:34,617
That makes your commission 200...

405
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:36,535
My God!

406
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:40,165
- Two hundred and twelve dollars!
- I didn't figure it yet.

407
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:43,710
- How much did you do?
- A hundred eighty gross in Providence.

408
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:46,503
It comes to roughly 200 gross
on the whole trip.

409
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:49,465
See, three of the stores
were half closed for inventory.

410
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,425
I would have broke records.

411
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:54,261
It makes 70 dollars and some pennies.
Very good.

412
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:56,138
- What do we owe?
- Well...

413
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:58,807
- Sixteen dollars on the refrigerator.
- Why 16?

414
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,644
- The fan belt broke. It was $1.80.
- It's brand new.

415
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:04,731
Well, it's like the man says.
It's got to work itself in.

416
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:07,107
I hope we didn't get stuck
on that machine.

417
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,484
It's got the biggest ads of any of them!

418
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:11,320
It's a fine machine.
What else?

419
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:15,241
Well, there's $9.60
for the washing machine,

420
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:19,412
for the vacuum cleaner there's three and
a half due on the 15th, then the roof.

421
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:23,416
- You've got 21 dollars. - It don't
leak? - They did a wonderful job.

422
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:26,961
- You owe five for the carburettor.
- I'm not gonna pay that man.

423
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:31,382
That lousy, rotten Chevrolet, they ought
to prohibit the manufacture of that car.

424
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:33,634
Well, you owe him three and a half.

425
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:37,347
And odds and ends comes to
around 120 dollars by the 15th.

426
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,975
A hundred and twenty dollars?
If business don't pick up I don't know.

427
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,103
- Next week you'll do better.
- I'll knock them dead.

428
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:47,064
I'll go to Hartford.
I'm well-liked in Hartford.

429
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:50,693
You know what the trouble is, Linda?
People don't seem to take to me.

430
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:53,362
- Don't be so foolish.
- I know it when I walk in.

431
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:56,114
- They seem to laugh at me.
- Why would they laugh at you?

432
00:24:56,115 --> 00:25:00,119
- Don't talk like that.
- They just pass me by.

433
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:04,549
- You're making 70 to 100 dollars a week.
- I gotta be at in 10, 12 hours a day.

434
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:07,501
Other men, I don't know why,
they do it easier.

435
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:10,253
I don't know why I can't stop myself.
I talk too much.

436
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:13,575
- Oh! - A man ought to come
in with a few words.

437
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,636
Charley, he's a man of few words
and they respect him.

438
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,471
You don't talk too much.
You're just lively.

439
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:22,433
Well, I figure, what the hell.
Life is short.

440
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,120
A couple of jokes...

441
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:30,357
- I joke too much.
- Why, you're...

442
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:33,085
I'm short.

443
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:36,446
I'm very foolish to look at, Linda.

444
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:40,893
I didn't tell you, but at Christmastime
I happened to be calling on F.H. Stewarts,

445
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:45,206
another salesman I know
as I was going to see the buyer.

446
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,502
I heard him say something
about "the shrimp".

447
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:54,882
And I cracked him...
I cracked him right across the face.

448
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:56,717
I won't take that.

449
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:59,595
I simply will not take that.

450
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:05,183
But they do laugh at me.
Oh, I know that.

451
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,477
- Darling?
- No, I gotta overcome it.

452
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,729
- I know I gotta overcome it.
- Darling?

453
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,900
I'm not dressing to advantage, maybe.

454
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:17,864
Willy, darling, you're
the handsomest man in the world.

455
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:24,203
You're the best. You're a pal.

456
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,584
On the road I want to grab you sometimes
and just kiss the life out of you.

457
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:34,672
I get so lonely,
especially when business is bad,

458
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:37,717
I get the feeling
I'll never sell anything.

459
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,527
I want to make a living for you.

460
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:45,357
Or business. Business for the boys.
There's so much I want to make for them.

461
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:48,393
Me? You didn't make me, Willy.
I picked you.

462
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:50,520
- You picked me, huh?
- I did.

463
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:54,692
I'm sitting at that desk, watching all
the salesmen go by, day in and day out.

464
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:58,279
You got such a sense of humour.
And we do have a good time together.

465
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:01,281
- Sure, sure. Why do you have to go?
- It's 2:00.

466
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:04,202
- Come on.
- My sisters will be scandalised.

467
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:07,120
- When will you be back?
- Two weeks. Will you come up?

468
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:11,167
Sure thing. You do make me laugh.
That's good for me.

469
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,960
And I think you're a wonderful man.

470
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:18,658
- You picked me, huh? - I did, 'cause
you're so sweet and such a kidder.

471
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:20,926
I'll see you next time I'm in Boston.

472
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,720
- I'll put you through to the buyers.
- Right. Well.

473
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:26,389
Well, bottoms up.

474
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,352
Willy! You just kill me, Willy!

475
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:32,079
You just kill me!

476
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:36,025
And thanks for the stockings.
I love a lot of stockings.

477
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,487
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

478
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,489
Oh, and keep your pores open.

479
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,716
Willy!

480
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:50,748
You are, Willy, the handsomest.

481
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:59,005
I'll make it all up to you, Linda.

482
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:01,675
There's nothing to make up.
You're doing fine.

483
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:04,010
- What's that?
- I'm mending my stockings.

484
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:07,223
- They're so expensive.
- I won't have you mending stockings!

485
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:09,391
- Willy...
- Where is he? If he doesn't...

486
00:28:09,392 --> 00:28:12,102
- Give him the answers.
- I do, but I can't on a Regents.

487
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:15,189
- It's a state exam.
- Biff! Where is he?

488
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,482
You better give back that football.

489
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:20,861
- Biff, where is he?
- He's too rough with the girls.

490
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:24,031
- He's driving without a licence.
- Shut up.

491
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:25,281
Willy.

492
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:28,369
- Get out of here.
- If he doesn't buckle down he'll flunk.

493
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:33,124
- You gotta do something about that boy.
- There's nothing the matter with him.

494
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,920
You want him to be a worm like Bernard?

495
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:42,591
Aw, he's got spirit, personality.

496
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:46,137
He's loaded with it, loaded.
What is he stealing?

497
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,448
He's giving it back, isn't he?

498
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:53,702
Why is he stealing?

499
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:57,606
What did I tell him?
I never in my life told him anything...

500
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:01,234
Come on up, Pop.
Let's go up.

501
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:03,045
Huh?

502
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,823
Why did she have
to wax the floors herself?

503
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,869
Every time she waxes the floors
she keels over.

504
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:12,162
- She knows that.
- Take it easy, Pop.

505
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:15,583
- Hey, what brought you back tonight?
- I got an awful scare.

506
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,851
I nearly hit a kid in Yonkers.

507
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:21,672
Why didn't I go to Alaska
with my brother Ben that time?

508
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:24,925
Ben, that man was a genius.
That man was success incarnate.

509
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:27,802
What a mistake.
He begged me to go.

510
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:31,932
The man started with the clothes on his
back and ended up with diamond mines.

511
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:34,142
I'd like to know how he did it.

512
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:36,227
The man knew what he wanted, got it.

513
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:39,732
Walks into a jungle, comes out
the age of 21 and he's rich.

514
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:44,403
The world is an oyster, but
you don't crack it open on a mattress.

515
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:47,197
Pop, I told you,
I'm gonna retire you for life.

516
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:50,242
You're gonna retire me for life
on 70 dollars a week

517
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:53,537
and your women and your car
and your apartment. You retire me?

518
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:57,208
I couldn't get past Yonkers today.
Where are you guys? Where are you?

519
00:29:57,291 --> 00:30:02,154
The woods are burning. I can't
drive a car. - Everything all right?

520
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:06,007
- What's the matter?
- Everything's fine.

521
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:10,720
- I thought something happened.
- No. - Can't we do something about the walls?

522
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:14,766
You sneeze in here, in my house hats
blow off. - Come on, let's go up, huh?

523
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:18,187
- You go ahead. I'm not tired.
- All right. Take it easy.

524
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,568
- What are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep. I had a heartburn.

525
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:27,278
- You don't know how to eat.
- I eat with my mouth.

526
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,115
You gotta know about vitamins
and things like that.

527
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:33,410
- Come on, let's shoot. Tire you out.
- All right.

528
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:36,372
- You got cards?
- I got them someplace.

529
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:41,417
What is it with those vitamins?

530
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,920
They build up your bones. Chemistry.

531
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:47,091
- There's no bones in a heartburn.
- What are you talking about?

532
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:49,717
- You don't know about it.
- I'll get insulted.

533
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:52,888
Don't talk about something
you don't know anything about.

534
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:03,081
- What are you doing home?
- A little trouble with the car.

535
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:05,542
Oh.

536
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:10,698
- I'd like to take a trip to California.
- Don't say.

537
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:16,328
You want a job? - I got a job, I told you
that. What are you offering me a job for?

538
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:19,122
- Don't get insulted.
- Don't insult me.

539
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:21,916
- You don't have to go on this way.
- I got a good job.

540
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:24,878
- What do you keep coming in here for?
- You want me to go?

541
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:28,048
I can't understand it.
He's going back to Texas again.

542
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:29,882
- What is that?
- Let him go.

543
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:32,385
I've got nothing to give him.
I'm clean.

544
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:36,515
- I'm clean.
- He won't starve. None of them starve.

545
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:39,893
- Forget about it.
- Then what have I got to remember?

546
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:45,299
You take it too hard. When a deposit bottle
is broken you don't get your nickel back.

547
00:31:45,524 --> 00:31:48,527
- That's easy for you to say.
- That ain't easy for me to say.

548
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:54,199
You see the ceiling
I put up in here, hmm?

549
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:57,260
Yeah, that's a piece of work.

550
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:02,039
Putting up a ceiling is a mystery to me.

551
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,060
How do you do it?
What's the difference?

552
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:08,212
- Huh?
- Well, talk about it.

553
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:10,423
- You gonna put up a ceiling?
- How can I?

554
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:13,217
- What are you bothering me for?
- You're insulted.

555
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:15,970
A man who can't handle tools
is not a man.

556
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:19,933
- You're disgusting.
- Don't call me disgusting, Willy.

557
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:23,145
Oh, I'm getting...

558
00:32:25,063 --> 00:32:28,984
- I'm getting awfully tired, Ben.
- Keep playing. You'll sleep better.

559
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:31,795
Did you call me Ben?

560
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:37,493
That's funny. For a second
you reminded me of my brother, Ben.

561
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:41,079
- I only have a few minutes.
- You never heard from him again?

562
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:45,693
Didn't Linda tell you? A couple weeks ago
we got a letter from his wife in Africa.

563
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:49,253
- He died. - Is that so?
- This is Brooklyn, huh?

564
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:52,424
- Maybe you're in for some of his money.
- He had seven sons.

565
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:54,842
There was one opportunity
I had with that man.

566
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,428
There are several properties
I'm looking at.

567
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:01,308
If I'd have gone with him to Alaska
everything would have been different.

568
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:04,770
- You'd have froze to death.
- What are you talking about?

569
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:09,608
Opportunity is tremendous in Alaska.
I'm surprised you're not up there.

570
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:12,568
There's the only man I ever met
who knew the answers.

571
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,153
- How are you all?
- Fine.

572
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:16,989
- Fine.
- Pretty sharp tonight.

573
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,325
- Is Mother living with you?
- She died long ago.

574
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,786
- Who?
- Fine specimen of a lady, Mother.

575
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:23,955
- I'd hoped to see the old girl.
- Who died?

576
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:26,457
- You heard from Father?
- What do you mean, who died?

577
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,709
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about!

578
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,586
- It's half past eight.
- That's my bill.

579
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,214
- I put the ace.
- If you don't know how to play...

580
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:36,134
- It's my ace, for God's sake.
- I'm through!

581
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:38,052
- When did Mother die?
- Long ago.

582
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:40,680
- You never knew how to play cards.
- All right.

583
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:42,848
Next time I'll bring a deck
with five aces.

584
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:46,061
- I don't play that kind of game.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

585
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,770
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

586
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:51,108
- Ignoramus.
- So, you're William?

587
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:53,167
Oh, Ben.

588
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,237
I've been waiting for you so long.

589
00:33:56,238 --> 00:33:58,823
What's the answer?
How did you do it?

590
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:00,950
There's a story in that.

591
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,785
- Is this Ben?
- How do you do?

592
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:05,496
Where have you been?
Willy's been wondering...

593
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:07,581
Where is Dad?
How did you get started?

594
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:11,920
- I don't know how much you remember.
- I was just a baby, 3 or 4 years old.

595
00:34:12,004 --> 00:34:14,505
- Three years, eleven months.
- What a memory.

596
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:17,049
I have many enterprises
and I've never kept books.

597
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,677
I was sitting under the wagon.
What was it, Nebraska?

598
00:34:19,678 --> 00:34:21,846
South Dakota and I gave you wildflowers.

599
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:25,517
- I remember you walking down some road.
- I was going to find Father in Alaska.

600
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,477
In those days
I had a very faulty view of geography.

601
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:31,063
I discovered after a few days
I was heading south.

602
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:35,484
Instead of Alaska I ended up in
Africa. - Africa? - The Gold Coast!

603
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:38,279
- Principally, diamond mines.
- Diamond mines!

604
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,906
Yes, but I'm afraid
I only have a few minutes.

605
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,994
Boys, boys, listen to this!

606
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:45,870
This is your Uncle Ben!

607
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:49,332
A great man!
Ben, tell my boys.

608
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:52,794
Why, boys, when I was 17
I walked into the jungle.

609
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,379
When I was 21, I walked out.

610
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,217
- And by God, I was rich!
- See what I've been talking about?

611
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:02,971
- The greatest things can happen.
- I have an appointment in Ketchikan.

612
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:05,222
Tell about Dad.
I want my boys to hear.

613
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:07,850
I want them to know
the stock they spring from.

614
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:12,438
All I remember is a man with a big beard.
I was sitting on Mama's lap around the fire.

615
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:16,442
- There was some kind of high
music. - He played the flute.

616
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:21,239
- The flute, that's right. - Father was
a very great, very wild-hearted man.

617
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:24,534
He'd start in Boston
and toss the whole family in the wagon,

618
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:27,286
and he'd drive the team
right across the country.

619
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:31,082
Through lowa, Michigan, Illinois
and all the western states.

620
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:34,711
We'd stop in the towns and
he'd sell the flutes he made on the way.

621
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:36,420
A great inventor, Father.

622
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:40,759
With one gadget he made more in one week
than a man like you makes in a lifetime.

623
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:44,888
That's the way I'm bringing them up,
rugged, well-liked, all around.

624
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:47,306
- Yeah? Hit me, boy, hard as you can.
- No.

625
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:49,058
Oh, come on, get to me.

626
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,893
Go ahead, show him.

627
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:53,814
Like I taught you.
Give him the old shoulderjab.

628
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:59,069
Hey!

629
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:08,035
- How's that?
- Very good, Willy, very good.

630
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:11,873
- Shake hands, boys. Attaway.
- Look out, Biff.

631
00:36:11,957 --> 00:36:14,375
Never fight fair with a stranger, boy.

632
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:17,254
You'll never get
out of the jungle that way.

633
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:20,590
It was an honour and a pleasure
to meet you, Linda.

634
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:24,260
Have a nice trip.

635
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:27,556
Oh, and good luck with your, uh...
What do you do?

636
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:30,349
- Oh, uh, selling.
- Oh, yes, really?

637
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,478
I don't want you to think...
It's Brooklyn, but we hunt too.

638
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:35,938
- Really, now?
- There's snakes and rabbits

639
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:39,150
That's why I moved out.
Biff can fell any one of these trees.

640
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:42,546
Go over to where they're building
the apartment and get some sand.

641
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:45,314
We're gonna rebuild the front stoop.
Watch us.

642
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:48,151
I lost weight, Pop, you notice?

643
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:50,736
They steal more
they'll put the cops on them.

644
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:54,032
- Don't let Biff take any more.
- The load they brought last week,

645
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:57,160
at least a dozen six by tens,
won'th all kinds of money.

646
00:36:57,244 --> 00:37:00,247
If that watchman sees them...

647
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,333
I got a couple of fearless characters.

648
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,252
Willy, the gaols are full
of fearless characters.

649
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:09,423
- And the Stock Exchange.
- Uncle Willy!

650
00:37:09,506 --> 00:37:12,258
Uncle Willy,
the watchmars chasing Biff!

651
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:14,844
Shut up.
He's not stealing anything.

652
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:16,721
Where is he?

653
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:19,683
Oh, there's nothing wrong.
What is the matter with you?

654
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,000
Nervy boy, good.

655
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,711
Nerves of iron, that Biff.

656
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:26,046
I don't know what it is.

657
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:28,799
My New England man comes back
and he's bleeding.

658
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,387
- Couldrt sell a nickel for five cents.
- It's contacts, Charley.

659
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,306
- I got important contacts.
- Glad to hear it, Willy.

660
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,142
Come in later,
we'll shoot a little casino.

661
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:40,995
I'll take some of your Portland money.

662
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:50,738
All business is bad, it's murderous.

663
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:54,366
But not for me, of course.

664
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:58,804
- I'll stop by on my way
back to Africa. - Ben, wait.

665
00:37:59,372 --> 00:38:02,851
Can't you stay a few days, huh?

666
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:05,460
You're just what I need, Ben.

667
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,088
You know, I have a fine position here,

668
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:11,843
but Dad left when I was such a baby,
I never had a chance to talk to him.

669
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:14,803
I still feel
kind of temporary about myself.

670
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:19,350
- I'll be late for my train.
- Ben, my boys. Can't we talk?

671
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:22,937
See, they'd go
into the jaws of hell for me, but I...

672
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:27,442
You're being first-rate with your boys.
Outstanding, manly chaps.

673
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:30,445
Ben, that's good to hear
because sometimes I'm afraid

674
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:32,946
I'm not teaching them
the right kind of...

675
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,364
How should I teach them?

676
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:38,328
William, when I walked
into the jungle, I was 17.

677
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:41,497
When I walked out I was 21.

678
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:44,584
And by God, I was rich!

679
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:48,312
Was rich!

680
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:56,679
That's just the spirit
I want to imbue them with,

681
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:59,431
to walk into a jungle...
Oh, boy.

682
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:03,519
I was right. I was right. I was right!

683
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:06,872
- I was right!
- Willy?

684
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:11,326
Willy, dear, did you get some cheese?

685
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,132
It's awful late, darling.
Come to bed.

686
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:22,288
You gotta break your neck
to see a star in this yard.

687
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:25,474
Are you coming up, Willy?

688
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:28,670
Whatever happened
to that diamond watch fob?

689
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:31,088
When Ben came from Africa that time,

690
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:33,715
didn't he give me a watch fob
with a diamond in it?

691
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:38,554
You pawned it, dear, 12, 13 years ago
for Biff's radio correspondence course.

692
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:41,390
That was a beautiful thing.
I'll take a walk.

693
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:43,684
But in your slippers, Willy?

694
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:48,523
What a man, huh?
Now, there was a man won'th talking to.

695
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:51,525
- But in your slippers!
- I was right.

696
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:53,735
I was, I was right!

697
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:56,739
- I was right.
- What is he doing out here?

698
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,990
- Shh!
- God Almighty, Mom.

699
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:02,036
- How long's he been doing this?
- Don't. He'll hear you.

700
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,788
What the hell is the matter with him?

701
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:08,759
- It'll pass by morning.
- Shouldn't we do anything?

702
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,171
Oh, my dear,
you should do a lot of things.

703
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:14,881
There's nothing to do.
Go to bed.

704
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:18,136
- I never heard him so loud, Mom.
- You'll hear him.

705
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:21,054
- Why didn't you write me about this?
- How would I?

706
00:40:21,055 --> 00:40:23,515
For over three months
you've had no address.

707
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:26,702
I was on the move.
I thought of you all the time.

708
00:40:28,187 --> 00:40:29,729
But he likes to have a letter

709
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,109
just to know there's still
the possibility of better things.

710
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:36,571
- He's not like this all the time.
- When you come home he's the worst.

711
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:38,405
When you write you're coming,

712
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:41,701
he's all smiles, he talks about
the future, he's wonderful.

713
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:45,538
The closer you come the more shaky
he gets and by the time you get here,

714
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:47,789
he's arguing,
he seems to be angry at you.

715
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,627
I think it's just because he can't
bring himself to open up to you.

716
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:54,797
- Why are you so hateful to each other?
- I'm not hateful.

717
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:58,301
Oh! You no sooner walk through
that door than you're fighting.

718
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:01,262
I don't know why.
I mean to change, Mom. I'm trying.

719
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,930
- Are you home to stay now?
- I don't know.

720
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:07,226
- I'll look around.
- You can't look around all your life.

721
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,605
I just can't take hold.
I can't take hold to some kind of life.

722
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:14,609
Biff, a man is not a bird
to come and go with the springtime.

723
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:18,086
Your hair.

724
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:20,822
Your hair's getting so gray.

725
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:23,283
It's been gray
since you were in high school.

726
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:26,829
- I just stopped dying it.
- Well, dye it again, Mom.

727
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:30,498
I don't want my pal looking old.

728
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:33,210
You are such a boy!

729
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:37,465
You think you can go away for a year?
You've got to get it into your head now.

730
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:41,344
One day you'll knock on this door,
there will be strange people here.

731
00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:44,263
What are you talking about?
You're not even 60 yet.

732
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:45,972
What about your father?

733
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,683
- Well, I meant him, too.
- He admires Pop.

734
00:41:48,684 --> 00:41:52,104
If you don't have feeling for him,
you can't have feelings for me.

735
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:53,897
- Sure, I can.
- No, Biff.

736
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:56,775
You can'tjust come to see me!

737
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:59,694
Because I love him.

738
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:02,030
He's the dearest man in the world to me

739
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:06,994
and I won't have anyone making him feel
unwanted and low and blue.

740
00:42:07,078 --> 00:42:10,873
You have got to make up your mind now.
There's no leeway anymore.

741
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,583
Either he's your father,

742
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:15,961
and you pay him that respect,

743
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:17,796
or else you're not to come here.

744
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:20,925
- Hey, Biffo!
- What the hell is the matter with him?

745
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,718
- Don't go near him.
- Stop making excuses for him.

746
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:27,348
He always wiped the floor with you.
He never had an ounce of respect.

747
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:30,350
- He always had respect for her.
- What do you know?

748
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:32,852
- Don't call him crazy.
- He's got no character.

749
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:35,105
Charley wouldn't do this,
not in his house.

750
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:38,025
- Peeling that vomit from his mind.
- Charley never had what he's got.

751
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:41,070
People are worse off than Willy Loman,
I've seen them.

752
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:44,448
Then make Charley your father.
You can't do that, can you?

753
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:47,242
I am not saying he's a great man.

754
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:50,788
Willy Loman never earned a lot of money.
His name was never in the paper.

755
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,706
He's not the finest character.

756
00:42:52,707 --> 00:42:54,958
But he's a human being.

757
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:59,304
And a terrible thing is happening
to him. So attention must be paid.

758
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:04,218
He must not be allowed
to fall into his grave like an old dog.

759
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:08,889
Attention! Attention must
finally be paid to such a person.

760
00:43:09,014 --> 00:43:11,766
- You called him crazy?
- Mom, I didn't...

761
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:14,937
Wait a minute. A lot of people think
he's lost his balance,

762
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:18,274
but you don't have to be very smart
to know what his trouble is.

763
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:20,358
- The man is exhausted.
- Sure.

764
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,027
A small man can be
just as exhausted as a great man.

765
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:27,783
He works for a company
36 years this March,

766
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:31,203
he opens up uneard of territories
to their trademark,

767
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,663
and now, in his old age,

768
00:43:33,664 --> 00:43:35,999
they take his salary away!

769
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,253
- I didn't know that, Mom.
- You never asked, my dear!

770
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:41,880
Now you get your spending money
somewhere else

771
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:44,842
- you don't trouble your mind with him.
- I gave you money.

772
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:47,093
Christmastime, 50 dollars.

773
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:50,389
To fix the hot water it cost $97.50!

774
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:53,601
For five weeks
he's been on straight commission,

775
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:55,852
like a beginner, an unknown.

776
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:57,896
Those ungrateful bastards!

777
00:43:57,897 --> 00:44:00,190
Are they any worse than his sons?

778
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:03,944
He drives 700 miles,

779
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:07,990
and when he gets there no one
knows him anymore, no one welcomes him.

780
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:11,702
And what goes through a mars mind

781
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:14,705
driving 700 miles home

782
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:18,375
without having earned a cent?
Why shouldn't he talk to himself?

783
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:22,588
Why not, when
he has to go to Charley every week

784
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:26,300
and borrow 50 dollars from him,
and pretend to me it's his pay.

785
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:29,594
How long can that go on?
How long?

786
00:44:29,595 --> 00:44:33,933
And you tell me he has no character?

787
00:44:34,016 --> 00:44:38,187
The man who never worked a day
in his life but for your benefit!

788
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,730
And when does he get the medal for that?

789
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:43,859
Is this his reward?

790
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:48,364
To turn around at the age of 63
and find his sons,

791
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:51,450
who he loved better than his life,

792
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:54,578
- one a philandering bum...
- Mom!

793
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:57,247
That is all you are, my baby.

794
00:44:57,248 --> 00:45:00,834
And you! What happened
to the love you had for him?

795
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:02,502
You were such pals.

796
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:05,213
How you used to talk every night
on the phone,

797
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:08,092
how lonely he was
till he could come home to you.

798
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:10,051
All right, Mom.

799
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:13,514
I'll live in my room, I'll get a job,
I'll just keep away from him.

800
00:45:13,597 --> 00:45:17,226
No, Biff, you can't stay here
and fight all the time.

801
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,310
He threw me out of this house.

802
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:20,979
Why did he do that?

803
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,983
- Because I know he's a fake.
- A fake!

804
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:27,486
- In what way? What do you mean?
- Just don't lay it all at my feet.

805
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:30,113
It's between me and him.
That's all I have to say.

806
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:33,575
I'll chip in from now on.
He'll settle for half my paycheque.

807
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:36,327
- He'll be all right.
- He won't be all right!

808
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:39,347
I hate this city and I'll stay here.

809
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:41,216
Now, what do you want?

810
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,662
- He's dying, Biff.
- Why is he dying?

811
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:47,306
He's been trying to kill himself.

812
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:49,975
How?

813
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:56,716
Do you remember I wrote you that
he smashed the car again in February?

814
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:59,050
Well?

815
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:02,453
The insurance inspector came.

816
00:46:02,454 --> 00:46:06,458
There's evidence that all the accidents
in the last year werert accidents.

817
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,417
How can they tell?
That's a lie.

818
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:11,255
- It seems there's a woman...
- What woman?

819
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,231
What?

820
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:15,133
- Nothing.
- What did you say?

821
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:17,986
- I said, "What woman?"
- What about her?

822
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,651
She was walking down the road.

823
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:27,613
She saw his car.
She said he wasrt driving fast at all.

824
00:46:27,696 --> 00:46:29,405
He didn't skid, she said.

825
00:46:29,406 --> 00:46:33,369
He came to that little bridge and
deliberately smashed into the railing.

826
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:36,204
It was the shallowness of the water
that saved him.

827
00:46:36,205 --> 00:46:39,266
Mom, he probably just fell asleep again.

828
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:44,505
- No. I don't think he fell asleep.
- Why not?

829
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:49,150
Last month...

830
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:53,780
Oh, boys, it's so hard
to say a thing like this.

831
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:59,520
I was looking for a fuse, the lights
blew out, I went down in the cellar.

832
00:46:59,603 --> 00:47:02,355
Behind the fuse box,
it happened to fall out,

833
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:06,276
was this length of rubber pipe,
just short.

834
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,902
No kidding.

835
00:47:07,903 --> 00:47:10,238
There was an attachment
on the end of it.

836
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,633
I knew right away, and sure enough.

837
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,704
On the bottom of the hot water heater
there's a new nipple on the gas pipe.

838
00:47:17,788 --> 00:47:21,182
- Thatjerk.
- Did you have it taken off?

839
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:24,644
I'm ashamed to.

840
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:27,731
How can I mention it to him?

841
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,716
Every day I go down

842
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:33,971
and I take away
that little rubber pipe.

843
00:47:34,972 --> 00:47:37,808
But when he comes home
I put it back where it was.

844
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,328
How can I insult him that way?

845
00:47:42,688 --> 00:47:47,067
It sounds so silly and old-fashioned,
but I tell you,

846
00:47:47,151 --> 00:47:50,045
he's put his whole life into you.

847
00:47:50,988 --> 00:47:53,548
And you've turned your backs on him.

848
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:58,662
Biff, his life is in your hands.

849
00:48:00,497 --> 00:48:03,141
I feel like a damn fool.

850
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,626
All right.

851
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:08,271
All right.

852
00:48:10,215 --> 00:48:13,927
It's settled now.
I've been remiss, I know that.

853
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:18,223
But now I'll stay and I swear to you,
Mama, I'll apply myself.

854
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:21,727
It's just that, see,
I don't fit in business.

855
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,730
Not that I won't try.
I'll try and I'll make good.

856
00:48:24,813 --> 00:48:27,774
The trouble was,
you never tried to please people.

857
00:48:27,858 --> 00:48:30,318
It's like when you worked
for Bob Harrison.

858
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,028
He said you were tops.

859
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:36,200
Then you go and do some damn fool thing
like whistling songs in the elevator.

860
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:38,075
So what? I like to whistle.

861
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:40,996
You don't raise a guy
to a responsible job who whistles.

862
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:42,622
Don't argue about it.

863
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:44,916
You'd go for a swim
in the middle of the day.

864
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:47,920
You don't take off?
You run off sometimes, on a nice day.

865
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:50,338
- Sure, but I cover myself.
- Oh, boys.

866
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:51,756
I'll tell you something.

867
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:54,635
In the business world
some of them think you're crazy.

868
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:58,805
- Screw the business world.
- Right. Great. But cover yourself.

869
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,515
I don't care!
They've laughed at Dad for years.

870
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,895
You know why? Because we don't belong
in this nuthouse of a city.

871
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:09,066
We should be mixing cement somewhere
on some open plain, or carpenters.

872
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:11,192
A carpenter's allowed to whistle.

873
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:14,321
Even your grandfather was better
than a carpenter.

874
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:17,090
You never grew up.

875
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:20,911
Bernard does not whistle
in the elevator, I assure you.

876
00:49:23,038 --> 00:49:26,667
- I bet you do.
- I never whistled in an elevator.

877
00:49:28,377 --> 00:49:31,546
And who in the business world
thinks I'm crazy, hmm?

878
00:49:31,672 --> 00:49:34,675
I didn't mean it like that.
Don't make a thing out of it.

879
00:49:34,758 --> 00:49:38,136
Go back to the West.
Be a carpenter or a cowboy.

880
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,846
- Enjoy yourself.
- He was just saying things.

881
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:42,640
- I heard what he said.
- Come on.

882
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,266
They laugh at me, huh?

883
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:46,352
Go to Filene's, go to the Hub,

884
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:49,481
go to Slattery's, Boston
and call out the name Willy Loman.

885
00:49:49,564 --> 00:49:52,526
- See what happens. Big shot. Big.
- All right, Pop.

886
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:54,794
All right.

887
00:50:01,743 --> 00:50:03,994
Why do you always insult me?

888
00:50:03,995 --> 00:50:05,955
Dad, I didn't say a word.

889
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:08,917
- Did I say a word?
- He didn't say anything, Willy.

890
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,584
No.

891
00:50:10,585 --> 00:50:13,422
- All right, good night.
- Willy! He's decided...

892
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:17,384
If you get tired hanging around
tomorrow, paint the ceiling I put up.

893
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:19,218
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

894
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,971
He's gonna see Bill Oliver, Pop.

895
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:24,240
Oliver?

896
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:27,476
For what?

897
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:31,231
Well, he always said he'd stake me
and I'd like to go into business,

898
00:50:31,314 --> 00:50:33,149
so maybe I'll take him up on it.

899
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,069
- Isn't that wonderful?
- What's wonderful about it?

900
00:50:36,153 --> 00:50:39,573
There's 50 men in the city of New York
that would stake him.

901
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:42,826
- Sporting goods?
- I guess so.

902
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,121
- I know something about it.
- He knows something about it!

903
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:50,792
You know sporting goods
better than Spalding, for God's sake.

904
00:50:50,876 --> 00:50:54,337
- How much is he giving you?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him yet.

905
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:58,717
- Then what are you talking about?
- All I said was I was gonna go see him.

906
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,510
- You're counting your chickens again.
- Jesus.

907
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,681
- Don't curse in this house.
- Since when did you get so clean?

908
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:08,143
Don't use that language to me.
I won't have it!

909
00:51:08,226 --> 00:51:12,930
I got an idea, a feasible idea. Let's
talk this over. Let's talk sense.

910
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:17,827
When I was in Florida last time I thought
of a great idea to sell sporting goods.

911
00:51:18,028 --> 00:51:21,455
It just came back to me.
We have a line, the Loman line.

912
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:25,409
- We put on a couple of exhibitions.
- That's an idea. - Wait!

913
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,287
We form two basketball teams,
two water polo teams.

914
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:31,249
We play each other.
It's a million dollars of publicity.

915
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,959
Two brothers, see?
The Loman brothers.

916
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,839
- We could sell sporting goods.
- That is a one million dollar idea.

917
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:39,673
Marvellous.

918
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:42,134
I'm in great shape
as far as that's concerned.

919
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:45,722
It wouldn't be like a business at all.
We'd be out playing ball again.

920
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:49,392
- That's what I was talking about.
- You won't get fed up. It'd be family.

921
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:53,939
Lick the world. You guys together could
absolutely lick the civilised world.

922
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:56,649
I'll see Oliver.
If we could work that out...

923
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,945
- I think everything is...
- Stop interrupting!

924
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,363
Don't wear a sports jacket and slacks.

925
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:05,450
A business suit
and talk as little as possible.

926
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:08,285
- And don't crack any jokes.
- Hey, he did like me.

927
00:52:08,286 --> 00:52:10,621
- He always liked me.
- Oh, he loved you.

928
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:12,581
Will you stop!

929
00:52:12,582 --> 00:52:15,669
Walk in very serious.
You're not applying for a boy's job.

930
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:18,797
Money is to pass.
Be quiet, fine and serious.

931
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,757
Everybody likes a kidder
but nobody lends them money.

932
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:24,803
- I'll try to get some myself.
- I see great things for you.

933
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:28,515
I think your troubles are over.
Start big, you'll end big. Ask for 15.

934
00:52:28,598 --> 00:52:30,307
How much you gonna ask for?

935
00:52:30,308 --> 00:52:33,185
- Gee, I don't...
- Don't say gee. Gee is a boy's word.

936
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:36,147
A man walking in for $15,000
does not say "gee".

937
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:38,357
- Ten would be top.
- Don't be so modest.

938
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:41,236
You always start it too low.
Walk in with a big laugh.

939
00:52:41,277 --> 00:52:44,698
Start off with a couple of your
good stories to lighten things up.

940
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:47,533
It's not what you say
but how you say it,

941
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:50,077
because personality always wins the day.

942
00:52:50,078 --> 00:52:53,039
- Oliver always thought...
- Will you let me talk!

943
00:52:53,123 --> 00:52:54,999
Dad, stop yelling at her.

944
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,459
I was talking, wasrt I?

945
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,087
I just don't like you
yelling at her all the time.

946
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:02,673
- I'm telling you.
- You taking over this house?

947
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:05,969
- Willy, he didn't mean...
- Don't take his side all the time!

948
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:08,821
Stop yelling at her.

949
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:36,332
Give my best to Bill Oliver.

950
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:45,307
- He may remember me.
- Why did you have to start that?

951
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:49,304
Did you see how sweet he was
as soon as you talked hopefully?

952
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:54,275
Go up.
Say good night to him.

953
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:57,820
- Don't let him go to bed that way.
- Biff, let's buck him up.

954
00:53:58,021 --> 00:54:02,666
Please, dear.
It takes so little to make him happy.

955
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:06,061
Come.

956
00:54:07,864 --> 00:54:10,825
Your pyjamas are hanging
in the bathroom, Willy.

957
00:54:10,909 --> 00:54:12,326
What a woman.

958
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:15,788
They broke the mould when they made her.
You know that, Biff?

959
00:54:15,972 --> 00:54:18,640
He's off salary.

960
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,934
My god, working on commission.

961
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:23,478
Let's face it.
He's no hotshot selling man.

962
00:54:23,479 --> 00:54:26,356
Sometimes you gotta admit
he's a sweet personality.

963
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:29,109
Lend me ten bucks.
I'm gonna buy some new ties.

964
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,488
I'll take you to a place I know.
Wear one of my striped shirts.

965
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:35,742
Mom got so gray.
She got awful old.

966
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:41,080
I'm gonna go in and see Oliver tomorrow
and I'm gonna knock him...

967
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:43,832
Come on up and tell Dad.
Let's give him a whirl.

968
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,543
With ten thousand bucks... boy.

969
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:49,338
That's the first time
I've heard the old confidence.

970
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:53,593
You're gonna live with me, kid,
and I'm telling you, any babe you want.

971
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:55,802
You say the word.

972
00:54:55,803 --> 00:54:58,639
Can you do something about the shower?
It drips.

973
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:02,935
Oh, all of a sudden
everything falls to pieces.

974
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:06,439
That damn plumbing.
They ought to be sued, those people.

975
00:55:06,522 --> 00:55:10,318
- Hardly finished putting it in...
- I'm wondering if Oliver will remember.

976
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:14,830
- You think he might? -Remember him?
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?

977
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:17,866
If he'd have stayed with Oliver,
he'd be on top now.

978
00:55:17,867 --> 00:55:23,339
Wait till Oliver gets a look at him. You
don't know the average calibre anymore.

979
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:27,418
The average young man today
has got a calibre of zero.

980
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:29,836
The greatest thing for him
was to bum up...

981
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:31,855
Willy.

982
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:42,141
- Glad to hear it, boy.
- He wanted to say good night to you.

983
00:55:42,225 --> 00:55:45,327
Oh, yeah, you knock them dead, boy.

984
00:55:47,188 --> 00:55:50,124
What do you want to tell me?

985
00:55:55,988 --> 00:55:58,323
Take it easy, Pop, good night.

986
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:01,536
If anything falls off the desk
while you're talking to him,

987
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,454
like a package or something,
don't you pick it up.

988
00:56:04,455 --> 00:56:07,875
- They have office boys.
- I'll make a big breakfast.

989
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:13,506
Will you let me finish, hmm?

990
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:17,468
Tell him you were in business
in the West, not farm work.

991
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:20,721
- All right, Dad. I will.
- I think everything's gonna be...

992
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:27,478
And don't undersell yourself.
No less than $15,000.

993
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:31,023
- OK. Good night, Mom.
- Because you got a greatness in you.

994
00:56:31,107 --> 00:56:33,250
Biff!

995
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:39,047
Remember that.

996
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:43,126
- You got all kinds of greatness.
- Sleep well, darling.

997
00:56:43,327 --> 00:56:47,414
- I'm gonna get married, Mom. I wanted
to tell you. - Go to sleep, dear.

998
00:56:47,415 --> 00:56:50,293
I just wanted to tell you.

999
00:56:50,376 --> 00:56:53,019
Keep up the good work.

1000
00:57:08,644 --> 00:57:13,232
Do you remember that Ebbets Field
game, the championship of the city?

1001
00:57:13,316 --> 00:57:14,858
Hmm?

1002
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:17,419
Just rest, dear.

1003
00:57:18,362 --> 00:57:20,780
- Should I sing to you?
- Yeah, you sing to me.

1004
00:57:20,781 --> 00:57:25,244
You know, when that team came out,
he was the tallest.

1005
00:57:25,328 --> 00:57:26,953
You remember?

1006
00:57:26,954 --> 00:57:30,541
- All in gold.
- Oh, like a young god.

1007
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:37,598
Hercules, something like that. And
the sun, the sun all around him.

1008
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,735
Remember how he waved to me?

1009
00:57:42,553 --> 00:57:47,333
Right from the field, with the representatives
from three colleges standing by,

1010
00:57:47,516 --> 00:57:50,936
and the buyers I brought.

1011
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,563
Oh, the cheers when he came out.

1012
00:57:53,564 --> 00:57:56,750
Loman! Loman!

1013
00:57:57,777 --> 00:58:00,863
Loman!

1014
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:10,180
God Almighty, he'll be great yet.

1015
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:16,921
A star like that, magnificent,

1016
00:58:17,004 --> 00:58:20,107
can never really fade away.

1017
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:28,323
- Oh, boy.
- Willy?

1018
00:58:29,058 --> 00:58:31,243
Dear?

1019
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:35,914
What has he got against you?

1020
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:41,712
I'm so tired. Don't talk anymore.

1021
00:58:43,364 --> 00:58:46,700
Will you ask Howard
if he'll let you work in New York?

1022
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:50,079
First thing in the morning.
Everything will be all right.

1023
00:58:53,165 --> 00:58:55,100
Gee.

1024
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:59,212
Look at the moon
moving between the buildings.

1025
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:11,493
Oh, oh, wonderful coffee!

1026
01:00:11,577 --> 01:00:14,037
- A meal in itself.
- Can I make you some eggs?

1027
01:00:14,038 --> 01:00:17,957
- Take a breath.
- You look so rested, dear.

1028
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,720
I slept like a dead one.
First time in months.

1029
01:00:20,803 --> 01:00:23,630
Imagine sleeping till 10
on a Tuesday morning.

1030
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:27,976
- Boys left nice and early? - They
were out of here by 8:00. - Good work.

1031
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:30,595
It was thrilling, them leaving together.

1032
01:00:30,596 --> 01:00:33,883
I cannot get over the smell
of shaving lotion in this house.

1033
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:37,834
Biff was very changed this morning.
His attitude seemed to be hopeful.

1034
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,589
- He couldn't wait to see Oliver.
- He's heading for a change.

1035
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,985
- Certain men take longer to get...
- Solidified.

1036
01:00:45,069 --> 01:00:47,671
- How did he dress?
- His blue suit.

1037
01:00:48,414 --> 01:00:51,500
He looked so handsome.
He could be anything in that suit.

1038
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:54,252
Boy, there's no question.
No question at all.

1039
01:00:54,253 --> 01:00:58,215
Gee, on the way home tonight
I'd like to buy some seeds.

1040
01:00:58,299 --> 01:01:01,927
Wonderful, but not enough sun
gets back there. Nothing will grow.

1041
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:04,846
Before it's over
we'll get a place in the country,

1042
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,724
- I'll raise vegetables, chickens.
- You'll do it.

1043
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:10,769
They'll get married and visit.
I'll build a guest house.

1044
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:14,732
I've got so many tools. All I'd need
would be lumber and peace of mind.

1045
01:01:14,815 --> 01:01:17,400
- I sewed the liner.
- I could build two houses

1046
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:19,486
- so they'd both come.
- Yes.

1047
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:23,491
- He decide how much he's gonna ask for?
- He didn't, but I imagine ten.

1048
01:01:23,574 --> 01:01:27,703
Fifteen thousand.
You're gonna talk to Howard today?

1049
01:01:27,786 --> 01:01:32,082
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll put it to him straight and simple.

1050
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:35,044
- He'll have to take me off the road.
- Ask for a little advance.

1051
01:01:35,127 --> 01:01:38,255
We've got the insurance premium.
It's the grace period.

1052
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:41,717
It's $108.68 because
we're a little short this month.

1053
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,552
- Why are we short?
- You had the job done on the car.

1054
01:01:44,553 --> 01:01:47,514
- That damn Studebaker.
- One more payment on the refrigerator.

1055
01:01:47,598 --> 01:01:50,016
- Itjust broke again.
- It's old, dear.

1056
01:01:50,017 --> 01:01:52,727
We should have bought
a well advertised machine.

1057
01:01:52,728 --> 01:01:56,106
Charley bought a General Electric.
It's 20 years old and it's good.

1058
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:00,485
- Willy, please! - Whoever heard
of a Hastings refrigerator?

1059
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:04,782
Once in my life I'd like to buy
something outright before it's broken.

1060
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:08,702
I am always in a race with the junkyard.
I just finished paying for the car.

1061
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:11,747
It's on its last legs.
The refrigerator consumes belts.

1062
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,706
- Willy.
- They time those things!

1063
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:17,419
They time them so when you finally
pay for them they're used up.

1064
01:02:17,503 --> 01:02:20,422
All told, about 200 dollars
would carry us dear,

1065
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:24,510
but that includes the last payment
on the mortgage.

1066
01:02:24,593 --> 01:02:28,639
When we've made that payment, Willy,
the house belongs to us.

1067
01:02:28,764 --> 01:02:32,392
- That's 25 years.
- Biff was nine when we bought it.

1068
01:02:32,393 --> 01:02:37,481
Well, that's a great thing,
to weather a 25 year mortgage.

1069
01:02:37,564 --> 01:02:40,425
It's an accomplishment.

1070
01:02:41,276 --> 01:02:45,847
All the cement, the lumber. The
reconstruction I put in this house.

1071
01:02:45,948 --> 01:02:49,326
There ain't a crack
to be found in it anymore.

1072
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,078
- Well, it served its purpose.
- What purpose?

1073
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,207
Some stranger will come along,
move in, and that's that.

1074
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:59,837
If only Biff would take this house
and raise a family.

1075
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:05,967
- Good-bye. I'm late.
- I forgot to tell you.

1076
01:03:05,968 --> 01:03:10,305
You're supposed to meet them for dinner.
Frank's Chop House, near Sixth Avenue.

1077
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:12,348
Is that so? How about you?

1078
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:15,394
Just the three of you.
They are gonna blow you to a big meal.

1079
01:03:15,477 --> 01:03:18,271
- Who thought of that?
- Biff came to me this morning.

1080
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:22,517
He said, "Tell Dad we're gonna blow
him to a big meal. Be there 6:00".

1081
01:03:22,518 --> 01:03:25,061
You and your two boys
are gonna have dinner.

1082
01:03:25,062 --> 01:03:27,897
- Gee whiz, that's really something.
- Yeah.

1083
01:03:27,898 --> 01:03:30,400
I'm gonna knock Howard for a loop, kid.

1084
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:33,946
I'll get an advance
and I'll come home with a New York job!

1085
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:36,865
- I'm gonna do it!
- That's the spirit, Willy!

1086
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:39,743
I will never get behind the wheel
the rest of my life!

1087
01:03:39,827 --> 01:03:42,537
It's changing, Willy.
I can feel it changing.

1088
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:45,057
- Beyond a question.
- Oh!

1089
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,417
- You got your glasses?
- Yeah.

1090
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:50,546
And your handkerchief?
And your saccharine?

1091
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:53,632
- And my saccharine.
- Be careful on the subway stairs.

1092
01:03:53,757 --> 01:03:58,137
Will you stop mending stockings?
It gets me nervous. I can't tell you.

1093
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,680
And don't forget,
Frank's Chop House.

1094
01:04:00,881 --> 01:04:05,427
- Maybe beets would grow out there.
- Oh, Willy, you tried so many times.

1095
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:08,722
- Yeah, well, don't work hard.
- Now, you be careful.

1096
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:11,449
Come on, give me a little something.

1097
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,871
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1098
01:04:30,427 --> 01:04:33,363
- Psst.
- Hello, Willy.

1099
01:04:33,564 --> 01:04:37,526
- I'd like to talk to you, Howard.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

1100
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:40,445
- What's that?
- Didrt you ever see one of these?

1101
01:04:40,446 --> 01:04:43,072
- It's a wire recorder.
- Can we talk a minute?

1102
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:45,908
It records things.
I just got delivery yesterday.

1103
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:48,494
It's the most terrific machine
I ever saw in my life.

1104
01:04:48,495 --> 01:04:50,621
- I was up all night with it.
- What do you do?

1105
01:04:50,622 --> 01:04:53,458
I bought it for dictation
but you can do anything with it.

1106
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:56,462
Listen to this. I had it home.
Listen to what I picked up.

1107
01:04:56,587 --> 01:04:59,606
The first one is my daughter.
Get this.

1108
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:04,277
Listen to that kid whistle.

1109
01:05:06,138 --> 01:05:08,222
That is lifelike, isn't it?

1110
01:05:08,223 --> 01:05:12,728
- Seven years old. Get that tone.
- I'd like to ask a little favour.

1111
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:15,104
It's your turn now, Daddy.

1112
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:18,041
She's crazy for me.

1113
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:23,221
- That's me. - You're very
good. - Now this is my son.

1114
01:05:23,322 --> 01:05:26,366
The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.

1115
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:30,937
The capital of California is Sacramento.
- Five years old.

1116
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:33,873
He'll make an announcer someday.

1117
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:37,294
- The capital of Colorado...
- That is alphabetical order.

1118
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:40,129
- The maid kicked the plug.
- That certainly is...

1119
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,589
Shh! For God's sake.

1120
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,593
It is 9:00 so I have to go to sleep.

1121
01:05:44,676 --> 01:05:47,178
- It really is...
- Wait. The next is my wife.

1122
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:50,224
- Talk!
- I can't think of anything.

1123
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:54,436
- It's time.
- Hello. Howard, I can't talk.

1124
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,898
- That was my wife.
- That is a wonderful machine. Can we...

1125
01:05:58,023 --> 01:06:02,945
I'm gonna take my camera and my bandsaw
and all my hobbies and out they go.

1126
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:07,198
- This is the most fascinating
relaxation ever. - I think I'll get one.

1127
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,826
They're a hundred and a half.
You can't do without it.

1128
01:06:09,827 --> 01:06:14,163
Supposing you want to hear Jack Benny,
see. But you can't be home at that hour.

1129
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:17,584
You tell the maid to turn the radio on
when Jack Benny comes on,

1130
01:06:17,668 --> 01:06:20,378
and this automatically comes on
with the radio.

1131
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:23,966
- When you come home...
- You come home any time you like.

1132
01:06:24,049 --> 01:06:26,969
You get yourself a Coke,
sit down, throw the switch,

1133
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:30,055
and there is Jack Benny's programme,
in the middle of the night.

1134
01:06:30,138 --> 01:06:33,267
I'm gonna get one,
'cause lots of times I'm on the road,

1135
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:36,143
and I think, "What I must
be missing on the radio".

1136
01:06:36,144 --> 01:06:40,649
- Don't you have a radio in the car?
- Yeah. Whoever thinks of turning it on?

1137
01:06:40,732 --> 01:06:44,194
- Arent you supposed to be in Boston?
- That's what I want to talk about.

1138
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:46,529
- You got a minute?
- What happened?

1139
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:49,365
- You didn't crack up again, did you?
- Oh, no.

1140
01:06:49,366 --> 01:06:52,034
Oh!

1141
01:06:52,035 --> 01:06:55,330
Geez, you got me worried there
for a minute.

1142
01:06:55,455 --> 01:06:58,458
- Well, what's the trouble?
- Well, to tell you the truth,

1143
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:02,462
I've come to the decision
that I'd rather not travel anymore.

1144
01:07:02,546 --> 01:07:06,799
- Not travel? Well, what would you do?
- Remember Christmastime at the party

1145
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,552
you said you'd think
of a spot for me here in town?

1146
01:07:09,553 --> 01:07:13,706
- With us? - Sure. - Oh,
yeah, yeah, I remember.

1147
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:16,183
I couldn't think of anything for you.

1148
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:20,355
I'll tell you, Howard, the kids
are all grown up now, you know.

1149
01:07:20,439 --> 01:07:22,648
I don't need much anymore.

1150
01:07:22,649 --> 01:07:27,863
If I could take home $65 a week
I could swing it.

1151
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:30,740
- Yeah, but Willy...
- I'll tell you why.

1152
01:07:30,741 --> 01:07:34,453
Speaking frankly
between the two of us, you know,

1153
01:07:34,536 --> 01:07:37,413
I'm just a little tired.

1154
01:07:37,414 --> 01:07:40,608
Oh.
I can understand that, Willy.

1155
01:07:40,709 --> 01:07:43,044
But you're a road man, Willy.

1156
01:07:43,045 --> 01:07:46,298
We're a road business.
We've got half a dozen salesmen here.

1157
01:07:46,381 --> 01:07:51,203
God knows, Howard,
I never asked a favour of any man,

1158
01:07:51,386 --> 01:07:54,890
but I was with the firm when
your father used to carry you in here.

1159
01:07:54,973 --> 01:07:56,766
- I know.
- Your father came to me

1160
01:07:56,767 --> 01:08:00,395
the day you were born and asked me
what I thought of the name Howard.

1161
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,441
I appreciate that, Willy,
but there just is no spot here for you.

1162
01:08:04,566 --> 01:08:08,612
If I had a spot I would slam you
right in there, but I just don't.

1163
01:08:08,695 --> 01:08:12,616
- All I need is 50 dollars a week.
- Where am I gonna put you, kid?

1164
01:08:12,741 --> 01:08:15,284
It's not a question
of whether I can sell, huh?

1165
01:08:15,285 --> 01:08:19,206
No, but it's a business and
everybody's gotta pull his own weight.

1166
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:21,916
- Let me tell you a story.
- Business is business.

1167
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:26,003
This is definitely business.
Listen. You don't understand this.

1168
01:08:26,004 --> 01:08:30,092
When I was a boy, 18, 19,
I was already on the road.

1169
01:08:30,175 --> 01:08:33,720
There was a question in my mind
whether selling had a future for me.

1170
01:08:33,845 --> 01:08:37,099
In those days
I had a yearning to go to Alaska.

1171
01:08:37,182 --> 01:08:40,102
There were three gold strikes
in one month in Alaska.

1172
01:08:40,227 --> 01:08:43,146
I felt like going out,
just for the ride, you might say.

1173
01:08:43,271 --> 01:08:46,900
- You don't say?
- My father lived many years in Alaska.

1174
01:08:47,025 --> 01:08:49,235
He was an adventurous man.

1175
01:08:49,236 --> 01:08:52,322
We got quite a streak of self-reliance
in our family.

1176
01:08:52,405 --> 01:08:55,659
I thought I'd go out with
my older brother, try to locate him,

1177
01:08:55,742 --> 01:08:57,326
maybe settle in the North.

1178
01:08:57,327 --> 01:09:00,596
I was almost decided to go...

1179
01:09:01,915 --> 01:09:04,542
...when I met a salesman
in the Parker House.

1180
01:09:04,543 --> 01:09:06,627
His name was Dave Singleman.

1181
01:09:06,628 --> 01:09:11,091
He was 84 years old and
he'd drummed merchandise in 31 states.

1182
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:14,928
Old Dave would go up to his room,
put on his green velvet slippers,

1183
01:09:15,887 --> 01:09:18,180
pick up the phone and call the buyers.

1184
01:09:18,181 --> 01:09:21,852
Without ever leaving his room
at the age of 84,

1185
01:09:21,977 --> 01:09:24,162
he made his living.

1186
01:09:24,646 --> 01:09:29,067
When I saw that, I realised that selling
was the greatest career a man could want

1187
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:33,446
because what could be more satisfying
than to be able to go at the age of 84

1188
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,447
into 20 or 30 different cities

1189
01:09:35,448 --> 01:09:37,992
and pick up a phone
and be remembered and loved

1190
01:09:37,993 --> 01:09:40,803
and helped by many different people.

1191
01:09:41,997 --> 01:09:44,582
You know, when he died...

1192
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:47,251
And by the way, he died
the death of a salesman,

1193
01:09:47,252 --> 01:09:50,705
in his green velvet slippers
in the smoker of the New York,

1194
01:09:50,806 --> 01:09:53,340
New Haven and Hartford
going into Boston.

1195
01:09:53,341 --> 01:09:57,228
When he died, hundreds of salesmen
and buyers were at his funeral.

1196
01:09:58,471 --> 01:10:02,851
Things were sad on a lot of trains
for months after that.

1197
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,573
You see, in those days there was
personality in it, Howard.

1198
01:10:08,815 --> 01:10:13,403
There was respect and comradeship and...

1199
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:17,790
...and gratitude.
Today it's all cut and dry.

1200
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:21,786
And there's no chance for bringing
friendship to bear or personality.

1201
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:23,829
You see what I mean.

1202
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:27,000
- They don't know me anymore.
- That's just the thing, Willy.

1203
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:29,543
If I had 40 dollars a week,
that's all I need.

1204
01:10:29,544 --> 01:10:32,296
- I can't take blood from a stone.
- Howard!

1205
01:10:32,297 --> 01:10:35,258
The year Al Smith was nominated
your father came to me...

1206
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,178
I'm talking about your father!

1207
01:10:38,261 --> 01:10:40,721
There were promises made
across this desk!

1208
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:43,908
You mustnt tell me
that you got people to see!

1209
01:10:44,809 --> 01:10:49,380
I put 34 years into this firm,
Howard! Now I can't pay my insurance!

1210
01:10:49,481 --> 01:10:52,149
You can't eat the orange
and throw the peel away!

1211
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,835
A man is not a piece of fruit!

1212
01:10:57,489 --> 01:10:59,840
Pay attention.

1213
01:11:00,909 --> 01:11:04,011
No, your father...

1214
01:11:04,412 --> 01:11:06,955
Howard...

1215
01:11:06,956 --> 01:11:10,460
In 1928 I had a big year.

1216
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:14,480
I averaged 170 dollars a week.

1217
01:11:14,481 --> 01:11:17,692
- You never averaged 170 dollars a week.
- No, no, no!

1218
01:11:17,775 --> 01:11:23,239
I averaged 170 dollars a week
in the year 1928!

1219
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:25,657
And your father came to me, Howard,

1220
01:11:25,658 --> 01:11:28,578
right across this desk,
put his hand on my shoulder...

1221
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:32,548
You have to excuse me, Willy!
I have got to see some people.

1222
01:11:32,749 --> 01:11:36,193
Pull yourself together.
I'll be back in a little while.

1223
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,633
Ah, pull myself together!

1224
01:11:42,634 --> 01:11:44,777
What did I say to him?

1225
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:50,741
Oh, my god.

1226
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:54,161
I was yelling at him.

1227
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:59,984
Frank, Frank, don't you remember
what you told me that time?

1228
01:12:00,068 --> 01:12:02,110
You put your hand on my shoulder...

1229
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:05,030
The capital of Delaware...

1230
01:12:05,031 --> 01:12:08,133
Oh, Howard!

1231
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:10,619
Howard!

1232
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,581
Howard, Howard, shut it off!

1233
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:15,415
Shut it off!

1234
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:18,378
- Look, Willy...
- I gotta get myself some coffee.

1235
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:20,629
- I'll get coffee.
- Willy, look...

1236
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:25,343
Look, Willy,
you can't go to Boston for us.

1237
01:12:26,886 --> 01:12:30,723
- Why can't I go?
- I don't want you to represent us.

1238
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:36,495
I've been meaning to tell you
for a long time now.

1239
01:12:38,231 --> 01:12:42,860
- Howard, are you firing me?
- I think you need a good long rest.

1240
01:12:42,944 --> 01:12:47,073
When you feel better come back
and we'll try to work something out.

1241
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:48,824
I gotta earn money, Howard.

1242
01:12:48,825 --> 01:12:51,828
Where are your sons?
Wort your sons give you a hand?

1243
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:54,621
Oh, they're working on a very big deal.

1244
01:12:54,622 --> 01:12:56,415
This is no time for false pride.

1245
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:58,875
Go to your sons
and tell them you're tired.

1246
01:12:58,876 --> 01:13:00,836
You got two great boys there.

1247
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:03,130
- No question.
- That's that, huh?

1248
01:13:03,131 --> 01:13:05,132
In the meantime. All right.

1249
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:07,926
I'll go to...
I'll go to Boston tomorrow.

1250
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:09,761
No!

1251
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:11,780
No.

1252
01:13:13,016 --> 01:13:15,892
I can't throw myself on my kids.
I'm not a freeloader.

1253
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:18,645
- Kid, I am busy this morning.
- Let me go to Boston.

1254
01:13:18,646 --> 01:13:21,999
I have got a line
of people to see this morning.

1255
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:31,616
- Sit down. Sit.
- What?

1256
01:13:31,617 --> 01:13:33,552
Oh.

1257
01:13:40,293 --> 01:13:44,046
Take five minutes
and pull yourself together.

1258
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:47,759
And then go home, will you?

1259
01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:50,110
I need the office.

1260
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:56,016
Whenever you can this week,
drop off the samples.

1261
01:13:56,017 --> 01:13:59,896
You'll feel better, Willy,
and then come back. We'll talk.

1262
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,985
Pull yourself together, kid.
There's people outside.

1263
01:14:19,207 --> 01:14:22,293
Oh, Ben!

1264
01:14:23,753 --> 01:14:27,147
How did you do it, huh?

1265
01:14:28,299 --> 01:14:30,425
What's the answer?

1266
01:14:30,426 --> 01:14:32,969
Did you wind up the Alaska deal already?

1267
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:37,350
Doesrt take much time if you know what
you're doing. I wanted to say good-bye.

1268
01:14:37,517 --> 01:14:39,809
- I gotta talk to you.
- I haven't the time.

1269
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:42,354
Nothing's working out.
I don't know what to do.

1270
01:14:42,355 --> 01:14:46,317
I bought timberland in Alaska. I need
a man to look after things for me.

1271
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,984
God, timberland!

1272
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:50,487
Me and my boys and those grand outdoors!

1273
01:14:50,488 --> 01:14:52,364
A new continent on your doorstep.

1274
01:14:52,365 --> 01:14:56,536
Get out of these cities. They're full of
talk, time payments and courts of law.

1275
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:59,956
- You can fight for a fortune up there.
- Linda! Linda!

1276
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:01,915
- Linda.
- You're back.

1277
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:03,541
- I haven't much time.
- Wait.

1278
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:05,752
He's got a proposition for me in Alaska.

1279
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:08,839
- But you've got a job here.
- But in Alaska, kid, I could...

1280
01:15:08,923 --> 01:15:11,842
- You are doing well enough.
- Enough for what, dear?

1281
01:15:11,926 --> 01:15:15,972
Don't say things like that to him.
Enough to be happy right here, now.

1282
01:15:16,055 --> 01:15:20,184
Why must everyone conquer the world?
You're well-liked, the boys love you.

1283
01:15:20,309 --> 01:15:23,896
The other day old man Wagner told him
he'll be a member of the firm.

1284
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:27,358
- Didn't he, Willy?
- I'm building something with this firm.

1285
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:30,319
If a man is building
he must be on the right track.

1286
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:34,657
- What are you building? Where is it?
- That's true, Linda, there's nothing.

1287
01:15:34,782 --> 01:15:37,827
Why, there's a man 84 years old, Willy.

1288
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:39,869
That's right, Ben, that's right!

1289
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:42,873
When I look at that man
I say what's there to worry about?

1290
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:46,168
All he has to do is go into any city,
pick up a phone

1291
01:15:46,252 --> 01:15:48,295
and he's making his living. Know why?

1292
01:15:48,296 --> 01:15:50,463
- I gotta go.
- Oh, look at this boy.

1293
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:54,427
Without a penny to his name, three
great universities are begging for him.

1294
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:59,164
From there the sky's the limit! It's
not what you do, Ben, it's who you know!

1295
01:15:59,265 --> 01:16:02,560
And a smile on your face.
It's contacts, Ben, contacts!

1296
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:06,981
The whole wealth of Alaska passing over
the lunch table of the Commodore Hotel.

1297
01:16:07,106 --> 01:16:09,941
And that's the wonder,
the wonder of this country,

1298
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:14,363
that a man can end with diamonds
on the basis of being liked.

1299
01:16:14,488 --> 01:16:17,658
That's why, when you get
on that field today, it's important,

1300
01:16:17,742 --> 01:16:21,328
'cause thousands of people
will be rooting for you, loving you.

1301
01:16:21,412 --> 01:16:25,499
When he walks into a business office,
his name will sound out like a bell,

1302
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,460
and all the doors will open to him.
I seen it, Ben.

1303
01:16:28,461 --> 01:16:32,506
I seen it a thousand times. You can't
feel it in your hands, but it's there.

1304
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,841
- Good-bye.
- Don't you think I'm right?

1305
01:16:34,842 --> 01:16:38,470
- I value your advice.
- A new continent at your doorstep.

1306
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:41,497
You could walk out rich.

1307
01:16:41,498 --> 01:16:43,499
Rich!

1308
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,379
We're gonna do a hit, Ben, you hear me?
We're gonna do a hit!

1309
01:16:47,421 --> 01:16:49,463
Gee, I was afraid you left already.

1310
01:16:49,464 --> 01:16:51,299
- What time is it?
- Ten past one.

1311
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,595
Oh, come on everybody,
Ebbets Field, next stop.

1312
01:16:54,678 --> 01:16:57,723
- Where's the pennants?
- Did you pack fresh underwear?

1313
01:16:57,806 --> 01:17:01,058
- I want to go. - I'm
carrying your helmet. - I am.

1314
01:17:01,059 --> 01:17:03,936
You promised me.
How am I gonna get in the locker room?

1315
01:17:03,937 --> 01:17:05,855
Let him carry the shoulder guards.

1316
01:17:05,856 --> 01:17:08,817
Can I? I told everybody
I was gonna be in the locker room.

1317
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:11,695
- It's the Clubhouse.
- I meant the Clubhouse.

1318
01:17:13,572 --> 01:17:16,450
- Let him carry the shoulder guards.
- Stay close to us.

1319
01:17:16,533 --> 01:17:20,503
- Wave when Biff comes out on the
field! You set, boy? - Ready to go, Pop.

1320
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:23,539
- Every muscle is ready.
- You realise what this means.

1321
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,499
You're coming home this afternoon

1322
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,336
captain of the All-Scholastic
Championship Team

1323
01:17:28,337 --> 01:17:32,007
- of the city of New York.
- That's right, Pop, and remember,

1324
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:35,302
when I take off my helmet,
that touchdowrs for you.

1325
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,060
Let's go over.
I got no room for you, Charley.

1326
01:17:43,143 --> 01:17:44,810
- Room for what?
- In the car.

1327
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:47,396
Going for a ride?
I want to shoot some casino.

1328
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:49,440
Don't you realise what today is?

1329
01:17:49,441 --> 01:17:52,986
Oh, he knows, Willy.
He's just kidding you.

1330
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:57,098
That's nothing to kid about. I'm
not kidding, Linda. What's going on?

1331
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,700
He is playing at Ebbets Field today.

1332
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:03,246
- Baseball in this weather?
- Don't talk to him. We're late.

1333
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,289
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What?

1334
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:08,377
Don't you listen to the radio?
Ebbets Field just blew up.

1335
01:18:08,502 --> 01:18:10,586
You go to hell! Everybody in?

1336
01:18:10,587 --> 01:18:12,505
Knock a homer, Biff.
Knock a homer!

1337
01:18:12,506 --> 01:18:14,757
I don't think that was funny, Charley.

1338
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:18,011
Did you hear me, huh?
This is the greatest day in his life.

1339
01:18:18,095 --> 01:18:19,553
When are you gonna grow up?

1340
01:18:19,554 --> 01:18:22,139
When this game is over
you won't be laughing anymore.

1341
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,060
They'll be calling him
another Red Grange, 25,000 a year.

1342
01:18:25,143 --> 01:18:26,519
- That so?
- Yeah!

1343
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,896
- Wait a minute, Willy. I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

1344
01:18:28,897 --> 01:18:32,067
But tell me something.
Who is Red Grange?

1345
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:34,777
Put up your hands.
Put up your hands, come on.

1346
01:18:34,778 --> 01:18:38,323
Put up your hands. Who do you think
you are, better than everybody?

1347
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:41,284
Put up your hands! Put up your hands!

1348
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:44,204
Put up your hands.
Who the hell do you think you are?

1349
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:48,125
You don't know everything,
you big ignorant stupid...

1350
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:51,086
Put up your hands.
What are you walking away for?

1351
01:18:51,169 --> 01:18:54,840
Don't walk away. You gonna say
something to me, say it to my face.

1352
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:57,207
I know you laugh at me behind my back.

1353
01:18:57,208 --> 01:19:00,629
You'll be laughing out of the other
side of your face after this game.

1354
01:19:00,712 --> 01:19:03,673
The woods are burning.
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1355
01:19:03,757 --> 01:19:08,011
Eighty thousand people!
Right between the goal posts.

1356
01:19:08,094 --> 01:19:11,264
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1357
01:19:11,348 --> 01:19:14,517
Hello, baby! Touchdown!

1358
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:16,852
Touchdown! Ah, Jenny.

1359
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:20,039
Jenny, good to see you.
How are you?

1360
01:19:20,398 --> 01:19:23,526
- Working? Or still honest?
- Fine.

1361
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:26,488
- How you been feeling?
- Not much any more.

1362
01:19:27,572 --> 01:19:29,966
- Oh!
- Hello, Uncle Willy.

1363
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:34,679
Bernard.

1364
01:19:35,413 --> 01:19:37,873
- Look who's here.
- How are you?

1365
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:40,835
- What are you doing here?
- I just stopped by to see Pop.

1366
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:44,422
To get off my feet till my train leaves.
I'm going to Washington.

1367
01:19:44,506 --> 01:19:46,882
- Is he in?
- He's with the accountant.

1368
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:50,519
Sit down. What are you
gonna do in Washington?

1369
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,940
- Just a case I've got there.
- That so? You gonna play tennis there?

1370
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:57,601
I'm staying with a friend
who's got a court.

1371
01:19:57,602 --> 01:20:00,479
You don't say.
Their own tennis court?

1372
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,316
- Those are fine people, I bet.
- They're very nice.

1373
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,484
- Dad tells me Biff's in town.
- Yeah.

1374
01:20:05,485 --> 01:20:08,905
Biff's in. He's working
on a very big deal, Bernard.

1375
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:13,183
- What's Biff doing? - He's been
doing very big things in the West,

1376
01:20:13,284 --> 01:20:15,994
but he decided
to establish himself here.

1377
01:20:15,995 --> 01:20:18,931
Very big. We're having dinner.

1378
01:20:20,283 --> 01:20:23,160
Did I hear your wife had a boy?

1379
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:25,871
That's right. Our second.

1380
01:20:25,872 --> 01:20:28,015
Two boys.

1381
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:31,586
- What do you know?
- You still with the old firm, Willy?

1382
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:38,051
I'm overjoyed to see how
you made the grade, Bernard, overjoyed.

1383
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:40,469
It's an encouraging thing to see.

1384
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:45,859
A young man really... really...

1385
01:20:46,243 --> 01:20:50,429
Ah, it looks very good for Biff.
Very good.

1386
01:20:58,404 --> 01:21:03,359
- Bernard. - What is it, Willy?
- What... What's the secret?

1387
01:21:03,543 --> 01:21:05,586
- What secret?
- How did you...?

1388
01:21:05,587 --> 01:21:08,673
- Why didn't he ever catch on?
- Willy, I wouldn't know that.

1389
01:21:08,756 --> 01:21:11,508
Oh, you were his friend,
his boyhood friend.

1390
01:21:11,509 --> 01:21:13,594
It's something I don't understand.

1391
01:21:13,595 --> 01:21:16,221
His life ended
after that Ebbets Field game.

1392
01:21:16,222 --> 01:21:19,099
From the age of 17
nothing good ever happened to him.

1393
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:23,605
- He never trained himself for anything.
- He took correspondence courses.

1394
01:21:23,646 --> 01:21:27,400
Radio mechanics, television...
He never made the slightest mark.

1395
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,985
- Do you want to talk candidly?
- Bernard.

1396
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:34,199
I regard you as a very brilliant man.
Bernard, I value your advice.

1397
01:21:34,282 --> 01:21:36,867
The hell with advice.
I couldn't advise you.

1398
01:21:36,868 --> 01:21:39,661
There's one thing
I have always wanted to ask you.

1399
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:42,999
When he was supposed to graduate
and the teacher flunked him...

1400
01:21:43,082 --> 01:21:44,499
Ruined his life.

1401
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,754
All he had to do was go
to summer school, make up that subject.

1402
01:21:47,837 --> 01:21:51,007
- That's right. That's right!
- Did you tell him not to go?

1403
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,926
Me? I begged him to go.
I ordered him to go.

1404
01:21:53,927 --> 01:21:56,553
- Why wouldn't he go?
- Why? Why, Bernard!

1405
01:21:56,554 --> 01:21:59,807
That questiors been trailing me
like a ghost for 15 years.

1406
01:21:59,891 --> 01:22:04,579
He flunked the subject and he laid down
and died like a hammer hit him.

1407
01:22:04,904 --> 01:22:07,656
Let me talk to you, Bernard.
I got nobody to talk to.

1408
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:11,936
It wasn't my fault. It keeps going
around in my head, maybe I did something.

1409
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,579
I got nothing to give him.

1410
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,997
Don't take it so hard.

1411
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:17,475
Why did he lay down?

1412
01:22:18,793 --> 01:22:20,878
- What is the story there?
- Willy...

1413
01:22:20,879 --> 01:22:22,880
You're his friend. Come on.

1414
01:22:22,881 --> 01:22:26,968
Willy, I remember it was June.
Our grades came out. He'd flunked math.

1415
01:22:27,051 --> 01:22:29,428
That son of a bitch ruined his life.

1416
01:22:29,429 --> 01:22:33,516
Then Biff just got very angry and
he was ready to enrol in summer school.

1417
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,976
- He was?
- He wasn't beaten by it at all.

1418
01:22:35,977 --> 01:22:38,812
But then, Willy, see...

1419
01:22:38,813 --> 01:22:40,439
What?

1420
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:43,233
He disappeared from the block
for almost a month.

1421
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:46,654
I got the idea that he'd gone
up to New England to see you.

1422
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:49,741
Did he ever talk with you then?

1423
01:22:49,824 --> 01:22:52,534
- Willy?
- Yeah.

1424
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:55,012
Yeah.

1425
01:22:56,122 --> 01:22:58,457
He came to Boston.
What about it?

1426
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:02,003
Well, it's just
that when he came back...

1427
01:23:04,422 --> 01:23:06,924
I'll never forget this.

1428
01:23:06,925 --> 01:23:10,303
It always mystifies me
because I thought so well of Biff.

1429
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:12,947
I loved him, Willy, you know.

1430
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:16,058
He came back after that month
and took his sneakers.

1431
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:20,605
Remember those sneakers with the
University of Virginia on them?

1432
01:23:20,688 --> 01:23:23,916
He was so proud of them.
Wore them every day.

1433
01:23:24,442 --> 01:23:27,987
He took them down into the cellar,
burned them up in the furnace.

1434
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:30,589
We had a fistfight.

1435
01:23:30,823 --> 01:23:33,659
It lasted at least half an hour,
just the two of us,

1436
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:37,830
punching each other down in the cellar,
crying right through it.

1437
01:23:37,914 --> 01:23:41,626
I often thought how strange it was
that I knew he'd given up his life.

1438
01:23:45,964 --> 01:23:48,691
What happened in Boston, Willy?

1439
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:52,512
I just bring it up because you asked me.

1440
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:54,680
What's that got to do with it?

1441
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:58,184
- Don't get sore.
- What are you trying to do, blame me?

1442
01:23:58,268 --> 01:24:00,894
If a boy lays down is that my fault?

1443
01:24:00,895 --> 01:24:04,023
- Don't take it...
- Don't you talk to me that way.

1444
01:24:04,107 --> 01:24:06,525
What does that mean,
huh, what happened?

1445
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:09,687
Hey!

1446
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:16,469
- You're gonna miss that train.
- Yeah, I'm going.

1447
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,434
Good-bye, Willy.

1448
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:29,190
- Don't worry about it. If at first you
don't succeed... - Yes, I believe in that.

1449
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:32,568
Sometimes, Willy, it's better for a man
just to walk away.

1450
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:35,070
- Walk away?
- That's right.

1451
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:37,881
What if you can't walk away?

1452
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:41,726
I guess that's when it's tough.

1453
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:44,805
Good-bye, Willy.

1454
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,585
Good-bye, boy.

1455
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:54,423
How do you like this kid?
Gonna argue a case in the Supreme Court.

1456
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:57,359
- Pop!
- No.

1457
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:00,303
- The Supreme Court?
- I gotta run.

1458
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:03,073
- Bye, Dad.
- Knock 'em dead, Bernard.

1459
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,855
The Supreme Court.

1460
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,898
And he didn't even mention it?

1461
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,960
He don't have to.
He's gonna do it.

1462
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:19,782
And you never told him what to do.
You never took any interest in him.

1463
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:23,077
My salvation is that I never
took any interest in anything.

1464
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:28,107
Here's some money, 50 dollars.
I got an accountant inside.

1465
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,435
Uh, Charley, look, uh...

1466
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:36,591
I got my insurance to pay.
If you could manage it, I...

1467
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:40,969
I need 110 dollars.

1468
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:44,056
- I'd draw from my bank, but...
- Sit down, Willy.

1469
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:46,683
I'm keeping an account of everything.

1470
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:49,269
- Listen to me.
- I'll pay every penny back.

1471
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:53,107
- I want you to know I appreciate...
- What's going on inside your head?

1472
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:55,817
- Why? I'm simply...
- I offered you a job.

1473
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:59,196
You can make 50 dollars a week
and I won't send you on the road.

1474
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,632
- I got a job.
- Without pay?

1475
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:05,636
What kind of a job is a job without pay?

1476
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,665
Now, look, kid. Enough is enough.

1477
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,502
I'm no genius, but I know
when I'm being insulted.

1478
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:16,129
- Insulted?
- Why don't you want to work for me?

1479
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,340
What does it matter with you?
I got a job.

1480
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:21,568
What do you walk in here every week for?

1481
01:26:25,056 --> 01:26:30,019
Well, if... if you don't
want me to walk in here...

1482
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:33,272
- I am offering you a job.
- I don't want your job.

1483
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:36,441
When the hell are you gonna grow up?

1484
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:40,487
You big ignoramus! If you say
that to me again I'll rap you one.

1485
01:26:40,488 --> 01:26:43,766
I don't care how big...
...how big you are.

1486
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:58,172
- How much do you need, Willy?
- Ah, Charley, I'm strapped.

1487
01:26:58,339 --> 01:27:02,209
I'm strapped. I don't know
what to do. I was just fired.

1488
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:06,238
- Howard fired you?
- That's not no...

1489
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,968
Imagine that. I named him Howard.
I named him! I named him Howard!

1490
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:16,273
Willy, when are you gonna realise
that them things don't mean anything?

1491
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:19,418
You named him Howard
but you can't sell that.

1492
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:22,571
The only thing you got in this
world is what you can sell.

1493
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:26,450
The funny thing is, you're a salesman
and you don't know that.

1494
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:30,037
I always try to think otherwise,
I guess. I always felt...

1495
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,334
...if a man was impressive
and well-liked then nothing...

1496
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:38,295
Why must everybody like you?
Who liked JP Morgan?

1497
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:41,841
Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath
he looked like a butcher.

1498
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:46,220
With his pockets on
he was very well-liked.

1499
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,438
Now, listen, Willy,
I know you don't like me.

1500
01:27:56,522 --> 01:27:59,692
And nobody can say I'm in love with you.

1501
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:04,864
But I'll give you a job
just for the hell of it.

1502
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:10,069
- What do you say?
- No. No, I just...

1503
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,829
No, I just can't work for you, Charley.

1504
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,831
- What are you, jealous of me?
- No!

1505
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:17,584
I can't work for you, that's all.
Don't ask me why.

1506
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:21,229
You've been jealous of me
all your life, you damn fool.

1507
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:25,567
Here.

1508
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,014
- Pay your insurance.
- I'm keeping strict accounts.

1509
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:35,068
I got some work to do. Take care
of yourself. And pay your insurance!

1510
01:28:41,659 --> 01:28:46,622
It's funny, after all the highways
and the trains and the appointments

1511
01:28:46,706 --> 01:28:49,099
and the years...

1512
01:28:51,085 --> 01:28:54,229
...you end up worth
more dead than alive.

1513
01:28:57,383 --> 01:29:00,594
Willy, nobody's worth nothing dead.

1514
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:08,076
You hear what I said?

1515
01:29:10,187 --> 01:29:12,289
Willy!

1516
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:17,178
Oh, apologise to Bernard for me
when you see him.

1517
01:29:17,361 --> 01:29:20,238
I didn't mean to argue with him.
He's a fine boy.

1518
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:26,120
They're all fine boys. And they'll
end up big, all of them someday.

1519
01:29:27,079 --> 01:29:29,205
They'll all play tennis together.

1520
01:29:29,206 --> 01:29:32,293
Wish me luck, Charley.
He saw Bill Oliver today.

1521
01:29:33,676 --> 01:29:36,196
Good luck.

1522
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:39,832
Oh, Charley,
you're the only friend I got.

1523
01:29:46,189 --> 01:29:49,392
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

1524
01:29:57,935 --> 01:29:59,911
Jesus.

1525
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:07,785
In the front
you're in the middle of noise.

1526
01:30:07,786 --> 01:30:11,482
Whenever you've got a party, Mr. Loman,
tell me, I'll put you back here.

1527
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:14,626
You look French.
How's it coming, Stanley?

1528
01:30:14,627 --> 01:30:18,923
It's a dog's life. I only wish that
during the war they took me in the Army.

1529
01:30:19,006 --> 01:30:21,967
- I could have been dead.
- You got lobsters?

1530
01:30:22,051 --> 01:30:26,312
- A hundred percent big. - With the claws.
- Don't worry, I don't give you no mice.

1531
01:30:26,513 --> 01:30:29,057
How about some wine?
Put a hat on the meal.

1532
01:30:29,058 --> 01:30:32,770
No, the recipe I brought you from
overseas with the champagne in it

1533
01:30:32,937 --> 01:30:36,565
I still got that in the kitchen,
but it'll cost you a buck a piece.

1534
01:30:36,649 --> 01:30:39,025
- That's all right.
- You hit a number?

1535
01:30:39,026 --> 01:30:41,527
My brother, I think
he pulled off a deal today.

1536
01:30:41,528 --> 01:30:45,324
- I think we're going into business.
- That's the best, family business.

1537
01:30:45,449 --> 01:30:47,659
- That's the best.
- That's what I think.

1538
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:51,038
What's the difference?
Somebody steals, it's in the family.

1539
01:30:51,121 --> 01:30:53,974
Shh. Strudel.

1540
01:30:54,792 --> 01:30:58,629
- Ma'am?
- I'm expecting someone.

1541
01:31:00,756 --> 01:31:05,344
Oh, look at that mouth. Oh, God,
and the binoculars. Wait on her.

1542
01:31:06,804 --> 01:31:09,305
- Would you like a menu?
- I'd like a...

1543
01:31:09,306 --> 01:31:11,599
Why don't you bring her...
Do you mind?

1544
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,437
I sell champagne and I'd like her
to try my brand. Bring her a champagne.

1545
01:31:15,521 --> 01:31:18,732
- That's awfully nice of you.
- It's all company money.

1546
01:31:18,816 --> 01:31:21,651
That's a charming product
to be selling, isn't it?

1547
01:31:21,652 --> 01:31:24,153
Like everything else,
selling is selling.

1548
01:31:24,154 --> 01:31:28,041
- I suppose? - You don't happen
to sell? - No, I don't sell.

1549
01:31:28,242 --> 01:31:31,620
Would you object to a compliment?
You ought to be on a magazine cover.

1550
01:31:31,904 --> 01:31:36,316
- I have been. -W hat did I say before?
See, Stanley, she's a cover girl.

1551
01:31:36,417 --> 01:31:39,210
- Oh, I could see, I could see.
- What magazine?

1552
01:31:39,211 --> 01:31:41,170
A lot of them.
Thank you.

1553
01:31:41,171 --> 01:31:43,256
You know what they say in France?

1554
01:31:43,257 --> 01:31:45,591
Champagne is the drink
of the complexion.

1555
01:31:45,592 --> 01:31:48,595
- Hiya, Biffo.
- Sorry I'm late.

1556
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:51,956
- No. No, no, I just got here.
Miss, um...? - Forsythe.

1557
01:31:52,057 --> 01:31:54,809
Miss Forsythe, this is my brother.

1558
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,170
Is Dad here?

1559
01:31:58,071 --> 01:32:01,616
You might have heard of him.
He's a great football player.

1560
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:04,661
- Really? What team?
- You're familiar with football?

1561
01:32:04,745 --> 01:32:07,622
- I'm afraid I'm not.
- Biff's with the New York Giants.

1562
01:32:07,706 --> 01:32:09,999
- Well, it is nice, isn't it?
- Good health.

1563
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,959
- Happy to meet you.
- That's my name.

1564
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,712
It's Harold, but at West Point
they called me Happy.

1565
01:32:14,713 --> 01:32:16,297
I see. How do you do?

1566
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:18,941
- Isn't Dad coming?
- You want her?

1567
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:24,138
- What? - You want her?
- I could never make that.

1568
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:27,768
I remember the time that idea
would never come into your head.

1569
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:31,571
- I just saw... - Wait, please. I've
got to see the old confidence.

1570
01:32:31,772 --> 01:32:35,150
If you want her she's on call.
I'm telling you, watch this.

1571
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:39,388
Honey, are you busy?

1572
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:42,223
Well, I am
but I could make a phone call.

1573
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:45,560
Go and do that, will you, honey,
and see if you can get a friend.

1574
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:49,439
We'll be here for awhile. Biff,
one of the greatest football players.

1575
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,401
- I'm certainly happy to meet you.
- Come back soon.

1576
01:32:52,684 --> 01:32:56,905
- I'll try.
- Don't try, honey. Try hard.

1577
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:02,202
Isn't that a shame?
Beautiful girl like that.

1578
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:05,121
- That's why I can't get married.
- Hap, look...

1579
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:07,206
- I told you she's on call.
- Cut it out.

1580
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:09,583
I want to say something.

1581
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,961
- Did you see Oliver?
- I saw him, all right.

1582
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:14,881
I want to tell Dad a couple of things.
I want you to help.

1583
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:18,093
- Is he gonna back you?
- Are you crazy?

1584
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,594
You're out of your head,
do you know that?

1585
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,971
Why, what happened?

1586
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,432
I did a terrible thing today, Hap.

1587
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:27,978
It's been the strangest day
I ever went through.

1588
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,646
- I'm a little numb.
- What, he wouldn't see you?

1589
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:34,700
I waited six hours for him, see.
All day I kept sending my name in.

1590
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:38,655
Even tried to date his secretary
so she got me through. Not so.

1591
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,117
You're not showing the confidence.
But he remembered you?

1592
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:46,830
Finally at 5:00 he comes out,
didn't remember who I was or anything.

1593
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:49,665
Biff, did you tell him my Florida idea?

1594
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:52,376
Hap, he walked away.

1595
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:56,256
I saw him and for one minute I got
so mad I could have torn the walls down.

1596
01:33:56,339 --> 01:34:00,177
How the hell did I ever get the idea
that I was a salesman there?

1597
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:03,053
I believed myself
that I'd been a salesman for him.

1598
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:07,767
Then he gave me one look and I realised
what a ridiculous lie my life's been.

1599
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:11,162
We have been talking in a dream
for 15 years.

1600
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:14,490
- I was a shipping clerk.
- What did you do?

1601
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:17,819
Well, he... he left, see.

1602
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:21,698
His secretary went out
and I was alone in the waiting room.

1603
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:26,536
And next thing I know,
I was in his office.

1604
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:30,415
Panel walls and everything.

1605
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:35,003
I can't explain it, Hap.
I took his fountain pen.

1606
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:37,171
Geez. Did he catch you?

1607
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:41,384
I ran out. I ran down all 11 flights.
I ran and ran and ran.

1608
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:44,178
Boy, that was dumb, Biff.
Why did you do that?

1609
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,971
I don't know.

1610
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:48,825
I just wanted to take something.

1611
01:34:51,645 --> 01:34:54,188
You gotta help me, Hap.
I want to tell Pop.

1612
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,249
Are you crazy? What for?

1613
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:03,448
He's gotta understand I'm not the man
somebody lends that kind of money to.

1614
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,283
He thinks I've been spiting him
all these years.

1615
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:09,496
Tell him something nice.
Say you got a date with Oliver tomorrow.

1616
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,666
- What do I do tomorrow?
- Dad is never so happy

1617
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:15,852
as when he's
looking forward to something.

1618
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:20,047
Gee, I haven't been here in years!

1619
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:22,926
- Sit down. You want a drink?
- Sure, I don't mind.

1620
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:25,094
- You look worried.
- No.

1621
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:27,429
Uh, Scotch all around.
Make it doubles.

1622
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:30,892
You had a couple already, didn't you?
Did everything go all right?

1623
01:35:30,976 --> 01:35:34,229
- I had an experience today, Pop.
- That so? What happened?

1624
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:37,064
I wanted to tell you everything
from first to last.

1625
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:39,942
It's been a strange day.
I had to wait quite a while.

1626
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,402
- Oliver?
- Yeah, Oliver.

1627
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:43,445
All day, as a matter of cold fact.

1628
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:48,493
And a lot of instances, Pop,
facts about my life came back to me.

1629
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:52,038
Who was it, Pop, whoever said
I was a salesman with Oliver?

1630
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:55,041
- Well, you were.
- No, I was a shipping clerk, Dad.

1631
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:58,294
I don't know who said it first
but I was never a salesman for Oliver.

1632
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:01,213
- What are you talking about?
- Hold onto the facts.

1633
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,549
I was a shipping clerk.

1634
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,592
- Listen to me...
- Dad, let me finish.

1635
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:08,220
I'm not interested in stories
about the past.

1636
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:10,013
The woods are burning, boys.

1637
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,725
There's a big blaze going on all around.

1638
01:36:12,726 --> 01:36:14,309
I was fired today.

1639
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,061
How could you be?

1640
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:20,275
And I'm looking for a little good news
to tell your mother

1641
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,735
- because the woman has suffered.
- Dad!

1642
01:36:22,736 --> 01:36:26,573
I haven't got a story left in my head
so don't give me a lecture about facts.

1643
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,784
I am not interested.
Now, what have you got to say to me?

1644
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:33,137
Did you see Oliver, huh?

1645
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,914
- Geez, Dad.
- You didn't go up there?

1646
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:39,127
- Sure, he went up there.
- I saw him. How could they fire you?

1647
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:42,839
- What kind of welcome did he give you?
- He won't let you work on commission?

1648
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,632
- I'm out! He gave you a warm welcome?
- Sure, Pop.

1649
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:49,262
I was wondering if he'd remember you.
A man doesn't see him in ten years,

1650
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:52,181
he gives him a welcome.
You know why he remembered?

1651
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:56,436
- You impressed him in those days.
- Dad, can we talk and get this down?

1652
01:36:56,519 --> 01:37:00,398
What happened? Did he take you in
his office or talk in the waiting room?

1653
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:03,192
- He came in...
- I bet he threw his arms around you.

1654
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:06,362
- He's a fine man, a hard man to see.
- Oh, I know that.

1655
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:08,739
- Is that where you had the drinks?
- Yeah.

1656
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,366
- He told him my Florida idea.
- Don't interrupt.

1657
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:14,621
- How'd he react to the Florida idea?
- Give me a minute to explain.

1658
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:18,750
I've been waiting for you to explain
since I sat down here. What happened?

1659
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:22,128
- I talked, he listened to me.
- Oh, the way he listens.

1660
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:24,630
- What was his answer?
- An... Answer...

1661
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:27,550
You're not letting me tell you
what I want to tell you.

1662
01:37:27,634 --> 01:37:29,259
- You didn't see him.
- I did.

1663
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,514
- You insult him or something?
- Dad! Will you let me out of it?

1664
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,224
- Will you just let me out of it?
- What happened?

1665
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:37,100
- I can't talk to him.
- Tell him.

1666
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:40,688
- Shut up and leave me alone.
- No, no. You had to go and flunk math.

1667
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:43,900
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- Math, math, math.

1668
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:47,445
- Take it easy, Pop.
- If you hadrt of flunked you'd be set.

1669
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:50,615
I'm gonna tell you what happened
and you're gonna listen to me.

1670
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:54,702
I waited six hours and I kept sending
my name in but he wouldn't see me.

1671
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:57,705
- Finally he came.
- Biff flunked mathl

1672
01:37:57,789 --> 01:38:00,457
- They won't graduate him.
- Where is he?

1673
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,542
He ran off.
He went to Grand Central.

1674
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,294
Is Uncle Willy in Boston?

1675
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:07,799
See, so I'm washed up with Oliver,
Pop, do you understand that?

1676
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:10,759
- Are you listening?
- If you hadrt have flunked...

1677
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,555
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- I didn't flunk math. What pen?

1678
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,474
- That was dumb, Biff.
- You took Oliver's pen.

1679
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:20,770
- I just explained it.
- You stole Bill Oliver's fountain pen.

1680
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:23,730
I didn't exactly steal it.
I was trying to tell you.

1681
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:26,734
He had it in his hand,
Oliver walked in, he got nervous.

1682
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:29,569
- My god, Biff.
- I never intended to do it...

1683
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:33,032
- I'm not in my room. I'm not there.
- Ringing Mr Loman.

1684
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:35,367
- Now, stop it.
- Mr Loman does not answer.

1685
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:37,286
- I'm not there.
- Shall I page him?

1686
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:40,080
- You're no good, no good for anything.
- I am, Dad.

1687
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,666
I'll find something.
Don't worry about anything.

1688
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,459
- Talk to me.
- Paging Mr Loman.

1689
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:47,045
- No! No!
- He'll strike something, Pop, please.

1690
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:49,673
- No!
- Dad, I'm telling you something good.

1691
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:53,219
Oliver talked to his partner
about the Florida idea.

1692
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,303
- You listening, Dad? Dad?
- Yeah.

1693
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:59,559
He talked to his partner and he came
to me and I'm gonna be all right, Pop.

1694
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,893
He said it's just a question
of the amount.

1695
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:05,523
- Then you... Then you got it?
- It's gonna be terrific, Pop.

1696
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:08,066
Aw, then you got it, haven't you?

1697
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:10,987
- You got it, haven't you? You got it!
- No.

1698
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,655
I'm supposed to have lunch
with him tomorrow.

1699
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,617
I'm telling you so you'll know
I can make an impression.

1700
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:20,079
I'll make good somewheres,
but I can't go tomorrow.

1701
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:22,289
- Why not? You simply...
- The pen, Pop.

1702
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:25,042
You give him the pen,
tell him it was an oversight.

1703
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:26,585
- You have lunch.
- I can't.

1704
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,337
You were doing a crossword puzzle,
you used his pen.

1705
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:33,259
No, listen, kid,
I took those balls years ago, Pop,

1706
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:36,387
and now I walk in with this fountain pen
that clinches it.

1707
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:39,599
Don't you understand? I can't face him.
I'll try elsewhere.

1708
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:42,602
- Don't you want to be anything?
- How can I go back?

1709
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,019
Pop!

1710
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,730
You don't want to be anything,
that what's behind it?

1711
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:50,359
Don't take it that way! You think
it was easy walking into that office?

1712
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:53,488
A team of horses couldn't
have dragged me to Oliver.

1713
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:56,448
- Then why did you go?
- Why did I go?

1714
01:39:56,449 --> 01:40:00,286
Why did I go? Dad, look at you.
Look at what's become of you.

1715
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:04,248
- You're gonna go to that lunch.
- I can't. I've got no appointment.

1716
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:06,750
- Are you spiting me?
- Don't take it that way!

1717
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:09,629
You rotten little louse.
Are you spiting me?

1718
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:13,174
Dad. I'm no good.
Can't you see what I am?

1719
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:16,344
You're in a restaurant.
Cut it out, both of you!

1720
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:19,639
- Someone's at the door.
- Hello, girls. Sit down.

1721
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:21,932
Yes, we might as well.
This is Letta.

1722
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:24,769
- What do you drink?
- Letta might not be able to stay.

1723
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:29,022
I gotta get up very early
tomorrow. I've got jury duty.

1724
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:32,109
I'm so excited.
Were you fellas ever on a jury?

1725
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:35,587
No, I've been in front of a jury.

1726
01:40:37,506 --> 01:40:41,218
- This is my father.
- Isn't he cute. Sit down with us, Pops.

1727
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,553
- Biff, sit him down.
- Come on, sit down.

1728
01:40:43,554 --> 01:40:47,016
- Drink us under the table.
- Willy, are you coming?

1729
01:40:47,099 --> 01:40:49,517
Willy, I'm waiting.

1730
01:40:49,518 --> 01:40:51,728
- Where are you going?
- To open the door.

1731
01:40:51,729 --> 01:40:54,481
- What door?
- The washroom. Where is the door?

1732
01:40:54,482 --> 01:40:57,417
Just go straight down.

1733
01:40:58,110 --> 01:41:01,530
Will you stop laughing. Stop. Shh.

1734
01:41:01,614 --> 01:41:04,282
Will you stop!

1735
01:41:04,283 --> 01:41:06,385
Shh!

1736
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:08,328
Will you stop!

1737
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:10,914
I think it's sweet you bring your daddy.

1738
01:41:10,915 --> 01:41:13,041
Oh, he isn't really your father.

1739
01:41:13,042 --> 01:41:16,170
Miss Forsythe, you've just seen
a prince walk by.

1740
01:41:16,353 --> 01:41:20,448
A fine troubled prince. A
hard-working, unappreciated prince.

1741
01:41:20,549 --> 01:41:23,051
A pal, do you understand,
a good companion.

1742
01:41:23,052 --> 01:41:25,904
Always for his boys.

1743
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:31,018
- That's so sweet.
- Girls, we're wasting time here.

1744
01:41:31,102 --> 01:41:33,686
What's the programme?
Biff, gather round now.

1745
01:41:33,687 --> 01:41:35,480
Where would you like to go?

1746
01:41:35,481 --> 01:41:38,125
- You do something for me?
- Me?

1747
01:41:38,818 --> 01:41:42,029
- Don't you give a damn for him?
- What are you talking about?

1748
01:41:42,113 --> 01:41:44,864
- I'm the one...
- You don't give a damn about him.

1749
01:41:44,865 --> 01:41:47,968
Look what I found in the cellar, Hap.

1750
01:41:47,993 --> 01:41:51,664
- How can you bear to let that go on?
- Me? Who goes off? Who runs away?

1751
01:41:51,747 --> 01:41:55,084
He doesn't mean anything to you.
You could help him, I can't.

1752
01:41:55,167 --> 01:41:59,088
Don't you understand what he's gonna do?
He's gonna kill himself.

1753
01:41:59,171 --> 01:42:01,423
- Don't you know that?
- Don't yell at me.

1754
01:42:01,424 --> 01:42:03,508
Hap, help him.

1755
01:42:03,509 --> 01:42:06,804
Help him!
Help me.

1756
01:42:06,929 --> 01:42:08,972
Help me!

1757
01:42:08,973 --> 01:42:12,200
I can't bear to look in his face.

1758
01:42:14,145 --> 01:42:15,854
Biff...

1759
01:42:15,855 --> 01:42:18,606
- Biff, where you going?
- What's he so mad about?

1760
01:42:18,607 --> 01:42:20,358
We're gonna catch up with him.

1761
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:23,194
- I don't like that temper of his.
- He's overstrung.

1762
01:42:23,195 --> 01:42:26,490
- Do you want to tell your father?
- That's not my father, just a guy.

1763
01:42:26,574 --> 01:42:30,786
Come on, we're gonna catch up with Biff
and honey, we'll paint this town.

1764
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:34,331
I love those bedroom eyes.

1765
01:42:34,415 --> 01:42:39,879
- That's how I knew you were friends.
- Mr Loman! Mr Loman! Mr Loman!

1766
01:42:39,962 --> 01:42:42,965
Hey! Mr Loman!

1767
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:45,258
- Willyl
- What?

1768
01:42:45,259 --> 01:42:47,468
Oh.

1769
01:42:47,469 --> 01:42:49,345
No.

1770
01:42:49,346 --> 01:42:53,100
Willy, aren't you gonna answer the door?

1771
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:55,243
Willy...

1772
01:42:57,187 --> 01:42:59,022
Willyl

1773
01:42:59,023 --> 01:43:02,125
- Arert you gonna answer the door?
- Sure.

1774
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:07,864
Oh.

1775
01:43:07,865 --> 01:43:12,194
Someone's at the door, Willy.
Are you gonna answer the door?

1776
01:43:12,578 --> 01:43:15,497
He's gonna wake up the whole hotell

1777
01:43:16,733 --> 01:43:19,434
I'm not expecting anybody.

1778
01:43:19,835 --> 01:43:22,755
Why don't you have another drink, honey?

1779
01:43:22,838 --> 01:43:26,133
- Stop being so damn self-centred.
- I'm so Ionely.

1780
01:43:26,216 --> 01:43:29,878
You know you ruined me, Willy. From
now on, when you come to the office,

1781
01:43:29,979 --> 01:43:32,555
I'll see you
go right through the buyers.

1782
01:43:32,556 --> 01:43:35,391
No waiting at my desk anymore.
Willy, you ruined me.

1783
01:43:35,392 --> 01:43:37,685
Oh, that's nice of you to say that.

1784
01:43:37,686 --> 01:43:40,063
Oh, gee, you're self-centred.

1785
01:43:40,064 --> 01:43:42,106
Why so sad?

1786
01:43:42,107 --> 01:43:45,653
You're the saddest, self-centredest soul
I ever did see-saw.

1787
01:43:45,778 --> 01:43:48,781
Oh, boy, huh? What?

1788
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:54,803
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1789
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,432
Oh, to be dressing
in the middle of the night.

1790
01:44:03,087 --> 01:44:05,004
Arert you gonna answer the door?

1791
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:07,925
They're knocking on the wrong door.

1792
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:10,593
But they're knocking
and hear us talking.

1793
01:44:10,594 --> 01:44:13,096
- Maybe the hotel's on fire.
- It's a mistake.

1794
01:44:13,097 --> 01:44:15,723
- Tell them to go away.
- There's nobody there.

1795
01:44:15,724 --> 01:44:17,600
Willy!

1796
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:22,147
There's somebody standing out there
and it's getting on my nerves.

1797
01:44:22,231 --> 01:44:25,401
All right. Stay in the bathroom
and don't come out.

1798
01:44:25,484 --> 01:44:28,737
There's a law in Massachusetts,
so don't come out.

1799
01:44:28,821 --> 01:44:32,825
It may be the new room clerk.
He looked mean. It's a mistake.

1800
01:44:32,908 --> 01:44:35,994
There's no fire.

1801
01:44:36,078 --> 01:44:39,623
- Dad. Why didn't you answer?
- Biff.

1802
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:42,626
- What are you doing in Boston?
- Why didn't you answer?

1803
01:44:42,751 --> 01:44:45,503
I was knocking for five minutes.
I called you.

1804
01:44:45,504 --> 01:44:48,632
I just heard you. I was in the bathroom
and had the door shut.

1805
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:51,175
Did anything happen at home, huh?

1806
01:44:51,176 --> 01:44:53,761
- Dad, I let you down.
- Excuse me?

1807
01:44:53,762 --> 01:44:56,932
Biffo, what's this about?
Come on, let's go get you a malt.

1808
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,893
Dad, I...

1809
01:44:59,977 --> 01:45:04,505
- I flunked math. - Not for the term? -
I haven't got enough credits to graduate.

1810
01:45:04,606 --> 01:45:08,610
- Bernard wouldn't give you the answers?
- He did. He tried. I only got a 61.

1811
01:45:08,694 --> 01:45:12,364
They wouldn't give you four points?
Birnbaum refused absolutely.

1812
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:15,325
I begged him to give me those points
but he won't listen.

1813
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:18,370
You gotta talk to him.
Dad, before they close the school.

1814
01:45:18,454 --> 01:45:22,249
'Cause if he saw the kind of man you are
and you talked to him in your way,

1815
01:45:22,374 --> 01:45:24,959
I'm sure he'd come through for me, Pop.

1816
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,505
The class came right before practice,
so I didn't go enough.

1817
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:31,800
Would you talk to him?
He'd like you, the way you can talk.

1818
01:45:31,884 --> 01:45:34,635
- I'm gonna drive right back.
- Dad, good work.

1819
01:45:34,636 --> 01:45:37,723
- I'm sure he'll change it.
- Tell the clerk I'm checking out.

1820
01:45:37,806 --> 01:45:40,558
Go right down.

1821
01:45:40,559 --> 01:45:43,812
The reason he hates me
is one day he was late for class,

1822
01:45:43,896 --> 01:45:46,522
so I got up at the blackboard
and imitated him.

1823
01:45:46,523 --> 01:45:49,233
- Crossed my eyes, talked with a lisp.
- You did?

1824
01:45:49,234 --> 01:45:51,319
- Yeah.
- The kids like it?

1825
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:54,489
- They nearly died laughing.
- Yeah, what did you do?

1826
01:45:54,573 --> 01:45:59,119
The square root of 63 is...

1827
01:45:59,203 --> 01:46:01,037
In the middle of it he walks in.

1828
01:46:01,038 --> 01:46:04,541
He walked in! All right.

1829
01:46:06,877 --> 01:46:09,295
- Is somebody in there?
- That was next door.

1830
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:13,300
- Somebody got in your bathroom.
- In the next room there's a party.

1831
01:46:13,383 --> 01:46:16,135
Can I come in?

1832
01:46:16,136 --> 01:46:19,556
There's something in the bathtub, Willy,
and it's moving.

1833
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:44,498
Uh, you better go back to your room now.

1834
01:46:44,581 --> 01:46:48,210
They must be finished painting by now.

1835
01:46:48,293 --> 01:46:51,588
See, they're painting her room,
so I let her shower here.

1836
01:46:51,672 --> 01:46:53,923
- Go back.
- I gotta get dressed, Willy.

1837
01:46:53,924 --> 01:46:57,511
You get out of here.
This is Miss Francis. She's a buyer.

1838
01:46:57,594 --> 01:47:00,388
She lives down the hall
and they're painting her...

1839
01:47:00,389 --> 01:47:02,682
- Go back, go back!
- My clothes, Willy!

1840
01:47:02,683 --> 01:47:05,184
- I can't go naked.
- Will you get out of here.

1841
01:47:05,185 --> 01:47:08,063
Where's my stockings?
You promised me stockings.

1842
01:47:08,146 --> 01:47:11,525
- I have no stockings.
- You had 2 boxes of sheers. I want 'em.

1843
01:47:11,608 --> 01:47:13,484
Yeah, here, here, here.

1844
01:47:13,485 --> 01:47:15,878
Here.

1845
01:47:16,196 --> 01:47:18,739
For God's sake, now get out of here.

1846
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:22,327
I just hope there's nobody in the hall,
that's all I hope.

1847
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,684
You, uh, football or baseball?

1848
01:47:30,711 --> 01:47:32,503
Football.

1849
01:47:32,504 --> 01:47:34,981
That's me, too.

1850
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:37,817
Good night.

1851
01:47:43,932 --> 01:47:46,100
Well, better get going.

1852
01:47:46,101 --> 01:47:49,020
I want to get to the school
first thing in the morning.

1853
01:47:49,104 --> 01:47:53,608
So, get my suits out of the closet
and I'll get my valise.

1854
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:00,239
What's the matter?

1855
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,450
She's a buyer, Biff.
She buys for...

1856
01:48:02,451 --> 01:48:05,244
She lives down the hall.

1857
01:48:05,245 --> 01:48:08,582
She buys for J.H. Simmons
and you know, they're painting...

1858
01:48:11,835 --> 01:48:14,854
Oh, now, you don't imagine that I...

1859
01:48:17,174 --> 01:48:19,216
Now, look, pal, she's just a buyer!

1860
01:48:19,217 --> 01:48:23,472
She sees merchandise in her room and
they have to keep it looking just so.

1861
01:48:23,555 --> 01:48:26,850
- Come on, now, get my suits.
- No.

1862
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:31,521
You stop crying and do as I say.
I gave you an order, Biff.

1863
01:48:32,856 --> 01:48:35,625
Biff, I gave you an order.

1864
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:39,069
Is that what you do
when I give you an order?

1865
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:41,214
Is it?

1866
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:44,258
Then how dare you cry!

1867
01:48:52,542 --> 01:48:54,727
Oh, now.

1868
01:49:00,342 --> 01:49:03,887
Look, Biff, when you grow up
you'll understand about these things.

1869
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:07,474
No, you mustrt overemphasise
a thing like this.

1870
01:49:07,557 --> 01:49:10,518
Come on, III see Birnbaum
first thing in the morning.

1871
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:12,519
- Never mind.
- Never mind?

1872
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:15,189
He's gonna give you those points.
I'll see to it.

1873
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:17,733
- He won't listen to you.
- He certainly will!

1874
01:49:17,734 --> 01:49:19,568
You need those for the U of Virginia.

1875
01:49:19,569 --> 01:49:22,972
- I'm not going there.
- What? - I'm not going there.

1876
01:49:23,073 --> 01:49:26,910
If I can't get him to change that mark
you'll make it up in summer school.

1877
01:49:26,993 --> 01:49:29,887
- You got all summer to...
- Dad.

1878
01:49:35,543 --> 01:49:38,104
My... my boy.

1879
01:49:40,298 --> 01:49:44,970
She's nothing to me, Biff.
I was Ionely. I was terribly Ionely.

1880
01:49:45,053 --> 01:49:47,388
Dad, you gave her Mama's stockings.

1881
01:49:47,389 --> 01:49:49,682
I gave you an order!

1882
01:49:49,683 --> 01:49:52,142
- I gave...
- Don't touch me, you liar!

1883
01:49:52,143 --> 01:49:55,105
- You apologise for that.
- You fake!

1884
01:49:55,188 --> 01:49:58,149
I gave you an order!
I gave you an order!

1885
01:49:58,233 --> 01:50:01,361
- Now, you come back here.
- You phoney little fake.

1886
01:50:01,444 --> 01:50:03,112
- Come back here!
- You fake!

1887
01:50:03,113 --> 01:50:06,658
I gave you an order!
Come back or I'll beat you. I'II...

1888
01:50:06,741 --> 01:50:09,218
- Hey.
- I'll whip you.

1889
01:50:11,079 --> 01:50:12,746
I gave you...

1890
01:50:12,747 --> 01:50:14,373
Pick it up, Mr Loman.

1891
01:50:14,374 --> 01:50:17,210
Your boys just left with the chippies.

1892
01:50:18,461 --> 01:50:20,212
They said they'd see you home.

1893
01:50:20,213 --> 01:50:22,715
We were supposed
to have dinner together.

1894
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:25,976
- Can you make it?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, I'll make it.

1895
01:50:26,177 --> 01:50:29,155
- Mr Loman.
- OK.

1896
01:50:30,056 --> 01:50:32,533
I'll make it.

1897
01:50:34,477 --> 01:50:39,040
- I look all right.
- Sure, you look all right.

1898
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:42,110
Uh... Uh...

1899
01:50:42,986 --> 01:50:45,821
Here. Here. Here's a dollar.

1900
01:50:45,822 --> 01:50:48,699
- Your son paid. It's all right.
- You're a good boy.

1901
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:51,911
- You don't have to.
- Here's more. I don't need it anymore.

1902
01:50:51,995 --> 01:50:55,874
Tell me, is there a seed store
in the neighbourhood?

1903
01:50:55,957 --> 01:50:58,259
Seeds?

1904
01:50:58,626 --> 01:51:02,589
- You mean, like to plant?
- Yes, like carrots, peas.

1905
01:51:02,672 --> 01:51:05,048
There's a hardware store
on Sixth Avenue.

1906
01:51:05,049 --> 01:51:07,969
- It may be too late now.
- I better hurry.

1907
01:51:08,052 --> 01:51:12,307
I gotta get some seeds.
Gotta get some seeds right away.

1908
01:51:12,532 --> 01:51:15,634
Well, what are you looking at?

1909
01:51:18,955 --> 01:51:20,914
Nothing is planted right.

1910
01:51:20,915 --> 01:51:23,934
I don't have a thing
in the ground right now.

1911
01:51:46,316 --> 01:51:50,327
"Carrots.
Quarter inch apart,

1912
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:53,297
one foot rows..."

1913
01:51:53,615 --> 01:51:55,841
One foot.

1914
01:51:56,367 --> 01:51:58,344
Beets.

1915
01:51:59,537 --> 01:52:02,648
Lettuce.
One foot.

1916
01:52:02,749 --> 01:52:05,208
Oh, what a proposition.

1917
01:52:05,209 --> 01:52:08,421
Terrific, terrific,
'cause she's suffered, man.

1918
01:52:08,546 --> 01:52:10,773
The woman has suffered.

1919
01:52:11,215 --> 01:52:13,342
A man can't go out the way he came in.

1920
01:52:13,343 --> 01:52:16,429
A man has got to add up to something.
You can't...

1921
01:52:16,512 --> 01:52:18,764
You can't. You gotta consider now.

1922
01:52:18,765 --> 01:52:20,640
Don't answer so quick.

1923
01:52:20,641 --> 01:52:26,189
Remember, it's a guaranteed
$20,000 proposition, huh?

1924
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:31,152
Now, look, Ben, I want you to go through
the ins and outs of this thing with me.

1925
01:52:31,277 --> 01:52:35,956
I got nobody to talk to. And the
woman has suffered, you hear me?

1926
01:52:36,157 --> 01:52:40,745
- What's the proposition? - It's $20,000
on the barrel head, guaranteed.

1927
01:52:40,828 --> 01:52:42,537
Gilt edge, you understand?

1928
01:52:42,538 --> 01:52:44,790
You don't want
to make a fool of yourself.

1929
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:48,419
- They might not honour the policy.
- How can they refuse? I worked.

1930
01:52:48,503 --> 01:52:52,131
I met every premium on the nose
and now they don't pay off? Impossible.

1931
01:52:52,215 --> 01:52:54,049
It's called a cowardly thing.

1932
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:58,137
Why does it take more guts to stand here
the rest of my life ringing up a zero?

1933
01:52:58,221 --> 01:52:59,805
That's a point, William.

1934
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:03,768
And 20,000. That is something
one can feel with their hands.

1935
01:53:03,893 --> 01:53:06,269
That's the whole beauty of it, Ben.

1936
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:09,232
I see it like a diamond
shining in the dark

1937
01:53:09,315 --> 01:53:12,067
that I can pick up and touch in my hand.

1938
01:53:12,068 --> 01:53:15,613
Not like an appointment.

1939
01:53:15,738 --> 01:53:19,700
This would not be another appointment
and it changes all the aspects.

1940
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:22,954
Because he thinks I'm nothing,
so he spites me.

1941
01:53:23,037 --> 01:53:28,084
But the funeral.
Oh, Ben, that funeral will be massive!

1942
01:53:28,167 --> 01:53:31,629
Oh, they'll come
from Maine, Massachusetts,

1943
01:53:31,712 --> 01:53:34,732
Vermont, New Hampshire.

1944
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:38,970
All the old-timers
with the strange licence plates.

1945
01:53:39,053 --> 01:53:41,388
That boy will be thunderstruck, Ben,

1946
01:53:41,389 --> 01:53:44,308
because he never realised I am known.

1947
01:53:44,392 --> 01:53:47,937
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,
I am known, Ben!

1948
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:50,730
He'll see it with his eyes!

1949
01:53:50,731 --> 01:53:54,068
Once and for all,
he'll see what I am, oh!

1950
01:53:55,319 --> 01:53:57,671
He's in for a shock, that boy.

1951
01:53:57,947 --> 01:54:01,284
He'll call you a coward, William.

1952
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:05,287
Oh, no, no, that would be terrible.

1953
01:54:05,288 --> 01:54:09,341
- Yes, and a damn fool.
- No, no!

1954
01:54:09,542 --> 01:54:12,269
He'll hate you, William.

1955
01:54:12,587 --> 01:54:15,772
He mustn't. Oh, I won't have that.

1956
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:42,382
Mom, what are you doing up?

1957
01:54:43,534 --> 01:54:46,345
Where's Pop? Is he sleeping?

1958
01:54:48,623 --> 01:54:51,499
- Where were you?
- We met two girls, very fine types.

1959
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:54,294
We brought you some flowers.
Put 'em in your room.

1960
01:54:54,295 --> 01:54:57,088
What did you do that for?
I want you to have flowers.

1961
01:54:57,089 --> 01:55:00,008
Don't you care whether he lives or dies?

1962
01:55:00,009 --> 01:55:02,653
- Biff, let's go up.
- Go away from me.

1963
01:55:03,763 --> 01:55:07,350
What do you mean, lives or dies?
Nobody's dying around here, pal.

1964
01:55:07,433 --> 01:55:10,853
Get out of here!
Get out of my sight!

1965
01:55:10,936 --> 01:55:12,771
I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

1966
01:55:12,772 --> 01:55:15,624
- You're not going near him.
- Where is he?

1967
01:55:16,275 --> 01:55:19,362
You invite him for dinner,
he looks forward to it all day.

1968
01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:22,364
- And then you desert him there?
- Dad?

1969
01:55:22,365 --> 01:55:24,741
There's no stranger you'd do that to.

1970
01:55:24,742 --> 01:55:27,953
He had a swell time with us.
When I desert him I hope I do it...

1971
01:55:28,037 --> 01:55:30,764
- Get out of here!
- Ma!

1972
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:36,336
- Mom?
- Did you have to go to women tonight?

1973
01:55:36,337 --> 01:55:39,423
You and your rotten, lousy whores!

1974
01:55:39,507 --> 01:55:43,094
Mom, all we did was follow Biff around
trying to cheer him up.

1975
01:55:43,177 --> 01:55:45,970
- Boy, what a night you gave me.
- Get out of here.

1976
01:55:45,971 --> 01:55:49,183
Both of you, and don't come back.
I don't want you tormenting him anymore.

1977
01:55:49,266 --> 01:55:52,978
- Dad, are you down there?
- You can sleep in his apartment.

1978
01:55:57,024 --> 01:56:00,653
And pick up this stuff!
I'm not your maid anymore.

1979
01:56:00,778 --> 01:56:03,656
Go on, pick it up, you bum, you!

1980
01:56:03,781 --> 01:56:05,949
You're a pair of animals.

1981
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:09,370
There's not one, not a living soul,
who would have the cruelty

1982
01:56:09,453 --> 01:56:12,247
to walk out on that man
in a restaurant.

1983
01:56:12,248 --> 01:56:15,251
- Is that what he said?
- He didn't have to say anything.

1984
01:56:15,334 --> 01:56:19,505
He was so humiliated,
he nearly limped when he came in.

1985
01:56:19,588 --> 01:56:22,733
- Look, Mom, he had a great time.
- Shut up!

1986
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:30,265
You! Didn't even go to
see if he was all right.

1987
01:56:30,266 --> 01:56:34,019
No, Mom, I didn't. I didn't do
a damn thing. How do you like that?

1988
01:56:34,103 --> 01:56:36,996
I left him babbling in a toilet.

1989
01:56:37,148 --> 01:56:40,734
- You louse, you.
- You hit it on the nose.

1990
01:56:40,818 --> 01:56:43,361
The scum of the earth.
You're looking at him.

1991
01:56:43,362 --> 01:56:47,116
- Get out of here.
- I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

1992
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:49,242
You're not going near him. Get out.

1993
01:56:49,243 --> 01:56:52,121
We're gonna have
an abrupt conversation, him and me.

1994
01:56:52,204 --> 01:56:55,474
You're not talking to him.

1995
01:57:05,217 --> 01:57:08,429
Please, leave him alone.

1996
01:57:08,512 --> 01:57:11,490
What is he doing out there?

1997
01:57:13,058 --> 01:57:16,145
He's planting the garden.

1998
01:57:17,146 --> 01:57:18,955
Now?

1999
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:22,609
Oh, my god.

2000
01:57:22,610 --> 01:57:27,114
Never even let me carry
the valises in the house.

2001
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:30,451
And simonising, simonising...

2002
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:33,369
...that little red car.

2003
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:35,514
Why?

2004
01:57:36,206 --> 01:57:41,295
Why can't I give him something
and not have him hate me, huh?

2005
01:57:41,378 --> 01:57:44,298
Let me think about it.
I still have a little time.

2006
01:57:44,381 --> 01:57:46,841
A remarkable proposition.

2007
01:57:46,842 --> 01:57:48,217
Oh.

2008
01:57:48,218 --> 01:57:51,180
You gotta be sure
you're not making a fool of yourself.

2009
01:57:51,263 --> 01:57:53,490
Dad?

2010
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:03,192
Where is that seed?
You can't see nothing here, boxed in.

2011
01:58:03,275 --> 01:58:05,276
Dad, there are people all around.

2012
01:58:05,277 --> 01:58:08,004
- Don't you realise?
- Don't bother me.

2013
01:58:14,787 --> 01:58:18,123
- I'm saying good-bye to you, Pop.
- Huh?

2014
01:58:18,248 --> 01:58:20,708
I'm not coming back anymore.

2015
01:58:20,709 --> 01:58:24,129
- You're not gonna see Oliver?
- Dad, I've got no appointment.

2016
01:58:24,213 --> 01:58:26,798
- He put his arm around you.
- Dad, get this now.

2017
01:58:26,799 --> 01:58:29,885
Every time I've left
it's been a fight that's sent me out.

2018
01:58:29,968 --> 01:58:34,831
Today I realise something about
myself. I tried to explain it to you.

2019
01:58:34,932 --> 01:58:39,228
I think I'm just not smart enough
to make sense out of it for you.

2020
01:58:39,353 --> 01:58:42,272
To hell with whose fault it is
or anything like that.

2021
01:58:43,691 --> 01:58:45,942
Let's just wrap it up.

2022
01:58:45,943 --> 01:58:48,736
- Come in and we'll tell Mom.
- I don't want to see her.

2023
01:58:48,737 --> 01:58:50,571
- Come on.
- I don't want to see her.

2024
01:58:50,572 --> 01:58:53,116
Don't bother me, will ya?

2025
01:58:53,117 --> 01:58:55,743
Dad, what do you mean?
You don't want to see her?

2026
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:59,373
Pop, you don't want them
calling you yellow, do you?

2027
01:58:59,456 --> 01:59:03,585
Dad, it's not your fault.
It's me. I'm a bum.

2028
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:06,146
Now, come on inside.

2029
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,233
Dad, did you hear what I said to you?

2030
01:59:16,723 --> 01:59:18,992
Did you plant, dear?

2031
01:59:20,436 --> 01:59:23,038
All right, Mom.

2032
01:59:24,189 --> 01:59:27,443
We had it out.
I'm going and I'm not writing anymore.

2033
01:59:27,526 --> 01:59:29,485
I think it's best, Willy.

2034
01:59:29,486 --> 01:59:32,573
There's no use drawing it out.
You two will never get along.

2035
01:59:32,656 --> 01:59:35,617
If people ask where I am,
what I'm doing, you don't know or care.

2036
01:59:35,701 --> 01:59:39,830
That way it'll be off your mind
and you can start brightening up again.

2037
01:59:39,913 --> 01:59:42,474
All right?

2038
01:59:48,213 --> 01:59:51,024
That... That clears it, then, huh?

2039
02:00:07,024 --> 02:00:11,069
- You gonna wish me luck, scout?
- Shake his hand, Willy.

2040
02:00:11,153 --> 02:00:13,404
What do you say?

2041
02:00:13,405 --> 02:00:16,825
There's no necessity to mention...
He put his arm...!

2042
02:00:16,909 --> 02:00:20,621
Dad, you're never gonna see what I am,
so what's the use of arguing?

2043
02:00:20,704 --> 02:00:24,166
If I strike oil I'll send you a cheque.
Meantime, forget I'm alive.

2044
02:00:24,249 --> 02:00:26,250
Spite, see?

2045
02:00:26,251 --> 02:00:29,562
- Shake hands, Dad.
- Not my hand.

2046
02:00:34,218 --> 02:00:36,277
Dad?

2047
02:00:36,678 --> 02:00:40,641
- I was hoping not to go this way.
- This is the way you're going. Bye.

2048
02:00:44,394 --> 02:00:48,231
May you rot in hell
if you leave this house!

2049
02:00:48,315 --> 02:00:50,942
Exactly what is it
that you want from me?

2050
02:00:50,943 --> 02:00:54,780
I want you to know on the train,
in the mountains, in the valleys,

2051
02:00:54,863 --> 02:00:58,367
wherever you go,
that you cut down your life for spite!

2052
02:00:58,450 --> 02:01:01,594
- No, no!
- Spite!

2053
02:01:06,458 --> 02:01:10,504
When you are rotting somewhere
beside a railroad track, remember.

2054
02:01:10,587 --> 02:01:13,422
- Don't you blame it on me.
- I'm not blaming you.

2055
02:01:13,423 --> 02:01:15,967
I'm not taking the rap for this, hear?

2056
02:01:15,968 --> 02:01:19,054
- That's what I'm telling you.
- You're putting a knife in me.

2057
02:01:19,137 --> 02:01:21,889
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

2058
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:24,600
All right, phoney.
Leave it there. Don't move it.

2059
02:01:24,601 --> 02:01:26,811
- What is that?
- You know damn well.

2060
02:01:26,812 --> 02:01:29,146
- I never saw that.
- You saw it, all right.

2061
02:01:29,147 --> 02:01:32,943
Mice didn't bring it into the cellar.
Is that supposed to make you a hero?

2062
02:01:33,026 --> 02:01:36,488
That supposed to make me sorry for you?
There will be no pity for you.

2063
02:01:36,571 --> 02:01:38,572
- Hear that? No pity.
- Hear the spite?

2064
02:01:38,573 --> 02:01:41,158
You're gonna get the truth,
what you are, what I am.

2065
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:42,868
- Spite!
- Cut it out!

2066
02:01:42,869 --> 02:01:45,831
The man don't know who we are.
The man is gonna know.

2067
02:01:46,707 --> 02:01:49,626
We never told the truth
for ten minutes in this house.

2068
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:52,586
- We always told truth.
- Are you the assistant buyer?

2069
02:01:52,587 --> 02:01:55,297
You're one of
the two assistants to the assistant.

2070
02:01:55,298 --> 02:01:57,967
- I'm practically...
- You are practically full of it.

2071
02:01:57,968 --> 02:02:00,261
- We all are. I'm through with it.
- Yeah.

2072
02:02:00,262 --> 02:02:03,197
- Hear this, Willy. This is me.
- I know you.

2073
02:02:03,432 --> 02:02:06,308
Do you know why I had no
address for three months?

2074
02:02:06,309 --> 02:02:09,019
I stole a suit in Kansas City
and I was in gaol.

2075
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:12,357
- I suppose it's my fault.
- Stop crying, I'm through with it!

2076
02:02:12,441 --> 02:02:15,569
I stole myself
out of every good job since high school.

2077
02:02:15,652 --> 02:02:17,069
Whose fault is that?

2078
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:20,407
I could never get anywhere
'cause you blew me so full of hot air

2079
02:02:20,532 --> 02:02:23,367
that I could never stand
taking orders from anybody.

2080
02:02:23,368 --> 02:02:25,661
- I hear that.
- Stop it!

2081
02:02:25,662 --> 02:02:28,498
I had to be boss big shot
in two weeks and I'm through.

2082
02:02:28,582 --> 02:02:31,000
- Then hang yourself for spite!
- No! No!

2083
02:02:31,001 --> 02:02:34,796
No, nobody is hanging himself, Willy.

2084
02:02:37,924 --> 02:02:42,471
I ran down 11 flights with a pen
in my hand today.

2085
02:02:42,554 --> 02:02:44,889
And suddenly I stopped.
Do you hear me?

2086
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:48,226
In the middle of that office building...
Do you hear this?

2087
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:50,436
I stopped...

2088
02:02:50,437 --> 02:02:54,483
...in the middle of the building
and I saw the sky!

2089
02:02:54,566 --> 02:03:00,447
And I... I... I saw the things
that I love in this world.

2090
02:03:00,572 --> 02:03:04,017
The work and the food

2091
02:03:04,201 --> 02:03:07,037
and the time to sit and smoke.

2092
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:11,458
I looked at that pen in my hand and
I said, "What am I grabbing this for?

2093
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:14,251
Why am I trying to become
what I don't want to be?

2094
02:03:14,252 --> 02:03:15,920
What am I doing in an office?

2095
02:03:15,921 --> 02:03:19,049
Making a contemptuous begging
fool of myself,

2096
02:03:19,132 --> 02:03:21,884
when all that I want
is out there waiting for me?"

2097
02:03:21,885 --> 02:03:25,222
The minute I say it, I know who I am.
Why can't I say that, Willy?

2098
02:03:25,305 --> 02:03:27,306
The door to your life is wide open!

2099
02:03:27,307 --> 02:03:29,808
Pop, I am a dime a dozen and so are you.

2100
02:03:29,809 --> 02:03:32,436
I am not a dime a dozen!

2101
02:03:32,437 --> 02:03:35,398
I am Willy Loman and you are Biff Loman!

2102
02:03:35,482 --> 02:03:39,285
I am not the leader of men, Willy!
And neither are you!

2103
02:03:39,486 --> 02:03:42,948
You were never anything
but a hard-working drummer

2104
02:03:43,073 --> 02:03:45,908
who landed in the ashcan
like all the rest of them.

2105
02:03:45,909 --> 02:03:48,535
I am one dollar an hour, Willy!

2106
02:03:48,536 --> 02:03:52,249
I am not bringing home
any prizes anymore,

2107
02:03:52,332 --> 02:03:54,500
and you're gonna stop waiting for me!

2108
02:03:54,501 --> 02:03:58,338
- You vengeful, spiteful mutt!
- Yeah, Pop!

2109
02:03:58,421 --> 02:04:01,383
Pop, I'm nothing.

2110
02:04:01,466 --> 02:04:04,552
I'm nothing, Pop.
Can't you understand that?

2111
02:04:04,636 --> 02:04:06,971
There's no spite in it anymore.

2112
02:04:06,972 --> 02:04:09,865
I'm just what I am, that's all.

2113
02:04:11,518 --> 02:04:14,854
What are you doing?
Aw, what are you doing?

2114
02:04:19,693 --> 02:04:22,946
- Why is he crying?
- Dad...

2115
02:04:24,155 --> 02:04:26,882
Will you let me go, for God's sake?

2116
02:04:27,826 --> 02:04:33,164
Will you take that phoney dream
and burn it before something happens?

2117
02:05:12,537 --> 02:05:15,431
I'll go in the morning.

2118
02:05:19,127 --> 02:05:21,437
Put him to bed.

2119
02:05:28,511 --> 02:05:32,557
Isn't that...
Isn't that remarkable?

2120
02:05:33,641 --> 02:05:36,478
Biff, he...

2121
02:05:38,104 --> 02:05:40,998
He likes me.

2122
02:05:41,274 --> 02:05:44,944
- He loves you, Willy.
- Always did, Pop.

2123
02:05:45,028 --> 02:05:47,696
Aw, Biff, he...

2124
02:05:47,697 --> 02:05:50,466
He cried. He cried to me.

2125
02:05:50,909 --> 02:05:54,537
Aw, that boy.
That boy, he's going to be magnificent.

2126
02:05:55,663 --> 02:05:58,457
Yes, outstanding,
with 20,000 behind him.

2127
02:05:58,458 --> 02:06:01,001
Come to bed, Willy.
It's all settled now.

2128
02:06:01,002 --> 02:06:04,422
Oh, yes, we'll sleep.
Come on, let's go to sleep.

2129
02:06:04,547 --> 02:06:07,132
It takes a great man
to crack thejungle.

2130
02:06:07,133 --> 02:06:10,470
I'm getting married.
Don't forget. I'm changing everything.

2131
02:06:10,553 --> 02:06:13,515
I'm gonna run that department
before the year is up.

2132
02:06:13,598 --> 02:06:16,183
Thejungle is dark
but full of diamonds.

2133
02:06:16,184 --> 02:06:19,687
Be good. You're both good boys.
Just act that way, that's all.

2134
02:06:21,189 --> 02:06:23,699
- Night, Pop.
- Night, boy.

2135
02:06:24,567 --> 02:06:28,111
- Come, dear. -S hh. One must
go in to fetch a diamond out.

2136
02:06:28,112 --> 02:06:30,822
I just want to get settled down
for a little while.

2137
02:06:30,823 --> 02:06:33,952
- I want you upstairs.
- A few minutes. I couldn't sleep now.

2138
02:06:34,077 --> 02:06:36,955
- Go. You look awful tired.
- Not like an appointment.

2139
02:06:37,038 --> 02:06:40,083
- A diamond is rough and hard to touch.
- I'll be right up.

2140
02:06:40,208 --> 02:06:43,044
- I think it's the only way.
- Sure, it's the best thing.

2141
02:06:43,127 --> 02:06:47,991
Best thing. The only way.
Everything is gonna be...

2142
02:06:48,174 --> 02:06:51,151
Aw, go on, kid. Get to bed.

2143
02:06:52,128 --> 02:06:56,591
- You look so tired. - Now, you
come right up. - Two minutes.

2144
02:07:05,141 --> 02:07:08,227
Loves me. Always loved me.
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

2145
02:07:08,311 --> 02:07:12,648
- Ben, he'll worship me for it.
- It's dark there.

2146
02:07:12,732 --> 02:07:14,524
But full of diamonds, Willy.

2147
02:07:14,525 --> 02:07:18,321
Can you imagine that magnificence
with $20,000 in his pocket?

2148
02:07:18,404 --> 02:07:20,530
Willy, come up.

2149
02:07:20,531 --> 02:07:23,283
Yes, yes, coming, coming!

2150
02:07:23,384 --> 02:07:26,345
It's very smart,
you realise, don't you, sweetheart?

2151
02:07:26,429 --> 02:07:28,221
Even Ben sees it.

2152
02:07:28,222 --> 02:07:30,741
I gotta go, baby.

2153
02:07:34,395 --> 02:07:36,580
Bye-bye.

2154
02:07:37,189 --> 02:07:40,026
When the mail comes
he'll be ahead of Bernard again.

2155
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:44,654
- A perfect proposition all around.
- Did you see how he cried to me?

2156
02:07:44,655 --> 02:07:48,683
- Aw, I could kiss him, Ben.
- Time, William, time.

2157
02:07:48,784 --> 02:07:52,872
Ben, I always knew one way or another
we were gonna make it, Biff and I.

2158
02:07:52,955 --> 02:07:56,250
Boat! We'll be late.

2159
02:07:57,710 --> 02:08:02,965
Now, when you kick off,
I want a 70 yard boot.

2160
02:08:03,049 --> 02:08:06,594
And get right down the field
under the ball.

2161
02:08:06,677 --> 02:08:10,014
And when you hit,
hit low and hit hard,

2162
02:08:10,139 --> 02:08:12,515
because it's important, boy.

2163
02:08:12,516 --> 02:08:16,645
There's all kinds of
important people in the stands.

2164
02:08:17,521 --> 02:08:20,248
The first thing that you know...

2165
02:08:20,608 --> 02:08:22,108
Willy?

2166
02:08:22,109 --> 02:08:25,029
- Ben? Ben, where do I...?
- Willy?

2167
02:08:25,112 --> 02:08:29,200
- Ben! Ben!
- Willy!

2168
02:08:30,284 --> 02:08:31,993
Shh. Shh.

2169
02:08:31,994 --> 02:08:34,746
Shh! Shh!

2170
02:08:34,747 --> 02:08:37,808
- Willy, please come up.
- Oh.

2171
02:08:39,752 --> 02:08:41,978
- Willy!
- Shh!

2172
02:08:46,425 --> 02:08:48,485
Willy?

2173
02:08:51,013 --> 02:08:54,516
- Pop?
- Willy, answer me!

2174
02:08:54,517 --> 02:08:57,828
Willy!

2175
02:08:59,288 --> 02:09:03,209
- Willy!
- Pop! No!

2176
02:09:04,084 --> 02:09:06,770
- No!
- No!

2177
02:09:10,758 --> 02:09:14,929
It's getting dark, Linda.

2178
02:09:16,472 --> 02:09:20,768
How about it, Ma? Better get
some rest. They'll be closing the gates.

2179
02:09:20,893 --> 02:09:23,938
He had no right to do that.
There was no necessity.

2180
02:09:24,021 --> 02:09:26,941
- We would have helped him.
- Come on.

2181
02:09:27,024 --> 02:09:31,235
- Why didn't anybody come?
- It was a very nice funeral.

2182
02:09:31,236 --> 02:09:34,448
Where were the people he knew?
Maybe they blame him.

2183
02:09:34,531 --> 02:09:37,910
It's a rough world, Linda.
They wouldn't blame him.

2184
02:09:37,993 --> 02:09:42,990
I can't understand it.
First time in just about 35 years

2185
02:09:43,374 --> 02:09:46,919
we were almost free and clear.

2186
02:09:48,170 --> 02:09:51,356
He only needed a little salary.

2187
02:09:51,423 --> 02:09:54,385
He was even finished with the dentist.

2188
02:09:54,468 --> 02:09:57,471
No man only needs a little salary.

2189
02:09:59,056 --> 02:10:01,015
I can't understand it.

2190
02:10:01,016 --> 02:10:06,480
There were a lot of nice days when he'd
come home from a trip or on Sundays,

2191
02:10:06,563 --> 02:10:09,942
making the stoop,
finishing the cellar

2192
02:10:10,025 --> 02:10:14,196
when he built the extra bathroom
and put up the garage.

2193
02:10:15,614 --> 02:10:19,201
You know, Charley, I think there was
more of him in that front stoop

2194
02:10:19,284 --> 02:10:21,619
than in all the sales he ever made.

2195
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:25,916
Yep. He was a happy man
with a bunch of cement.

2196
02:10:25,999 --> 02:10:28,835
He was wonderful with his hands.

2197
02:10:28,836 --> 02:10:32,089
He had the wrong dreams.
AII, all wrong.

2198
02:10:32,172 --> 02:10:35,433
Don't say that.
The man didn't know who he was.

2199
02:10:35,634 --> 02:10:38,511
Nobody dast blame this man.

2200
02:10:38,512 --> 02:10:40,905
You don't understand.

2201
02:10:41,306 --> 02:10:44,242
Willy was a salesman.

2202
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:47,646
For a salesman,
there is no rock bottom to the life.

2203
02:10:47,729 --> 02:10:49,605
He don't put a bolt to a nut,

2204
02:10:49,606 --> 02:10:52,400
he don't tell you the law,
don't give you medicine.

2205
02:10:52,401 --> 02:10:55,237
He's a man way out there in the blue,

2206
02:10:56,530 --> 02:10:59,382
riding on a smile and a shoeshine.

2207
02:10:59,867 --> 02:11:04,545
When they start not smiling back,
that's an earthquake.

2208
02:11:04,746 --> 02:11:08,500
You get yourself a couple of spots
on your hat and you're finished.

2209
02:11:10,294 --> 02:11:13,354
Nobody dast blame this man.

2210
02:11:13,714 --> 02:11:17,242
A salesman has got to dream, boy.
Comes with the territory.

2211
02:11:17,426 --> 02:11:21,345
- The man didn't know who he was.
- Don't say that!

2212
02:11:21,346 --> 02:11:24,365
Why don't you come with me, Happy?

2213
02:11:24,975 --> 02:11:27,452
I'm not licked that easily.

2214
02:11:27,811 --> 02:11:31,064
I'm staying right in the city
and I'm gonna beat this racquet.

2215
02:11:32,816 --> 02:11:35,485
- Loman brothers.
- I know who I am, kid.

2216
02:11:35,486 --> 02:11:38,237
All right, boy,
I'm gonna show you and everybody

2217
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:41,700
that Willy Loman did not die in vain.
He had a good dream.

2218
02:11:41,783 --> 02:11:45,078
It's the only dream you can have,
to come out number one man.

2219
02:11:45,162 --> 02:11:48,840
He fought it out here and this is where
I'm gonna win it for him.

2220
02:11:51,376 --> 02:11:54,103
Oh, I'll be with you in just a minute.

2221
02:11:54,421 --> 02:11:57,181
You go on, Charley.

2222
02:11:57,466 --> 02:12:00,109
Just... just a minute.

2223
02:12:04,473 --> 02:12:07,742
I never had a chance to say good-bye.

2224
02:12:16,944 --> 02:12:19,603
Help me, Willy.

2225
02:12:19,821 --> 02:12:22,298
I can't cry.

2226
02:12:22,908 --> 02:12:27,829
Seems to me you're just away on
another trip and I keep expecting you.

2227
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:32,900
Why did you do it?

2228
02:12:34,294 --> 02:12:37,172
I search and I search,

2229
02:12:38,298 --> 02:12:41,134
and I search,

2230
02:12:42,469 --> 02:12:47,432
and I can't understand it, Willy.

2231
02:12:50,644 --> 02:12:54,247
I made the last payment
on the house today.

2232
02:12:55,774 --> 02:12:58,167
Today!

2233
02:13:05,409 --> 02:13:08,645
And there'll be nobody home.

2234
02:13:10,789 --> 02:13:14,083
We're free and clear.

2235
02:13:18,088 --> 02:13:20,598
We're free.

2236
02:13:21,383 --> 02:13:23,901
We're free.

2237
02:13:28,598 --> 02:13:31,326
We're free.
