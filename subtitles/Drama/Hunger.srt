1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
HUNGER (2008)

2
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:16,157
Temperature-wise,  fairly cold.
Six, seven degrees, which is...

3
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,874
What is it in Fahrenheit?
I don't know. Forty something?

4
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:25,377
anyone has a nice formula then
they can write in and tell me, after this.

5
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:29,720
How to transform Fahrenheit
into centigrade...

6
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:56,048
...dirty protest and the blanket
protest has been going on for years,

7
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:59,178
all in support of the same demand:
Political status.

8
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:03,967
That is to say, different treatment
for people who commit crimes,

9
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:07,268
hideous crimes, for what they claim
to be a political motive.

10
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:09,435
And that is what
the government will not grant.

11
00:05:56,734 --> 00:06:00,317
About an hour later there's a painful cry
coming from the granny's room.

12
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:02,320
So the Da walks up and opens the door,

13
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:05,318
and there's the wee fella
having a go at the granny.

14
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:09,318
And he turns round and goes, "It's not
so fucking funny when it's your Ma!"

15
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,383
There is no such thing
as political murder,

16
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,850
political bombing or political violence.

17
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:36,391
There is only criminal murder,
criminal bombing and criminal violence.

18
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:41,566
We will not compromise on this.

19
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:44,780
There will be no political status.

20
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:20,100
I will not wear the uniform of a criminal.

21
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:23,729
I demand to wear me own clothes.

22
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:00,904
What?

23
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,539
Say what your surname is again.

24
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:11,419
- Gillen.
- Gillen?

25
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,041
Aye.

26
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,507
Fancy Quinn.

27
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:20,299
Falls Road. Fancy Quinn.
Do you know him?

28
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,594
- No.
- No?

29
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,307
- How long did you get?
- Twelve years.

30
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,524
You?

31
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:45,822
Six years. Six.

32
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:49,121
- Six?
- Aye.

33
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,163
You lucky bastard.

34
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,013
All right?

35
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,050
- How are you? OK?
- Yeah.

36
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:21,391
How's Ma?

37
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:24,918
...engineering union. It's by
the political advisor to Merlyn Rees,

38
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,758
when he was at the Home Office,
Roger Darlington.

39
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:30,214
He rejects the official line
on phone taps,

40
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,722
that there's only been
a modest overall increase,

41
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:36,517
and says Parliament has no way
of knowing how much tapping goes on,

42
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:39,185
because the Prime Minister
and other senior ministers

43
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:42,732
Don't even have to get warrants
to get a tap put into effect.

44
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:31,804
What?

45
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,645
Get ready.

46
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,097
Fuck!

47
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:24,493
...she sends
her very, very best to you.

48
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,582
Are you all right, Bobby?

49
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:31,793
I'm grand, Ma.

50
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:35,418
Are they giving you treatment for that?

51
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:37,762
It's being looked after.

52
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:42,471
And the young fella?

53
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,639
He's a handful, I'll tell you that.

54
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,444
- Are you eating all right?
- I'm grand, Ma.

55
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,318
- Are they feeding you all right?
- Don't yous be worrying about me.

56
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,450
Five minutes.

57
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:01,496
Five minutes.

58
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:06,122
- You eating all right?
- Aye.

59
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:09,252
- Tastes like shit though doesn't it?
- You get used to it.

60
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,717
You're looking well.

61
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:20,797
So are you, son.

62
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:22,841
So are you.

63
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:31,352
The eyes of the Lord
are on the righteous.

64
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:34,437
And his ears are attentive to their cries.

65
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,404
The face of the Lord is against
those who do evil.

66
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:42,657
The righteous cry out,
and the Lord hears them.

67
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:46,201
He delivers them from all their troubles.

68
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,201
The Lord is close
to the broken-hearted

69
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,453
and saves those
who are crushed in spirit.

70
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:55,124
The righteous man has many troubles.

71
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,925
But the Lord delivers him from them all.

72
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,089
He protects all his bones,

73
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:03,048
and not one of them will be broken.

74
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,840
Evil will slay the wicked.

75
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:11,811
The foes of the righteous
will be condemned.

76
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:15,141
The Lord redeems his servants.

77
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:18,975
No one will be condemned
who finds refuge in him.

78
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:27,987
Let us pray.

79
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:46,758
Fucking shoes matches the wall.

80
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:31,131
Fucking dirty bastards!

81
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:34,764
- Fucking bastards!
- Fucking dirty bastards!

82
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:59,289
I... I... IRA!

83
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:02,536
I... I... IRA!

84
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,914
Fucking bullshit!

85
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,669
Everything in order?

86
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:57,676
Yes, sir. In order, sir.

87
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,347
Very good.

88
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,949
Gerry! Gerry!

89
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,038
Gerry!

90
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:23,188
Get the fuck off me!

91
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,989
Shit. Shit!

92
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:34,484
Gerry! Gerry!

93
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,110
Get off me, you fucking...

94
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:21,518
Tea with two sugars, please.

95
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,607
Hi, Mum.

96
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:44,879
What are you doing sitting in here?

97
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:14,276
Daisies.

98
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:32,039
Out! Out! Everybody!

99
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,874
You can sit down anytime you like.

100
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:13,003
Priest etiquette.
Never sit before you're asked.

101
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:14,755
Sit down, then.

102
00:46:14,882 --> 00:46:16,958
I don't want to come over too eager.

103
00:46:17,093 --> 00:46:19,548
What, best to hover at the door?

104
00:46:19,678 --> 00:46:23,094
You learn that in your first week
in the seminary, Bobby.

105
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:31,515
- Cig?
- Come on.

106
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,564
Bit of a break
from smoking the Bible, eh?

107
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,735
Oh, aye.

108
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:45,826
Anyone work out which book
is the best smoke?

109
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:47,993
We only smoke the Lamentations.

110
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:50,577
A right miserable cigarette.

111
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,784
Nice room.

112
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:54,911
Very clean.

113
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,999
- Where is it you're from again, Dom?
- Born, you mean?

114
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:01,002
- Bally-go-backwards.
- Oh, the city dog.

115
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:02,628
Ballyroberts.

116
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:06,046
A wee place south of Ballymoney.
Kilrea.

117
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:09,714
I remember a homily you did
at Mass one time.

118
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:11,558
Oh, will you listen to it?

119
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:15,304
- The men hold you in very high esteem.
- I can feel a dig coming on.

120
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:17,515
- You're very quick.
- Right.

121
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,105
Nah, you're respected, you know that.

122
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:23,106
But I like those stories you tell
about the countryside.

123
00:47:23,238 --> 00:47:26,856
A childhood of poaching,
robbing apples, stampeding cattle.

124
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:30,859
- A fine education for a priest.
- A priest working West Belfast, it is.

125
00:47:30,996 --> 00:47:33,237
Stampeding comes in handy
down the Falls Road.

126
00:47:33,373 --> 00:47:35,661
- hate me.
- You miss it, though?

127
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:37,784
- What?
- Countryside.

128
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:41,370
Ah, sure I get home to see my wee
brother every month or so, but...

129
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:45,254
Aye, I miss the usual.
Clean air. Space. All that.

130
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:49,168
- Feels closer to who you are.
- Aye, well, it is. No question.

131
00:47:51,014 --> 00:47:53,885
Like a fish out of water,
working in a big city like Belfast,

132
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:55,926
but it's a job, isn't it?

133
00:47:57,312 --> 00:47:59,554
You stop looking
at your surroundings quick enough

134
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:03,188
when you figure your business is
the business of the soul and all.

135
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:05,855
- Business of the soul?
- Ah, you know what I mean.

136
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:10,316
- Learn that in the seminary, too?
- Aye. You can use that free of charge.

137
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:12,442
Go on.

138
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:16,870
Well, I suppose what I'm saying is...
you get on.

139
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,824
Kilrea can wait till I'm an old man.

140
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:21,531
Too many scoundrels to be saved
in Belfast, anyway.

141
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:24,373
- Busy work. Aye.
- God will reward you in Heaven.

142
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:28,288
And I'll be thankful,
once there's wine involved.

143
00:48:30,593 --> 00:48:33,084
So what does your wee brother do
back home?

144
00:48:35,431 --> 00:48:37,388
He's a parish priest.

145
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:42,396
He's a sneaky wee bastard.
You know the sort, Bobby.

146
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:45,142
- Still goes poaching?
- Poaching jobs.

147
00:48:45,274 --> 00:48:47,895
And he's younger than me
by eight years all right.

148
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,268
Go on.

149
00:48:50,403 --> 00:48:54,401
Well, as a cleric I work
in a parish beside Kilrea.

150
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,857
A wee hole of a place.
I'm working me arse off.

151
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:59,910
House calls to the elderly,
mobile confessions.

152
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:02,030
- The glamour stuff.
- Oh, aye.

153
00:49:02,165 --> 00:49:06,079
- So... a position comes up at Kilrea.
- Right.

154
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,330
And I'm passed over for some reason
or other. No reason probably.

155
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:11,954
- Too much cake off the old ladies?
- Probably.

156
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:13,633
So?

157
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:17,756
So about five years later, the position
again comes up back home in Kilrea.

158
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:22,514
And my brother Michael
waltzes right into it.

159
00:49:22,642 --> 00:49:24,053
Fuck.

160
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:27,760
He's made parish priest at 28.

161
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:31,017
More spiritual probably.
Less lippy than you.

162
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:34,519
He worked the Bishop. He's a golfer.

163
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:36,646
He's a pushy little twerp is what he is.

164
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,271
- At least you're not bitter.
- No, I couldn't be that.

165
00:49:39,408 --> 00:49:41,899
Parish priest at 28? Fantastic.

166
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:45,155
Hmm. He has two cars.

167
00:49:45,288 --> 00:49:47,411
And the house he has is massive.

168
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:49,367
He has a maid, a cook.

169
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,410
I'm stuck in a two-up-two-down,

170
00:49:51,544 --> 00:49:54,830
with a fat Kerry man who drones
on and on about Gaelic football.

171
00:49:54,964 --> 00:49:58,629
- Can we stop talking about this?
- Jesus, you're the one who's talking.

172
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:03,338
- How's your smoke going?
- Grand.

173
00:50:03,472 --> 00:50:05,180
Hmm. Filthy habit. Disgusting.

174
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:07,513
Oh, aye, awful. Lovely, though.

175
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:09,600
Aye. Praise the Lord.

176
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,272
- 28... My God!
- Oh, stop it.

177
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:21,355
So what happened to your eye, Bobby?

178
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:22,948
What?

179
00:50:23,074 --> 00:50:25,743
- Get a dig? Your eye?
- Difference of opinion.

180
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:29,652
- Hmm. How's the other fella?
- A lot worse, believe me.

181
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:32,998
So. What did you call me here for?

182
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:37,169
- Why, is that the idle banter over?
- Priest etiquette. Small talk first.

183
00:50:37,296 --> 00:50:39,454
I'm learning a lot about the priesthood.

184
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:41,915
- You'd make a fine priest.
- Oh, aye.

185
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,126
Good talker. Man of principle.
Leader of men.

186
00:50:44,261 --> 00:50:47,843
- Political terrorist.
- The church loves a reformed crook.

187
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:49,632
Aye.

188
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,350
I always felt that thief next to Jesus
got off lightly.

189
00:50:54,478 --> 00:50:56,601
Ah, but he recognised his sins.

190
00:50:56,731 --> 00:50:58,770
- Did he, though?
- Aye. Said as much.

191
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:01,568
When you're hung from a cross,
you'll say anything.

192
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:04,860
Jesus offers him a seat next to daddy
in a place called paradise.

193
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:07,942
You're always gonna put your hand up
for piece of that.

194
00:51:08,075 --> 00:51:10,281
Even when it's nailed to your cross.

195
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,735
Jesus Christ. That's sacrilegious.

196
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:15,990
Sacrilegious?
No, no, no, he was a dirty thief.

197
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:21,585
So. What do you want to tell me?

198
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,835
Where are you at?

199
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:26,716
Been driven mad by that governor yet?

200
00:51:26,842 --> 00:51:29,131
See this negotiating lark?

201
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:32,013
It's been a sideshow.
I'll tell you that for nothing.

202
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:34,178
But you understand
why you need to do it?

203
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:36,466
Because we're no longer
good propaganda.

204
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:38,808
According to who? The leadership?

205
00:51:40,355 --> 00:51:42,229
The time has come.

206
00:51:42,357 --> 00:51:44,598
A decision had to be made.

207
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,185
You think that's
what the leadership think?

208
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:51,072
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Bit paranoid there, Bobby.

209
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:58,360
Ten thousand people marched for
the seven hunger strikers last October.

210
00:51:58,497 --> 00:52:00,904
- International pressure on the Brits.
- Busy time.

211
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:03,579
Even the Pope's having a say.
Getting involved.

212
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,960
The whole world, trying to get Thatcher
to give us our demands.

213
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:09,840
- But it all came to nothing.
- Right.

214
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:13,299
Hunger strike failed.
We're on the front line.

215
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:17,010
We created the protest.
It's our responsibility.

216
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:19,465
Leadership have been
very clear to me, Dom.

217
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,842
Four and a half years
of the no-wash protest,

218
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:24,302
as much as it's highlighted
Republicanism,

219
00:52:24,438 --> 00:52:27,355
it's also distracted from the development
of the organisation.

220
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:29,392
Because your needs are specific.

221
00:52:29,526 --> 00:52:30,937
Of course they are.

222
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:33,904
Some woman bringing up
three children in West Belfast

223
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,609
shouldn't care about civilian clothing
or whatever they call these clown outfits.

224
00:52:38,743 --> 00:52:43,286
Honest to God. We were promised our
own clothes. It's childish skulduggery.

225
00:52:43,414 --> 00:52:45,987
So the leadership have had
enough of you?

226
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:49,791
In the ideal world,

227
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,123
we'd be fighting our battles
independently, but we're tied.

228
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:56,460
Nothing's changed in here.
The leadership are stuck with us

229
00:52:56,593 --> 00:53:00,840
until there's some realistic chance
of political status, that's the hard truth.

230
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:04,222
See, to get me to negotiate
with these lying, reneging monkeys

231
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,972
when there's never nothing
on the table, it's pure crap.

232
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:09,143
I'm not gonna be marched
into this Governor's office

233
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:13,020
and get caught up in some pointless
dialogue with that pompous bastard.

234
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,151
- Well, he's a big fan of yours.
- Thick as two short planks.

235
00:53:16,278 --> 00:53:19,279
Can you believe they made him
Governor? Bloody insult to humanity!

236
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:22,076
Mother of Jesus, where do you get
your energy from?

237
00:53:23,202 --> 00:53:25,278
I was a cross-country runner as a boy.

238
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:28,831
I could have guessed it.
Big engine on you.

239
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:34,535
Cross-country running.
Explains a lot about you, Bobby.

240
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:38,205
Why, I loved it, so I did.
That's the whole country thing for me.

241
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:42,255
Jesus, they to hold me back at
the finishing line or I'd keep on running.

242
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,221
Little scraps.
We were mongrels from out of the city.

243
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,885
Frightened of cattle and all.
It was a funny time.

244
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:50,638
- Frightened of cattle?
- Aye, terrified of them.

245
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,016
Think you could get milk and burgers
from them monsters? Jesus Christ!

246
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,518
The next time round I'll be born
in the countryside. Guaranteed.

247
00:54:01,654 --> 00:54:03,730
Wildlife. Birds.

248
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,107
I love all that. Paradise.

249
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:09,860
Aye, and you could learn to relax, too.

250
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,831
Aye. Maybe. You never know.

251
00:54:12,957 --> 00:54:15,080
Never tried it before.

252
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:19,128
I'm starting a hunger strike
on the first of March.

253
00:54:21,131 --> 00:54:24,132
That's why you're here.
That's what I'm telling you.

254
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:26,548
Aye. I heard that.

255
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:33,307
- Does your family know?
- I got word out to them, aye.

256
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:36,933
- Have you spoken with them?
- Got a visit in two weeks. Talk then.

257
00:54:37,063 --> 00:54:41,855
- How do you think they'll take it?
- What do you think, Dom?

258
00:54:41,984 --> 00:54:44,023
And your wee boy?

259
00:55:02,503 --> 00:55:06,168
So, what makes it different
from the last time?

260
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,669
The last hunger strike was flawed.
It became emotional.

261
00:55:11,804 --> 00:55:14,045
Seven men started at the same time.

262
00:55:14,181 --> 00:55:16,588
They got weak and couldn't let
the weakest die,

263
00:55:16,725 --> 00:55:20,425
which left us susceptible to be conned
by the Brits, and that's what we were.

264
00:55:20,562 --> 00:55:21,973
Conned.

265
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:25,474
This time out, the men will start
consecutively, two weeks apart.

266
00:55:25,608 --> 00:55:27,517
Somebody dies, they'll be replaced.

267
00:55:27,652 --> 00:55:30,736
There's no shortage of us.
Seventy-five men have signed up.

268
00:55:30,863 --> 00:55:33,105
Oh, for Christ's sake...

269
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:35,731
The announcement's being made today.

270
00:55:38,954 --> 00:55:43,532
So what makes this protest different
is that you're set to die, Bobby?

271
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,624
It may well come to that.

272
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:48,836
You start a hunger strike to protest
for what you believe in.

273
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:53,127
You don't start already determined
to die, or am I missing something here?

274
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:58,217
It's in their hands. Our message is clear.
They're seeing our determination.

275
00:55:58,347 --> 00:56:01,597
So it'll take a couple of deaths,
do you think? Maybe five or six?

276
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:03,765
But sure, there's seventy-five of you.

277
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:05,970
Aye well, it won't come to that.

278
00:56:06,105 --> 00:56:09,639
All right, maybe the Brits will buckle
after twenty or so.

279
00:56:09,775 --> 00:56:13,060
But why should you care,
cos you're already dead, right?

280
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:26,203
Have you thought about
what you'll put these boys through?

281
00:56:26,332 --> 00:56:29,701
Putting aside what's going to happen
to these poor men's families.

282
00:56:29,835 --> 00:56:33,584
You're up against a British government
who clearly despises Republicanism,

283
00:56:33,714 --> 00:56:35,623
who are unshakable.

284
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:39,209
Who can easily live with the deaths
of what they call terrorists.

285
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:41,301
The stakes are much higher this time.

286
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,840
I know that.

287
00:56:42,973 --> 00:56:46,756
And if you're not willing to negotiate,
you want them to capitulate?

288
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:50,262
- Right.
- So failure means many dead men.

289
00:56:50,396 --> 00:56:52,436
Families torn apart.

290
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:54,807
And the whole
Republican Movement demoralised.

291
00:56:54,942 --> 00:56:59,937
Worse case scenario, it might well mean
all that. But short term, out of the ashes.

292
00:57:00,072 --> 00:57:04,117
Guaranteed there'll be a new generation,
even more resilient, determined...

293
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:06,319
- Look who you're talking to.
- There's a war going on.

294
00:57:06,453 --> 00:57:08,944
I thought you might understand.
You're talking like a foreigner.

295
00:57:09,081 --> 00:57:11,618
You're talking to me like one.
You think I don't know Northern Ireland?

296
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,659
- I live here, man.
- Then support us.

297
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:18,087
I supported the first hunger strike
on the basis it was a protest.

298
00:57:18,214 --> 00:57:21,548
Not some predesign to die
and balk at negotiation,

299
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:25,720
other than surrender from Thatcher.
That's ridiculous, Bobby, it's destructive.

300
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:29,891
What's happening here for the last
four years? The brutality, humiliation.

301
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:33,101
Our basic human rights taken away.
All of this has to stop.

302
00:57:33,228 --> 00:57:34,936
Through talking.

303
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:38,728
So what?
We take their offer, put their uniform on?

304
00:57:38,859 --> 00:57:41,231
Cos the last four years
have meant nothing?

305
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:44,860
We could do that, Dom, or we could
behave like the army we proclaim to be

306
00:57:44,989 --> 00:57:47,029
and lay down our lives
for our comrades.

307
00:57:47,158 --> 00:57:49,696
Is there not even a small part of you
hoping for a breakthrough?

308
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:51,820
That could find you negotiating again?

309
00:57:51,954 --> 00:57:54,445
- That won't happen.
- Right, forget about that.

310
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:58,710
I want to know whether your intent
is just purely to commit suicide here.

311
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:05,751
You want me to argue about
the morality of what I'm about to do

312
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:09,419
and whether it's really suicide or not?

313
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:12,425
For one, you're calling it suicide.
I call it murder.

314
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:14,846
And that's just another
wee difference between us.

315
00:58:14,976 --> 00:58:17,218
We're both Catholic men. Republicans.

316
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:19,642
But while you were poaching salmon
in lovely Kilrea,

317
00:58:19,772 --> 00:58:21,681
we were being burnt out
of our house in Rathcoole.

318
00:58:21,816 --> 00:58:25,765
Similar in many ways, but experiences
focussed our beliefs differently.

319
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,611
- Understand me?
- I understand.

320
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:31,652
I have my belief. And in all its simplicity
that is a most powerful thing.

321
00:58:33,618 --> 00:58:36,156
So, what's your statement by dying?

322
00:58:37,372 --> 00:58:40,575
Just highlighting British intransigence,
so fucking what?

323
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,582
Everyone knows what the Brits are like.

324
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,711
- Good.
- It is good and nothing to do with you.

325
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:48,411
The Brits have been fucking up
everything for centuries.

326
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:50,209
I can feel your hatred, Dom.

327
00:58:50,342 --> 00:58:52,549
- Are you looking for martyrdom?
- No.

328
00:58:52,678 --> 00:58:54,172
- Are you sure?
- Aye.

329
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:58,432
Cos I've heard you eulogising
Wolfe Tone, Connolly, MacSwiney...

330
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,223
I can't help think you're writing
your name for all them history books.

331
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:04,845
- Cos you think that matters to me?
- I know it does.

332
00:59:04,981 --> 00:59:07,140
Well, you're wrong.

333
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:13,442
You say you're soldiers,
it's all about the freedom.

334
00:59:13,573 --> 00:59:16,609
But you've got no appreciation
of a life, Bobby.

335
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:19,826
You no longer know
what a life is, you men.

336
00:59:19,954 --> 00:59:23,572
Four years living in these conditions,
no one expects you to be normal.

337
00:59:23,707 --> 00:59:26,032
There's nothing normal about you.

338
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:31,161
Right now, the Republican Movement
has talked itself into a corner.

339
00:59:31,298 --> 00:59:35,295
You IRA are standing right behind it
looking into that corner.

340
00:59:35,427 --> 00:59:40,005
All that history, all them dead men
and women. You're still seeing nothing.

341
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:43,473
When your answer's to kill everything,
you've blinded yourselves

342
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:46,518
and you're scared to stop it.

343
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,646
Afraid of living.
Afraid of talk and peace.

344
00:59:50,774 --> 00:59:54,772
Sure, what would Ulster be
if it wasn't tearing itself to shit?

345
00:59:55,946 --> 00:59:58,069
And this situation here.

346
00:59:58,198 --> 01:00:01,780
That the future of the Republican
Movement is in the hands of you men

347
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,946
who've lost all... all sense of reality.

348
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:09,450
You think your head's on right?

349
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:12,501
Locked up in here twenty-four hours
a day in piss and shit,

350
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:15,712
and you are making decisions
that could see so many men die.

351
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,377
Build a statue to Bobby Sands!

352
01:00:18,509 --> 01:00:21,178
You're joking me. Freedom Fighter?

353
01:00:22,429 --> 01:00:25,798
They're the men and women working
out there in the community.

354
01:00:25,932 --> 01:00:28,969
And that was you,
once upon a time, am I right?

355
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:31,889
All that work you did in Twinbrook.

356
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:36,066
That's where we need you, Bobby.
And you know I'm right.

357
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:40,527
That I'm deluded...
you want me to answer that?

358
01:00:40,654 --> 01:00:42,694
They're beating you.
You're playing into their hands.

359
01:00:42,823 --> 01:00:46,109
- The strategy's in place.
- Then stop it. Just say stop.

360
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:50,027
- You don't understand a thing.
- You're in no shape to make this call.

361
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:52,785
It's done. It won't be stopped.

362
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:56,000
Then fuck it, life must mean
nothing to you.

363
01:00:57,379 --> 01:00:59,952
God's going to punish me?

364
01:01:05,344 --> 01:01:10,801
Well, if not just for the suicide, then
he'd have to punish you for stupidity.

365
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:16,849
Aye. And you for your arrogance.

366
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,764
Cos my life is a real life,
not some theological exercise,

367
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:24,684
some religious trick that's
got fuck all to do with living.

368
01:01:24,821 --> 01:01:28,949
Jesus Christ had a backbone, but see
them disciples, every disciple since,

369
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:32,859
you're just jumping in and out
of the rhetoric and dead-end semantics.

370
01:01:32,995 --> 01:01:37,704
You need the revolutionary, the political
soldier, to give life a pulse, direction...

371
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:41,000
- That's stupid talk. You're deluded.
- Aye, so you say.

372
01:01:41,128 --> 01:01:44,082
- And what's your wee son going to say?
- Fuck off.

373
01:01:44,214 --> 01:01:46,041
Doesn't that interest you?

374
01:01:46,174 --> 01:01:49,792
You're going to attack me
with sentiment? Typical priest.

375
01:01:49,928 --> 01:01:52,501
- What's your heart saying?
- I thought you'd me all figured out.

376
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:55,011
What's it saying? Tell me.

377
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:02,976
My life means everything to me.
Freedom means everything.

378
01:02:03,107 --> 01:02:06,642
I know you don't mean to mock me,
Dom, so I'll just let all that pass.

379
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,905
This is one of these times
when we've come to a pause.

380
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:13,403
It's a time to keep your beliefs pure.

381
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:17,068
I believe that a united Ireland
is right and just.

382
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:21,705
Maybe it's impossible
for a man like you to understand,

383
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:25,249
but having a respect for my life,
a desire for freedom,

384
01:02:25,378 --> 01:02:28,047
an unyielding love for that belief,

385
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:31,126
means I can see past
any doubts I may have.

386
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:35,925
Putting my life on the line is not just
the only thing I can do, Dom.

387
01:02:36,055 --> 01:02:38,462
It's the right thing.

388
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:45,017
And this is why you've called me here?

389
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:50,063
Needed a sounding board? Not
a hundred per cent sure of yourself?

390
01:02:50,193 --> 01:02:52,150
Been doubting yourself maybe?

391
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:55,398
Aye. Well, I'm only human.

392
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:58,283
And I've made it clear for you, then?

393
01:02:59,994 --> 01:03:04,074
Man of guidance, Dom,
"business of the soul".

394
01:03:15,216 --> 01:03:18,336
You've been to Gweedore in Donegal?

395
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,923
Aye.

396
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:30,935
I went there when I was twelve.

397
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:35,183
Big cross-country race for the boys,

398
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:39,399
and we're all in the back of a minibus
headed towards Derry one morning.

399
01:03:40,657 --> 01:03:42,899
I mean, this is big time.

400
01:03:43,034 --> 01:03:45,157
This is like international athletics
for us,

401
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:48,371
cos we're racing against boys
in the South

402
01:03:48,498 --> 01:03:51,167
and we have this thing
to do Belfast proud.

403
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:57,172
Two of the boys are Prods
and the rest of us are Catholics.

404
01:03:57,298 --> 01:03:59,623
It's a cross-community event.

405
01:03:59,758 --> 01:04:03,008
I suppose the good people
in the South think this is great stuff,

406
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:07,181
let's get this wee team over from Belfast
and all that patronising shite.

407
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:14,015
Anyway, we're through the border...

408
01:04:16,274 --> 01:04:19,109
...the boys are all singing
pop tunes and all,

409
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:22,651
but I'm just in the back of the bus
looking out the window.

410
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:26,732
We're going through them mountains,

411
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,619
you know, where Mount Errigal is
and everything?

412
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:33,035
It's a beautiful sight, Dom.

413
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:37,582
Donegal has to be the most beautiful
place in Ireland, I reckon.

414
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,914
Aye.

415
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,630
Anyway...

416
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,633
...we arrive at Gweedore.

417
01:04:53,934 --> 01:04:57,220
What a place. And it's hopping
with about two hundred boys

418
01:04:57,354 --> 01:05:00,474
and they're getting into their gear
and limbering up.

419
01:05:01,108 --> 01:05:03,563
The whole event is run
by Christian brothers

420
01:05:03,693 --> 01:05:06,480
and they're clipping young fellas
around the ears,

421
01:05:06,613 --> 01:05:09,068
basically trying to retain some order.

422
01:05:10,116 --> 01:05:13,449
Our team goes off for a wee jog
to stretch out the legs.

423
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:18,244
We're surrounded by fields of barley...

424
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:24,373
...and they dip down into a wee valley
where there's a stream and woods.

425
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:30,381
The woods and stream
are out of bounds,

426
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,961
so naturally us Belfast boys
have to go check them out.

427
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:37,217
Woods and a stream, Dom.
Sure, that's like the Amazon to us.

428
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:42,393
And we come across
these young fellas from Cork.

429
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:46,187
There's some banter about our accents
but they could barely talk,

430
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,890
we couldn't understand
a word they were saying.

431
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:52,737
You get the idea that they're
lording it over us a bit, you know?

432
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,782
Looking down on us.
I'm sensing it anyway.

433
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,197
We're running along
and we come up with this idea

434
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,374
to go down to the stream
and check it out for fish.

435
01:06:04,501 --> 01:06:07,170
So we're down
by the river, Dom... stream...

436
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:09,916
...it was half a foot of water in there.

437
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,717
Little silver fish
but nothing substantial.

438
01:06:12,842 --> 01:06:15,712
Until one of their boys
call us further down.

439
01:06:17,513 --> 01:06:19,671
Lying in the water is a wee foal,

440
01:06:20,724 --> 01:06:23,678
four or five days old,
he's all skin and bone,

441
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:27,428
a grey colour, and he's got
flecks of blood on his coat

442
01:06:27,564 --> 01:06:30,730
cos he's cut himself up really badly
on the sharp rocks.

443
01:06:33,695 --> 01:06:37,313
We're just standing over him,
and you can see his back leg snapped.

444
01:06:37,448 --> 01:06:40,734
And he's breathing, he's alive,
but just about.

445
01:06:42,995 --> 01:06:45,451
So this big conversation gets started up

446
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:48,866
between the boys who suddenly
reckon themselves the leaders.

447
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:52,950
They're deliberating what we should do.
Someone says drop a rock on his head.

448
01:06:53,088 --> 01:06:57,132
But I'm looking in their faces. I can see
they're either scared stiff or clueless.

449
01:06:57,259 --> 01:06:58,918
It's all bravado.

450
01:06:59,928 --> 01:07:02,964
And this foal on the ground, in real pain.

451
01:07:04,098 --> 01:07:06,720
All this chitchat going on,
going nowhere.

452
01:07:08,811 --> 01:07:12,227
Next thing, one of the priests sees us,
sees the foal,

453
01:07:12,356 --> 01:07:15,357
tells us not to move and we're done for,
really done for.

454
01:07:15,484 --> 01:07:18,153
A group of boys will always get
the blame for hurting a foal.

455
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:21,445
A group of Belfast boys
will get a hammering for sure.

456
01:07:21,573 --> 01:07:24,360
So it's clear to me in an instant,
and I'm on my knees

457
01:07:24,492 --> 01:07:27,992
and I take the foal's head in my hands
and I put him under water.

458
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:30,078
He's thrashing around a bit to start,

459
01:07:30,206 --> 01:07:32,827
so I press down harder
until he's drowned.

460
01:07:35,336 --> 01:07:38,041
Priest arrives, Dom.

461
01:07:38,172 --> 01:07:39,963
And he's grabbing me by the hair,

462
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:43,590
dragging me through the woods,
promising me a proper hiding.

463
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:46,636
But I knew I did the right thing
by that wee foal.

464
01:07:47,848 --> 01:07:50,386
And I could take the punishment
for all our boys.

465
01:07:51,726 --> 01:07:55,510
I had the respect of them
other boys now and I knew that.

466
01:08:02,153 --> 01:08:04,311
I'm clear of the reasons, Dom.

467
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:08,609
I'm clear of all the repercussions.

468
01:08:08,742 --> 01:08:13,071
I will act and I will not stand by
and do nothing.

469
01:08:50,657 --> 01:08:52,815
You can leave them there if you like.

470
01:08:53,743 --> 01:08:57,112
Don't want me rolling up
the Letters of Saint John, do you?

471
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:05,127
Couldn't have that
on my conscience, no.

472
01:09:12,803 --> 01:09:15,472
I don't think
I'm going to see you again, Bobby.

473
01:09:17,223 --> 01:09:19,430
There's no need, Dom.

474
01:12:55,262 --> 01:12:59,840
'And faced now with
the failure of their discredited cause,

475
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:03,758
'the men of violence have chosen,
in recent months,

476
01:13:03,895 --> 01:13:07,643
'to play what may well be their last card.

477
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:11,852
'They have turned their violence
against themselves

478
01:13:11,986 --> 01:13:16,197
'through the prison hunger strike
to death.

479
01:13:16,323 --> 01:13:22,408
'They seek to work on the most basic
of human emotions, pity,

480
01:13:22,537 --> 01:13:25,242
'as a means of creating tension

481
01:13:25,373 --> 01:13:29,371
'and stoking the fires
of bitterness and hatred. '

482
01:14:00,948 --> 01:14:06,025
There's been a deterioration
of liver, kidney and pancreatic function.

483
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:09,694
Also the bone density
decreases substantially

484
01:14:09,832 --> 01:14:12,583
due to calcium and vitamin deficiencies.

485
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:18,171
The muscle of the heart
is also undernourished,

486
01:14:18,298 --> 01:14:22,165
causing impaired function
and eventually cardiac failure.

487
01:14:27,932 --> 01:14:32,095
The left ventricle could shrink
to seventy percent of its normal size.

488
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:38,728
He will have low blood sugar,
low energy and muscular wasting.

489
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:44,106
He'll be experiencing
gastrointestinal ulcers

490
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,450
with the thinning of the intestinal wall
and sub-mucosal haemorrhaging.

491
01:14:50,245 --> 01:14:53,696
There will have been degenerative
changes to the mucous membrane

492
01:14:53,832 --> 01:14:57,532
of the intestines
and indeed all the organs in the body.

493
01:25:29,638 --> 01:25:32,804
- Name?
- Rosaleen Sands.

494
01:25:36,269 --> 01:25:39,472
- Name?
- John Sands.

495
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:57,183
People always ask us,
people always ask us

496
01:27:57,318 --> 01:28:01,066
- Who we are...
- Bobby! Bobby!

497
01:28:01,197 --> 01:28:05,064
And where we come from,
where we come from

498
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,949
And we tell them,
and we tell them

499
01:28:09,079 --> 01:28:12,614
We're from Belfast,
we're from Belfast

500
01:28:12,749 --> 01:28:16,367
Mighty, mighty Belfast,
mighty, mighty Belfast

501
01:28:16,503 --> 01:28:20,168
And if they can't hear us,
if they can't hear us

502
01:28:20,298 --> 01:28:23,963
We shout a little louder,
we shout a little louder...
