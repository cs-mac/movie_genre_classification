1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,626
When a man is abused unjustly

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,464
by any form of authority

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,038
all men are responsible;

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,775
for it is they who, by their silence

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,175
permit and condone such oppression.

6
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:26,824
ORDERS

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,522
Why can't I go?

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,554
I want you to come home.

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,625
But Ginette's a nice girl.

10
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,726
I know, I know.

11
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,125
Then why can't I go?

12
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,256
I don't have time to explain.

13
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,799
Tell me!

14
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,835
I want to know. School can wait.

15
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,632
No, it can't.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,666
Will you
make coffee?

17
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,475
What fell?
- I dunno.

18
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,541
Pick it up.

19
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,645
The water's still hot.

20
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,907
Could you make it?

21
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,176
Mom, tell me why I can't go to Ginette's.

22
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,751
Martine, when you get home
from school I'll tell you.

23
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,048
But by then...

24
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,921
I haven't time to argue with you now

25
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,724
<i>My name's Jean Lapointe</i>

26
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,727
<i>and I play the role of Clermont Boudreau</i>.

27
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,561
I was born on a farm

28
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,928
like my wife, Marie.

29
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,510
I guess our biggest mistake

30
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,771
was coming to the cit<i>y</i>

31
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,116
I work in a weaving mill.

32
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,343
Our one hope

33
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,655
is the union.

34
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,515
Do you go to church?

35
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,221
Yes.

36
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,296
Are you involved in politics?

37
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,898
Not directly.

38
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,431
I'm active in the union.

39
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,706
Take your bag and put your coat on.

40
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,069
Hurry up, off to school.

41
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,904
Ok, we're going.

42
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,141
You'll be cold...

43
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,344
I'm going to Ginette's anyway!

44
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,153
I want you home straight after school!

45
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,860
My name is Hélène Loiselle.

46
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,799
I play Marie Boudreau.

47
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,934
Clermont's my husband.

48
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,970
I'm a housewife.

49
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,640
It keeps me busy.

50
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,299
But later, maybe, when the girls are older

51
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:04,108
I'll get a job, work outside the house.

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,817
Jeez, it's tough.

53
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,554
With what's going on, I want her here.

54
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,331
That's why I told her to come home.

55
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,697
Bye, dear.

56
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,533
You could've backed me up.

57
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,043
Might've made it worse.

58
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,110
The FLQ kidnaps two political figures.

59
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:12,274
Federal authorities proclaim the
War Measures Act.

60
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,114
450 citizens are imprisoned.

61
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,789
All are eventually released

62
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,552
without any charges having been laid.

63
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,821
This film is based on interviews

64
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,056
with 50 of them.

65
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,134
I'll be gone for 10 minutes.

66
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,102
Again?

67
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,604
What do you mean, again?
- What for?

68
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,939
I have to look into a grievance.

69
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,676
Goddamn union!

70
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,754
<i>My name is Louise Forestier</i>

71
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,328
<i>and in this film I play</i>
<i>the role of Claudette Dusseault</i>.

72
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,566
<i>I've been a social worker for 4 years</i>.

73
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,475
<i>I'm based in St Henri</i>

74
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,645
and I love my work.

75
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,942
There's so much to be done...

76
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,018
and not only here in St Henri.

77
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,880
I've...

78
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,380
always been

79
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,791
a fighter

80
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,220
sometimes using force...

81
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,625
sometimes

82
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,562
my wits

83
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,261
of social injustice.

84
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,602
<i>I like this work and I believe in it</i>.

85
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,832
Claudette!

86
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,205
They took everything!
- I'll handle it.

87
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,740
The stove, the fridge, the sofa...

88
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,883
Leave this to me.
- Nothing's left.

89
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,319
Put that all back inside!

90
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,351
Mr...? Martineau.

91
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,583
I'm the one who called you yesterday

92
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,623
We had an arrangement.

93
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,352
What's all this?

94
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,724
I said the welfare office

95
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,330
would take care of it.

96
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,900
Not the chairs! How many are you?

97
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,466
Four.

98
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,401
Law says we leave 4 chairs.

99
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,844
Look, I've seen plenty of social workers.

100
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,277
They're nice folks

101
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,042
but they don't pay my bills.

102
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,452
Guys like him make me sick.

103
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,348
What'd you say?

104
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:40,984
You make me sick!

105
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,125
Clermont!

106
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:49,663
What?

107
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,660
I'm warning you.

108
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,931
If you leave the floor again

109
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,231
I'll suspend you for 2 days.

110
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,702
Finished.

111
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,041
You know damn well

112
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,741
that union reps can look into grievances.

113
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,751
Grievance or not, I'll suspend you.

114
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,245
Oh yeah?

115
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,150
I'll tell my union boss.

116
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,381
Then I'll suspend you indefinitely.

117
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,394
I'll have you thrown out!

118
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,685
Don't need to hide to drink at your age, Léo.

119
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:56,102
I have two good seats for tonight's game.
Want to go?

120
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,262
No thanks.

121
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,767
I'm driving a cab.

122
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,442
I'm back to driving a cab.

123
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,868
I was suspended.

124
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,273
Jesus!

125
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,148
Didn't I warn you?

126
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,353
You and your damn union!

127
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,825
The way I see it, Clermont

128
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,792
you ought to hang up your skates.

129
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,725
You've done your share.

130
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,666
Struggling to make ends meet...

131
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,609
<i>Police Launch Wave of Arrests</i>

132
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,109
Anyway...

133
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,547
Hey, listen...

134
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,588
Have you heard

135
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,025
the army's in town?

136
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,253
Yeah, sure!

137
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,996
They're just trying to scare us.

138
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,464
Listen, Clermont...

139
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:08,102
Your credit's always good here, you know

140
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,401
Thanks.

141
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,207
It worked out because we wanted
to take a week off

142
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:20,819
to visit his parents in Lac St Jean.
His dad was over <i>7</i>0.

143
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,881
It had been a long time

144
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,382
and we'd just gotten a letter...

145
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,716
It's been 5 years since you last came to visit.

146
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,558
The doctor says

147
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,768
to tell Clermont

148
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,259
that his father will need a little boost

149
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,629
to get through the winter.

150
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,434
But don't let him know I told you.

151
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,471
He's not very well.

152
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,408
She underlined "not very well."

153
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,881
She say why?

154
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,146
It's his old illness.

155
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,751
He's always muttered

156
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,592
about having to slave away

157
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,458
getting up at dawn, working hard all day

158
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,362
Well, he's stopped muttering.

159
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,433
I'm the one slaving away

160
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,944
and I could do with a little boost myself.

161
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,470
Love to you both, Mathilda.

162
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,649
Mom, André's throwing rocks at me.

163
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:31,479
You punk!

164
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,257
I'll kick you in the pants

165
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,719
and tell your dad!

166
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,699
Where are the cookies?

167
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,998
What?
- The cookies!

168
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,935
In the pantry.

169
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,530
There's a box open.

170
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,385
Where's Clermont going?
- Is he driving a cab again?

171
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,547
He was suspended

172
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,049
cause of that foreman.

173
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,793
Careful! Don't stand in front of a machine gun!

174
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,465
I'll stuff a cork up the barrel!

175
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,271
What are they up to with their army?

176
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,977
It's getting chill<i>y</i>

177
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,978
Grampa!

178
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,552
Getting cold?

179
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,988
So he said: Cost a lot to learn to drink.

180
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,093
Not gonna give it up now.

181
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,635
We only have one life.
Imagine spending it crazy!

182
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,282
I'm cold.

183
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,411
I'm going in.

184
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,850
Ok Grampa, time for bed.

185
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,559
Mr Prime Minister,
The Chief of Police informs us

186
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,233
that assistance from higher
government levels is essential

187
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,466
to protect society

188
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,080
from the sedition and
apprehended insurrection

189
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,479
made evident by the recent kidnappings.

190
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:42,279
We request all the support
you deem appropriate

191
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,217
to protect our citizens.
- The Mayor

192
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,479
Mom! Who is that?

193
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,747
Call the police.
- What's the number?

194
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,684
Mom, they're on the porch!

195
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,137
Anybody in there?

196
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,435
All right, that's enough.

197
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,871
What's going on?

198
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,515
Do you have a warrant?

199
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,521
Don't need one. There's a new law.

200
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,048
It was just passed.

201
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,190
Did you check the end of the hall?

202
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,295
Look in the cupboards.

203
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,595
I thought they'd gone craz<i>y</i>

204
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,174
We hadn't done anything wrong

205
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,505
and they broke in like thugs.

206
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,441
I was pretty shaken up.

207
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,579
<i>The War Measures Act just now decreed</i>

208
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:23,756
<i>authorizes the police and army</i>
<i>to arrest without a warrant</i>

209
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,351
<i>those they suspect belong</i>
<i>to an illegal organization</i>

210
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,954
<i>or who declare they are members of such</i>.

211
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,562
<i>Further, the police may search</i>
<i>without a warrant any place</i>

212
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,735
<i>where they suspect members of such an</i>
<i>organization are hidden</i>

213
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,102
<i>or are holding someone illegally</i>.

214
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,407
<i>This has been a special news bulletin</i>.

215
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,967
My name's Claude Gauthier.

216
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,732
In the film I play Richard Lavoie.

217
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,239
I'm unemployed.

218
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,173
I have two children.

219
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,715
I look after them and I really like it.

220
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,721
Richard Lavoie?

221
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,621
No, he lives next door.

222
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,449
Next door?

223
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,290
4058?

224
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,355
Wait a minute.

225
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,102
Police, open up.

226
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,843
What is it?

227
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,695
We've got company, kid.

228
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,890
Where's your wife?

229
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,130
She's at work.

230
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,796
Where?

231
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,237
Waitress, night shift.

232
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,639
Oops, that's dangerous!

233
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,439
Can I see your search warrant?

234
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,578
Don't need one.

235
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,724
Do I have the right to know what's up?

236
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,652
You have no rights.

237
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,861
Look, as far as I know

238
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,633
people always have rights.

239
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,569
This is war.

240
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,764
War? What war?

241
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,104
We've got orders.

242
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,810
What do you think, kid?

243
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,914
If you guys have orders, the grocer's next door

244
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,892
I don't keep my dynamite in the fridge.

245
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,225
Smoked all my pot last week.

246
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,871
<i>My name is Guy Provost</i>

247
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:07,640
<i>and from now on I am</i>
<i>Dr Jean Marie Beauchemin</i>.

248
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,947
<i>I head a community health clinic</i>

249
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,950
<i>for people with low incomes</i>

250
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,663
and I once ran

251
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,291
as a socialist candidate.

252
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,102
I lost, of course.

253
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,978
<i>We had no rights at all</i>.

254
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,637
<i>But they had the right</i>

255
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,082
<i>to do whatever they wanted</i>.

256
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,917
<i>To them we were</i>

257
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,121
<i>common criminals, maybe worse</i>.

258
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,318
<i>They even watched as I got dressed</i>.

259
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,686
Do you want this coat?

260
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,146
Handcuffs?

261
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,019
Not behind his back!

262
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,562
Call the clinic.

263
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,060
Speak to Demers.

264
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,736
Tell him what happened. This won't take long.

265
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,739
I'll get a lawyer.

266
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,771
Call Jac<i>q</i>ues.

267
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,417
If Demers isn't in, speak to nurse Parenteau.

268
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,062
Where are you taking him?
- You'll be told.

269
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,841
Unbelievable...

270
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,001
It's outrageous!

271
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,009
Do you know why you were arrested?

272
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,417
I was never told.

273
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,855
I didn't let it show, but I was scared shitless.

274
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,263
<i>And then my shoelace broke</i>.

275
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,289
<i>Not that it matters</i>.

276
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,394
<i>So then</i>...

277
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,964
What'll you do with the kids?

278
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,438
What do you mean?

279
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,605
We're taking you in.

280
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,781
Who're you calling?
- My wife.

281
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,154
To tell her to come?

282
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,255
Yeah.

283
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,858
Ok, let him call.

284
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,896
Sébastien!

285
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,300
What?

286
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,368
Give your little brother some cereal.

287
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,169
He won't eat.
- Sure he will.

288
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,305
He's not hungry.

289
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,152
Ginette, please.

290
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,684
Ok, I'll wait. There's no hurry.

291
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,201
Captain!

292
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,470
They want to talk to you.

293
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,704
Captain!

294
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,478
That girl wants to go back to bed.

295
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,643
Tell her we're taking her in.

296
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,852
Ginette...

297
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,923
Listen, the cops are here.

298
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,325
I don't know.

299
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,463
Yeah, he's up.

300
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,266
Tell them the baby's sick.

301
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,609
Can we wait till she gets here?

302
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,974
How long?

303
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,607
10 minutes.

304
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,004
Alright.

305
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,939
Ok, we'll wait for you.

306
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,884
I'll tell you later.

307
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,920
Get your coat.

308
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,254
I can't leave the kids. You said we'd wait.

309
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,492
We'll wait.

310
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,049
See, we're not such bad guys.

311
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,400
There's Daddy!

312
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,354
What's that for? Take it off.

313
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,097
Mom!
- I'm not cold!

314
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,897
Are you scared?
- No!

315
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,211
<i>But of course inside I was scared</i>.

316
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,646
<i>I tried not to cry in front of the girls</i>.

317
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:28,876
<i>With the chill and my nerves, I was shaking</i>.

318
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,913
<i>Besides, I wasn't sure</i>

319
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,524
<i>if they were real policemen</i>.

320
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,090
<i>I wondered who they were</i>.

321
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,262
<i>There was one of them</i>

322
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
<i>who didn't look like a gangster</i>

323
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,566
<i>but he didn't look like a cop either</i>

324
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,411
<i>So where's your husband?</i>

325
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,118
<i>I told you, he's working</i>.

326
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,484
<i>Come on</i>.

327
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,651
<i>Where to?</i>

328
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,992
Where to? Jail.

329
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,457
No, Mom, don't leave us!

330
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,395
I can't tell you where he is.

331
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,635
I don't know myself.

332
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,805
Where does he work?
- He's driving a cab.

333
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,467
Ok, come on, get dressed.

334
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,005
We're taking her in.

335
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,120
No, Mom!

336
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:38,980
You can't go!

337
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,722
<i>That young policeman didn't say a word</i>.

338
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,127
<i>He just stood there with his hands</i>
<i>behind his back</i>.

<i>But I could tell he found it disgusting</i>.

<i>He wasn't proud of being a cop then</i>.

341
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,199
That's her, let's go.

00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,928
Richard, what's wrong?

343
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,793
<i>The two little ones were crying</i>.

344
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,989
<i>Monique wanted to console me</i>
<i>but didn't know what to say</i>.

345
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,268
<i>She just kept saying:</i>
<i>I love you, Mom. I love you</i>.

346
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,532
I can't leave you alone.

347
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,280
I'll call Mme Thibault.

348
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,077
Stay away from the phone.

349
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,489
What do you mean?

350
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,818
I can't leave them alone.

351
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,323

takes care of her kids.

No, he didn't arrest me, it was Binette.

380
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,644
Doesn't matter.

381
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,406
Binette arrested me!

382
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,753

Got a new band.

They're all mixed up.
They don't know who to arrest next.

Can you get her out?

Mom told us to go to school.

391
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,403
I don't feel like going.
- Me neither.

392
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,940
What did Mom say?
- We have to go.

You're in charge now.

00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,060
I'm counting on you.

403

<i>I knew they'd pick me up</i>.

405

<i>The worst was</i>

406

<i>knowing Marie was in jail</i>.

407
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,242
<i>I imagined her sitting in jail, under arrest</i>...

408
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:01,379
<i>And there was nothing I could do. I felt rotten</i>.

<i>You don't know why you're there,</i>

413

<i>or what's going to happen to you</i>.

414
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,609
<i>You just have to guess</i>.

415
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,838
<i>None of us had been charged</i>.

416
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,449
<i>We thought they'd let us go</i>.

- French Canadian.

507
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,725
Obviously.

508
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,894
Put <i>Québécois</i> if you want.

509
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,870
Don't be smart.

510
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,568
Don't be dumb.

511
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,475
Up till then I'd been hoping they'd let us go...

512
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,649
they'd see it was all a mistake.

513
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,149
But then they gave us those uniforms...

514
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,352
<i>Christ!</i>

515
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:13,023
<i>Looking down at yourself</i>... <i>brown shirt, grey</i>
<i>pants, boots</i>

516
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,898
<i>you don't recognize yourself</i>.

517
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,765
<i>You've got nothing of your own</i>.

518
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,698
That'll do.

519
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:29,168
<i>That's when you realize</i>
<i>how important clothes are</i>.

520
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,670
<i>They're who you are</i>.

521
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,913
<i>And then the sheets</i>...

522
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,784
<i>You wonder how long you'll be sleeping there</i>.

523
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,863
<i>A year, two years? You have no way of</i>
<i>knowing</i>.

524
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,194
Next!

525
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,427
Ok, this way.

526
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,970
That's when you realize you're in prison.

527
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,298
And for what? Nothing.

528
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,775
The first thing you know is you're...

529
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,549
stark naked

530
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:13,856
and there's a dozen guards looking you over
from head to foot.

531
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,626
It's not a <i>q</i>uestion of modesty, but...

532
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,755
Go on, scrub up!

533
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,092
<i>It's humiliating</i>.

534
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,671
<i>They do it just to embarrass you</i>.

535
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,809
<i>Undressing doesn't bother me</i>

536
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,175
<i>but only when I want to</i>.

537
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:42,307
Gotta respect people's sense of modesty.

538
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,917
Wait here.

539
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,796
Left hand.

540
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,146
That's it.

541
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,513
Sit down.

542
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,599
<i>It hit home. We were really in jail</i>.

543
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,845
<i>Locking up a housewife</i>

544
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,814
who'd spent her life changing diapers

545
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,576
washing up and cleaning house...

546
00:50:55,819 --> 00:51:00,017
who'd never talked politics
except to agree with her husband...

547
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,083
That's hard to take!

548
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,756
<i>What struck me was the colour of the walls</i>.

549
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,766
<i>It drives you crazy</i>.

550
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:45,766
Ok, stop.

551
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,705
<i>The prison itself was modern, clean, cold</i>.

552
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:55,743
<i>But with all those doors slamming behind you</i>...

553
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,878
<i>Such a miscarriage of justice!</i>

554
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,176
<i>That's why the colour gets to you</i>.

555
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,447
<i>Though it's pretty ordinary</i>.

556
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,086
Ok, move on.

557
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:17,961
Sit down there.

558
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,274
Hand in all your personal belongings...

559
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,712
rings, watches

560
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,250
necklaces, handbags.

561
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,815
They'll be returned later.

562
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,354
Mlle Claudette Dusseault, please.

563
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:56,896
Next.

564
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,874
You're not allowed to shave me.

565
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,248
It's an ampu...

566
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,251
Sit down!

567
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,095
Well, seems I've got no choice.

568
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,216
<i>No, I wasn't scared then</i>.

569
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,621
<i>I don't think the others were either</i>.

570
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,754
<i>The fear came later</i>.

571
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:39,361
You can't feel much, they
keep moving you around.

572
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,903
<i>They led us from one place to another</i>

573
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,975
<i>Never said, We're taking you to the elevator</i>
<i>Just did it</i>.

574
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,010
<i>And you wait</i>.

575
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,047
<i>You may wait 10 minutes</i>.

576
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,853
Number nine.

577
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,042
<i>It hit me when I got in the cell</i>.

578
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:39,522
<i>I was in a rage. It wasn't right</i>.

579
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,683
<i>They had to tell me why I was there</i>.

580
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:46,362
Locking me in that cell
without telling me why...

581
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,555
<i>it just couldn't be</i>.

582
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:53,769
<i>The worst part is the sense of paralysis</i>.

583
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,867
<i>There's no room to move around</i>.

584
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,875
<i>You're caught, trapped</i>.

585
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,127
Everybody up. 8 o'clock.

586
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,599
Come on, get up.

587
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,513
Get up, it's 8.

588
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,182
C'mon, get up.

589
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,223
<i>They kept us in our cells for five days</i>.

590
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:57,457
<i>We weren't let out, couldn't wash or shave</i>.

591
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:02,637
We had to use the water from
the toilet bowl to wash our faces.

592
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,102
<i>For 3 days straight we ate porridge</i>.

593
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,078
Se<i>rv</i>ice stinks... I'll change jail!

594
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,083
<i>Porridge</i>.

595
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:26,524
<i>Cold porridge, like cardboard no milk, no sugar</i>

596
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,520
Where's the spoon?

597
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,135
<i>Swill fit for pigs and even they wouldn't eat it</i>.

598
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:41,003
<i>Porridge, morning, noon and night</i>.

599
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,867
<i>Goddamn porridge</i>.

600
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:51,143
I stopped eating tillTuesday,
when they gave us real food.

601
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,248
Knit one

602
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,142
pearl one

603
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,755
knit one...

604
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,027
Look at me, I've always loathed knitting!

605
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:14,730
<i>I did everything to keep busy</i>

606
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:17,098
<i>Even tried knitting</i>.

607
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:20,701
<i>Kept starting over, but I just couldn't get it</i>.

608
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,638
<i>In jail, it's like you're no good at anything</i>.

609
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,984
<i>We smoked, read and knit</i>.

610
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,878
<i>Boring as hell</i>.

611
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,923
<i>When you're in jail, at the beginning</i>

612
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,328
you're given nothing.

613
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,736
It's all calculated.

614
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,465
You have nothing at all.

615
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,734
No cigarettes, no razor

616
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,472
no aspirin, not even salt for your food.

617
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,341
So you ask them for things.

618
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,455
And then, one by one, they start giving you

619
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:09,016
all those little things that seem so essential.

620
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,556
So the guards become benefactors.

621
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,627
<i>You see what being inside is like</i>.

622
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,662
<i>Everything's upsidedown</i>.

623
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:25,636
<i>One of the privileges is to wash the floors</i>.

624
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:30,069
<i>You get so you want to wash the floors</i>.

625
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:47,094
Hey, could you please change the station?

626
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,597
Yeah, a French station. It's our right!

627
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,499
Hey, wise guy...

628
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,362
Since when do prisoners have rights?

629
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,530
You have no rights.

630
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,405
You're given privileges.

631
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,380
Hey, here comes the canteen.

632
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,089
Time to stuff our faces.

633
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:24,733
Beaulieu.

634
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:40,849
Lavoie.

635
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,450
Careful of the floor, guys.

636
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,456
Wipe your socks before you come out.

637
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,733

<i>It's not that we were mistreated or beaten</i>.

643
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,220
<i>At least I wasn't</i>.

644
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,363
<i>It was knowing that our families</i>

645
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,756
<i>had no news of us</i>.

646
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,696
No one knew where we were
or when we'd come back.

647
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,800
<i>Some had no one to care for their babies</i>.

648
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:26,280
I kept thinking of my girls and
how they must be crying.

649
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,911
<i>To me it was all very cruel</i>.

650
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,412
<i>Others were worse off</i>.

651
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,118
Now, now, don't cry.

652
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:41,092
That's ok, dear.

653
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:52,100
It'll be all right.

654
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,441
This won't last much longer.

655
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:03,376
It's just a big mistake.

656
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,180
They'll see that.

657
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,358
Don't cry.

658
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,296
Tomorrow you'll be free.

659
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:29,909
It's not easy when you feel like crying, too.

660
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,738
You don't know what to say.

661
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:52,093
<i>B2 North, come to the door</i>.

662
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,983
Lucky man, Boudreau!

663
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,860
Lucky Boudreau!

664
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,752
It's your father...

665
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:51,523
He's dead?

666
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,199
Will they let me out?

667
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:04,664
We'll see. I'll tell you.

668
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,140
Well...

669
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:16,046
I guess this business with me didn't help.

670
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:22,285
Hearing where I was must've killed him.

671
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,118
Somebody's going to pay for this.

672
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,855
What?

673
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,763
Forget it.

674
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,457
<i>They really gave it to Lavoie</i>.

675
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,891
One night they took him

676
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,758
and interrogated him for 3 hours.

677
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,032
They told him he'd be executed in 3 days.

678
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,632
And he believed them.

679
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,771
<i>Awful</i>...

680
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,271
<i>Can you imagine those three days?</i>

681
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,662
What's Beauchemin's number? 5.

682
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,470
Put the lights on in 5.

683
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,457
Get up. A search.

684
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,523
Someone smuggled something in.

685
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:13,892
Do the back, I'll do the front.

686
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,818
Check the fan too.

687
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:03,314
<i>That wasn't the first time</i>.

688
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:06,716
<i>Every night they found new ways to harass us</i>

689
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,550
<i>to humiliate us</i>.

690
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:18,461
<i>Being so helpless made us furious</i>.

691
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:23,301
<i>The scars we bear will never heal</i>.

692
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:27,440
<i>I was worried about my wife</i>.

693
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,612
<i>She was going to have the baby any day</i>

694
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,645
<i>and I'd had no news</i>.

695
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,184
<i>They'd managed to create a psychosis in us</i>.

696
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:45,556
We were so humiliated,
we didn't even know how to react.

697
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,427
<i>Besides</i>...

698
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,971
You won't believe what I'm going to say

699
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,972
but it's true.

700
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,606
They sentenced me to death.

701
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,950
Not a court, the guards.

702
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,352
They said I'd be shot in 3 days.

703
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,790
And I believed them.

704
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:26,230
Under those circumstances you can't help it

705
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:29,034
I think.

706
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,663
<i>I spent those 3 days in a state of utter panic</i>

707
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,101
<i>sick with fear</i>.

708
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:39,943
I was going to die without even knowing why.

709
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,041
<i>It was absurd, but I was helpless</i>.

710
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,343
<i>I was paralysed</i>.

711
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,047
<i>3 days, 3 nights, alone</i>

712
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:51,257
<i>lying on my cot, shaking</i>.

713
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,120
<i>It was horrible</i>.

714
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:59,595
I was scared. I'm not much of a hero

715
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:03,061
<i>but probably no one could be brave</i>

716
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,031
<i>in a situation like that</i>.

717
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:19,084
<i>They came to get me the third night</i>.

718
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:24,553
Come on.

719
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,563
Move!

720
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:33,993
C'mon!

721
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,730
Where are you taking me?

722
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,220
You know where.

723
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,933
Down to the end.

724
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,615
All the way.

725
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,776
<i>It was just to scare me, the bastards</i>.

726
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,578
<i>They used blanks</i>.

727
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,843
<i>I went into shock, and fell</i>.

728
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,777
<i>I passed out</i>.

729
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:12,225
When I woke up I was in my cell.

730
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:19,294
And when you wake up from
an experience like that...

731
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,386
Never been to Lac St Jean?

732
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:50,528
Lord! How many times must I tell you? No.

733
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,498
Or to Robe<i>rv</i>al?

734
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,428
No, absolutely not.

735
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,368
My husband's been there, but not me.

736
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,705
And you don't know these names?

737
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,613
All right...

738
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,711
It seems you're not being charged.

739
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,144
You were arrested by mistake.

740
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,184
You're free.

741
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,128
Why'd you do this?

742
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,343
I'm free!

743
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,883
Claudette! I'm free to go!

744
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,688
What? I'm free!

745
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:49,657
I don't believe it! That's wonderful!

746
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,019
What about us?

747
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:56,855
Marie is free!

748
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,433
When can we go?

749
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:04,039
What did they say?

750
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:05,802
How about us?

751
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,343
They just said I was free.

752
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,005
Doesn't matter. It's a good sign.

753
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,613
First one...

754
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,911
They're going to release us one by one.

755
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,564
Marie's free!

756
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,395
Marie's leaving!

757
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,577
<i>I only heard about his father</i>

758
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:30,683
<i>when I got home, after si</i>x <i>days in jail</i>.

759
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,185
Maybe it doesn't seem long

760
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:38,727
but six days in jail, tormenting yourself, is long.

761
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,886
Stop that!

762
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,600
What's going on?

763
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:17,799
What's going on is that common sense

764
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,700
says Boudreau should be allowed to leave
because of his father.

765
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:26,372
It's the minimum of decency.

766
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:29,044
Are you listening?

767
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,776
The minimum!

768
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,188
I can't make that decision.

769
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,786
The Minister of Justice

770
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:40,553
gives the orders. We carry them out.

771
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,622
Who would treat a man that way?

772
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,827
Have you lost your father?

773
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:53,036
Besides, not one of us has been charged.

774
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,869
Why're we being held?

775
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:01,206
We still have fundamental rights.

776
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,115
Dr Beauchemin, you know...

777
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:08,452
Forget the Dr and do something for Clermont.

778
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:12,016
You know we have to follow our orders.

779
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,690
Orders! From whom?

780
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,928
From heaven?

781
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,062
I'll look into it.

782
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,656
45 minutes I've been waiting...

783
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,187
Yes?

784
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:24,691
Yes?

785
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:28,896
Yes, I'll wait.

786
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,001
It's the Minister!

787
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:42,074
Yes...

788
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,081
This is Mme Clermont Boudreau.

789
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:48,846
It's my husband who's in jail.

790
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:50,648
Yes.

791
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:52,383
Well...

792
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:57,062
My husband's father just died and...

793
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:01,166
I wondered if, I mean...

794
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:05,164
given the circumstances, and that he's been in
jail 10 days

795
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,408
with no charge...

796
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:11,078
I thought maybe you could let him out.

797
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:15,480
I thought that

798
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,919
for humanitarian reasons, you know

799
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:21,312
under the circumstances...

800
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,558
But this is different.

801
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:30,893
I know there's a special law but those people...

802
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:43,201
Exactly.

803
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:46,880
You'd best pray to God for guidance!

804
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,343
I don't understand

805
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:56,487
why you can't make that decision yourself.

806
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,168
I'll wait for your call.

807
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:12,735
Thank you, sir.

808
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:19,877
We don't weigh heavily on his conscience.

809
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,618
Take Lavoie's name off the board.

810
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,094
You're free.

811
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,470
It's not true!

812
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,760
Get undressed.

813
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,901
What's this?
- Get undressed!

814
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,871
But you said I was free.

815
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:26,812
Want us to do it for you?

816
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,682
Take it easy.

817
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:52,165
Goddamn filthy pigs!

818
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:54,468
Lavoie...

819
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:57,545
we'll get you yet.

820
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,876
You pig!

821
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,875
Just you try!

822
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:21,500
Françoise?

823
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:23,430
Yeah, it's me.

824
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,332
Just walked in the door

825
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,840
when the telephone rang.

826
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:34,913
They kept me six days, more than enough.

827
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,985
No, they didn't torture me.

828
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,812
You should see my place.

829
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,184
It's incredible.

830
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:46,460
They came back while I was in jail.

831
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,686
It wasn't this bad when I left.

832
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:51,497
It's a real mess.

833
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:54,099
The plants, record player, books.

834
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,002
You should see it.

835
01:27:57,405 --> 01:27:59,674
They didn't even lock the door.

836
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:02,010
<i>Want me to help clean up?</i>

837
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,945
It's a huge job.

838
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,242
<i>That's ok</i>.

839
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:09,472
Oh, I meant to tell you.
Be careful on the phone.

840
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,818
<i>They have wire taps</i>.

841
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:11,786
What?

842
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,521
<i>Yeah, they record your calls</i>.

843
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,045
Well let them!

844
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,590
Tap all you want, see if I care!

845
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:23,086
<i>My life's an open book. I've nothing to hide</i>.

846
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:25,297
<i>Are you there?</i>

847
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,968
<i>Go on, give it to'em!</i>

848
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,833
<i>Hello there, police</i>.

849
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:32,262
<i>Must look stupid with their tape recorders</i>.

850
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:44,718
I couldn't sleep. First time in my life
I was really scared.

851
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:46,615
<i>We all get scared</i>

852
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:50,952
<i>but not damn scared. This time I was</i>.

853
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,925
<i>All night long in the dark I felt it</i>.

854
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,195
<i>I heard every sound</i>.

855
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:01,457
<i>Like when they came for</i>
<i>Maurice and brought him back</i>.

856
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:04,596
<i>The least noise, someone breathing</i>

857
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:07,172
<i>or moaning in his sleep</i>.

858
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,869
<i>I couldn't stop listening, I was too scared</i>.

859
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:34,628
Maurice!

860
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:44,734
Clermont...

861
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:50,978
What is it?

862
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:55,482
I have to get out of here.

863
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,988
They said they'd kill me.

864
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,831
Get the nurse.

865
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,897
Yeah, but...

866
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:10,069
everything's closed after 11:00.

867
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:13,404
Did they beat you up?

868
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,638
Call the priest!

869
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,651
Boudreau, come to the gate.

870
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:31,887
<i>I was pretty worried about Maurice</i>

871
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:35,893
<i>but I was even more worried for myself</i>.

872
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,032
<i>I wondered when they'd come for me</i>.

873
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,728
You ok?
- I guess so.

874
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,562
Boudreau!

875
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,473
Clermont, I'm scared.

876
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:49,943
They're going to shoot me. Listen...

877
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,580
They would've done it by now.

878
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,247
Get some rest and don't be scared.

879
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,663
What's that for?

880
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,036
You're going to see your father.

881
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,875
At this time of night?

882
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,149
Those are our orders.

883
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:32,118
Unbelievable!

884
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:29,501
<i>They didn't want us to know they'd given in</i>

885
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:33,011
<i>so they waited till we were asleep</i>.

886
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:36,178
<i>They came for him at 3:00 a. M</i>.

887
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:38,452
To take him to see his father.

888
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,378
<i>St Joseph was pretty far</i>...

889
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:45,224
<i>but they didn't ease up</i>.

890
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:49,392
<i>Not allowed to smoke, handcuffs</i>...

891
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:53,363
<i>Four guards and they kept the cuffs on</i>.

892
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:57,533
<i>To take him to see his dead father!</i>

893
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:01,731
This way.

894
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:15,515
Oh my God!

895
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:42,158
Didn't stay long.

896
01:35:49,343 --> 01:35:53,677
<i>It was in the month of October</i>

897
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:58,209
<i>in St Joseph d'Alma</i>.

898
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:02,988
<i>Although my life is sober</i>

899
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:07,186
<i>it is coming to an end</i>.

900
01:36:08,195 --> 01:36:12,291
<i>I pack my bags</i>

901
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:16,926
<i>To the station I go</i>.

902
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:22,066
<i>Today I'm leaving you</i>

903
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:26,343
<i>for a long time</i>.

904
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:33,449
<i>When you come to this world</i>

905
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:37,785
<i>you feel tall and strong</i>.

906
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:42,791
<i>And you laugh at yourself</i>

907
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:47,460
<i>for having feared death</i>.

908
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:51,860
<i>Hope, is born again</i>...

909
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:57,040
<i>We must preserve it well</i>.

910
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:02,712
<i>Cast off your false masters</i>

911
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:08,282
<i>This is freedom</i>.

912
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:14,595
<i>To hear him singing, to give himself courage</i>

913
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:18,361
a song his father sang to him as a boy...

914
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,099
<i>There, was silence</i>.

915
01:37:22,236 --> 01:37:24,830
<i>It made us stop and think</i>.

916
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:32,808
<i>If he could still sing after all that</i>

917
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:36,150
<i>our own little problems didn't seem so bad</i>.

918
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:39,950
But it was getting harder and harder to bear.

919
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:47,927
Believe, it or not, they
interrogated him that night.

920
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:52,829
You know how it is.
You're wrong no matter what.

921
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:55,199
So you won't talk?

922
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,364
I've nothing to say.

923
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,598
You're only hurting yourself.

924
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:05,644
All your pals talked.

925
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:09,438
So don't try to pretend.

926
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:13,310
You'll get 20 years, minimum

927
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:19,324
unless they decide to shoot you.

928
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:21,958
In Robe<i>rv</i>al

929
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:26,093
did you meet a man named Brochu?

930
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:35,398
We have ways to take care of people like you.

931
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:43,315
You have the right to speak,
but not others, huh?

932
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:53,191
Alright.

933
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:56,295
That's enough. You can go back now.

934
01:38:56,797 --> 01:38:58,628
Yeah, back to yourcoffin.

935
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:11,241
They must've given up trying to make me talk

936
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:13,839
so they let me go.

937
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:15,975
<i>You're, in no hurry, huh?</i>

938
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:22,920
Bye, Maurice.

939
01:39:24,591 --> 01:39:25,956
Here, Gaétan.

940
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:29,727
Good luck, kid.

941
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:36,793
Bye, Gaétan.

942
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:38,602
Bye, Maurice.

943
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:40,931
See you, guys!

944
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:44,306
Have one for me, a cold one!

945
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:46,436
Bye, Richard. Bastard!

946
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,911
Won't be long.

947
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:57,883
You're going to miss us, you'll see.

948
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,525
<i>They kept me locked up another si</i>x <i>days</i>.

949
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:06,864
<i>Waiting was the hardest</i>.

950
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:13,999
<i>When there's no charge, you can't defend</i>
<i>yourself</i>.

951
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:18,807
<i>You think you'll never be free again</i>.

952
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:23,607
<i>When they let me go, after 21 days</i>

953
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:29,588
<i>I spent a few weeks in a psychiatric ward</i>.

954
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:37,052
They destroyed a part of me.

955
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:42,134
I feel like I'm...

956
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:45,832
older than other people my age.

957
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,899
I've lost my innocence.

958
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:54,308
What I've told you...

959
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:58,080
is true, every terrible word of it.

960
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:33,342
Pierre Bélanger!

961
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,222
Sign there.

962
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,253
Clermont Bourdeau!

963
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:43,118
It's <i>Boudreau</i>!

964
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,642
Sign the envelope and you can go.

965
01:41:59,012 --> 01:42:01,503
Don't you drive us home?

966
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:02,410
Forget it.

967
01:42:02,716 --> 01:42:05,412
I think you can find your own way.

968
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,886
Dr Jean-Marie Beauchemin.

969
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:15,587
See you!

970
01:42:22,736 --> 01:42:24,226
Stuff, your <i>See you</i>!

971
01:42:25,372 --> 01:42:28,675
After what happened here...

972
01:42:28,675 --> 01:42:32,042
I almost died. You won't see me again!

973
01:42:32,412 --> 01:42:34,812
You drag me here like a dog

974
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,780
shut me up in a hole for 16 days.

975
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:42,523
16 days in a cell, and then
you say it was a mistake!

976
01:42:42,523 --> 01:42:44,320
Mistakes like that...

977
01:42:45,259 --> 01:42:47,523
Next time I'll be ready!

978
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:51,556
Don't bother, they just follow orders.

979
01:42:51,965 --> 01:42:55,696
Next time there'll be a trial, out in the street!

980
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:18,886
When we were arrested,
it made all the headlines.

981
01:43:19,893 --> 01:43:22,054
<i>But, when they let us go</i>

982
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:25,494
<i>do you think that was news? No way!</i>

983
01:43:26,767 --> 01:43:28,064
<i>Outside, it was like</i>

984
01:43:28,802 --> 01:43:30,736
<i>nothing had happened</i>.

985
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:14,403
Now that it's over, what are you going to do?

986
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:18,049
Go back to work.

987
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:23,089
I've got no choice. That's how I was raised.

988
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:28,826
Just so people learn from this.

989
01:44:29,396 --> 01:44:31,762
Like Marie says...

990
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:34,356
after the ice jams the rivers flow again.

991
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:06,095
<i>What happened to us</i>

992
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:08,525
<i>is nothing really</i>.

993
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:12,030
<i>But we must realize</i>

994
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:16,273
<i>it shows something's rotten somewhere</i>.

995
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:20,236
<i>We mustn't let the sickness spread</i>.

996
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:57,941
This film is based on the true stories
of the victims of the War Measures Act.
