1
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,000
 
Innocence

2
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,359
 
- What's your name?
- Iris.

3
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:14,220
 
Good morning, Iris.

4
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:20,493
 
These are Nadja, Rose, Vera… 

5
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,618
 
… Alice and Selma.

6
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,844
 
And I am Bianca.

7
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:09,179
 
Rose, Vera, come, quick.

8
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,979
 
Selma, you also.

9
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,526
 
Hurry.

10
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:49,055
 
Change of ribbons.

11
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:03,160
 
You see, Iris, each one 
has a ribbon color.

12
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:05,591
 
The red one is for small ones.

13
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,376
 
And violet for the one in charge.

14
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:15,336
 
No, violet is Natacha's color.

15
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:18,554
 
She went away, now I wear the violet one.

16
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,489
 
Liar.

17
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,688
 
Don't worry, she'll get over it.

18
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:38,893
 
Iris, you will sleep here 
and I will sleep over there.

19
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:24,580
 
Bianca, where is 
my younger brother?

20
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:26,644
 
There are no males here.

21
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,856
 
- Why not?
- Because.

22
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,549
 
- But, where am I?
- This is our house.

23
00:11:57,427 --> 00:12:00,031
 
You will also learn to swim.

24
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:28,920
 
- Now try yourself 
- you see, how fun it is? 

25
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,386
 
- You must also move the legs. That's right.
- Raise your legs. That's right. 

26
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:44,780
 
And forward, that's right

27
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,839
 
You also arrived today?

28
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:20,310
 
Yes, but I will not remain 
for long.

29
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,852
 
- Laura, come.
- Can I be with Iris?

30
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,920
 
No, you're not in the same house.
But you will be able to see her tomorrow.

31
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:12,344
 
You see, Iris, there are 5 houses in the park, 
one for each group of girls.

32
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:16,945
 
Laura is in house #1 and you are in
house #3, with us.

33
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,193
 
This is Madeleine, she is 
here to serve us.

34
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:18,224
 
If she does not obey us she will be punished.

35
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:45,043
 
I want to go back home.

36
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,313
 
This is your home now.

37
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,915
 
- But they are going to come to look for to me
- No.

38
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:55,407
 
Will my brother be able to visit me?

39
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:56,979
 
No, no.

40
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:03,985
 
Iris.

41
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:07,967
 
Iris.

42
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,662
 
Come.

43
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:23,477
 
- I am going to show you the house.
- And Bianca, where is she?

44
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,867
 
Bianca.

45
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:42,762
 
Bianca.

46
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:46,069
 
- Where are you going?
- I can't tell you.

47
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,849
 
- Why not?
- Because.

48
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:51,203
 
- I want to go with you.
- That is not possible.

49
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:53,082
 
- Why not?
- Because.

50
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,554
 
- Leave her alone, she must go now.
- No.

51
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,229
 
- Leave her alone.
- No.

52
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,786
 
I promise that when 
you wake up tomorrow morning I will be there with you.

53
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:52,559
 
It is always so.
At 9 we leave.

54
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:55,892
 
- At 10 we go to sleep.
- At 7 we wake up.

55
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:58,800
 
- At 8 we have breakfast.
- At 9 we work.

56
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,566
 
- Work?
- Yes.

57
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:06,029
 
Do you know what time it is now?
Here that is very important.

58
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:09,301
 
Do you know to count?

59
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:14,809
 
One, two, three, four, 
five, six, seven, eight.

60
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:19,254
 
One, two, three, four, 
five, six, seven, eight.

61
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,230
 
One, two, three, four, five… 

62
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,583
 
… six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

63
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:46,771
 
One, two, three, 
four, five, six… 

64
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:51,589
 
… seven, eight, nine, 
ten, eleven… 

65
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:56,283
 
… twelve, thirteen, fourteen -- 

66
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:42,769
 
Iris.

67
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:46,900
 
Iris.

68
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:52,990
 
Stand up, we're going.

69
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:16,993
 
Bianca… 

70
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:21,542
Will you stay with me today?

71
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,100
 
Iris, come.

72
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:04,430
 
Come.

73
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,680
 
It is important to follow the way.

74
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:12,369
 
And that you always follow 
the lamps.

75
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:19,862
 
- Where are we going?
- Down there.

76
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:34,136
 
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

77
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,525
 
So long, Iris.

78
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:17,361
 
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

79
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,177
 
I am Mademoiselle Edith.

80
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,007
 
I hope you'll be happy here.

81
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:00,159
 
We will learn to love all the animals in this park 

82
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,855
 
Come with me.

83
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:09,925
 
All beings are fruits 
of the same tree… 

84
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:12,555
 
Which is called Life. 
Life first started in the sea… 

85
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,507
 
and then spread to air and finally to earth.

86
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:17,442
 
- What is this?
- A hind.

87
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,587
 
- And this?
- A rat.

88
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:22,525
 
- And this?
- A fox, a wolf.

89
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,222
 
And we are here.

90
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:27,437
 
We are the most evolved species that exist 
and our progress never stops  

91
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,697
 
… and the human infants, within several years, 
will have completely different characteristics… 

92
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,456
 
… then you, and in several generations the
 progress of evolution will clearly be seen.

93
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,865
 
Alice, will I have to stay long here?

94
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:14,961
 
Yes.

95
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,877
 
Do we have any visits?

96
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,385
 
There are no visits, nobody ever comes.

97
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,583
 
But is there a headmistress?

98
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,994
 
Yes, she comes every year 
in order to see us dance.

99
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:43,449
 
However you will not see the headmistress
in the near future.

100
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:46,247
 
She only comes once a year to give
the blue ribbon.

101
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,801
 
And when will I be able to leave 
to see my little brother?

102
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:54,213
 
You cannot leave, it is prohibited.

103
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:56,451
 
But you gou out every afternoon.

104
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:58,819
 
I don't go out. I told you 
it's prohibited.

105
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,388
 
What do you do then?

106
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:07,157
 
Listen, if you continue with this, 
you will be punished.

107
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:38,152
 
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

108
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,142
 
Here are your things.

109
00:29:04,882 --> 00:29:07,333
 
You are going to meet Mademoiselle Eva. 
She is very kind.

110
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:16,970
 
Welcomes, young ladies.

111
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:21,463
 
Come in.

112
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:37,037
 
You are lucky of being chosen 
to live here.

113
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:40,281
 
But you are still just 
ugly maggots.

114
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:43,087
 
It will be necessary to work hard.

115
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:51,176
 
Hurry young lady.

116
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,203
 
Wait.

117
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:02,449
 
I am going to show you something, 
and you have to pay attention.

118
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:04,832
 
… because you will have 
to do it after me.

119
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:08,627
 
Seven, eight.

120
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:13,219
 
One, two, three… 

121
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:17,484
 
… four, five, six… 

122
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:21,052
 
… seven, eight.

123
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:41,304
 
Unfortunately not all 
maggots transform themselves into butterflies.

124
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,331
 
But I hope that within a few
years you will all have that honor.

125
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,385
 
Bianca, where do you go in the afternoons?

126
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:17,039
 
- Do you see boys?
- No.

127
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,670
 
Then what do you do?

128
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:36,361
 
Attention, I am counting.

129
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:40,427
 
One, two, three, four… 

130
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:43,839
 
… five, six, seven… 

131
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:47,662
 
… eight, nine, ten… 

132
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:04,215
 
Hide!

133
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:13,422
 
Bianca?

134
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,552
 
What do we do now?

135
00:40:26,086 --> 00:40:27,612
 
Iris.

136
00:40:29,622 --> 00:40:31,295
 
I am here.

137
00:40:32,586 --> 00:40:34,774
 
Are you crazy? We have been looking everywhere for you.

138
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,702
 
I wanted to follow Bianca.

139
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:38,801
 
You didn't try to leave 
the park, did you?

140
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,057
 
No.

141
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:42,343
 
You know what kind of punishment there is for leaving the
park?

142
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:45,123
 
No.

143
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,964
 
You stay here forever and serve the others.

144
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,090
 
- What is it?
- I don't see anything.

145
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:07,733
 
- I see something.
- What?

146
00:41:09,605 --> 00:41:12,532
 
What do you see?

147
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,453
 
You see this? This is the wall 
that surrounds the whole park.

148
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:36,500
 
Iris, I am going to show you 
another secret.

149
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:44,162
 
Look.

150
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:10,170
 
You see, outside there are very strange people, 
that's why we musn't go outside.

151
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,828
 
And Bianca's secret, do you know what it is?

152
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:23,720
 
Sure, come with me.

153
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:42,016
 
So, what's her secret?

154
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,262
 
Let's play a game.

155
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:54,428
 
You musn't move.

156
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:05,861
 
- You lost.
- No, start again.

157
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:19,765
 
You are a little spy.

158
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:43,489
 
Bianca.

159
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:49,262
 
Bianca.

160
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:53,542
 
- What do you want?
- I want to sleep with you.

161
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:56,281
 
It is prohibited.

162
00:45:42,088 --> 00:45:44,052
 
What did you do with your legs?

163
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,813
 
I hurt them when i was playing.

164
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:54,055
 
We're finished, young ladies.

165
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,046
 
Iris, please wait here.

166
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:04,366
 
- Tell me, are you happy here?
- Yes.

167
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:08,043
 
- Do you get on well with your friends?
- Yes.

168
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:11,892
 
Especially with Bianca.

169
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:16,070
 
And because you like Bianca so much, 
I suppose that you obey her as well.

170
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,105
 
Yes.

171
00:46:21,136 --> 00:46:24,148
 
You know, perhaps it is 
difficult to understand it… 

172
00:46:24,306 --> 00:46:28,375
 
… but obedience is the one and only 
way that guarantees us a good life.

173
00:46:42,018 --> 00:46:43,981
 
What are you doing?

174
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:54,874
 
Do you ever ask yourself 
if we'll ever get out of here?

175
00:46:54,988 --> 00:46:59,307
 
Of course i do, but there is a great wall in between 
and there are no doors.

176
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:06,939
 
Don't worry, 
I know how to get out of here.

177
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,899
 
How?

178
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,812
 
- Can't you guess?
- No.

179
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:54,482
 
Will you come with me?

180
00:47:55,717 --> 00:47:57,611
 
That is prohibited.

181
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:06,451
 
- You won't tell on me?
- No.

182
00:48:07,281 --> 00:48:09,909
 
- Do you swear?
- I swear.

183
00:48:13,198 --> 00:48:16,246
 
Can you help me 
with untying the rope?

184
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:05,385
 
Is is true that Mademoiselle Edith 
tried to escape when she was just a little girl… 

185
00:51:05,685 --> 00:51:08,812
 
… and that the headmistress punished her by breaking her legs?

186
00:51:10,027 --> 00:51:13,599
 
Ah, those stories of punishment are just a way of 
scaring the children.

187
00:51:13,762 --> 00:51:16,815
 
They cannot force us to be 
here all of our life… 

188
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:19,527
 
… if we don't want it ourselves.

189
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:18,052
 
Iris?

190
00:52:27,148 --> 00:52:28,895
 
Iris?

191
00:52:31,332 --> 00:52:32,964
 
Iris?

192
00:52:55,787 --> 00:52:58,350
 
What are you doing there?

193
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:05,801
 
Are you scared of the storms?

194
00:53:12,528 --> 00:53:16,488
 
Laura left the park, but 
I shouldn't have told you that.

195
00:53:16,744 --> 00:53:19,251
 
Were you with her?

196
00:53:22,348 --> 00:53:24,955
 
Will she be punished?

197
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:31,721
 
Are they also going to punish me?

198
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,154
 
- Did anybody see you?
- No.

199
00:53:41,738 --> 00:53:44,713
 
- Did you speak about this with anyone?
- No.

200
00:53:45,532 --> 00:53:48,035
 
Will I be punished?

201
00:53:51,383 --> 00:53:53,961
 
No, I promise you, you won't be.

202
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:03,922
 
Come in.

203
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:29,268
 
Laura is no longer among us.

204
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,617
 
I know that you are sad… 

205
00:55:32,984 --> 00:55:37,004
 
… we will organize an incineration ceremony as
soon as possible.

206
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:11,918
 
Good afternoon, young ladies.

207
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:15,117
 
Good afternoon.

208
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,042
 
Let's go.

209
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:16,527
 
Stephanie don't eat with your fingers.

210
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,340
 
Use your fork.

211
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:09,905
 
Eva.

212
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,009
 
Eva, calm down.

213
00:59:16,157 --> 00:59:19,559
 
Calm down.

214
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,335
 
Calm down.

215
00:59:33,854 --> 00:59:36,359
 
We're going back now.

216
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:46,178
 
- Happy New Year, young ladies.
- Happy New Year.

217
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:47,750
 
- Did you make a wish?
- Yes.

218
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,367
 
- What kind of wish did you make?
- To always be with Bianca.

219
00:59:52,374 --> 00:59:54,482
 
I want to be chosen as 
the headmistress

220
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:56,586
 
Those are not dreams.

221
00:59:56,815 --> 00:59:58,786
 
Well, it all depends on the talent.

222
00:59:59,302 --> 01:00:01,837
 
I am sure that 
she will be chosen.

223
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:03,993
 
What means "chosen" ?

224
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:07,328
 
Every year, the headmistress comes and 
she chooses the one that wears the blue ribbon… 

225
01:00:07,453 --> 01:00:10,772
 
… and she takes her away. It's one of the ways to get 
out of here faster.

226
01:00:11,102 --> 01:00:13,704
 
But I'll be afraid of the headmistress 
when she comes.

227
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:16,159
 
I won't be scared.

228
01:00:52,873 --> 01:00:55,952
 
Please, please let me be chosen.

229
01:01:01,773 --> 01:01:03,800
 
Two of them have become very pretty.

230
01:01:04,057 --> 01:01:07,312
 
This year has been a good year, I think 
that she will be very satisfied.

231
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:24,489
 
So long 
headmistress, so long.

232
01:01:27,797 --> 01:01:29,526
 
Alice.

233
01:01:35,285 --> 01:01:38,710
 
What are you doing here?
Today is not your turn.

234
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,553
 
I want to practise with 
Mademoiselle Eva.

235
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,190
 
Good one.

236
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:46,165
 
She asked me to come.

237
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,271
 
Why do you want so much to be
chosen?

238
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,772
 
Do you want to distance yourself from the others?

239
01:02:00,728 --> 01:02:02,844
 
Aren't you happy here?

240
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:06,281
 
I am, but I would like to make sure
that they like me.

241
01:02:07,565 --> 01:02:11,780
 
You know Alice, I don't
believe that they will choose you.

242
01:02:21,977 --> 01:02:25,980
 
And what do you know you disabled species!

243
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:55,606
 
You shouldn't have discouraged Alice 
like that.

244
01:03:02,187 --> 01:03:05,569
 
Anyway, she doesn't know what it means to be chosen.

245
01:03:06,135 --> 01:03:07,682
 
And what do you know about it?

246
01:03:09,772 --> 01:03:12,360
 
If they disappoint her, she will suffer.

247
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:16,800
 
She will learn.

248
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:21,209
 
Learn what?

249
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:29,339
 
I don't believe she will become like us.

250
01:03:32,928 --> 01:03:35,373
 
What do you mean by "like us"?

251
01:04:02,528 --> 01:04:05,398
 
Hurry, we're only 
waiting for you.

252
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:09,427
 
Here you are.

253
01:06:10,213 --> 01:06:14,295
 
Raise your chin. Turn.

254
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:19,776
 
Very good. Now give me a beautiful smile.

255
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:23,002
 
Come

256
01:06:26,677 --> 01:06:30,119
 
Turn. Stay like this, please.

257
01:06:30,576 --> 01:06:32,856
 
Take a look at the nape of the neck .

258
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,995
 
Very well on 
the feet, very well.

259
01:06:38,616 --> 01:06:40,061
 
Thanks.

260
01:06:40,477 --> 01:06:42,007
 
Coming?

261
01:06:43,455 --> 01:06:45,031
 
Don't be scared.

262
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:48,910
 
What is that ball?
Push it a little back.

263
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:54,128
 
Thanks. The profile.

264
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:57,871
 
Stand on your toes. Stay like that.

265
01:06:58,177 --> 01:07:00,438
 
Very well, thanks.

266
01:07:01,513 --> 01:07:03,044
 
Coming?

267
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:07,940
 
Are we bashful? Of course 
we are not. We are very beautiful. See.

268
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:11,037
 
The profile.

269
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:14,179
 
Wait a second 
I want to see something.

270
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:17,032
 
A little short.

271
01:07:17,736 --> 01:07:19,597
 
Turn.

272
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:24,679
 
Stay like that, 
I need to see something.

273
01:07:25,294 --> 01:07:28,247
 
Wait, do not move.
Step on your toes.

274
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:32,286
 
Wait, wait, wait, 
wait a little more.

275
01:07:32,505 --> 01:07:34,948
 
Now you can descend. Thanks.

276
01:07:35,421 --> 01:07:36,978
 
Are you coming?

277
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:40,103
 
Let's see.

278
01:07:40,275 --> 01:07:43,770
 
Look at her face.
Raise the chin.

279
01:07:45,054 --> 01:07:46,588
 
Very well.

280
01:07:47,114 --> 01:07:50,416
 
What a pretty nape of the neck, 
very pretty. Look.

281
01:07:51,586 --> 01:07:54,178
 
Very pretty. Turn.

282
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:02,348
 
She is very pretty, isn't she?

283
01:08:05,987 --> 01:08:07,539
 
You.

284
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:18,031
 
Give me your hand.

285
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,980
 
Now the other hand.

286
01:08:24,594 --> 01:08:26,787
 
Show me your teeth.

287
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:41,396
 
- This one.
- This one? Sorry.

288
01:08:45,025 --> 01:08:48,769
 
Congratulations, you worked well with the
students.

289
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:57,499
 
Alice.

290
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,198
 
Lady, take me.

291
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:03,941
 
Alice!

292
01:09:04,284 --> 01:09:06,579
 
You said that I will 
be the chosen one.

293
01:09:06,795 --> 01:09:09,538
 
I never said that.

294
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,356
 
It she going to die?

295
01:11:57,495 --> 01:11:59,153
 
Where are you going?

296
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:13,646
 
We cannot find her.

297
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:29,250
 
Alice did a very big mistake.

298
01:14:31,518 --> 01:14:34,121
 
We will never see her again.

299
01:14:35,052 --> 01:14:37,724
 
And we will never speak about her again.

300
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:24,979
 
Now you know how the transformation looks like.

301
01:15:25,552 --> 01:15:29,126
 
First one occurs at the age of 7, 
when they lose the milk teeth.

302
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,909
 
The second one will happen any moment.

303
01:15:32,016 --> 01:15:35,140
 
This time the entire body 
will transform.

304
01:15:35,451 --> 01:15:39,526
 
From now on, every month, 
they will lose a little blood.

305
01:16:03,949 --> 01:16:08,071
 
Now it must find a companion to assure its descendants.

306
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:33,868
 
Hurry, we musn't be late.

307
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:36,797
 
I am coming.

308
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:31,701
 
Rose, today you will be
in charge of the others.

309
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,100
 
-  OK.
-  Why?

310
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,728
 
- Because I am goin with Bianca.
- But that is prohibited.

311
01:17:38,185 --> 01:17:42,271
 
- As of today she has permission.
- Are you coming?

312
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:59,199
 
- And why her?
- Someday you will take her place.

313
01:18:29,194 --> 01:18:31,984
 
- Good afternoon, young ladies.
- Good afternoon, miss.

314
01:18:32,366 --> 01:18:34,484
 
Welcome, Nadja.

315
01:18:35,783 --> 01:18:38,399
 
You are going to see that everything will be fine.

316
01:18:40,807 --> 01:18:43,004
 
- Good afternoon, Nadja.
- Good afternoon, miss.

317
01:18:43,836 --> 01:18:45,503
 
Let's go.

318
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:46,170
 
- What is that?
- That is your costume.

319
01:19:48,254 --> 01:19:51,330
 
- Why are there only four?
- You will see.

320
01:19:53,925 --> 01:19:56,096
 
Leave us alone.

321
01:20:01,558 --> 01:20:04,171
 
Repeat it all before the audience.

322
01:20:24,037 --> 01:20:26,956
 
Step up, 
step on the chair.

323
01:20:34,951 --> 01:20:38,006
 
You will have to take care of legs, Nadja.

324
01:20:41,547 --> 01:20:43,163
 
Ok.

325
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:48,502
 
Young ladies.

326
01:20:56,687 --> 01:20:58,783
 
Here is where we dance.

327
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:02,783
 
Repeat.

328
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,438
 
Very well, Nadja.

329
01:21:12,877 --> 01:21:15,879
 
Continue, continue.

330
01:21:26,946 --> 01:21:28,899
 
Continue, Nadja.

331
01:21:35,498 --> 01:21:37,590
 
What is that noise?

332
01:21:38,296 --> 01:21:41,518
 
It is absolutely prohibited 
to draw the curtains.

333
01:21:41,832 --> 01:21:44,511
 
- What is on the other side?
- The spectators.

334
01:21:45,742 --> 01:21:48,072
 
The spectators?

335
01:21:55,718 --> 01:21:57,781
 
Where are you going?

336
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,736
 
- Leave me alone.
- Calm down.

337
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:06,678
 
Nadja, don't be scared.

338
01:22:07,982 --> 01:22:12,198
 
When the curtains will unveil 
you will not see them.

339
01:22:12,668 --> 01:22:14,329
 
Ok?

340
01:22:16,447 --> 01:22:19,563
 
Let's go to the classroom.
Bianca, take care of her.

341
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:37,041
 
You are going to see, they always applaud us.

342
01:25:25,408 --> 01:25:27,640
 
What is wrong?

343
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:32,074
 
I cannot return.

344
01:25:39,421 --> 01:25:42,732
 
Next time 
you will be less scared.

345
01:25:44,504 --> 01:25:46,936
 
I don't want to return.

346
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,952
 
You have no choice.

347
01:26:27,091 --> 01:26:29,787
 
Good, this is all for today.

348
01:26:34,586 --> 01:26:37,807
 
I hope that you will be
more concentrated tonight.

349
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,744
 
Bianca, come with me please.

350
01:26:51,553 --> 01:26:53,773
 
It is your turn.

351
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:14,595
 
Mademoiselle Edith already told you about the
bleedings that can occur.

352
01:27:15,113 --> 01:27:18,408
 
When it happens you will use these cloths.

353
01:27:21,842 --> 01:27:25,632
 
You know Bianca, a complete new 
cycle will begin.

354
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:31,494
 
You and other violet ribbons are going to leave the school.

355
01:27:34,364 --> 01:27:36,963
 
And tonight you will dance 
for the last time.

356
01:27:37,242 --> 01:27:39,786
 
Last time?

357
01:28:44,387 --> 01:28:48,256
 
Bravo, you are the most beautiful.

358
01:30:43,565 --> 01:30:46,341
 
- I am very proud of you.
- Thank you miss.

359
01:30:50,214 --> 01:30:52,166
 
Did you all have a good time?

360
01:30:53,392 --> 01:30:55,415
 
Come, let's go.

361
01:31:38,169 --> 01:31:39,835
 
Come.

362
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:05,264
 
Bianca, come.

363
01:32:37,614 --> 01:32:40,012
 
What are you doing here?

364
01:32:42,321 --> 01:32:44,797
 
What is that thing?

365
01:32:46,255 --> 01:32:49,265
 
- Didn't they find the money?
- Money?

366
01:32:51,675 --> 01:32:53,837
 
Look.

367
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:07,166
 
Do you think the guests will pay for the 
expenses of the school?

368
01:33:08,795 --> 01:33:11,900
 
Who else, if not them?

369
01:33:15,417 --> 01:33:17,076
 
You?

370
01:33:17,745 --> 01:33:21,879
 
I am sure that you will use your legs well when
you leave the school.

371
01:33:24,123 --> 01:33:26,243
 
I do not want to go out.

372
01:36:44,348 --> 01:36:46,052
 
Bianca.

373
01:36:54,296 --> 01:36:57,688
 
Bianca, what are you doing there?

374
01:36:58,252 --> 01:37:00,331
 
Leave me alone.

375
01:37:01,678 --> 01:37:04,432
 
Is it true that you are leaving?

376
01:37:11,217 --> 01:37:15,640
 
I do not want you to go, I want you 
to stay with me forever.

377
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:49,780
 
Iris.

378
01:37:54,048 --> 01:37:57,300
 
- Iris.
- Leave me alone.

379
01:41:02,597 --> 01:41:04,589
 
Bianca.

380
01:41:08,393 --> 01:41:10,261
 
Bianca.

381
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,526
 
Good bye.

382
01:41:53,276 --> 01:41:55,318
 
You won't forget me?

383
01:41:55,498 --> 01:41:58,061
 
- No, and you?
- Never.

384
01:41:58,191 --> 01:42:02,243
 
- Will we see each other when you come out?
- When i come out?

385
01:42:16,827 --> 01:42:19,076
 
It is time, Bianca.

386
01:44:01,707 --> 01:44:03,326
 
Young ladies.

387
01:44:22,415 --> 01:44:24,576
 
Let's go, young ladies.

388
01:45:23,946 --> 01:45:25,898
 
Come, let's go.

389
01:46:22,663 --> 01:46:24,742
 
Step in, young ladies.

390
01:47:23,724 --> 01:47:25,716
 
Miss… 

391
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:30,628
…what is going to happen with us?

392
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:38,164
 
One thing is certain: 
you are going to forget us quickly.

393
01:49:44,809 --> 01:49:46,745
 
Go.

394 
01:54:26,564 --> 01:54:28,564
