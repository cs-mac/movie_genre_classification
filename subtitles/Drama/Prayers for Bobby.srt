1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,479
<i>O God I need you too.</i>

2
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:35,186
<i>I want to see your face.</i>

3
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,642
<i>It is this love I have</i>

4
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:41,988
<i>It makes me search for you.</i>

5
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>I need you to listen,</i>

6
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,394
<i>I need you to answer.</i>

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,849
<i>I need you to listen,</i>

8
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,938
<i>I need you to answer.</i>

9
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:05,473
<i>Do not avoid my eyes
or let me anger you.</i>

10
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,982
<i>Do not toss me aside.</i>

11
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:12,844
<i>O God, do not drop me.</i>

12
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:43,075
Alright you two.
That's enough.

13
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:48,997
I like her.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think she likes you.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,137
What tells you that Mum?

16
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:56,965
Here you go Mum.

17
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:06,949
This is such a nice day.

18
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,246
Who knows this?

19
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:09,945
<i>May those who love you,</i>

20
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:13,301
<i>be like the sun when it rises in its strength.</i>

21
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,189
Corinthians?

22
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,224
Judges 5:31.

23
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,770
So grandma, how old are you again?

24
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,652
Never mind.

25
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:25,848
You know you shouldn't ask for the age...

26
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,150
That's very nice!

27
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,525
Save some for me, will you?

28
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:36,516
That's very nice!

29
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,874
Who's that from?

30
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,662
From you and Mary!

31
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,521
Well correct!

32
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,917
I was just testing.

33
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:45,858
Remember Mum?

34
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,901
We were at the mall

35
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,703
and you said you liked that.

36
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:52,138
So I went back and I got it for you.

37
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:55,003
Nancy honey, get me my purse.

38
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:58,822
Why am I always the one harrased to get the purse?

39
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,666
Youngest Griffith girl's the purse mule.

40
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,250
O Grandma.

41
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,599
Open mine.

42
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:06,460
Why do I have to be the purse mule?

43
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,220
Ok. Fine.

44
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:12,654
Yes, I think it suits me.

45
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:14,322
What do you guys think?

46
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,966
Grandma, that is a lovely shade of lipstick.

47
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:17,432
Beautiful!

48
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,394
O Ed stop it.

49
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:21,128
Why? What's wrong Mum?

50
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:21,889
It's disgusting.

51
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,071
If you ask me,

52
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,559
queers should all be
lined up and shot.

53
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,126
Didn't you say that last year
about the Giants?

54
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:31,242
What did you say?

55
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:33,729
Never mind.

56
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:35,541
What is this?

57
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,097
It's a journal.

58
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:38,608
Like a diary.

59
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,788
I don't need any more stuff.

60
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:45,475
Mum!!

61
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,306
- What?
- I'll go.

62
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,893
It's a good thing we didn't
get you the pen.

63
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:52,657
You can't take it personal.

64
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:53,916
It's grandma.

65
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:57,883
You know the rules. Sh'es mean sometimes.
Then we get a free pass to make fun of her.

66
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:59,718
Bobby, she picks at me.

67
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:03,011
Nobody ever picks on you. You're the favorite.

68
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:07,074
So what's it like to be perfect?

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,816
I'm perfect?

70
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:10,783
You think I'm perfect?

71
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,044
Have you looked in a mirror lately?
You're Charlie's next angel, ok?

72
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,295
Can I have it?

73
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,696
You don't want it.

74
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:21,711
Well, I'm taking it.

75
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,485
I'm gonna fill this up in a week.

76
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:29,634
Come on. Let's go celebrate grandmas'
39-39 birthday.

77
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,738
I am ready.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,900
What?

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,526
I wanna go further.

80
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:51,136
Is... Is something wrong?
I thought you'd want to...

81
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,984
Here? I mean, this isn't really
what I had in mind.

82
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:56,515
It doesn't have to be here.

83
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,152
I should go. I have to
get up early tomorrow.

84
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,389
Is something wrong?

85
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:04,068
I don't think this is gonna work.

86
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,842
I think we should break up.

87
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:11,505
I thought you liked me... I came
to meet your family.

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,578
I just don't want to get that serious.

89
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,124
Well, it doesn't have to be serious, ok?

90
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,772
It's not you, it's me.

91
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:20,164
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Hey.

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,200
You wanna watch with me?

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm tired.

95
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,900
Oh come on!

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,675
Who else can I get to watch
an old black and white movie?

97
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:10,638
You know if it's not John Wayne,
your dad's not interested.

98
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,996
It's really scary.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,500
You know this scene's famous?

100
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,500
Really?

101
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,374
You know they got that glass of milk to glow?

102
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:20,779
How?

103
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:26,210
Well Hitchcock put a lightbulb inside
the glass so the audience would know
the milk was poisonous.

104
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,849
No kidding.

105
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,885
That's clever.

106
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,096
How do you know that?

107
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,576
Cause I'm brilliant.

108
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,300
You are brilliant!

109
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:36,973
Take it away; I'm eating too much.

110
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:40,099
I think there's something wrong with me.

111
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:41,309
That's for sure.

112
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:47,510
What you think Mum would do if she found out
one of us was a psychoptath?

113
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,395
What you mean "if"?

114
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,364
You know she's always saying...

115
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:56,453
the whole family's gonna be
together in the afterlife?

116
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:56,919
Well...

117
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:00,617
What if one of us is a sinner?

118
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:02,682
Have you sinned with Michelle ?

119
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,886
I promise I won't tell.

120
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:04,758
It's not that.

121
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:06,881
I'm just...

122
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:09,111
thinking about stuff, you know?

123
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:10,114
You think too much.

124
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:12,163
It's dangerous.

125
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,807
That's why I avoid it
at all cost.

126
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,152
Yeah?

127
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm glad we talked.

128
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,924
Seriously, something... something wrong?

129
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:24,268
No.

130
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:31,246
Relax, cause I'm your big bro.
I'm just looking out for you.

131
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:58,466
What's up Bobby?

132
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,711
Ready to go?

133
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:03,527
Hey Bobby.

134
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,106
Cheryl.

135
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,892
She's not your type.

136
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,033
Too much eye shadow.

137
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,446
What's wrong with Michelle?

138
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,659
We broke up.

139
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,233
Talk to you guys later.

140
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:21,194
Not telling the truth...

141
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:23,943
sometimes I feel like I'm at
the edge of a cliff,

142
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:25,324
looking down at the crashing surf

143
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:28,344
with nowhere to go but down.

144
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:32,357
I used to have these fun dreams
when I was so free.

145
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:34,222
But now, as I fly,

146
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:35,043
I'm afraid.

147
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:39,151
They are telephone lines and
electrical wires.

148
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,374
How painful it would be to run into one.

149
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:46,689
I wonder if I'll ever be free again.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,541
Hello?

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,770
Bobby? Bobby?

154
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Hey! Bobby? What did you do? Ha?

157
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,999
Did you take these?

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Answer me!

159
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,900
No!

160
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
Is that the truth?

161
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,898
I couldn't do it, ok?
Get off me.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,761
I wanted to but I couldn't.

163
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,000
What's wrong with you?

164
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Why I couldn't do it?

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Because it's a sin.

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,999
Bobby, what are you talking about?

167
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,999
I didn't wanna go to hell, but...

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,300
I am.

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,500
Cause this is worse.

170
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Bobby, you're scaring me.
What's going on?

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
You'd all hate me.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,900
I know it. I know that if you guys
knew the truth, you'd hate me.

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,500
No.

174
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Whatever it is...

175
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
we'll tell Mum...

176
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
No!

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,900
No. Mum wouldn't understand. OK?
She can't know.

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,500
Then you have to tell me right now.

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm not like you Ed.

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So what?

181
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,900
I keep trying.

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I keep telling myself that one day
I'm gonna wake up and it's gonna
be different. But it's not.

183
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,600
I don't dream...

184
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,600
about girls, like you do.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,900
I dream about guys.

186
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,900
You're gay?!

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,900
See?

188
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,900
You even say it like you hate me.

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Bob, gimme a break.

190
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,500
I don't know what to do!

191
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,500
-We'll tell Mum and dad.
-No!

192
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,999
No.

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,200
They can help, Bobby. They always
want us to come to them.

194
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,000
They can help.

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't! Ok?

196
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,200
And you're not gonna say
anything either.

197
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,000
Promise me.

198
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,900
Promise me you're not gonna
say anything.

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Ed, promise!

200
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,200
Ok.

201
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,000
I promise.

202
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,000
Mum, if there was something wrong
with one of your kids, you always
said that we should come to you...

203
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
What did you do?

204
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,900
It's not me, it's Bobby.

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
What is it?

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,100
I didn't want to tell you but he was...

207
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,900
in such a bad shape, I'm really
worried about him.

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He thinks...

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
he might be homosexual.

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
He's not.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He didn't want me to tell you. He was
gonna take a bunch of aspirins.

212
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Ok?

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,500
You know... he trusted me, you
can't go too hard on him.

214
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,900
Ok, good. It's good.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm glad you told me.

216
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
There's no doubt in my mind that
God can handle this.

217
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
He'll help us.

218
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,900
He'll heal Bobby.

219
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,100
In order for all of us to be together
in the kingdom of heaven,

220
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,000
we cannot stray.

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,200
We can't sin like that.

222
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
That is a terrible sin.

223
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,300
The bible calls it an abomination.

224
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,200
In Leviticus, if a man lies with
another man,

225
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
they should both be put to death.

226
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,000
I will not raise my family not
being together in the next life.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,100
Mary. Can we please worry about this life
before we worry about the next life?

229
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,900
Hey. What's going on?

230
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Isn't there a problem you need to
tell us about?

231
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,000
-No...
-Bobby

233
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,000
If there is something wrong, you
need to share it with your family.

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,500
-How could you?
-Bobby...

236
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm gonna kill you!

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,820
No!

239
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,900
Ok, ok. Enough!

240
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,000
I was worried about you!

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,100
I trusted you!

242
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Calm down!

243
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,990
Hey, Ed. Go find some room.

244
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
Bobby, we're your family.

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We can get through this.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I know that if we trust in God,
we can get through this.

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,100
It's curable with his help.

248
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
I can't help it.

250
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,500
I don't even want it Mum!
What do I do?

252
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,100
Bobby, you're not gay.

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're probably just...

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you haven't met a girl that you're
really attracted to.

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Please...

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Mum, please don't tell anyone please...

257
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
- Mum, please don't tell anyone.
- It's all right.

258
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's gonna be fine.

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,500
I was worried about you.

260
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,200
What was I supposed to do?

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
I'm out of here.

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,100
<i>Thank you again for joining us</i>

263
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,900
<i>I'm pastor Raymond</i>

264
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
<i>and we'll take another call,</i>

265
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,500
<i>this is from Melissa in Concord.</i>

266
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
<i>Thank you reverend,
I'm a little nervous</i>

267
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,000
<i>My sister made a terrible mistake</i>

268
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
<i>she sinned...</i>

269
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I advise you to live according to
your new life in the holy spirit

270
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,200
Then you won't be doing...

271
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
what your sinful nature craves.

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,100
When the holy spirit controls your life,

273
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,500
it will produce love, joy and kindness,

274
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,000
goodness and self-control.

275
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
Does everyone have to know?

276
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,000
We're your family.
We love you.

279
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:19,243
<i>I am pure of hearts.
I am of god's goodness.</i>

280
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,000
We still love you, Bobby.

281
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,835
Yes, thanks. Can I get some privacy?

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,900
Hi Mary!

283
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:45,599
<i>Everything you always wanted to
know about sex</i>

284
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,282
If a homosexual who wants to renounce to
homosexuality...

285
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,290
finds a psychiastrist who knows
how to cure homosexuality...

286
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,281
he has every chance of becoming...

287
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:59,947
a happy well adjusted heterosexual.

288
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Do you hear any voices?

289
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No.

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,200
Do you ever hear any ringing sounds?

291
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,500
Is that the phone?

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It was a joke.

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
So you think you're a homosexual?

295
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
Bobby, how many girls have you
been with?

296
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
I don't know. Two.

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,500
Had sexual relations with?

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Then how do you know for sure?

300
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I just...

301
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
have these feelings, you know?

302
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,500
I don't mean you know. I mean...

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,500
I have these feelings.

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,500
Do you want to be homosexual?

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,200
I just wanna be close with my
family again.

306
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,500
I feel like I slipped up and now
I can't...

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
get back.

308
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm not gonna be able to help you...

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,356
if you don't answer my questions.

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No, I don't wanna be this way.

311
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,938
I'm gonna talk with your mother
alone for a minute, ok?

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,500
She wants to talk to you.

313
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,500
He can be cured. Right?

314
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He has to be willing to really put
the work in.

315
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,00
O, he is. I know he is.

317
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And I think it would be good, it would
be important to have your husband come
join us in therapy.

318
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Right...

319
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
How did it go?

320
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,500
She said we should spend some more time
together.

321
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Maybe the two of you could spend

322
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
some quality time together.

323
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes, sure.

324
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
That's all she said for 60$ an hour?

325
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
She also wants the 3 of us to go to
a few sessions together.

326
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
What? So it's our fault?

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,100
No no... I don't know about it but
it's fine if he goes.

328
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,120
Bob, I want you to be a part of this.
I can't do it alone, ok?

330
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,100
I read that homosexuals have sex
in public bathrooms,

331
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,000
and that they recruit children.

332
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,100
What are you saying?

333
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,900
Do you think Bobby was recruited?

334
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Come on Mary, you're going overboard.

335
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,650
You got to do something about this.
I won't lose him.

336
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:06,486
Dear lord, we ask that you keep 
Bobby safe from temptation.

337
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:08,707
Please help him return to a pure heart.

338
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,590
Do you think this will heal me?

339
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,025
You have to trust the God will heal you.

340
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,925
And that Satan will try to discourage
you.

341
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,226
Do you trust in god?

342
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:18,815
Yeah.

343
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,588
Now let me go to sleep.

344
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,302
When temptation is all around you,

345
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:33,259
faith is not enough.
It requires discipline

346
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,482
Not just mental, but physical.

347
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:38,300
Who would like to share their story?

348
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:42,452
I used to be so unhappy.

349
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,006
I stayed out all night,

350
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:45,598
I talked back to my mother.

351
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:48,812
Since coming here and accepting Jesus
as my savior,

352
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:49,511
I've changed..

353
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,528
My Mum and I are like best friends now.

354
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:53,998
That's great Kerry.

355
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,540
The power of prayer and hard work.

356
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,598
Bobby what about you?
How are you coming along?

357
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:04,083
Good...

358
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:07,725
Well, you feel better. Don't you?
I can see it in your eyes.

359
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,736
Your hard works' paid off. Hasn't it?

360
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:11,391
Yeah...

361
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,278
Let's sing, shall we?

Nothing I do seems to make a difference.

369
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:55,293
I try to act like them but
it feels impossible.

370
00:21:55,643 --> 00:22:00,138
It's an awful feeling to believe you can
be headed straight for the fires of hell.

371
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:04,091
Even worse is everyone telling you
how simple the solution is.

372
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:07,494
They don't know what it is to be
in my shoes.

373
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,689
I'm running, I'm not eating junk food.

374
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:10,389
Good, good!

375
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,500
Yeah, that's good but...

376
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,900
I don't know the point of it.

377
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,000
I mean, my face has cleared up but
everything else feels the same.

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Well you have to stick with it.

379
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Do you like the people in your group?

380
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
They're ok.

381
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This one girl, she...

382
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You know, I hope you're taking this
seriously.

383
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
I mean that I hope you are trying with
all your might.

384
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,500
I cannot lose you to this.

385
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,079
You won't.

386
00:22:38,742 --> 00:22:39,320
Have faith!

387
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
Well this is gonna be fun.

388
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,000
When was the last time all the
Griffith men went hiking together?

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
So how's school?

392
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Good.

393
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,076
You thought about your plans?

394
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:15,560
Well college...

395
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:17,314
No, I mean...

396
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,429
life plans.

397
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well, I'm still thinking of becoming
a writer.

398
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,600
Listen Bobby, you always had a strong
imagination.

399
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,500
and we've always been alright with that.

400
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,000
But you're getting to the age where
you're gonna have to get practical.

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Alright, dreams...

402
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
they're great when you're young, but...

403
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
they don't really have...

404
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,500
really have a place in the real world.

405
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

406
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
You hear what I'm saying to you?

407
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,000
-Yeah.
-Alright, alright. Le'ts go, let's move.

408
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,500
Alright.

410
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
How did it go?

411
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm "healed".

412
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,000
It was fine.

413
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Did you two talk?

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, we talked.

415
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,500
What did you talk about?

416
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,500
Mary, it was fine.

417
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
No, but this is important.
This could make him or break him.

419
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,034
I did the best I could.
Is that alright with you?

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,500
A lot of times, confusions like Bobby's

421
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,000
can be caused by a distant father or
an overbearing mother.

422
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Well, I had both but I'm fine.

423
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
-Bob?
-Yes?

425
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You need to participate in this.

426
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm right here Mary. I'm in the room.

427
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:46,621
I think...

428
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,500
I've been a very good father.

429
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,000
And maybe you don't know this but
Bobby. I mean he was never into...

430
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,300
stuff that his brother and other boys
were into. He's just not interested.

431
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
So I'm not gonna force him.

432
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,327
Hi Bobby I'm Sheila.

433
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Mum, who's that?

434
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Sheila is a student in my Sunday
school class.

435
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
You got me a date?

436
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You need to go out with lots of girls.
And your dad thinks so too.

437
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Can I at least pick my own?

438
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,500
I donnot think that you are.

439
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Have fun.

440
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,000
You look nifty. Do you want a brownie for energy?

441
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,806
-No
-Take them up! No?!

442
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,500
Hello. Who's this?

444
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
That's my brother Ed.

445
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,000
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Sheila.

447
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

450
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,200
-Hi.
-Are you up to see my friends?
-Yeah!

451
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
So you're never gonna talk to me again?

452
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
???

453
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,500
What if she wants me
to kiss her goodnight?

454
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Tell her you're gay.

455
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,002
Watch out fag.

456
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,999
Did you tell your friends?

457
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,000
Bobby, that's not my friend.

458
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,000
You told everyone I'm gay?

459
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,500
I haven't told anyone. Stop being
so paranoid.

460
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,999
You all hate me for it.

461
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I know you don't think I see it but I do.

462
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,496
I gotta go.

463
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Bobby...

464
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
It's 3 in the morning!

465
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Sorry I lost track of time.

466
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,900
Where were you?

467
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Bobby...

468
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,900
You weren't with homosexuals, were you?

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,500
This is not you.

470
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This is temptation working its ways. 

471
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,500
You have to pray harder if you're going to get well.

472
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,900
Good night, Mum.

473
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,000
Pray for forgiveness right away.

474
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
<i>If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. Matthew 21:22</i>

475
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,900
It was fine, girls. But I gotta go.

476
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,100
Ok.

477
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Bobby! Hey!

478
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,100
Where's Joy?

479
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,500
She's at work so she asked me to pick you up.

480
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,500
You're welcome.

481
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
- What's with you?
- What?

482
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,900
You think I didn't notice that?

483
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You don't want your friends to see me.

484
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:25,500
Some people wouldn't understand.

485
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And now it's so obvious...

486
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,900
What did you tell them?

487
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,900
Well look the way you're wearing.

488
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,900
And I told you time after time not to do that thing with your arm.

489
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,900
Makes you look like a girl and you continue to do it.

490
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,000
- I'm always dressed this way.
- No, you haven't. It's gotten worse.

491
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,900
Why you're doing this?
I'm trying to help you.

492
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,900
No, you're not.

493
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You're trying to help YOU!

494
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
It's not about me. It's about what people think about you.

495
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,900
Imagine if they thought your son
was some big queer.

496
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,000
What's wrong with you?

497
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,500
Stop that!

498
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,500
Nite Mum. Great.

499
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Le'ts go home!

500
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,900
- I'm walking.
- No!

501
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,900
Where are you going?

502
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:14,673
I've never seen you around here before.

503
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:17,362
You are really beautiful.

504
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:24,789
I gotta go.

505
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,188
Can I call you?

506
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:31,278
No.

507
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:47,890
<i>Metropolitan Community Church
celebrates gay pride.
All are welcome</i>

508
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:49,834
Bobby...

509
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:54,292
Don't worry. I was at church.

510
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:08,007
-Hi Cousin
-I have a name. It's gorgeous cousin.

512
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:10,102
So, how long you're here for?

513
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,514
Just a day, I'm driving home tonight.

514
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:16,512
I came to see my dad. But I couldn't resist stopping by.

515
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,828
Maybe it's not a choice.
Maybe I just can't help it.

516
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:22,266
So you say that stealing's not a choice.

517
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:22,783
What?

518
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:25,665
Aunt Mary, lunch is delicious.

519
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:27,246
Joy's right Bobby.

00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:28,112
The bible says:

521
00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:30,383
Men committed shameless acts with men

522
00:31:30,383 --> 00:31:34,052
and received in their own's person the due penalty for their error.

523
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,876
You just won't change, will you?

524
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,653
I can't erase what's in the bible.

525
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:42,398
Personnally, I think people should be able to love whoever they want.

526
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:48,327
Did I mention how good lunch is?

527
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,922
Even animals know what to do it with.

528
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,175
Actually, our dog does it with a pillow...

529
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:57,663
Can we please find something different to discuss?

530
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:01,039
Ed, why don't you tell us about college?

531
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,523
I dropped school last week.

532
00:32:04,471 --> 00:32:05,221
You what?

533
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,150
Well, what about college?

534
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:09,968
I'm not going.

535
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,676
Great!

536
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:14,924
What's next?

537
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:17,752
You wanna ruin your life?

538
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,899
Yeah well it's my life to ruin.

539
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,585
Is it like this at every meal?

540
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:29,752
Pretty much.

541
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:34,235
You should come up and visit me in Portland. It's so great!

542
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:35,898
I used to envy you..

543
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:40,917
When I came here with Mum and Dad, I always wished your parents were my parents.

544
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,030
You all seemed so close.

545
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,912
Well that's over with.

546
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,280
I think they love the sinners. Not the sin.

547
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,413
They should love the son no matter what the sin.

548
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:51,640
Hey that's good.

549
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:54,313
I'm gonna start my own bible.

550
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:03,362
Think about coming to Portland?

551
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:08,284
Hi Mrs. Griffith!

552
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:09,278
Is Bobby here?

553
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:13,049
Bobby!

554
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:16,028
You know it's enough you go God knows where at night.

555
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:19,086
But now you're bringing these deviants into my house.

556
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:20,177
It's my house too.

557
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:21,358
And they're my friends.

558
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:23,266
Is that what that boy is?

559
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:25,383
Is it a sin to have friends now too Mum?

560
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,123
We have a good time, ok?

561
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:28,199
We go to the rocky chore together.

562
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,901
Does it mean we're all gonna get strucked down?

563
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:31,604
They're gay, aren't they?

564
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:33,452
I thought you were getting better.

565
00:33:33,452 --> 00:33:33,980
When?

566
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:37,374
When I was miserable?
That looked like I was getting better?

567
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:37,983
You're right Mum!

568
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,485
I'm doomed just to roast in hell!

569
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:40,167
Don't say that.

570
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,604
That's what your bible says!

571
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,714
The bible also says a person can change.

572
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:45,660
I tried Mum. I can't!

573
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,368
Why do you keep choosing this?

574
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:50,364
Why would I choose this?

575
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,231
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me?

576
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:55,342
No we love you. Can't you see that's why we're doing this?

577
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:57,968
Really Mum? Is that what love feels like?

578
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:05,056
Have fun in Portland.

579
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,365
Here's an issue for your vacation.

580
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:09,781
I hope you like it.

581
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:15,670
Promise me you'll write and call all the time?

582
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,094
It's two months.

583
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:20,746
Drive carefully.

584
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,459
Don't worry Madam.

585
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,543
You call me when you get to Portland.

586
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,972
I had this engraved with your initials.

587
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,778
I love you guys.

589
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,037
Bye Bobby.

590
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:06,773
Already I'm glad to be away from Walnut Creek.

591
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,304
This feels like a new life.

592
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:09,657
A new day.

593
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:13,491
I'm gonna be a success in every way I can.

594
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,213
It's my goal to achieve,

595
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,840
a sense of pride,

596
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,837
and worth as a human being.

597
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:30,077
Gorgeous cousin.

598
00:35:35,974 --> 00:35:37,454
Welcome to Portland!

599
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:56,191
Trust me...

600
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,667
You don't find clubs like this back home.

601
00:35:58,667 --> 00:35:59,600
I'll see.

602
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:13,899
Welcome to London House cousin.

603
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:14,781
This is amazing!

604
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:16,331
Let's go boogie.

605
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:39,441
David!

606
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:40,682
Janette!

607
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:45,497
This is my cousin Bobby.

608
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:50,238
Nice to finally meet you Bobby!

609
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:26,872
So Janette tells me your Mum wants to cure you of your gayness.

610
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:27,572
Yeah, well...

611
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:30,246
My parents don't really understand it.

612
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:31,057
Do yours?

613
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:33,228
They didn't first.

614
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:35,682
But, they eventually came around.

615
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,740
How did you get them to change?

616
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,808
Well, one day,

617
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:42,980
I told them «Accept me as I am, or forget me!»

618
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:48,296
I know my Mum means well but I don't know if she'll ever accept me.

619
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:55,541
Just don't stop trying.

620
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:04,498
<i>Now that you know</i>

621
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:09,000
<i>What every parent should know about homosexuality</i>

623
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:37,415
Have a great trip. 

624
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,719
Don't let her get to you.

625
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,481
And don't be afraid to stand up to her.

626
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,208
Too much flew by fast.

627
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:05,557
I'll call you when I get home.

628
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,412
You'd better.

629
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:13,291
Well. Look who's home.

630
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,268
-Hey Dad.
-Hey, come here, come here.

631
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,927
Just in time for dinner. Come on in.

632
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,156
That's funny.

634
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:23,049
So how was Portland?

635
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:23,515
Yeah...

636
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:25,839
Portland was great.

637
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,367
Good!

638
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:30,452
I'm thinking of maybe moving there for a little bit.

639
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:31,429
Moving there?

640
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:32,849
I met someone...

641
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:38,377
A guy.

642
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:43,315
Girls...

643
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,217
Give me a hand with this.

644
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:50,655
We're supposed to pretend we didn't hear that?

645
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:51,000
Yes.

646
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:52,678
Bobby...

647
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:56,267
This might not have been the right time.

648
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:56,845
I know.

649
00:39:57,574 --> 00:39:58,283
I'm sorry..

650
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,213
You should start thinking about college for next fall.

651
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:07,747
You need to get your GED first.

652
00:40:07,747 --> 00:40:08,201
I mean...

653
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:10,773
it's ok to take some time off but...

654
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:11,776
Did you hear me?

655
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,313
I don't wanna know.

656
00:40:13,313 --> 00:40:15,077
I want you to know.

657
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:17,196
His name's David.

658
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:22,008
We always start at the beginning every time and if we're not getting any more different let's just not go there.

659
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,369
When I'm with him,

660
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:24,433
it feels so...

661
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:25,130
good!

662
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:27,886
He treats me well...

663
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:30,456
he's funny and he's smart...

664
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:33,347
Stop. I mean it. I don't wanna hear it.
And you know I don't.

665
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:37,561
I spent the last year listening to you and you're gonna listen to me for once.

666
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,952
It feels good when I'm with David.

667
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:41,685
But if he touches me in public,

668
00:40:41,685 --> 00:40:43,631
or God forbids, kisses me,

669
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:45,986
I pull away.

670
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:47,994
I feel ashame.

671
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:49,323
Because you know it's wrong.

672
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:52,849
-Because YOU told me it's wrong.
-It's not me. It's the bible.

673
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,603
It's not the bible. It's you!

674
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:56,874
Why can't you admit that?

675
00:40:57,084 --> 00:41:00,114
Why can't you admit that you can't stand what I am?

676
00:41:00,114 --> 00:41:01,461
What you've become!

677
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,576
What I am!

678
00:41:04,036 --> 00:41:07,722
I'm sorry. I'm not the perfect little Bobby you always wanted.

679
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:10,213
But I can't keep apologizing for it Mum.

680
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:12,314
Accept me as I am or forget it.

681
00:41:12,314 --> 00:41:14,190
I won't have a gay son.

682
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,199
Then Mum you don't have a son.

683
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,091
Fine.

684
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:28,441
Bobby...

685
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:43,058
Did you really think she'd change, Bobby?

686
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:47,585
She meant it.

687
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,664
She meant that.

688
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,832
I really want you to be happy.

689
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:02,558
And I'm sure that guy's really nice.

690
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,288
No matter what. She'll never accept it.

691
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:11,083
It's gonna be a lonely life because he'll never be welcome here.

692
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:14,378
And for Christmas, Thanksgiving, anything.

693
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:27,936
Don't worry about Mum too much. She'll come around.

694
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:30,004
I'm not gonna hold my breath.

695
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,054
Here you go.

696
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:36,316
The parachute pants!

697
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,779
Thanks.

698
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:46,854
I'll send you my first novel when I write it.

699
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:50,615
Bye Buck-Tooth!

700
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,602
Take care, ok?

701
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:56,816
Drive safe.

702
00:43:53,482 --> 00:43:58,301
<i>... most of the new cases up to 5 a day seem to be settled in the homosexual community...</i>

703
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:02,305
<i>The AIDS becoming known as «the gay disease».</i>

704
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:16,284
Well...

705
00:44:17,117 --> 00:44:20,689
your Mum went alot for your birthday.

706
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:21,600
No card.

707
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,418
A sweater and "AIDS - The Wrath of God".

708
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:25,937
Whoah.

709
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:28,613
Happy birthday!

710
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,132
You can't expect anything different from her, Bobby.

711
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:33,480
She's not gonna change.

712
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,506
Birthdays were always a big deal for all of us.

713
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:39,564
I'm just not in the «all of us» anymore.

714
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,372
Can't get that throughout my head.

715
00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:47,242
There's David.

716
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,804
Talk to you later.

717
00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:02,539
You sure this is ok?

718
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:03,897
They're gonna love you.

719
00:45:07,766 --> 00:45:08,232
Let's go.

720
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:11,823
Dad, do you have to tell that story?

721
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:13,599
Hey, I felt I had to.

722
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,466
Yes. And I've got about a dozen more where that came from if you're interested.

723
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:19,885
Oh, oh no thanks.

724
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:22,463
So Bobby...

725
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,132
tell us more about you.

726
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:26,045
You grew up in Walnut Creek, right?

727
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:27,514
David says you're very close to your family.

728
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:27,859
Yeah.

729
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:32,364
So how are your parents with you being gay?

730
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:33,125
Not good.

731
00:45:34,214 --> 00:45:34,533
Well...

732
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:37,008
Maybe it's hard for them at first.

733
00:45:37,008 --> 00:45:37,986
They'll come around.

734
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:42,944
You seem like a wonderful young man.
I'm sure they love you.

735
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:43,354
Hey!

736
00:45:43,939 --> 00:45:46,357
- Cheers to that!
- Cheers to that!

737
00:45:46,357 --> 00:45:48,253
It's great to meet you Bobby.

738
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:50,517
So how did you guys meet?

739
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:51,926
You know Janette?...

740
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:57,997
<i>It's a sin.</i>

741
00:45:58,183 --> 00:45:59,420
<i>It's not natural.</i>

744
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:07,296
<i>He'll never be welcome here.
Why do you keep choosing this?</i>

745
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:09,009
Sometimes I hurt so bad...

746
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,498
And I'm scared and I'm alone.

747
00:46:12,575 --> 00:46:15,404
<i>I'm sure they love you.</i>

748
00:46:15,678 --> 00:46:16,985
<i>I'm damned.</i>

749
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:24,388
I'm slowly sinking in a vast lake of quick sand.

750
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:25,736
A bottomless pool.

751
00:46:27,055 --> 00:46:32,306
I wish I could crawl under a rock and sleep forever.

752
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:44,241
You've reached David.

753
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:48,442
I'm not here right now but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back to you. 

754
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:49,618
Have a good one...

755
00:46:51,054 --> 00:46:52,636
Hey David it's Bobby.

756
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:56,954
I thought you'd be there.

757
00:46:58,259 --> 00:46:59,080
Look I'm...

758
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:06,248
I really need someone to talk to and I was hoping you'd be there.

759
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:09,466
Please,

760
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:14,981
dear lord, continue to convict Bobby's heart off sin.

761
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:32,960
That he may find his way

763
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,180
The way of purity,

764
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,486
the way of the righteous.

765
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,525
<i>It's a sin.</i>

766
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:24,953
<i>It's not natural.</i>

767
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:18,029
<i>I won't have a gay son.</i>

768
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,806
You're gonna be late for school.

769
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:32,354
You're the one who slept in.

770
00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:35,164
Ok, then we're both gonna be late for school.

771
00:49:35,164 --> 00:49:36,049
Meet you in the car.

772
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:37,870
- OK!
- Hello?

774
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,487
Janette, what's wrong?

775
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,075
No...

776
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:49,990
What's wrong?

777
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,457
No...

778
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,453
What's wrong?

779
00:49:52,453 --> 00:49:53,690
Nancy, get out of here!

780
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:54,824
Dad!

781
00:49:56,885 --> 00:49:57,351
Daddy...

782
00:50:01,115 --> 00:50:01,460
Hello.

783
00:50:03,649 --> 00:50:04,885
Hi. Hi, Janette...

784
00:50:06,564 --> 00:50:11,521
Mary, you've been called up front and he said to bring your purse.

785
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:13,458
Probably one of the kids that needs money again.

788
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:16,443
I need a break anyway.

789
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:16,909
Bye.

790
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:41,136
What is it?

791
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,647
Bobby killed himself.

792
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:52,201
He jumped off a bridge.

793
00:50:53,298 --> 00:50:53,825
He... He's gone.

794
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:00,877
Help me!

795
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:06,789
Help me!!

796
00:51:07,957 --> 00:51:10,491
My son is dead!
Let me out!

797
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,175
Let me out!

798
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,324
My son is dead!
Let me out!

800
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,391
Joy, slow down. What's wrong?

801
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:29,765
Thank you.

802
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:48,460
Death of a loved one is always tragic

803
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,121
But the death of a young person can be particularly painful.

804
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:55,516
Because that person had his whole life ahead of him.

805
00:52:55,516 --> 00:52:57,462
Bobby was only 20 years old.

806
00:52:57,738 --> 00:53:02,353
We'll never know who he could have been. Or what he could have accomplished.

807
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:05,475
Bobby was a good young man but he was lost.

808
00:53:06,862 --> 00:53:10,004
By giving into temptation, he strayed.

809
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:12,172
Then desillusioned, 

810
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:16,969
he chose to end his life.

811
00:53:17,657 --> 00:53:20,388
Now we know to condemn the sin,

812
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:21,443
not the sinner,

813
00:53:23,011 --> 00:53:25,667
it was this sin that Bobby succombed to.

814
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:28,977
It led to his unhappiness.

815
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,192
And it led him

816
00:53:31,315 --> 00:53:33,667
to take his own life.

817
00:53:34,953 --> 00:53:37,219
As goodness begets goodness,

818
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,642
so does sin begets sin.

819
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:42,312
They're ok with this?

820
00:54:10,325 --> 00:54:12,056
They're running low on sandwiches.

821
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:15,108
Mum, do you think Bobby got salvation?

822
00:54:15,108 --> 00:54:15,980
I don't know.

823
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:18,445
Suicide is a sin.

824
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:22,181
But maybe God knows that Bobby wasn't in his right mind?.

825
00:54:22,181 --> 00:54:22,918
I mean...

826
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:27,217
Why would God allow Booby to go to hell if it was in his power to cure him?

827
00:54:27,217 --> 00:54:28,444
I don't know Mary!

828
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:30,069
Clear yourself together.

829
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:34,960
People are unconfortable enough.

830
00:54:42,248 --> 00:54:43,485
Thank for coming.

831
00:54:44,634 --> 00:54:46,762
I'm so sorry for your loss.

832
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,325
Mrs Griffith. Mr. Griffith..

833
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:57,838
I'm David.

834
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:00,294
I was a friend of Bobby's.

835
00:55:03,122 --> 00:55:05,738
I wanna offer my condolences.

836
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,046
He was an amazing young man.

837
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,577
I'm so sorry.

838
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:56,635
Aunt Mary...

839
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,367
David is a good person.

840
00:55:59,635 --> 00:56:01,754
All of Bobby's friends were.

841
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:05,363
When Bobby was here, he was under control.

842
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:08,254
Then he moves to Portland and someone puts all these ideas into his head.

843
00:56:08,254 --> 00:56:09,309
It wasn't like that.

844
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:10,978
David cared for Bobby.

845
00:56:10,978 --> 00:56:12,352
We're his family.

846
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:13,859
We know how to help me,

847
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:15,730
he wanted to change, to be closer to god.

848
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,028
To be closer to YOU!

849
00:56:17,028 --> 00:56:21,313
Then he went further and further into that life style and he couldn't get out.

850
00:56:21,313 --> 00:56:24,144
Do you believe everything they tell you in church?

851
00:56:24,144 --> 00:56:26,529
I know you and uncle Bob meant with that serment...

852
00:56:26,529 --> 00:56:29,252
Bobby knew the repercussions about homosexual lifestyle.

853
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,786
Bobby was good, descent and kind.

854
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:38,356
Someone who didn't even know Bobby stood up there and condemned him, and you let him.

855
00:56:38,356 --> 00:56:41,110
Bobby did everything he could to make himself acceptable to you.

856
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:45,651
He was so good, and bright, and funny. He should be praised.

857
00:56:47,092 --> 00:56:50,103
I'm sorry you can't see it that way.

858
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:51,798
Maybe you should go.

859
00:56:52,566 --> 00:56:53,326
Fine.

860
00:56:54,532 --> 00:56:57,482
I left Bobby's things in his room.

861
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Bobby!

862
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Hey Mum!

863
00:57:49,611 --> 00:57:51,790
Don't you ever do that again!

864
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:54,262
I knew it wasn't true.

865
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,751
I knew God would bring you back to me.

866
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:58,769
Mum, you worry too much.

867
00:58:36,705 --> 00:58:39,717
<i>I'm slowly sinking in a vast lake of quick sands.</i>

868
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,248
<i>A bottomless pool.</i>

869
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:45,276
<i>I wish I could crawl under a rock and sleep forever.</i>

870
00:58:45,276 --> 00:58:46,817
<i>Noone understands me.</i>

871
00:58:47,342 --> 00:58:50,067
<i>Noone in this house can accept my side of the story.</i>

872
00:58:50,067 --> 00:58:52,932
<i>I can feel god's eyes looking down on me with pity.</i>

873
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:55,649
<i>I can't never let anyone find out I'm not straight.</i>

874
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:57,433
<i>It would be so humiliating...</i>

875
00:58:57,691 --> 00:58:59,333
<i>My friends would hate me.</i>

876
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:00,813
<i>and my family...</i>

877
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:01,549
Mum.

878
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,221
<i>I've overheard them.</i>

879
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:04,100
Thank you.

880
00:59:04,915 --> 00:59:06,598
<i>They've said that they hate gays.</i>

881
00:59:06,598 --> 00:59:08,716
<i>And even God hates gays.</i>

882
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:13,998
<i>It really scares me when they talk that way because now they are talking about me.</i>

883
00:59:13,998 --> 00:59:15,917
<i>I don't wanna choose sin.</i>

884
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:16,860
<i>I don't.</i>

885
00:59:17,644 --> 00:59:20,458
<i>I'm so mad and frustrated god...</i>

886
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,175
<i>I seem to be at the end of the road.</i>

887
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,041
<i>Why do you remain silent?</i>

888
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:27,694
<i>May 30th.</i>

889
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:30,250
<i>Memorial Day Barbecue.</i>

890
00:59:30,314 --> 00:59:31,267
<i>Had fun.</i>

891
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:34,157
<i>Mum was sweet and funny self.</i>

892
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:35,810
<i>Like the old Mum...</i>

893
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:38,888
<i>For a second it felt like the old days.</i>

894
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:41,209
<i>She smiled at something I said,</i>

895
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:46,329
<i>and I saw on her eyes that for a second she forgot what she really thinks of me.</i>

896
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:48,500
<i>The anger never erupts.</i>

897
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:53,486
<i>My timid nature would never allow a full fledged thunderstorm to occur.</i>

898
00:59:53,486 --> 00:59:55,554
<i>But it's there, on the horizon.</i>

899
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:59,993
<i>I can feel god's eyes looking down on me with such pity.</i>

900
00:59:59,993 --> 01:00:01,827
<i>He can't help me though.</i>

901
01:00:01,827 --> 01:00:05,183
<i>Because I've chosen sin over righteousness.</i>
 
905
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:32,769
Excuse me.

906
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:34,492
You alright Ed?

907
01:00:34,903 --> 01:00:38,423
Oh yeah, I'm fantastic.
I think we all are. Isn't that obvious?

908
01:00:38,423 --> 01:00:41,484
Ed. We have to deal with this as a family.

909
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,922
That was your answer for Bobby too but it didn't work.

910
01:00:44,922 --> 01:00:45,571
Damned!

911
01:00:47,194 --> 01:00:48,005
I'll go. I'll go.

912
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:49,503
Excuse me.

913
01:00:54,992 --> 01:00:55,935
Come, Nancy.

914
01:01:25,618 --> 01:01:28,861
You wanna get out of here, maybe go for a beer?

915
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:39,537
Did he even think about what he would do to us?

916
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:42,560
He could have called...

917
01:01:43,258 --> 01:01:44,373
or something but...

918
01:01:45,804 --> 01:01:47,509
not just screw us, right?

919
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:47,915
Ed...

920
01:01:48,058 --> 01:01:51,788
Nothing no! No goodbye, no note, nothing. Just...

921
01:01:56,487 --> 01:01:57,551
I'm sorry Bobby.

922
01:01:59,126 --> 01:01:59,775
I'm sorry.

923
01:02:02,038 --> 01:02:03,336
Are you happy now?

924
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:04,782
I'm sorry Bobby.

925
01:02:05,913 --> 01:02:07,210
Are you happy now?

926
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:08,594
Ed...

927
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:13,148
It's not your fault.

928
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,302
There must be other Bobbys out there.

929
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:35,732
Other young gay people who may be thinking of taking their lives.

930
01:02:36,842 --> 01:02:38,738
Does the church reach out to them?

931
01:02:41,334 --> 01:02:43,514
They are other churches that do that.

932
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:50,052
Reverend Joseph asked us to tell you how sorry he is for your loss.

933
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:58,129
- We can come back in a couple of weeks and check in on your f...
- You don't understand, are you...

934
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,196
I don't know what to do.

935
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:05,903
I need to make peace with this and I can't.

936
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:12,143
The lord says the impure will be thrown into the lake of fire.

937
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:14,469
Bobby...

938
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:15,694
sinned!

939
01:03:16,169 --> 01:03:17,933
But he was pure of heart.

940
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:21,511
He'd never knowingly hurt anyone.

941
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:24,844
Is that enough?

942
01:03:31,551 --> 01:03:32,017
Is it?

943
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,048
Dear god,

944
01:03:39,906 --> 01:03:43,150
my relationship to you leaves something to be desired.

945
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,649
I have never asked of you,

946
01:03:46,011 --> 01:03:48,140
only given, as I was told.

947
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:51,406
Your holy spirit has taught me so much...

948
01:03:51,608 --> 01:03:54,203
But now there's more I need to know.

949
01:04:01,461 --> 01:04:01,744
Hey!

950
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:08,471
I can't.

951
01:04:12,002 --> 01:04:12,701
Ok.

952
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:23,953
I think I'm gonna sleep in the living room.

954
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:12,351
Reverend?

955
01:05:13,173 --> 01:05:14,177
Mary Griffith. 

956
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:16,060
Nice to have you with us, Mary.

957
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:16,881
The bible...

958
01:05:18,064 --> 01:05:22,235
it says that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death. Do you believe that?

959
01:05:22,235 --> 01:05:25,682
There are other interpretations of the bible, Mrs Griffith.

960
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:26,919
My son...

961
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,860
was gay...

962
01:05:28,472 --> 01:05:29,476
and he killed himself.

963
01:05:31,281 --> 01:05:33,593
Is there an other interpretation of that?

964
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:36,753
I'm sorry.

965
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,533
What was his name?

966
01:05:45,243 --> 01:05:45,709
Bobby.

967
01:05:46,946 --> 01:05:47,949
Bobby Griffith.

968
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:52,778
I saw him here a couple of times.

969
01:05:52,778 --> 01:05:53,711
My Bobby?

970
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:57,033
He always sat way in the back.

971
01:05:57,522 --> 01:05:59,053
He stopped coming.

972
01:06:00,314 --> 01:06:01,379
I am so sorry.

973
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:03,001
You must be...

974
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,714
I need answers.

975
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:07,000
I need to know where he is.

976
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:10,415
Is homosexuality an unforgivable sin?

977
01:06:10,782 --> 01:06:12,424
Leviticus, 18:22 says:

978
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:17,009
«If a man lies with another man, it is an abomination.»

979
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:21,108
An abomination, in that time, didn't mean sin. It meant unclean.

980
01:06:21,108 --> 01:06:22,363
Leviticus also goes on to

981
01:06:22,363 --> 01:06:25,046
say eating shellfish is an abomination.

982
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:26,928
Or mixing fabrics...

983
01:06:26,928 --> 01:06:27,982
Leviticus 20:13

984
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,997
«If a man lies with another man, they both should be put to death.»

985
01:06:31,997 --> 01:06:37,697
And then he says the same thing about an adultere, or a child that disobeys their parents.

986
01:06:37,697 --> 01:06:41,028
And we certainly don't interpret that scripture litteraly. 

987
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:42,387
In Deuteronomy 22,

988
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,806
«If a woman is not a virgin on her wedding day,

989
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:48,861
she should be taken to her father's house and stoned to death.»

990
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,544
So what do you tell people who come here?

991
01:06:52,654 --> 01:06:53,718
Gay people...

992
01:06:54,757 --> 01:06:56,949
That homosexuality is ok?

993
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:59,563
That it is permissible in god's eyes?

994
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:01,579
I tell them what I believe to be the truth:

995
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:03,404
that God loves them as they are.

996
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:06,204
God's vengeance is great.

997
01:07:06,204 --> 01:07:08,028
So is his compassion.

998
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,485
You shouldn't teach them

999
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:11,872
that homoseuxality is ok.

1000
01:07:11,872 --> 01:07:13,799
That's not what the bible says.

1001
01:07:14,142 --> 01:07:15,855
It just confuses them more.

1002
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:16,895
Mrs Griffith,

1003
01:07:16,895 --> 01:07:19,397
if you'd like to come back during the week and talk,

1004
01:07:19,397 --> 01:07:20,507
my door is open,

1005
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:22,332
but not to be blamed.

1006
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:23,441
ok?

1007
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,919
I think that we got

1008
01:08:03,919 --> 01:08:04,852
a pretty good one,

1009
01:08:05,571 --> 01:08:06,686
nice and full.

1010
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:10,298
A couple of balls like your dear old dad.

1011
01:08:10,298 --> 01:08:11,048
Or grandma...

1012
01:08:14,606 --> 01:08:15,072
Yeah...

1013
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:19,052
Mum, can we hang this one on the tree? 

1015
01:08:23,714 --> 01:08:26,136
I remember when he made this.

1016
01:08:26,225 --> 01:08:27,289
Second grade.

1017
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,114
Mrs Towns' class, I think.

1018
01:08:30,602 --> 01:08:32,964
He was so proud of himself.

1019
01:08:35,599 --> 01:08:37,018
Where do you want to put it?

1020
01:08:38,277 --> 01:08:38,916
Up high.

1021
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:40,937
So he can look out.

1022
01:08:47,959 --> 01:08:48,963
Hey, they work.

1023
01:08:54,092 --> 01:08:55,745
I'm gonna go check on my cookies.

1024
01:09:20,376 --> 01:09:22,809
I found the passage you talked about.

1025
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:24,339
About stoning to death

1026
01:09:24,339 --> 01:09:25,464
Deuteronomy, 22.

1027
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:28,863
But what about Sodom and Gommorah?

1028
01:09:28,871 --> 01:09:32,949
God punishes the sin of homosexuality. How do you explain that?

1029
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:34,774
It's nice to see you too, Mary.

1030
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:37,455
What's this for?

1031
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:39,194
It's a roomish sale.

1032
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:41,772
All gay people have roomish too.

1033
01:09:42,754 --> 01:09:43,342
So...

1034
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,528
What about Sodom and Gommorah?

1035
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:50,666
Many scholars think this sin was greed and not homosexuality.

1036
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:54,600
And it wasn't labeled homosexuality until years after it was written.

1037
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,970
Do you have answers for all these things just to justify being that way?

1038
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,539
You have answers to justify that it's wrong.

1039
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:03,607
I guess we're in an impass here.

1040
01:10:05,025 --> 01:10:09,202
So you think it's ok to interpret the bible any way you want? 

1041
01:10:09,202 --> 01:10:14,199
No, of course not. But the bible was written and interpreted my mortal men.

1042
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:19,054
And many of those interpretations were reflections of the time and what they lived.

1043
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:23,473
So you feel completely free to question it?

1044
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,133
Because...

1045
01:10:24,692 --> 01:10:25,929
I think it's blasphemous.

1046
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:29,061
I don't think God minds questions.

1047
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:32,699
He might not be thrilled with all our answers. 

1048
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:36,367
I think blind faith is just as dangerous as none at all.

1049
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:38,769
I've never questioned my faith. I...

1050
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:40,774
I've never had reasons to.

1051
01:10:40,774 --> 01:10:42,509
Sometimes to question it...

1052
01:10:42,509 --> 01:10:45,287
helps you find a deeper faith.

1053
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:48,951
Bobby stopped coming here.

1054
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:52,198
I think the reason was...

1055
01:10:52,657 --> 01:10:56,550
he couldn't never allow himself to feel worthy of God's love.

1056
01:11:00,202 --> 01:11:01,784
And we didn't help.

1057
01:11:02,861 --> 01:11:03,389
Mary...

1058
01:11:04,837 --> 01:11:07,002
Have you ever heard about P-FLAG?

1059
01:11:07,002 --> 01:11:11,191
It's a national organisation.
It's «Parents and friend of lesbians and gays».

1060
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:11,965
No, that's not for me.

1061
01:11:11,965 --> 01:11:12,847
They can help.

1062
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,513
You'd be able to see you're not so alone in this. 

1063
01:11:16,513 --> 01:11:17,034
Bye reverend.

1064
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:17,368
No.

1065
01:11:17,368 --> 01:11:20,089
There's a woman in Concord, Betty Lambert.

1066
01:11:20,089 --> 01:11:21,032
You'll love her.

1067
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:23,909
She has a gay son in his 30s.

1068
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:27,029
I just had a few questions.
I don't need anything else.

1069
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:28,377
Just in case.

1070
01:11:34,686 --> 01:11:40,233
It's true. There's a passage that says if children are disobedient they should be put to death.

1071
01:11:40,233 --> 01:11:43,619
And I mean noone interprets that litteraly.

1072
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,814
What I'm saying is...

1073
01:11:46,147 --> 01:11:49,116
if the church no longer interprets that litteraly,

1074
01:11:49,116 --> 01:11:52,132
maybe homosexuality is also on that list.

1075
01:11:52,132 --> 01:11:52,954
Well, maybe.

1076
01:11:54,362 --> 01:11:56,308
Well, don't you think that's important?

1077
01:11:56,914 --> 01:11:59,896
Mary, I wasn't that keen with the first interpretation of the bible.

1078
01:11:59,896 --> 01:12:03,041
Well, it could mean that Bobby's in heaven.

1079
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:04,797
Yeah, well, he's not here.

1080
01:12:04,797 --> 01:12:05,264
Right?

1081
01:12:05,497 --> 01:12:07,783
Why isn't that enough for you?

1082
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:09,374
Is it enough for you?!

1083
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,536
Does it make it any better?

1084
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,007
Everything you're doing?

1085
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:15,710
What do you want me to do?

1086
01:12:16,352 --> 01:12:19,294
Just forget about him? I can't do that. Maybe you can.

1087
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:20,436
I don't wont to forget about him, Mary.

1088
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,150
I want to remember him. Then I want to move on.

1089
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,336
But I can't!

1090
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:25,352
Nobody can...

1091
01:12:26,145 --> 01:12:27,153
Just walk away. Like you always do.

1092
01:12:27,153 --> 01:12:28,684
You never deal with anything.

1093
01:12:29,484 --> 01:12:30,609
Oh, I see...

1094
01:12:31,136 --> 01:12:32,856
Maybe if I did, Bobby would still be alive today?

1095
01:12:32,856 --> 01:12:35,613
Is that what you're saying? Is that what you think?

1096
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:39,034
You can answer me!

1097
01:12:47,647 --> 01:12:49,769
Listen Mary, we both made mistakes. We all made mistakes. But it's done, he's gone.

1098
01:12:49,769 --> 01:12:53,077
We're not gonna bring him back.

1099
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,192
I know that!!!

1100
01:12:55,307 --> 01:12:57,365
Don't you know I know that?!

1101
01:13:19,927 --> 01:13:20,332
Mary?

1102
01:13:20,623 --> 01:13:21,556
I'm Betty.

1103
01:13:21,842 --> 01:13:22,187
Hello.

1104
01:13:22,605 --> 01:13:23,344
Betty Lambert.

1105
01:13:23,344 --> 01:13:25,267
I'm so glad you called.

1106
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,504
Please, come in.

1107
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:31,287
Reverend Whitsell told me what happened to Bobby.

1108
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:36,021
I can't imagine what it must feel like to lose a child like that...

1109
01:13:36,093 --> 01:13:37,563
How long has it been?

1110
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,863
Six months...

1111
01:13:41,271 --> 01:13:43,096
Six months and a few days.

1112
01:13:45,919 --> 01:13:49,109
Our son was 14 when he came out to us.

1113
01:13:49,109 --> 01:13:51,278
Isn't that a little young?

1114
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:54,753
I knew before then.

1115
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:58,385
We, mothers, we always know. Don't we?

1116
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,014
And you were ok with it?

1117
01:14:01,014 --> 01:14:02,007
Oh god, no.

1118
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,094
I don't think any parent hears the news and thinks «Oh Goodie»!

1119
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:15,885
«Goodie» wasn't the first word that came to my mind.

1120
01:14:16,692 --> 01:14:17,280
Mary...

1121
01:14:18,545 --> 01:14:21,900
Why don't you come to a P-FLAG meeting with me?

1122
01:14:22,002 --> 01:14:23,056
No, I'm...

1123
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:26,069
I'm not good at talking in groups.

1124
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:27,891
So don't talk.

1125
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:30,337
Just come and listen.

1126
01:14:31,486 --> 01:14:33,139
I think you'll be shocked

1127
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:38,751
at how many people think they were the All-American-Family.

1128
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,111
I'll think about it.

1129
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,303
Eric was taunted in shcool all the time.

1131
01:14:49,813 --> 01:14:50,960
Mary, you came.

1132
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,045
I can't stay long.

1133
01:14:52,045 --> 01:14:53,221
That's great. Come on in.

1134
01:14:53,356 --> 01:14:56,453
I was so furious, I went to the principal.

1135
01:14:56,453 --> 01:14:59,920
But he didn't do a thing to the boys who did it.

1136
01:15:00,471 --> 01:15:02,306
I was shocked by that.

1137
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:05,409
I called them fruits, and ferries.

1138
01:15:06,037 --> 01:15:07,030
I didn't know.

1139
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:10,389
It took me a long time to accept my Sam.

1140
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,266
I think I alway knew.

1141
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,027
I mean...

1142
01:15:14,027 --> 01:15:18,396
He asked for a pink Lacoste shirt for his birthday.

1143
01:15:18,633 --> 01:15:20,408
He was always different.

1144
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:22,748
So he tells me he's gay...

1145
01:15:23,054 --> 01:15:24,271
What do I do?

1146
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,609
I take him hunting.

1147
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:28,881
There he is in his pink Lacoste shirt, he saw a deer

1148
01:15:28,881 --> 01:15:31,345
and yaled «Run, Bambi, run»

1149
01:15:32,275 --> 01:15:35,396
I always knew I could love my son

1150
01:15:35,396 --> 01:15:38,995
I never thought I could accept him. For who he is.

1151
01:15:39,837 --> 01:15:44,485
Well, when Gil told me she was gay. I insisted she see a psychiastrist.

1152
01:15:44,485 --> 01:15:48,094
But when that man suggested shock therapy,

1153
01:15:49,376 --> 01:15:53,431
I looked at my baby and, the hurt in her eyes.

1154
01:15:54,197 --> 01:15:55,869
I thought «This is crazy!»

1155
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:57,136
Ah, hello reverend!

1156
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,201
Please, come sit down.

1157
01:15:58,201 --> 01:15:59,083
Hi guys!

1158
01:15:59,214 --> 01:16:00,217
Hi reverend!

1159
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,272
Glad to see you're all here tonight.

1160
01:16:02,272 --> 01:16:07,554
As you may know, reverend Whitsell is a pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church,

1161
01:16:07,554 --> 01:16:11,974
and he's proposing a gay freedom day to the Walnut Creek city council.

1162
01:16:12,664 --> 01:16:15,596
The city council vote happens in about a month.

1163
01:16:15,596 --> 01:16:18,759
and I would love all your support.

1164
01:16:35,396 --> 01:16:35,802
Mary!

1165
01:17:12,952 --> 01:17:13,357
Mary?

1166
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:17,983
Mary, what are you doing out here?

1167
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:20,222
You're soak. Come inside.

1168
01:17:20,222 --> 01:17:22,513
I didn't know where else to go.

1169
01:17:28,906 --> 01:17:30,437
I was sitting there,

1170
01:17:30,931 --> 01:17:32,949
listening to all their stories.

1171
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,178
About how they...

1172
01:17:35,728 --> 01:17:37,330
always just knew...

1173
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:40,365
their kid was different.

1174
01:17:42,014 --> 01:17:44,548
And then I had this dream tonight...

1175
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:46,965
Bobby was a baby.

1176
01:17:53,944 --> 01:17:56,306
My son was always different.

1177
01:18:00,755 --> 01:18:03,360
His difference began at conception.

1178
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:07,173
I knew that.

1179
01:18:08,423 --> 01:18:09,305
I felt it.

1180
01:18:11,599 --> 01:18:12,481
I know now...

1181
01:18:13,419 --> 01:18:15,538
why God didn't heal Bobby

1182
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:19,102
He didn't heal him because...

1183
01:18:21,809 --> 01:18:23,989
there was nothing wrong with him.

1184
01:18:26,797 --> 01:18:27,729
I did this!

1185
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,521
I killed my son!

1186
01:18:31,872 --> 01:18:33,249
You did not kill your son.

1187
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:34,314
Bobby killed himself.

1188
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:36,814
How could God forgive me?

1189
01:18:38,846 --> 01:18:40,742
How could Bobby forgive me?

1190
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,289
God has already done the forgiving.

1191
01:18:43,709 --> 01:18:46,294
You have to forgive yourself.

1192
01:18:47,899 --> 01:18:49,136
I'm so sorry!

1193
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:53,752
I'm so sorry!

1194
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,271
Dear god.

1195
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:08,754
Give us something we can live with

1196
01:19:08,754 --> 01:19:14,701
and pass on to others whose lives will never be the same because of a loved one's death. 

1197
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:17,124
I did not decide on brown eyes for myself.

1198
01:19:18,162 --> 01:19:21,700
And I now realize that Bobby didn't decide to be gay.

1199
01:19:22,486 --> 01:19:24,113
If you say in your word

1200
01:19:24,113 --> 01:19:27,235
that it is evil and wicked to be born with no arms,

1201
01:19:27,516 --> 01:19:29,756
and a child is born with no arms,

1202
01:19:30,592 --> 01:19:32,771
What is that child to think?

1203
01:19:39,185 --> 01:19:45,158
Our first order business is a proposal for a gay freedeom day in Walnut Creek.

1204
01:19:45,158 --> 01:19:46,517
Attention, please.

1205
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,868
We have a select group to debate the issue.

1206
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:49,715
I don't see her.

1207
01:19:49,715 --> 01:19:52,554
...it's reverend Whitsell.

1208
01:19:52,834 --> 01:19:53,706
For one day,

1209
01:19:54,882 --> 01:19:58,945
for one day, people can celebrate their difference rather than feel shame. 

1210
01:19:58,945 --> 01:20:00,719
They should be ashame!

1211
01:20:02,773 --> 01:20:07,095
There are so many other people who need our time and our attention.

1212
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:09,112
Why are we wasting it on this?

1213
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:12,472
Alright, alright. Let's have some order here please.

1214
01:20:12,472 --> 01:20:15,949
They spit in the face of decency and morality.

1215
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:22,396
We cannot allow the fabric of our society to be torn apart.

1216
01:20:24,021 --> 01:20:24,488
Right?

1217
01:20:30,002 --> 01:20:33,611
I heard he tries to run for the Human Relations commission,

1218
01:20:33,652 --> 01:20:36,896
they picked that limped Whitsell instead.

1219
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:38,795
They sent him a letter.

1220
01:20:38,902 --> 01:20:40,758
I said, 'We sing hymns at our church'.

1221
01:20:40,758 --> 01:20:42,904
What do you do with the hymns at your church?

1222
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,467
So unless anyone else has anything else to add,

1223
01:20:45,467 --> 01:20:48,139
we'll adjourn to make our decision.

1224
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:48,545
Mary?

1225
01:20:50,277 --> 01:20:50,855
Hey Dad!

1226
01:20:52,312 --> 01:20:53,184
Dad, get in here!

1227
01:20:54,176 --> 01:20:56,346
Dad hurry up! Mum's on TV.

1228
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,591
Homosexuality is a sin.

1230
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:03,248
Homosexuals are dommed to spend eternity in hell.

1232
01:21:04,633 --> 01:21:05,991
If they wanted to change,

1233
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:09,531
they could be healed of their evil ways.

1234
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,599
If they would turn away from temptation,

1235
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:14,270
they could be normal again.

1236
01:21:14,346 --> 01:21:17,525
If only they would try and try harder,

1237
01:21:17,525 --> 01:21:18,883
if it doesn't work.

1238
01:21:19,248 --> 01:21:24,219
These are all the things I said to my son Bobby when I found out he was gay.

1239
01:21:24,219 --> 01:21:25,993
When he told me he was homosexual,

1240
01:21:25,993 --> 01:21:27,888
my world fell apart.

1241
01:21:28,556 --> 01:21:30,077
I did everything I could

1242
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,476
to cure him of his sickness.

1243
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:35,707
8 months ago, my son...

1244
01:21:35,707 --> 01:21:37,948
jumped off a bridge and killed himself.

1245
01:21:39,631 --> 01:21:44,471
I deeply regret my lack of knowledge about gay and lesbian people.

1246
01:21:44,471 --> 01:21:49,073
I see that everything I was taught and told was bigotry and dehumanizing slender.

1247
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:54,086
If I had investigated, beyond what I was told,

1248
01:21:54,169 --> 01:21:56,125
if I had just,

1249
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:57,582
listened to my son,

1250
01:21:59,024 --> 01:22:01,326
when he poured his heart out to me...

1251
01:22:01,869 --> 01:22:04,231
I would not be standing here today with you

1252
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:06,227
filled with regrets.

1253
01:22:06,545 --> 01:22:07,427
I believe

1254
01:22:07,706 --> 01:22:11,607
that God was pleased with Bobby's kind and loving spirit.

1255
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:12,912
In god's eyes

1256
01:22:12,912 --> 01:22:15,679
kindness and love are what it's all about.

1257
01:22:16,035 --> 01:22:21,225
I didn't know that each time that I echoed eternal damnation for gay people...

1258
01:22:21,273 --> 01:22:27,810
each time I referred to Bobby as sick and perverted and a danger to our children...

1259
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,107
his self-esteem,

1260
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:33,165
his sense of worth, were being destroyed.

1261
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:34,423
and finally,

1262
01:22:34,872 --> 01:22:38,725
his spirit broke beyond repair.

1263
01:22:39,745 --> 01:22:45,391
It was not god's will that Bobby climbed over the side of a freeway overpass

1264
01:22:46,446 --> 01:22:48,253
and jumped directly into the path

1265
01:22:48,253 --> 01:22:52,571
of an 18 wheel truck which killed him instantly.

1266
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:54,530
Bobby's death

1267
01:22:54,530 --> 01:23:00,491
was the direct result of his parents' ignorance and fear of the word gay.

1268
01:23:02,759 --> 01:23:04,472
He wanted to be a writer.

1269
01:23:06,602 --> 01:23:11,741
His hopes and dreams should not have been taken from him but they were.

1270
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:13,436
They are children

1271
01:23:14,296 --> 01:23:15,289
like Bobby,

1272
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:18,425
sitting in your congreggations,

1273
01:23:19,497 --> 01:23:20,977
unknown to you,

1274
01:23:21,114 --> 01:23:22,767
they will be listening,

1275
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:24,822
as you echo «Amen».

1276
01:23:26,909 --> 01:23:29,981
And that will soon silence their prayers.

1277
01:23:30,915 --> 01:23:32,436
Their prayers to god,

1278
01:23:32,436 --> 01:23:33,561
for understanding,

1279
01:23:33,983 --> 01:23:34,865
and acceptance,

1280
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,806
and for your love.

1281
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,834
But your hatred, and fear,

1282
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:45,918
and ignorance of the word «gay» will silence those prayers

1283
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:48,136
So...

1284
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,624
before you echo «Amen»

1285
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:55,542
in your home and place of worship.

1286
01:23:56,052 --> 01:23:56,579
Think!

1287
01:23:57,393 --> 01:23:58,752
Think and remember.

1288
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,575
A child is listening.

1289
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:08,361
Oh, Mum...

1290
01:24:15,404 --> 01:24:16,995
Should be good.

1291
01:24:29,448 --> 01:24:30,097
He lost.

1292
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:33,218
They voted the order install.

1293
01:24:33,218 --> 01:24:36,401
Well, he'll try again next year, right?

1294
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:39,300
So, we're really going to San Francisco?

1295
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,878
I think we have to.

1296
01:24:40,878 --> 01:24:42,997
I don't think that's a choice.

1297
01:24:43,836 --> 01:24:44,302
Well...

1298
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:46,070
that's ironic.

1299
01:24:48,931 --> 01:24:49,631
Ok.

1300
01:25:00,009 --> 01:25:01,020
Are we late?

1301
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,074
Just in time!

1302
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:04,968
Jacky, is this everyone?

1303
01:25:04,968 --> 01:25:06,144
Oh! honey, no...

1304
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,446
Come with me.

1305
01:25:07,927 --> 01:25:09,596
We have a special place for you.

1306
01:25:09,596 --> 01:25:10,296
Ok .

1308
01:25:55,844 --> 01:25:58,490
To all the Bobby and Janes out there...

1309
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:02,982
I say these words to you as I would with my own precious children.

1310
01:26:02,982 --> 01:26:05,078
Please don't give up hope on life.

1311
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,071
Or yourselves.

1312
01:26:06,983 --> 01:26:08,933
You're very special to me.

1313
01:26:08,933 --> 01:26:14,343
I'm working very hard to make this world a better and safer place for you to live in.

1314
01:26:14,343 --> 01:26:17,070
Promise me you'll keep trying.

1315
01:26:17,168 --> 01:26:18,992
Bobby gave up on love.

1316
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:20,878
I hope you won't.

1317
01:26:20,878 --> 01:26:23,007
You're always in my gods.

1318
01:26:25,432 --> 01:26:27,490
My name is Bobby Griffith.

1319
01:26:27,897 --> 01:26:30,105
I write this in hope that one day,

1320
01:26:30,105 --> 01:26:31,575
many years from now,

1321
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:33,462
I would be able to go back

1322
01:26:33,462 --> 01:26:35,339
and remember what my life was like,

1323
01:26:35,339 --> 01:26:38,041
when I was a young and confused adolescent,

1324
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:42,178
desperately trying to understand myself in the world I live in

1325
01:26:42,178 --> 01:26:44,237
The other reason I write this,

1326
01:26:44,237 --> 01:26:46,460
so long after I died,

1327
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:49,415
others may have a chance to read about me,

1328
01:26:49,415 --> 01:26:52,588
and see what my life as a young person was like.

1329
01:27:59,473 --> 01:28:05,843
On December 6th 1995, Mary Griffith testified before members of the Congress of the United States.

1330
01:28:05,843 --> 01:28:13,780
Her tireless work protecting the rights of gay and lesbian youth has established her as a major force in the fight for human rights.

1331
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:22,500
Before you echo Amen in your home or place of worship, think and remember. A child is listening. - Mary Griffith

1332
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,261
In loving memory of
Bobby Griffith and Leroy Aarons
