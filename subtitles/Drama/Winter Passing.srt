1
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,037
<i>Yeah!</i>

2
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,715
<i>There are certain hours of the night
when I awake to the sound of a train.</i>

3
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:41,293
<i>It roars right through my apartment.</i>

4
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:45,048
<i>At times it feels as if
it will lift me out ofbed.</i>

5
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:49,220
<i>All that earsplitting thunder
and then silence.</i>

6
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:53,227
<i>- I'm alone, Exley!
- I'm gonna stop you.</i>

7
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,600
Would you mind singing?

8
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,856
<i>- Like a song?
- Yeah, like a song.</i>

9
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,063
<i>But I- I didn't prepare that!</i>

10
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,529
<i>- That's okay!Just go for it!
- Like any song?</i>

11
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,571
<i>Anything you like.</i>

12
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,909
<i>Whenever you're ready!</i>

13
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,123
<i>I don't know the rest! I'm sorry!</i>

14
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,796
<i>That's okay! That was great!</i>

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,796
<i>Thanks!</i>

16
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:14,592
<i>Take care!</i>

17
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,599
<i>You too!</i>

18
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,015
<i>Thank you!</i>

19
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:25,479
<i>Me thinks there is
an air comes from her.</i>

20
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:31,985
<i>What fine chisel!</i>

21
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,116
Could ever yet cut breath?

22
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,247
<i>Let no man mock me!</i>

23
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:47,376
<i>For I will kiss her!</i>

24
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,596
<i>Oh, she's warm!</i>

25
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,391
<i>If this be magic!</i>

26
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,600
<i>Let it be an art lawful as eating!</i>

27
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,872
<i>Yeah, we just got done!Just now!</i>

28
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,212
<i>I'm in the dressing room!
No, my stomach's been fucked up all day!</i>

29
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,551
<i>Valuables! See you tomorrow.</i>

30
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:38,635
<i>Hold on! I know we're winding down,
but the snow was clumpy again tonight!</i>

31
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,723
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry! I'll get it fixed!
- It's not your fault!</i>

32
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:16,964
<i>- You going out?
- Maybe for one, yeah!</i>

33
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,761
<i>I think I'm gonna head home.
I'm tired.</i>

34
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:23,886
<i>Sorry these are late, everyone.
Payroll had a computer glitch.</i>

35
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:27,850
<i>Reese, there's a woman out there
asking for you!</i>

36
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:31,270
<i>She said she'd wait by the stage door!
Very classy looking!</i>

37
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,813
<i>- Thanks, Ruthie!
- Thanks, Ruth!</i>

38
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,282
<i>- Reese?
- Yeah!</i>

39
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:47,747
<i>- Hi! Lori Lansky! It was a great show!
- Thanks!</i>

40
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,328
<i>The ending is so moving.
And that thief-he was just mesmerizing.</i>

41
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:53,542
<i>- Glad you liked it!
- Hey!</i>

42
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,667
<i>Hey! Hey, Ray, this is Lori!</i>

43
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,584
<i>- Hey, Lori!
- Hi, Ray! It was a great show!</i>

44
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:01,341
<i>- Thank you!
- Thanks! You're going to Niagara, right?</i>

45
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:04,429
<i>- Mm-hmm!
- Cool! See you there!</i>

46
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,427
<i>- Later!
- Bye, Ray!</i>

47
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,561
<i>There goes our thief!</i>

48
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,643
So, can I buy you a drink?

49
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,313
<i>- Um, who are you?
- I'm a book editor!</i>

50
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:20,150
<i>I, um, have to go meet our thief!</i>

51
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:23,238
Well, can I join you?

52
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:25,819
<i>It's this way!</i>

53
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:33,332
Is this about my dad?

54
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,497
<i>Sort of, yes!</i>

55
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,712
<i>- What's up?
- Not much!</i>

56
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,801
<i>- Staying out of trouble?
- Trying to!</i>

57
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,169
<i>- I'll get this!
- That's okay! It's on the house!</i>

58
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:45,634
<i>- Oh, thanks!
- Cheers!</i>

59
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,632
<i>So, about your father!</i>

60
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:50,721
<i>You want to know about
the, um, hidden manuscripts!</i>

61
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:53,266
<i>What he puts in his Cherry Coke!</i>

62
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,353
<i>If he finger fucks his pen pals!</i>

63
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,395
All the deep, dark, spooky shit?

64
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,978
<i>Oh, I can see the wolves
have already gotten to you!</i>

65
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:04,691
<i>- You people are relentless!
- He hasn't shared his work in almost two decades!</i>

66
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:07,241
<i>- Trust me-you're not missing out on much!
- Apparently there's a novel!</i>

67
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:10,530
<i>- I doubt it!
- The first two chapters were sent to his publishers!</i>

68
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,869
<i>Yeah, seven fucking years ago!
It was 37 pages of crap!</i>

69
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:15,913
<i>There were so many spelling errors!</i>

70
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:19,667
<i>His editor thought he was trying to
capture the voice of an illiterate!</i>

71
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,879
<i>Well, I like to think that he's
working on his masterpiece!</i>

72
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:27,298
<i>Anyway, I'm not here about the novel!</i>

73
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,933
<i>Early in your parents' relationship!</i>

74
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:40,022
<i>There was a three-year
letter-writing correspondence!</i>

75
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:42,689
<i>Apparently-
and I'm sure that you know this-</i>

76
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:46,901
<i>your father fancied himself as
a rather angry American expatriate!</i>

77
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:50,109
<i>For most of their courtship,
he was living in the south of France!</i>

78
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,659
<i>Now, if I have my chronology correct!</i>

79
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:55,573
<i>Your father was writing
the early chapters of People's Park...</i>

80
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:59,915
<i>and your mother was completing
her degree here in the States!</i>

81
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,585
<i>At some point
before your mother's death!</i>

82
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,293
<i>Your father returned
her letters to her.</i>

83
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:09,923
<i>- Your mother arranged them in a box.
- And?</i>

84
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:12,465
<i>And left the whole collection to you!</i>

85
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:17,096
And this is one of the letters?

86
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,685
<i>It's a xerox of one
of the early ones, yes.</i>

87
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:21,769
<i>There are approximately 150 pairs!</i>

88
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:25,065
<i>- How'd you get the xerox?
- Your mother's brother!</i>

89
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:27,983
<i>- Uncle Dick?
- Richard was the executor of your mother's will!</i>

90
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:32,661
<i>- How'd you find him?
- I attended the funeral!</i>

91
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,784
<i>- I was hoping to meet you there.
- I was opening a show!</i>

92
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:38,826
<i>Of course!</i>

93
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,414
<i>Hey, Spicer's in the turtle shed.</i>

94
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,708
What?

95
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,963
<i>Excuse me for a second!</i>

96
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,678
<i>Oh, God!</i>

97
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:20,663
<i>- dd
- dd</i>

98
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,877
<i>So, you want the letters!</i>

99
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:32,340
<i>- I'd like to buy them from you, yes!
- What's your offer?</i>

100
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,554
<i>$100,000-
half on delivery of the letters!</i>

101
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,845
<i>And, uh, half on publication!</i>

102
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,308
<i>L- I would be very happy
to recommend a literary agent to you!</i>

103
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,306
<i>How gracious!</i>

104
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:54,027
<i>- Reese, do you and your father speak?
- Doesn't matter!</i>

105
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,195
Why not?

106
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,240
<i>'Cause I'm not gonna do it!</i>

107
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:03,325
<i>Wait a minute! Look, just-just
think about it, would you?</i>

108
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:07,537
<i>If you change your mind, call me!
My home number's on the back of the card!</i>

109
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,705
<i>Just think about it!</i>

110
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,833
<i>Please leave!</i>

111
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,635
<i>Reese.</i>

112
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,642
<i>- Rob!
- Hey!</i>

113
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:18,640
<i>Hey!</i>

114
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:30,069
<i>- So, what's up?
- Not much!</i>

115
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:33,488
<i>Same old shit-
auditioning, working!</i>

116
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:35,907
<i>Watching my laundry multiply!</i>

117
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:39,453
What are you doing downtown?

118
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,709
<i>I'm, uh, house-sitting
over at this loft on Bond Street!</i>

119
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,917
<i>Sort of semipermanent couch surfing!</i>

120
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,839
<i>I heard you're in a show!</i>

121
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:53,757
<i>Yeah! Winter's Tale.</i>

122
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,968
<i>Over at La Mama!</i>

123
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,928
<i>We close this weekend!</i>

124
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,935
You working on anything?

125
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,563
<i>I was doing this weird Molière workshop
set in a boxing ring!</i>

126
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,189
<i>That ended a few weeks ago!</i>

127
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:15,112
<i>I was actually thinking
about moving to Colorado!</i>

128
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:18,116
<i>Working on a ranch or something!</i>

129
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,160
<i>Real people, cows and shit!</i>

130
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,163
<i>Hey, I heard about your mom!
I'm really sorry about that!</i>

131
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,335
<i>Oh, thanks!</i>

132
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,175
Are you okay?

133
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,216
<i>Yeah, I'm fine!</i>

134
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:47,809
<i>If you ever feel like talking me out
of moving to Colorado!</i>

135
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,650
<i>Give me a call!</i>

136
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,650
Uh-

137
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,949
<i>I still got this stupid thing!</i>

138
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:57,947
<i>Minutes galore!</i>

139
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:01,701
<i>See you around!</i>

140
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,456
<i>Fifteen years ago!</i>

141
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,836
<i>I thought he was the funniest,
sexiest, smartest person I'd ever met!</i>

142
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,679
<i>And now the idea of even being in the same
room with him makes me physically ill!</i>

143
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,387
<i>What time does to people!</i>

144
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,850
<i>I'm just glad we never had kids!</i>

145
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,979
Are you okay?

146
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,063
<i>Yeah! Why?</i>

147
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:35,318
<i>I don't know!
You just seem so far away!</i>

148
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:38,195
<i>You've hardly touched your salad!</i>

149
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,741
<i>I think I'm just a little run-down!</i>

150
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:43,157
<i>The show closing,
what's next and all that!</i>

151
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,239
<i>You can tell me stuff, you know!</i>

152
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,494
<i>I'd hate to have our little
mutual admiration society disband!</i>

153
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:50,581
<i>Just because the play is closing!</i>

154
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:57,547
What about your family?
Will you see them for the holidays?

155
00:14:57,674 --> 00:15:00,591
<i>- No!
- Where are your parents anyway?</i>

156
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:03,264
<i>I've never heard you talk about them!</i>

157
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:07,263
<i>- Not much to talk about!
- It's like that, huh?</i>

158
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:12,478
<i>If you'd like to spend Thanksgiving with me,
you're more than welcome!</i>

159
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,566
<i>I'm having some friends over for dinner!</i>

160
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,899
<i>We're doin' a turkey and pumpkin pie
and homemade stuffing!</i>

161
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:21,529
<i>And I got my grandma's
stuffing recipe with apples!</i>

162
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:23,613
<i>- Thanks, Didi!
- What happened to your hand?</i>

163
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:28,243
<i>Oh, I banged it while I was feeding Spike!
It's just a bruise!</i>

164
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:32,788
How is Spike anyway?
Is she still keeping you up at night?

165
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:35,289
<i>She's good!</i>

166
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,294
<i>It's so sweet-you saving that kitten!</i>

167
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:41,295
<i>I couldn't do it, not in this city!</i>

168
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,093
What?

169
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:50,221
<i>Hmm! There's no pay phone!</i>

170
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:52,514
<i>- You can use my cell!
- Are you sure?</i>

171
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,518
<i>Of course!</i>

172
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,646
<i>- Here!
- Thanks, Didi!</i>

173
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,650
<i>No problem!</i>

174
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:11,329
Hey!

175
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:13,327
<i>Hey, kiddo!</i>

176
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,373
<i>Mmm!</i>

177
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:25,004
<i>Hmm!</i>

178
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:44,206
<i>That was nice.</i>

179
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,879
<i>Thanks.</i>

180
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:49,421
<i>I didn't know you could play!</i>

181
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,977
<i>- Where are you going?
- I have to feed my cat!</i>

182
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:08,733
<i>- Where are you going?
- I have to feed my cat!</i>

183
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:12,942
<i>- Stay!
- I can't!</i>

184
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:15,157
<i>Feed her in the morning.</i>

185
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,740
<i>- She's sick!
- Reese.</i>

186
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,747
What are you so afraid of?

187
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,126
<i>I don't know!</i>

188
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:52,568
<i>Hi, Reese.
This is Dr. Barrett from St. Mark's Veterinary.</i>

189
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:55,653
<i>I'm sorry to have to tell you
that Spike's test results...</i>

190
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:58,450
<i>yielded positive for feline leukemia.</i>

191
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,157
<i>- Please give me a call
at your earliest convenience...</i>

192
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:03,406
<i>So that we can discuss her options.</i>

193
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:27,478
<i>- So, I got your message!
- Hey, Reese. Can I get a beer here?</i>

194
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:29,769
<i>I'll need money to get home!</i>

195
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:40,696
<i>- We'll be glad to arrange a flight for you!
- Oh, I don't fly!</i>

196
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,530
<i>Okay!</i>

197
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:45,534
<i>And I'll, uh, need cash!</i>

198
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:53,125
<i>Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to arrange cash, Reese!</i>

199
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:57,294
<i>I'd have to talk to my boss, put through a
check request. It could take a couple of weeks.</i>

200
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,676
<i>- Then fuck it!
- Well, wait a minute!</i>

201
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,598
<i>There's two!</i>

202
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:09,306
<i>You got all three!</i>

203
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,401
<i>- Will you be renting a car?
- I'll take the bus!</i>

204
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:18,318
<i>And I'll need money for cigarettes.</i>

205
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:21,989
<i>And food.</i>

206
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:24,365
A girl's gotta eat, right?

207
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,749
<i>Take it easy.</i>

208
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:36,294
<i>Well, that's that!</i>

209
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,881
Can you tell me when you plan
on heading to Michigan?

210
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:41,755
<i>I'll leave in a few days.</i>

211
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:45,677
<i>- So, uh, how can I get in touch with you?
- You won't! I'll call you!</i>

212
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,680
<i>I'll look forward to it!</i>

213
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,346
<i>- Okay!
- Thanks for the drink.</i>

214
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:53,184
<i>Good luck, Reese.</i>

215
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:09,952
Dd

216
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:33,739
<i>Dd</i>

217
00:24:01,078 --> 00:24:03,909
- Dd
- What happened?

218
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:05,956
<i>Smoking break!</i>

219
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:18,968
Are you all right?

220
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:22,600
<i>Oh, I'm fine!
Do you know where we are?</i>

221
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:25,348
<i>We just passed Traverse City!</i>

222
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:03,573
<i>- Hi!
- Hi!</i>

223
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:06,405
Who are you?

224
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,406
<i>Corbit!</i>

225
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,202
Is my dad around?

226
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:15,832
<i>- Who's your dad?
- Don Holden!</i>

227
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,666
<i>Got any I!D!?</i>

228
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,922
<i>- I!D!?
- Yeah! Preferably passport or driver's license!</i>

229
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,763
<i>- Seriously?
- Seriously!</i>

230
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,445
<i>- What's your date of birth?
- April 6, 1980!</i>

231
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:49,949
<i>- Zodiac sign?
- Aries!</i>

232
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,246
Are you, like,
his secret service guy or something?

233
00:26:58,373 --> 00:27:01,876
<i>Sort of! He's in the garage!</i>

234
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,423
<i>- What's he doing in there?
- That's where he lives now!</i>

235
00:27:06,922 --> 00:27:08,798
<i>- Who lives in the house?
- Me!</i>

236
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:11,056
<i>Me and Shelly!</i>

237
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,262
<i>- Who's Shelly?
- She's a girl!</i>

238
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,470
<i>Just this girl! You don't know her!</i>

239
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:20,977
<i>You look different than your pictures!</i>

240
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,981
Yeah, well, people change, right?

241
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:28,321
<i>Well, I gotta go rock!</i>

242
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:30,655
<i>Okay!</i>

243
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:35,286
<i>If you see Mr! Holden,
tell him his balls are clean!</i>

244
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,379
<i>Dd</i>

245
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,880
<i>What? Who's there?</i>

246
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,593
Corbit? Shelly?

247
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,017
<i>Reese!</i>

248
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,021
<i>Hey, Daddy!</i>

249
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:48,981
<i>Come in! Come in!</i>

250
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,027
<i>Here! Sit!</i>

251
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:56,192
<i>Oh, I've been sitting all day,
but thanks!</i>

252
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,415
<i>What a surprise!</i>

253
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,375
<i>- You want a drink?
- Sure!</i>

254
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,189
What are those pills for?

255
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:35,737
<i>Those were your mother's!
They! help me sleep!</i>

256
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:37,779
<i>I hardly use 'em!</i>

257
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:44,083
So, what brings you home?

258
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:47,042
<i>Oh, I don't know!
I just thought it was time!</i>

259
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:50,790
<i>If you need me to write you a check
or something, all you gotta do is ask!</i>

260
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:56,588
<i>Whew!</i>

261
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,760
<i>- How was the funeral?
- Pretty low-key!</i>

262
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,848
<i>Fair amount of her fans showed up!</i>

263
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:06,479
<i>No Pin the Tail on the Donkey
or anything like that!</i>

264
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,730
<i>- Where is she buried anyway?
- They cremated her!</i>

265
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:13,270
<i>Your Uncle Dick took her ashes
back to Louisville!</i>

266
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,616
<i>So that guy in the house said
you were living in here now!</i>

267
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,656
<i>Yeah. Pretty easy.
I got my books and my bed, my worktable.</i>

268
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,620
<i>Got this- Got a new stove here!</i>

269
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,965
Are you writing?

270
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,180
<i>A little here and there!</i>

271
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,601
<i>Shelly!</i>

272
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,605
<i>This is my daughter, Reese!</i>

273
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,313
<i>- Reese, Shelly.
- Hello!</i>

274
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,278
<i>- Hey.
- Reese just arrived from New York!</i>

275
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,488
<i>Well, it's such a surprise!</i>

276
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:11,789
<i>- Here you are!
- Mmm! Good! Thank you!</i>

277
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:14,539
<i>The car's making strange noises again!</i>

278
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:18,420
<i>Probably the transmission.
Have Corbit take a look at it.</i>

279
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:24,049
<i>Well, I should go put this stuff
in the fridge!</i>

280
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,888
<i>- Nice to finally meet you, Reese!
- Bye!</i>

281
00:31:28,015 --> 00:31:30,137
<i>Bye!</i>

282
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,645
<i>Wow! Where's she from, Wimbledon?</i>

283
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:42,359
<i>She's one of my former students!</i>

284
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,197
<i>She needed a place to get away
from things for a while!</i>

285
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,656
<i>She's been a big help.</i>

286
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:53,992
<i>- You still teaching?
- I stepped down a few semesters ago!</i>

287
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:55,916
Why?

288
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,997
<i>I got tired!</i>

289
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,001
<i>Corbit!</i>

290
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,005
<i>Come in!</i>

291
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:08,884
<i>Corbit, I understand you've
already met my daughter.</i>

292
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,927
<i>She'll be staying with us...</i>

293
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:14,725
<i>for an undisclosed period of time!</i>

294
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,938
<i>- In the house?
- In her old bedroom! Yeah!</i>

295
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,065
What about Shelly?

296
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,354
<i>She'll be okay
on the sofa for a while!</i>

297
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:26,900
<i>- The upstairs study's open!
- I don't want anybody in there!</i>

298
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:30,905
<i>I'm sure Shelly won't mind!</i>

299
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:33,782
<i>Right on!</i>

300
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:39,079
<i>Uh, Shelly told me
to tell you that dinner...</i>

301
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:41,959
<i>will be served promptly at 6:30!</i>

302
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:44,251
<i>And if Reese doesn't like chicken...</i>

303
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:49,755
<i>there's meat loaf and twice-baked potatoes
left over from Monday.</i>

304
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,054
<i>Tell Shelly
Reese is fine with chicken!</i>

305
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:56,553
<i>Okay!</i>

306
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:58,560
Tee time's in 55 minutes?

307
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,642
<i>I'll be ready!</i>

308
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:07,065
<i>Tee time?</i>

309
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:11,652
<i>- Golf game!
- Since when did you start golfing?</i>

310
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:14,242
<i>Oh, I mess around with it a little!</i>

311
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,326
<i>- Is Corbit a former student too?
- No.</i>

312
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,040
<i>When I was still living in the house,
I came downstairs!</i>

313
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:23,456
<i>He was sleeping on the sofa!</i>

314
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,503
<i>Well!</i>

315
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:30,087
<i>It sounds like you got yourself
a little utopia here!</i>

316
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,174
<i>Works pretty well!</i>

317
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:36,306
<i>I'm sure Mom would be intrigued!</i>

318
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,973
<i>Mary'd probably get a kick out of it!</i>

319
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:43,811
<i>I guess I'll see you at dinner!</i>

320
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:45,852
<i>Okay!</i>

321
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:08,267
<i>- Hey.
- Hey!</i>

322
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:10,267
<i>Wow!</i>

323
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:17,069
<i>Um, the hot water isn't working.</i>

324
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:23,409
<i>Just, um-Just flush the toilet
a couple of times!</i>

325
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:26,494
<i>- That will help with the hot water.
- Okay!</i>

326
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:30,205
<i>Yeah.
It's pretty cool-plumbing.</i>

327
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:34,921
<i>Well!</i>

328
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:37,254
<i>Enjoy your shower!</i>

329
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:39,252
<i>Thanks!</i>

330
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:58,442
<i>Here. Just relax.</i>

331
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,488
<i>- Watch the ball.
- Yes.</i>

332
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:06,033
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

333
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:11,119
<i>- That's it. That was beautiful.
- Yeah, that was pretty good.</i>

334
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,423
<i>Sorry!</i>

335
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:38,153
<i>Ow! Shit!</i>

336
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,403
<i>Run cold water over it!</i>

337
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:45,693
<i>If you've come down to help, I'm grateful,
but I think I have everything under control!</i>

338
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,992
<i>I was wondering if you could fill me in
on the little golf game that's going on upstairs!</i>

339
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:53,371
<i>- Don hits a bucket of golf balls
every night before dinner!</i>

340
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:55,456
What happened to all the furniture?

341
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:58,042
<i>Don had the movers
put it in the backyard!</i>

342
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:24,191
<i>- Corbit, would you like to say grace?
- Sure!</i>

343
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,989
<i>- Grace?
- Yes! Grace!</i>

344
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,700
<i>Since when does anyone in this house say grace?
I thought you were an atheist!</i>

345
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,536
<i>- Grace is okay!
- Wow.</i>

346
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,708
<i>- Wow what?
- Nothing.</i>

347
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:40,539
<i>I just can't believe that
this is the same man!</i>

348
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:43,005
<i>Who told his six-year-old daughter!</i>

349
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:47,712
<i>That Christmas was a Republican
capitalistic conspiracy...</i>

350
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:50,218
<i>created by the Hallmark Corporation!</i>

351
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,594
<i>And that,
ifJesus were alive today...</i>

352
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:56,097
<i>he'd be down in Nicaragua
rallying the Sandinistas!</i>

353
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:59,395
<i>- Grace away!
- Corbit?</i>

354
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:04,735
<i>Dear God!</i>

355
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,235
<i>Thank you for the food!</i>

356
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,275
<i>And the company.</i>

357
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:11,198
<i>Reese seems pretty cool!</i>

358
00:38:11,282 --> 00:38:13,574
<i>It's nice to have her here.</i>

359
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:16,037
<i>And thank you for a nice home.</i>

360
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,911
<i>- Amen.
- Amen!</i>

361
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,762
You want some?

362
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:39,099
<i>- Do you want some salad?
- Please! Thank you!</i>

363
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:44,648
<i>Mmm. Shelly,
your breasts are delicious.</i>

364
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:49,437
<i>Glad you like it, Corbit!</i>

365
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,070
<i>So, how were the links?</i>

366
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:55,160
<i>Mmm!</i>

367
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:58,450
<i>He was really whackin' 'em today.</i>

368
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:01,662
<i>We need to get a new driver though.
Also would like to get a four wood.</i>

369
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:04,914
<i>- It's just a nice club to have!
- Is that something you can sort out?</i>

370
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:07,128
<i>We can just order one
through the catalog!</i>

371
00:39:07,252 --> 00:39:09,795
<i>Great.</i>

372
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,753
<i>Don?</i>

373
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,132
<i>You've hardly touched your plate!</i>

374
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:18,972
<i>Corbit, did you get a chance
to look at the car?</i>

375
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:21,429
<i>The filter's old!
I'll replace it tomorrow!</i>

376
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:24,353
<i>Corbit here's quite the mechanic!</i>

377
00:39:24,476 --> 00:39:27,520
<i>He used to repair speedboats.
Right, Corbit?</i>

378
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:31,606
<i>Mmm!
Evinrude Outboard Motors, actually!</i>

379
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,156
<i>And he's a musician too.
What are you working on now, Corbit?</i>

380
00:39:35,236 --> 00:39:37,323
<i>Just some new stuff!</i>

381
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:41,161
<i>He used to be in a Christian rock band
down in Flint.</i>

382
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:44,283
<i>- What did you call yourselves?
- Punching Pilate!</i>

383
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:48,081
<i>L- I had to leave the band though
'cause they were trying to get all ska.</i>

384
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:52,339
<i>So! I left 'em!</i>

385
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:55,836
<i>Reese, would you mind
passing the potatoes?</i>

386
00:39:57,883 --> 00:39:59,803
<i>Thank you!</i>

387
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:15,361
<i>There you go!</i>

388
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:25,953
<i>You need to eat, Don!</i>

389
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,545
<i>I need to borrow the car!</i>

390
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:40,715
<i>Did you hear me?
I said I need the car.</i>

391
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,225
<i>- Do you have a license?
- Of course I have a license! Where are the keys, please?</i>

392
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,061
<i>- She has one!
- Where are you going?</i>

393
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:49,226
<i>Nowhere!
I just need to clear my head!</i>

394
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,726
<i>Please, can I have the keys?
Please, Shelly? Thank you. Yes?</i>

395
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,188
<i>- They're in the ignition.
- Thank you!</i>

396
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:57,124
<i>What are you having?</i>

397
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,456
<i>Jameson's on the rocks!</i>

398
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:15,515
<i>That'll be three bucks.</i>

399
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:26,485
<i>Thanks!</i>

400
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,532
Where are you from?

401
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:32,531
<i>Well, uh, here originally!</i>

402
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:35,496
<i>- Born and bred?
- Born and bred!</i>

403
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,830
<i>- Where do you live now?
- New York City.</i>

404
00:42:37,914 --> 00:42:41,210
<i>Where a pint of domestic beer
costs five bucks!</i>

405
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,877
<i>And you get tipped at least a dollar!</i>

406
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:46,838
<i>Unless they're European,
in which case, they don't tip at all!</i>

407
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:48,965
<i>- Ouch!
- Yeah!</i>

408
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:52,013
<i>And they wear such nice clothes!</i>

409
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:55,643
<i>- You're obviously a bartender too!
- Mm-hmm! I am!</i>

410
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:58,565
<i>Well, this is the place to come
if you want some cheap whiskey...</i>

411
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:01,732
<i>or if you're looking for
a decent open mike!</i>

412
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:03,816
<i>Wednesday nights, 9:00!</i>

413
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,611
<i>- What's your name?
- Reese!</i>

414
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:11,029
<i>- Nice to meet you, Reese! I'm Brian!
- Nice to meet you!</i>

415
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:22,248
<i>- So, uh, Brian!
- Yes, ma'am!</i>

416
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:25,838
<i>Do you, um!</i>

417
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:29,425
Know where I could score
something around here?

418
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:33,010
<i>I assume you're not talking
about Packers' tickets!</i>

419
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:36,390
<i>- Not even remotely!
- I'm sorry.</i>

420
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:39,723
<i>I can't help you out there, Reese!</i>

421
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:59,244
Crack cocaine, huh?

422
00:43:59,328 --> 00:44:01,785
<i>I've seen that stuff on Cops.</i>

423
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:03,959
<i>Crack cocaine will fry your brain!</i>

424
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:08,251
<i>Now, there's a rhyme!
You should get in the habit of knocking!</i>

425
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:10,422
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

426
00:44:10,546 --> 00:44:13,421
<i>You want to listen to some music?</i>

427
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:16,636
<i>Got a pretty sweet sound system
set up in the basement!</i>

428
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,101
<i>I don't think I can right now!
I'm pretty tired, Corbit!</i>

429
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:23,598
<i>- Okay!
- Maybe some other time!</i>

430
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:26,646
<i>No, that's cool! You don't have to!
You probably got more important things to do!</i>

431
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,820
<i>No, I'd really like to hear your stuff!
Just not-You know, not right now!</i>

432
00:44:30,944 --> 00:44:33,401
<i>Hey.</i>

433
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:36,656
Are you wearing eyeliner?

434
00:44:36,783 --> 00:44:38,657
What?

435
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:47,918
<i>Right on!
Um, so I'll catch you later?</i>

436
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:52,126
<i>Yeah, okay! Good night, Corbit!</i>

437
00:44:52,253 --> 00:44:54,217
<i>Good night, Reese!</i>

438
00:45:51,188 --> 00:45:53,062
<i>Hi!</i>

439
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:01,697
<i>I put some fresh linens on your bed!</i>

440
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,698
<i>And there's a wool blanket
at the bottom of that trunk!</i>

441
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:06,702
<i>It gets fairly cold at night!</i>

442
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:09,288
<i>And Don's not a big fan
of turning the heat up!</i>

443
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:13,916
<i>Yes, thank you! I know!
I lived here for 18 years!</i>

444
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:18,048
<i>- By the way, what happened to my comforter?
- I'm washing it!</i>

445
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,339
<i>You're quite the reader.</i>

446
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:26,385
<i>Yeah, well, when you grow up in a house full
of neo-Marxist, anti-TV, ex-hippie workaholics...</i>

447
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:29,684
<i>Nancy Drew can become your best friend
pretty fucking quickly!</i>

448
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,856
<i>- Can I ask a question?
- Ask away!</i>

449
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:37,523
<i>Were they competitive?</i>

450
00:46:37,606 --> 00:46:41,110
<i>Not really.
Their work was so different.</i>

451
00:46:41,234 --> 00:46:43,779
You think so?

452
00:46:43,903 --> 00:46:46,365
<i>He writes literary nightmares
about Berkeley undergrads!</i>

453
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:48,533
<i>Pulling out Uzis at People's Park!</i>

454
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:52,579
<i>She wrote about upper-middle-class
American executive types...</i>

455
00:46:52,662 --> 00:46:54,622
<i>stranded in post-I!B!M! Poughkeepsie!</i>

456
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:58,587
<i>I would say your mum wrote
her fair share of literary nightmares!</i>

457
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:03,258
<i>I actually think she wrote pseudo-literary
love stories disguised as social satire.</i>

458
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:07,429
<i>Well, obviously you would know
better than I do!</i>

459
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:10,180
<i>I mean, I've read everything
by both of them, but!</i>

460
00:47:10,304 --> 00:47:12,472
<i>I wasn't around
when it was happening!</i>

461
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,935
<i>But you are now!</i>

462
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,684
<i>I am!</i>

463
00:47:17,811 --> 00:47:21,398
<i>And I've never seen someone
agonize over each sentence!</i>

464
00:47:21,482 --> 00:47:23,440
<i>The way he does!</i>

465
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:26,069
<i>And it's funny.</i>

466
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:29,153
<i>As a teacher, he was always preaching
compositional velocity!</i>

467
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,493
<i>And boring your fingers into the keyboard
as though fiction is some kind of sport!</i>

468
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,247
<i>And now,
getting a paragraph out ofhim...</i>

469
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:41,756
<i>is like pulling a piano out of a pond!</i>

470
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:50,094
Would he ever show you his stuff?

471
00:47:50,177 --> 00:47:52,931
<i>I've had to buy every book he's written!</i>

472
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,806
<i>Must have been an interesting childhood!</i>

473
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,810
<i>Yeah!</i>

474
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:01,938
<i>Competing for attention with
twin No! 3 Underwood typewriters!</i>

475
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:04,319
<i>Won't do much for your self-esteem!</i>

476
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:06,652
<i>And now you're an actress!</i>

477
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:08,947
<i>- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.</i>

478
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:13,283
<i>It's just interesting!
The attention thing!</i>

479
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:21,500
<i>- Shelly!
- Yeah?</i>

480
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:25,458
<i>- How old are you anyway?
- Twenty-three! Why?</i>

481
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:29,005
<i>Just wanted to do the math
in case you're fucking my father!</i>

482
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:57,617
<i>- Can I help you?
- Um, yeah, I hope so!</i>

483
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,665
<i>My name is Dean Gerald!</i>

484
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:05,834
<i>I've been camping
over near Whitefish Point!</i>

485
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:11,217
<i>I was told this is where
the novelist Don Holden lives!</i>

486
00:49:11,341 --> 00:49:14,132
Are you, like, one of
his former students or something?

487
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:18,893
<i>I am currently in the M!F!A!
Writing program at Iowa!</i>

488
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:22,562
<i>Mr! Holden was a visiting lecturer there
a few years ago!</i>

489
00:49:22,686 --> 00:49:26,725
<i>I wasn't there yet,
but! I, like, heard about it!</i>

490
00:49:26,852 --> 00:49:30,233
So you've never actually met him?

491
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:32,863
<i>- I'm basically just a fan!
- Excuse me, Reese!</i>

492
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,948
What the fuck, dude?

493
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:37,946
<i>Get off!</i>

494
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:41,411
That's a $500 camera, man!

495
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:45,373
<i>No cameras on the premises, mister!
Photographs are not allowed!</i>

496
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:54,339
<i>- Okay!
- Mr! Holden has- has recently expired!</i>

497
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:56,802
<i>- Expired?
- That's right- expired!</i>

498
00:49:56,926 --> 00:50:01,473
<i>- He died?
- He's officially concluded all of his earthly business!</i>

499
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:04,058
<i>And he's no longer around
to talk about it!</i>

500
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:07,605
<i>So please remove yourself from the premises
or I'll be forced to seize your person!</i>

501
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:10,480
<i>- Is that understood?
- Totally understood!</i>

502
00:50:10,604 --> 00:50:13,775
<i>And I know karate.
I've amassed several belts.</i>

503
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:16,277
<i>Okay, I'm removing myself.</i>

504
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:23,246
<i>But, hey, if, um, Mr! Holden!</i>

505
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:26,287
<i>Ever decides to revive himself...</i>

506
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:30,460
<i>and officially resumes
his earthly business...</i>

507
00:50:32,481 --> 00:50:34,736
Would you give this to him?

508
00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:38,777
<i>It's! a harmless fan letter!</i>

509
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:43,699
<i>Well, if there is ever
an official revival!</i>

510
00:50:43,783 --> 00:50:46,747
<i>I'll make sure Mr! Holden
gets this letter!</i>

511
00:51:29,284 --> 00:51:31,248
<i>Looking for something in particular?</i>

512
00:51:31,332 --> 00:51:33,790
<i>Jesus, Shelly!
You scared the shit out of me!</i>

513
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:36,587
<i>That box is full of Don's
old interview transcripts!</i>

514
00:51:36,671 --> 00:51:39,130
<i>Could you please stop
calling him "Don"in front of me?</i>

515
00:51:39,254 --> 00:51:43,008
<i>It makes me imagine him at some weird
swingers' beach wearing a Speedo!</i>

516
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:45,470
<i>Don insists that his students
call him by his first name!</i>

517
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:47,474
<i>How egalitarian!</i>

518
00:51:47,598 --> 00:51:50,974
<i>All you're gonna find in that one
are royalty statements and tax documents.</i>

519
00:51:51,098 --> 00:51:54,979
Why does the idea of you being
his little attaché make my skin crawl?

520
00:51:55,103 --> 00:51:57,103
<i>I'm not the one lurking around!</i>

521
00:51:57,187 --> 00:51:59,776
<i>I'm not lurking, Shelly!
This is my house!</i>

522
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,818
<i>I know, Reese.</i>

523
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:03,816
<i>You grew up here!</i>

524
00:52:03,905 --> 00:52:06,865
<i>You suffered all the calamities
of being a daughter!</i>

525
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:10,620
<i>Of two self-indulgent,
brilliant artists!</i>

526
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:13,785
<i>And then you ran away
and never looked back!</i>

527
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,790
Oh, is that what he told you?
That I ran away and I never looked back?

528
00:52:16,874 --> 00:52:20,673
<i>- He didn't tell me anything!
- Don't you have your own family to psychoanalyze?</i>

529
00:52:20,797 --> 00:52:24,257
<i>For some reason
I imagine you as an only child!</i>

530
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:28,011
<i>Growing up in some vast,
impenetrable mansion with turrets!</i>

531
00:52:28,095 --> 00:52:31,427
<i>Daddy modeling perpetual tennis wear,
Mum playing badminton!</i>

532
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:33,976
<i>And having biscuits and tea
on the front lawn!</i>

533
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:38,065
<i>Why don't you go back to Narnia or wherever
the fuck you're from and leave my dad alone?</i>

534
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,153
<i>As it turns out, Reese...</i>

535
00:52:40,277 --> 00:52:42,190
<i>I am an only child!</i>

536
00:52:42,273 --> 00:52:45,070
<i>And my Daddy did play a bit of tennis!</i>

537
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:49,075
<i>And me mum rather fancied
her biscuits and tea at 4:00 p!m!</i>

538
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,866
<i>Every day after a rather bracing
game of croquet!</i>

539
00:52:52,949 --> 00:52:56,496
<i>But, if you must know...</i>

540
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,170
<i>I grew up in a two-bedroom council flat
in Shepherd's Bush!</i>

541
00:53:00,294 --> 00:53:04,877
<i>And, although it's really none of your
fucking business, my parents are dead!</i>

542
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:09,384
<i>When you work out what it is
you're looking for, let me know.</i>

543
00:53:09,464 --> 00:53:11,930
<i>I might be able to help you!</i>

544
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:11,777
<i>- What you doing?
- Workin'!</i>

545
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:13,781
<i>- What you doing?
- Workin'!</i>

546
00:54:15,615 --> 00:54:17,697
What's this thing for anyway?

547
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:21,747
<i>So Mr! Holden can get in the house
without having to walk outside!</i>

548
00:54:24,293 --> 00:54:26,418
Did something happen, Corbit?

549
00:54:26,502 --> 00:54:29,590
<i>- What do you mean?
- I mean, this whole hiding-in-the-garage thing!</i>

550
00:54:29,714 --> 00:54:33,839
<i>- Did one of his stalkers freak him out or something?
- Not that I know of!</i>

551
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:36,345
<i>He just likes it better inside!</i>

552
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:40,768
<i>Hey! Do you know anything about these?</i>

553
00:54:40,851 --> 00:54:43,518
<i>Oh, those are Shelly's!</i>

554
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:47,439
<i>- Is she sick?
- I think she was!</i>

555
00:54:47,523 --> 00:54:49,771
<i>But she doesn't really talk about it!</i>

556
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:56,362
Hey, so do you want to
hang out after dinner?

557
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:59,701
<i>Sure!</i>

558
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:01,699
<i>Right on!</i>

559
00:55:03,706 --> 00:55:05,627
Hey, Reese?

560
00:55:05,711 --> 00:55:09,962
<i>I'm not really an officer of the law
or anything!</i>

561
00:55:10,046 --> 00:55:12,168
<i>But, uh, I'm pretty sure it's illegal!</i>

562
00:55:12,295 --> 00:55:14,800
<i>To take someone else's
prescription medication!</i>

563
00:55:58,586 --> 00:56:00,677
No, no, no, no!

564
00:56:51,768 --> 00:56:53,435
<i>Hey!</i>

565
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:58,483
<i>- Hi, Reese!
- What you doin'?</i>

566
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:00,570
<i>I'm just wakin' up!</i>

567
00:57:07,701 --> 00:57:09,744
<i>Jesus!</i>

568
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:12,123
Are you okay?

569
00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:15,624
<i>Yeah, I'm fine! I-</i>

570
00:57:15,704 --> 00:57:17,671
<i>Just a dizzy spell!</i>

571
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:23,425
Would you hand me my bourbon, please?

572
00:57:23,509 --> 00:57:25,426
<i>Yeah!</i>

573
00:57:31,806 --> 00:57:33,680
<i>Ooh!</i>

574
00:57:35,145 --> 00:57:37,310
So, what are your plans today?

575
00:57:37,437 --> 00:57:39,565
<i>I don't know!</i>

576
00:57:39,649 --> 00:57:44,276
<i>- Thought I might go to the lake!
- Well, be sure to layer!</i>

577
00:57:55,537 --> 00:57:57,458
<i>- Daddy!
- Hmm!</i>

578
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:02,256
Did Mom leave anything for me?

579
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:06,631
<i>Regarding any money from her estate,
I'm sure a lawyer will be in touch!</i>

580
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:09,803
<i>No, I mean, besides money!
Was there anything else?</i>

581
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:14,140
<i>Your Uncle Dick mailed that box
a couple of months ago!</i>

582
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:17,100
<i>Haven't gone through it, but feel free!</i>

583
00:58:35,997 --> 00:58:38,336
What's in there?

584
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:40,995
<i>Just some old junk!</i>

585
00:58:46,543 --> 00:58:49,884
<i>So, Corbit said that Shelly's
had some medical problems!</i>

586
00:58:50,008 --> 00:58:52,889
<i>Yeah, she was in pretty rough shape
there for a while!</i>

587
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:55,178
What was wrong with her?

588
00:58:55,262 --> 00:58:57,891
<i>She had endometriosis!</i>

589
00:58:58,018 --> 00:59:02,227
<i>The doctors tried a lot of things.</i>

590
00:59:02,311 --> 00:59:05,566
<i>Nothing really worked,
so she had to have a hysterectomy!</i>

591
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:09,153
<i>- Jesus!
- Yeah, I was all she had there for a while!</i>

592
00:59:12,572 --> 00:59:15,660
<i>She's a good kid, Reese!</i>

593
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:18,200
<i>You oughta give her a chance!</i>

594
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:29,480
<i>- Thanks!
- There's a plate for you in the oven!</i>

595
01:00:33,986 --> 01:00:37,152
<i>Reese, are we still on for later?</i>

596
01:00:37,235 --> 01:00:38,991
Is something wrong?

597
01:00:39,115 --> 01:00:42,825
What room did she do it in?

598
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:46,539
<i>I don't think this is the time or the place
for this conversation, Reese.</i>

599
01:00:46,663 --> 01:00:48,955
<i>- What room?
- Reese-</i>

600
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:51,625
<i>Shut up, Shelly! What room was it?</i>

601
01:00:51,709 --> 01:00:54,836
<i>The basement? The bathroom? Tell me.</i>

602
01:00:57,132 --> 01:00:59,009
<i>The study upstairs!</i>

603
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:04,515
<i>In the middle of the night, I found her hangin'
on a coat hook on the back of the door!</i>

604
01:01:08,353 --> 01:01:10,351
<i>She used a necktie!</i>

605
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:49,183
<i>Hey, this is Rob.
Leave me a message.</i>

606
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:24,774
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

607
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:29,614
<i>- Mom used to play that!
- Yeah.</i>

608
01:03:29,738 --> 01:03:32,786
<i>I think she played it in a different key!</i>

609
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,534
<i>It sounded nice!</i>

610
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:38,957
<i>I'm gonna go do some work!</i>

611
01:03:41,957 --> 01:03:44,048
Daddy-

612
01:03:44,172 --> 01:03:49,010
Are you, like,
mad at me or something?

613
01:03:49,094 --> 01:03:52,720
<i>I guess I'm just a little disappointed!</i>

614
01:03:52,844 --> 01:03:55,474
Why?

615
01:03:55,557 --> 01:03:58,931
<i>I don't know, Reese. I th-</i>

616
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:03,021
<i>I think it would have been nice
if you'd made it back for the funeral!</i>

617
01:04:04,604 --> 01:04:07,652
<i>She wasn't perfect,
but she was your mother.</i>

618
01:04:07,736 --> 01:04:09,650
<i>Is that who she was?</i>

619
01:04:09,734 --> 01:04:12,698
My mother?

620
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:14,825
<i>The woman who treated me like a!</i>

621
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:16,912
Mild curiosity all my life?

622
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:20,246
<i>- She suffered, Reese!
- She suffered?</i>

623
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:22,244
<i>We all fucking suffered!</i>

624
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:25,709
<i>This house was one big,
silent museum of suffering!</i>

625
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:27,586
<i>We did our best!</i>

626
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:31,464
<i>Yeah, well, don't fault me
for being just a little disappointed.</i>

627
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:35,552
Do you know how many times
you guys saw me act?

628
01:04:37,181 --> 01:04:39,727
<i>Once!</i>

629
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:43,060
<i>One fucking time in the seventh grade
when I played Wendy in Peter Pan!</i>

630
01:04:43,184 --> 01:04:45,730
<i>And you had to nudge Mom awake
during the curtain call!</i>

631
01:04:47,229 --> 01:04:49,189
<i>So I missed her funeral.</i>

632
01:04:49,272 --> 01:04:51,778
<i>- Her fucking loss!
- Please don't swear!</i>

633
01:04:51,902 --> 01:04:54,860
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fu-
- Stop it!

634
01:05:17,842 --> 01:05:19,762
<i>Hey, Reese!</i>

635
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:25,145
Hey-

636
01:05:26,477 --> 01:05:29,899
Are you a faggot?
Are you a fucking faggot, Corbit?

637
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:35,406
<i>- God is my copilot!
- God is your fucking copilot?</i>

638
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:38,280
<i>Yeah. Jesus loves me,
and he loves you too.</i>

639
01:05:38,364 --> 01:05:41,951
<i>Corbit? Don was just asking for you.</i>

640
01:06:41,256 --> 01:06:43,678
<i>In your mother's third letter...</i>

641
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:46,054
<i>she talks about killing herself.</i>

642
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:54,358
<i>How... drowning would be
too terrifying...</i>

643
01:06:54,441 --> 01:06:57,396
<i>and a bullet to the head
would be too messy!</i>

644
01:06:57,523 --> 01:07:01,194
<i>She was in St. "Looey"at the time,
working on her second novel.</i>

645
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,194
<i>Your father replied...</i>

646
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:07,701
<i>that he would do anything she wished
to make that not happen!</i>

647
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:11,997
<i>He said he would
get on a plane if he had to!</i>

648
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:16,255
<i>In her next letter she said
that she felt better...</i>

649
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:19,712
<i>and that her thoughts of suicide
had subsided!</i>

650
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:22,757
<i>And that she had a new idea for a novel!</i>

651
01:07:24,469 --> 01:07:26,801
<i>Can I borrow a cigarette?</i>

652
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:33,061
<i>Thank you!</i>

653
01:07:33,185 --> 01:07:35,186
<i>It's St! Louis!</i>

654
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,229
<i>St! Louis!</i>

655
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:46,113
<i>The later letters...</i>

656
01:07:46,237 --> 01:07:48,156
<i>particularly!</i>

657
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,994
<i>77 through to 123!</i>

658
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:55,126
<i>Are less passionate!</i>

659
01:07:57,757 --> 01:08:01,171
<i>And almost approach bitterness!</i>

660
01:08:01,255 --> 01:08:03,256
<i>Perhaps even jealousy!</i>

661
01:08:03,339 --> 01:08:06,093
<i>And then by 130...</i>

662
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,851
<i>they dissolve down
to two or three...</i>

663
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:11,470
<i>very uninformative half-sentences!</i>

664
01:08:13,684 --> 01:08:15,599
<i>And then they end!</i>

665
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:19,938
Are you going to publish them?

666
01:08:22,861 --> 01:08:24,819
<i>I honestly don't know, Shelly!</i>

667
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:29,406
<i>Well, I hope it's worth it!</i>

668
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:34,956
<i>Thanks for the cigarette.</i>

669
01:08:36,997 --> 01:08:40,668
<i>Shelly, I found these under my bed.</i>

670
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:43,752
<i>Oh, thank you!</i>

671
01:08:46,465 --> 01:08:48,674
<i>You know, Reese,
if it wasn't for your dad...</i>

672
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:51,595
<i>I don't know if I would have made it!</i>

673
01:08:53,643 --> 01:08:56,602
<i>In his own quiet way, he cares
a great deal about other people!</i>

674
01:08:58,393 --> 01:09:01,351
<i>I think he really
wants to get to know you!</i>

675
01:09:02,565 --> 01:09:04,480
<i>It's probably gonna take some time.</i>

676
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:11,154
<i>Thanks for these!</i>

677
01:09:30,675 --> 01:09:33,509
Daddy, are you okay?

678
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,307
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

679
01:09:39,849 --> 01:09:42,104
<i>I thought maybe we could talk!</i>

680
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:49,489
<i>Please go away!</i>

681
01:10:46,582 --> 01:10:48,586
<i>Shit!</i>

682
01:11:07,019 --> 01:11:09,768
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah!</i>

683
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:17,902
Can you- Can you make a fist?

684
01:11:24,452 --> 01:11:27,414
<i>Yeah, like that!</i>

685
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:30,081
<i>- Does that hurt?
- A little bit!</i>

686
01:11:38,718 --> 01:11:42,051
Hey, Corbit, I'm-

687
01:11:42,134 --> 01:11:45,266
<i>I'm really sorry about
what happened last night!</i>

688
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:48,013
<i>Yeah, that was pretty weird!</i>

689
01:11:53,854 --> 01:11:56,444
Hey, what happened to your eyeliner?

690
01:11:56,568 --> 01:11:59,482
<i>It was too Adam Ant!</i>

691
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:03,280
<i>I thought it looked! cool!</i>

692
01:12:03,364 --> 01:12:06,531
<i>- Really?
- It looks really good on you!</i>

693
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:09,452
<i>Made you look kinda like a wolverine!</i>

694
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:11,952
<i>- Wolverine?
- Mm-hmm!</i>

695
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:15,460
<i>- Wow!
- Yeah! Wolverines rock!</i>

696
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:18,298
<i>Wolverines do rock!</i>

697
01:12:20,714 --> 01:12:23,297
<i>Hey, you know,
there's this bar in town!</i>

698
01:12:23,427 --> 01:12:26,471
<i>That has open mikes
on Wednesday nights!</i>

699
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,512
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, the Great Notch Inn!</i>

700
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:31,851
<i>You should go in, play a song!</i>

701
01:12:31,975 --> 01:12:35,187
<i>Oh, man, I don't-
I don't know, Reese!</i>

702
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:37,189
Why not?

703
01:12:37,272 --> 01:12:39,148
Um-

704
01:12:39,232 --> 01:12:41,570
In front of anyone, I-

705
01:12:41,694 --> 01:12:44,653
<i>I have this thing that happens to me!</i>

706
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:48,366
<i>When I have to play and sing
at the same time!</i>

707
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:51,664
What happens?

708
01:12:51,748 --> 01:12:54,746
<i>- I sort of freeze up!
- Mmm!</i>

709
01:12:54,873 --> 01:12:57,212
<i>If I'm alone, it's cool!</i>

710
01:12:57,292 --> 01:13:00,129
<i>And if I'm just playing
or just singing, it's okay too!</i>

711
01:13:00,212 --> 01:13:05,051
<i>But when I have to do both, it's bad!</i>

712
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:10,264
Well, what did you do when you
were in Punching Pilate?

713
01:13:10,388 --> 01:13:13,512
<i>I was pretty much
the designated rhythm guitarist!</i>

714
01:13:13,596 --> 01:13:18,394
<i>- Mmm! - They had me go up to
the front once, but that was-</i>

715
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:21,439
<i>- That was a disaster!
- Well, what happened?</i>

716
01:13:21,566 --> 01:13:25,446
<i>Let's just say I I- lost my shit!</i>

717
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:27,530
<i>Excuse my French!</i>

718
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:32,325
<i>I just froze up,
and they stopped the show!</i>

719
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:34,911
And then for some reason, I-

720
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,541
<i>I kicked the drummer!</i>

721
01:13:37,665 --> 01:13:41,920
He was this total
Black Sabbath wannabe and-

722
01:13:42,044 --> 01:13:45,506
<i>We got in this big fistfight,
and I broke his collarbone!</i>

723
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:50,094
<i>So, they kicked me out of the band!</i>

724
01:13:52,299 --> 01:13:54,972
<i>It was a pretty big mess!</i>

725
01:13:56,142 --> 01:13:58,605
<i>I've never done
an open mike before, Reese!</i>

726
01:13:58,729 --> 01:14:01,854
<i>It- It would be pretty scary!</i>

727
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,902
<i>I think you should just do it!</i>

728
01:14:05,026 --> 01:14:07,444
I mean, you only live once, right?

729
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:11,074
<i>I'm sure Shelly would come!</i>

730
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:13,407
<i>- You think?
- I totally think!</i>

731
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,454
<i>And I'll be there!</i>

732
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:18,622
<i>Right on!</i>

733
01:14:26,124 --> 01:14:28,004
<i>Karate!</i>

734
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,091
<i>"Kara-tay!"</i>

735
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:32,386
<i>"Kara-tay!"</i>

736
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,595
<i>It helps me relax!</i>

737
01:14:43,143 --> 01:14:45,482
<i>Wow!</i>

738
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:48,604
<i>Yeah! You need not worry!
I'm a total pacifist!</i>

739
01:15:30,066 --> 01:15:32,650
<i>- Can I join you?
- Sure!</i>

740
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:36,280
How far do you usually go?

741
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:38,739
<i>Uh, about two miles if I'm lucky!</i>

742
01:15:38,862 --> 01:15:42,329
<i>I think my jock days
are pretty much behind me!</i>

743
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:44,494
Do you wanna sprint
some telephone poles?

744
01:15:44,618 --> 01:15:48,126
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah! Feel okay!</i>

745
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,381
<i>Okay, but if I have a heart attack,
it's your fault.</i>

746
01:15:56,551 --> 01:16:00,010
<i>- dd
- dd</i>

747
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,557
<i>dd</i>

748
01:16:04,641 --> 01:16:08,603
<i>All right. Let's keep it going.
Next up we have Corbit.</i>

749
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,606
<i>Come on out, Corbit!</i>

750
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,693
<i>All right!
So where you from, Corbit?</i>

751
01:16:16,776 --> 01:16:21,032
<i>Uh, Pontiac, originally, but I've been
in the U!P! about seven months now!</i>

752
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:24,206
<i>All right! Well, welcome
to the Great Notch Inn!</i>

753
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:28,078
<i>Where luck and love come
from the same hairy family!</i>

754
01:16:28,162 --> 01:16:30,918
<i>Right, guys?</i>

755
01:16:31,002 --> 01:16:33,752
What song are you gonna
do for us tonight, Corbit?

756
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:37,091
<i>"I Can't Tell You Why"
by the Beatle- by the Eagles!</i>

757
01:16:37,174 --> 01:16:40,049
<i>All right, that sounds great!
Let's give it up for Corbit!</i>

758
01:16:45,763 --> 01:16:47,686
<i>Testing!</i>

759
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:50,267
<i>Testing! One, two!</i>

760
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:54,064
<i>Testing! One, two, three!</i>

761
01:16:54,148 --> 01:16:56,231
<i>17, 18!</i>

762
01:16:57,737 --> 01:17:00,528
<i>Uh, I'm kidding!</i>

763
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:02,696
Before I start, I just want to, uh-

764
01:17:02,777 --> 01:17:06,619
<i>I wanna dedicate this song to Reese!</i>

765
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,343
<i>Sorry!</i>

766
01:17:34,935 --> 01:17:38,023
<i>Plan "B!" Hold on!</i>

767
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:40,894
<i>That was great, Corbit!
I'm really proud of you!</i>

768
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:43,439
<i>Thanks, Shelly!</i>

769
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:46,775
<i>Yeah, and your plan "B" was genius!</i>

770
01:19:46,902 --> 01:19:48,776
<i>Right on!</i>

771
01:20:10,298 --> 01:20:12,715
<i>Oh! Thanks, Reese!</i>

772
01:20:12,798 --> 01:20:15,635
<i>- That was an awesome show!
- Thank you!</i>

773
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:17,719
<i>I'm gonna say good night to my dad!</i>

774
01:20:17,803 --> 01:20:19,726
<i>- Good night!
- Good night!</i>

775
01:20:26,104 --> 01:20:28,522
<i>Daddy?</i>

776
01:20:28,646 --> 01:20:30,529
Daddy?

777
01:20:30,653 --> 01:20:33,444
Daddy? Daddy?

778
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:35,442
Daddy?

779
01:20:35,526 --> 01:20:37,490
<i>Wake up, Dad!</i>

780
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:42,996
Why would you do that? Wake up!

781
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:45,623
<i>Come on!</i>

782
01:20:51,086 --> 01:20:53,341
<i>Miss Holden? I'm Dr! Staley!</i>

783
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:55,465
<i>- Hi!
- Pete Staley!</i>

784
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:58,055
<i>- Corbit!
- Shelly!</i>

785
01:20:58,179 --> 01:21:00,053
Um, maybe you and I
could have a word?

786
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,097
<i>- You wanna step down the hall with me for a moment?
- Sure!</i>

787
01:21:08,019 --> 01:21:10,150
<i>His heart never actually stopped.</i>

788
01:21:10,274 --> 01:21:12,608
<i>Fortunately,
the sleeping medication he took!</i>

789
01:21:12,692 --> 01:21:15,405
<i>Is designed to time release
in such a way!</i>

790
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:17,945
<i>That! he never got
a potent enough dose!</i>

791
01:21:18,029 --> 01:21:20,659
<i>To execute the desired effect!</i>

792
01:21:20,786 --> 01:21:23,165
Is he gonna be okay?

793
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:25,827
<i>I don't anticipate any cognitive deficit!</i>

794
01:21:25,911 --> 01:21:30,622
<i>And his vital signs are all back to normal!
He has a strong heart!</i>

795
01:21:30,706 --> 01:21:33,212
<i>We're rehydrating his system
intravenously!</i>

796
01:21:33,296 --> 01:21:37,303
<i>We'll give you a call if there are
any further complications tonight.</i>

797
01:23:48,599 --> 01:23:50,552
<i>He was up earlier.</i>

798
01:23:50,676 --> 01:23:53,807
<i>He mumbled something, fell back asleep!</i>

799
01:23:55,682 --> 01:23:57,769
<i>His vitals are good!</i>

800
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:03,359
<i>Just hit the call button
if you need anything!</i>

801
01:24:03,443 --> 01:24:05,444
<i>Thanks!</i>

802
01:24:25,923 --> 01:24:28,215
How long you been here?

803
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:30,172
<i>Awhile!</i>

804
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,554
Do you need anything?

805
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:37,559
<i>I'm thirsty!</i>

806
01:24:37,643 --> 01:24:39,560
<i>Okay!</i>

807
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:00,915
<i>Thanks!</i>

808
01:25:08,794 --> 01:25:11,300
Do you want some more?

809
01:25:11,424 --> 01:25:14,051
<i>No, but I'd love a cigarette!</i>

810
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,681
<i>Yeah, me too!</i>

811
01:25:16,764 --> 01:25:19,390
<i>But we'll set off the alarms!</i>

812
01:25:26,186 --> 01:25:28,106
What's that?

813
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:32,739
<i>That is, uh, your novel.</i>

814
01:25:32,863 --> 01:25:35,821
<i>I dug it up out of the backyard.</i>

815
01:25:35,945 --> 01:25:38,578
<i>Corbit was supposed
to keep that under his hat!</i>

816
01:25:38,662 --> 01:25:40,829
<i>How far are you into it?</i>

817
01:25:40,953 --> 01:25:43,583
<i>I'm about halfway through!</i>

818
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:48,167
<i>I think it's the first time I've seen anything
of yours in manuscript form!</i>

819
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:50,670
<i>The imperfections are really charming.</i>

820
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:54,129
<i>I spell like a gorilla!</i>

821
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:56,762
<i>- Do you hate it?
- No! I like it actually!</i>

822
01:25:56,845 --> 01:25:58,927
<i>It's really different
from your other stuff!</i>

823
01:25:59,051 --> 01:26:01,557
<i>- You're not bullshitting me?
- No.</i>

824
01:26:03,349 --> 01:26:06,772
<i>Shelly thinks
it's borderline sentimental.</i>

825
01:26:06,855 --> 01:26:08,853
Do you think it's sentimental?

826
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,443
<i>A little!
But it's a love story, right?</i>

827
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:14,360
<i>I guess!</i>

828
01:26:14,487 --> 01:26:16,528
Think I'm getting soft?

829
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:18,575
<i>Absolutely!</i>

830
01:26:21,658 --> 01:26:23,953
<i>- Daddy.
- Hmm?</i>

831
01:26:24,036 --> 01:26:26,622
About the stuff I said the other night-

832
01:26:26,705 --> 01:26:30,503
<i>I'm! really sorry! It wasn't fair!</i>

833
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:33,043
<i>Well, we messed up pretty bad, Reese!</i>

834
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,505
<i>No! You guys did the best you could!</i>

835
01:26:36,597 --> 01:26:38,506
<i>Like you said!</i>

836
01:26:40,597 --> 01:26:42,638
What was she doing at home anyway?

837
01:26:42,762 --> 01:26:45,475
<i>I think she was lonely!</i>

838
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:49,975
<i>We were both lonely!</i>

839
01:26:53,565 --> 01:26:56,111
<i>I just can't stop thinking about her!</i>

840
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:12,083
<i>Come here!</i>

841
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:26,597
<i>- Okay! Stop it now!
- Okay!</i>

842
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:30,518
<i>How's Corbit?
He and Shelly okay?</i>

843
01:27:30,602 --> 01:27:32,853
<i>Yeah, they're fine! They're fine!</i>

844
01:27:32,937 --> 01:27:36,192
<i>They're out in the waiting room.
You want me to go get them?</i>

845
01:27:36,276 --> 01:27:38,233
<i>Stay!</i>

846
01:27:38,357 --> 01:27:41,030
<i>- I feel like I'm hogging you.
- Please stay!</i>

847
01:27:41,114 --> 01:27:43,403
<i>- Okay!
- Okay.</i>

848
01:27:45,323 --> 01:27:48,618
<i>When you finish readin' that,
you let me know what you think!</i>

849
01:27:48,745 --> 01:27:50,870
<i>- I will.
- Promise?</i>

850
01:27:50,994 --> 01:27:53,373
<i>I promise!</i>

851
01:27:53,457 --> 01:27:55,416
<i>Hey, Corbit!</i>

852
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:59,254
<i>- Hey, Mr! Holden!
- Hi!</i>

853
01:27:59,338 --> 01:28:01,255
<i>Hi!</i>

854
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:06,594
<i>- How, uh- How are you feeling?
- Okay!</i>

855
01:28:06,678 --> 01:28:09,351
<i>- A little tired!
- Yeah!</i>

856
01:28:09,435 --> 01:28:12,848
<i>Well, we won't keep you!
We just wanted to say hi!</i>

857
01:28:12,932 --> 01:28:15,397
<i>- Hey, Mr! Holden!
- Hey, Corbit!</i>

858
01:30:59,095 --> 01:31:03,934
<i>There are certain hours of the night
when I wake to the sound of a train.</i>

859
01:31:04,061 --> 01:31:07,560
<i>It roars right through my apartment!</i>

860
01:31:07,644 --> 01:31:11,565
<i>At times, it feels as if
it will lift me out of bed!</i>

861
01:31:11,649 --> 01:31:15,403
<i>All that earsplitting thunder
and then silence!</i>

862
01:31:15,487 --> 01:31:18,698
<i>I'm alone, Exley!</i>

863
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:20,909
<i>I'm very much alone in a city
that at times!</i>

864
01:31:21,036 --> 01:31:23,452
<i>Makes people feel old and used!</i>

865
01:31:24,623 --> 01:31:27,083
<i>But I am somehow lucky!</i>

866
01:31:27,163 --> 01:31:30,337
<i>Even during the darkest hour!</i>

867
01:31:30,464 --> 01:31:33,422
<i>I always manage to pull through!</i>

868
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:38,134
<i>Great show, ladies.</i>

869
01:31:38,257 --> 01:31:41,177
<i>Thanks, Ben! You too!</i>

870
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:43,764
<i>- Thanks for the Zippo!
- Oh, no problem!</i>

871
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:45,805
<i>Thanks for the flowers!</i>

872
01:31:45,889 --> 01:31:47,812
<i>- Fan mail!
- Oh!</i>

873
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,565
<i>- Hey!
- Hey!</i>

874
01:33:18,692 --> 01:33:20,735
<i>I thought you left!</i>

875
01:33:22,324 --> 01:33:24,489
<i>Aww! Thank you!</i>

876
01:33:25,737 --> 01:33:28,327
<i>- Congratulations!
- Thank you!</i>

877
01:33:30,241 --> 01:33:32,161
They comped you, right?

878
01:33:32,244 --> 01:33:34,583
<i>Yeah, they were cool about it!</i>

879
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:38,083
<i>- You were great!
- Thanks!</i>

880
01:33:43,546 --> 01:33:45,717
You wanna walk?

881
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:49,301
<i>Let's walk!</i>
9999
