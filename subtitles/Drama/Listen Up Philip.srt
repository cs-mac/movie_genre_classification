with Mona, his ex-girlfriend,

'whom he had dated
throughout a portion of college.

7

'As with any punctual individual,
Philip loathed when people ran late,

made her way to Philip,

of tolerating his company.'

16

- It's just crazy that you're late to me.
- Can we stop talking about it?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,457
25 minutes I'm waiting, almost 30.
It's an insult.

18
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,915
Also, I have a really busy day,
so now I have less than an hour.

19
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,582
Probably not even enough time
to eat anything.

20
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,957
Maybe a grilled cheese for me.

21
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,540
I had that the other day.
It's disgusting.

22
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,457
So I'll ask you how you are, right?
Things are good?

23
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,915
Things are good with me.

24
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,665
Allie and I just finally found
a new roommate.

25
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,915
Oh, what's-her-ass moved?

26
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,415
- She got married, like, two years ago.
- Figures.

27
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,249
- Is that the new book?
- Er... yeah.

28
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,249
I wasn't sure you'd noticed, or heard.

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,207
- OK.
- I'm just getting ready.

30
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,415
Things are gonna be pretty crazy for me
after the release.

31
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,999
In fact, this might be
the last time I'm home

32
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,540
for more than a week at a time
for the next eight or possibly nine months.

33
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,540
Actually, yeah, definitely.
It's just busy.

34
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,040
Los Angeles in January, San Francisco...

35
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,290
Powell's in Portland,
the whole West Coast thing, really.

36
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,874
I'm told to expect big things out there.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,040
- You sound like you're bragging.
- That's because I am bragging.

38
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,249
And you're doing a really hurtful job
of sounding unfazed.

39
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,457
And do you know why that is?
Because you're not pretending.

40
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,499
You're not interested in this or me,
not even a little.

41
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,165
- Why would you say that?
- Because you never believed in me.

42
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,665
- And you don't now.
- Well, good for you.

43
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,374
No, not good for me. Great for me.

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,707
You know, you told me many times,
now that I think about it, actually,

45
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,582
that my goals were unreasonable
and foolhardy.

46
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,040
Am I recalling this correctly?

47
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,707
That my dream, the only dream I've had
since I was 14 years old,

48
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,290
to write and publish a novel of my own,

49
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,957
wasn't something I could just
reach out and have.

50
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,874
Hard work, you tell me. Years of
working up from the bottom, you tell me.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,540
Well, you know something?
You were wrong.

52
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,832
Dead wrong, actually.
About me and everything.

53
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,957
This was for you. It's an advance copy.

54
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,707
I'd even written a little note
on the dedication page and everything.

55
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,374
But you know something?
You don't support me and you never did.

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,957
So you don't get this gift from me.

57
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,582
Not today, not ever. Forever.

58
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,249
You were unkind,
and you tried to stray me from my path.

59
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,165
And had I listened to you,
I'd be nothing right now.

60
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,832
'Philip had never been one
for speaking his mind,

61
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,082
'preferring instead
to bottle up his emotions,

62

for creative inspiration.

63

Philip feeling more satisfied and content

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,957

that he immediately telephoned

66

67
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,999

an equally robust dressing down.'

68
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,124
You blew people's minds, man.

69
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,124
Now look at you. You're just a combination
of strange fucking colours.

70
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,790
It was gonna be you and me, man.
Ring a bell?

71
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,124
Sophomore year, creative writing seminar,
it was us versus them.

72
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,624
- What the fuck happened?
- I...

73
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,790
Apparently not everybody's cut out
for life in the fast lane.

74
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,332
You make me want back
every minute of time I wasted with you,

75
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,540
dreaming of a future we could share.

76
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,749
Our declaration of principles.

77
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,707
Remember this?

78
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,207
Worthless now.

79
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,915
I was so stupid to think you wanted it.

80
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,790
I wanted it, you fucking asshole!

81
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,999
I did want it.
I wanted it more than you could know.

82
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,249
It's not so easy for everybody, OK?

83
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:02,082
We can't all be as lucky and talented
as the great Philip Lewis Friedman.

84
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,957
You know what, though?
I'm glad, I'm glad.

85
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,207
Because if both of our goals
had come true,

86
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,707
then I'd be just as much
of an insufferable piece of shit as you,

87
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,624
you fuckin' Jew bastard!

88
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,999
This could have been us.

two items of good news.

Give 'em to me in that order.

Bad news is you're not looking at
a good review in the Times.

What? How do we know so soon?
Who's doing it?

Some new woman.

- She's new.
- So what's the problem?

142

She doesn't like your book.

143

Fuck, I really needed that.

144
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,374
- I'll take the good news now.
- Well, two things.

145
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,290
First, you're going to be in the "35 Under 35"
issue of the New York Literary Review.

146

- Nobody reads that anymore.
- This is something.

It is not uncompetitive.
Don't be a baby.

Shit.

149
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,165
Other thing is,
Ike Zimmerman got back to me.

150
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,415
- He liked your book, wants to meet you.
- That's huge.

00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,832
'His breakthrough novel,
Madness & Women,

154
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,999
'sold over three million copies
in hardback alone.

155
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,999
'Lesser returns

156
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,999
'gave way to the triumphant comeback
Audit in 1982.

157
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,749
'Since then he published infrequently.

158
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,832
'He had not completed a novel
in six years.'

159
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,582
Do you wanna look in our wardrobe area?

160
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,749
We can probably find you
a lighter-weight jacket.

161
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,999
Let's just keep this jacket on me and take
the photograph sooner rather than later.

162
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,165
We actually wanted to get a picture
of you in front of the printing press,

163
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,124
and then the portrait.

164
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,499
- Is that from the 1920s?
- Yeah.

165
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,915
Well, I'm not, so let's skip it

166
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,999
and move on over
to this yellow thing, all right?

167
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,957
I know. "What an asshole."

168
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,957
Would you mind standing?

169
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,957
What is this for?

170
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,832
Could you open it as though you're reading,
then look at me again?

171
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:27,957
I don't wanna do that.

172
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,290
- Why?
- It's a poor idea.

173
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,457
Why would I be standing up
with my jacket buttoned, reading?

174
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,207
- It's just a prop.
- I can see that.

175
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,582
But I think it presents
a very false depiction of me.

176
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,749
I'd much rather
this picture at least seem honest.

177
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,332
You know, Tolkien wouldn't allow himself
to be photographed writing,

178
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,999
because he didn't allow
anybody to watch him work.

179
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,582
Same idea here.
Just slightly modified to suit me.

180
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,707
Philip.

181
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,540
I hope that wasn't too bad.

182
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,374
It's always bad.
There's just degrees of bad.

183
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,832
Oh, hey. How's it going?

184
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,374
Mmh... good.

185
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,624
We met before.

186
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,290
Er... I don't think we have.

187
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,207
You sure about that?

188
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,332
Um... I wanted to tell you
I really liked your book.

189
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,790
Those advance copies
really get around, huh?

190
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,707
Anyway, the first one's better.

191
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,249
Um, I haven't read it.

192
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,582
I'm not some weird groupie or anything.

193
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,707
No, if you were a groupie,
you likely would have read both my books.

194
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,999
Are there book groupies?
Author groupies?

195
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,749
Not many, but yeah.

196
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,665
Hey! Quick thought I just had.

197
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,707
I'm not doing any press for the book at all.
Readings, interviews. Nothing.

198
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,165
- You cannot be serious.
- Oh, quite.

199
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,374
That's a horrible, horrible idea.

200
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,999
I don't like the idea
of being on display.

201
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,957
My mind is made up.
I wanna be left alone.

202
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,290
Hi, Riley.

203
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,332
I think the tie is a bit much.

204
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,124
I'm invited to his home.
I don't wanna look like a schmo.

205
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,582
Then maybe lose the jacket.

206
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,665
You know, it's 80 degrees out.

207
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,457
It looks like you don't own
a more seasonally-appropriate jacket.

208
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,665
I don't know, I think it looks nice.

209
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,415
Yeah. Nice, just kind of sweaty.

210
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,874
- Philip Lewis Friedman.
- Go get 'em.

211
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,582
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

212
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,665
- Pleasure.
- Good luck.

213
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,249
- Thank you.
- Fix your collar.

214
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,374
- Huh?
- Your collar.

215
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,624
Oh. Thank you.

216
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:47,040
I'd seriously consider having a better
answer to that question if I were you.

217
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,207
I'm filling up notebooks,
but it's nothing but worthless garbage.

218
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,707
Don't tell people that.

219
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,749
Makes you look lazy and stupid.

220
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,290
Got it.

221
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,915
That probably came out
a lot crueller than I intended.

222
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,915
But don't make being lackadaisical
and disorganised your thing.

223
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,790
- It sends out a message that you'll regret.
- I see.

224
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,707
Do you have a nice place to write?

225
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,915
I mean, that's important.

226
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,957
You'll find that,
if you haven't already.

227
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,290
I rented a small studio.

228
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,624
Does it work for you?

229
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,707
No, not really. In fact, I rarely go.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,165
Here.

231
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,040
I probably wouldn't have wanted
to hear this either

232
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,082
when I was your age, but...

233
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,665
The city.

234
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,332
You can't get anything done here.

235
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,749
It has a creative energy,
but not a productive energy.

236
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,457
Quiet does not exist,
and I find that difficult.

237
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,290
Do you know,
I've not written a single page

238
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,749
within the city limits
these past 30 years?

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,082
You'll need a country retreat,
if you can afford one.

240
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,249
I can't.

241
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,957
Well...

242
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,540
Of course, I had achieved
considerably more than you by now.

243
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,999
- Not to be insulting.
- Of course.

244
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,290
But if I can be of any assistance,
if I can help in any way,

245
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,165
just ask outright.

246
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,290
Don't be shy.

247
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,957
I loved your book.

248
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,957
- Yeah, it was OK.
- Don't denigrate yourself.

249
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,790
It's really, really good,

250
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,749
and it would be a shame
for me not to read another one.

251
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,332
Hello.

252
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,374
It's a filthy system, the way it's structured.
You can trust me on this.

253
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,124
I'm not sorry if this kills
any of your illusions about anything.

254
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,415
I feel like it's my job
to tell you the honesty.

255
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,165
Nobody else has.

256
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,499
Nobody else can.

257
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,332
It's rare to find these things out,
and also upsetting.

258
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,582
These little glasses.
Let me see these things.

259
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,290
Oh, yeah, we have
the exact same affectation.

260
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,624
Mm-mmh...

261
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,707
Ah... Emily.

262
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,582
Erm...

263
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,915
Seems like a less than ideal place
to carry on.

264
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,499
Is it 'cause you have a girlfriend?

265
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,499
You mentioned her in an interview.

266
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,915
It's because it's gauche
to grope and kiss in public.

267
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,290
You really don't remember
meeting me, do you?

268
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,707
I had a photo shoot in that same place
when my first book came out.

269
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,749
I gave you a copy of it.

270
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,999
You acted like you were better than some
first-time author nobody had ever heard of,

271
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,082
even though you were probably
still in college.

272
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,540
I wrote my number in it, twice.

273
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,374
I really honestly
don't remember meeting you.

274
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,457
Sorry, but I remember you now.

275
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,207
Oh, of course you do.

276
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,832
OK. I'll call you.

277
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,540
Where were you?

278
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,915
Out.

279
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,665
So, my meeting with Ike today...

280
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,249
Oh, so he's Ike now?

281
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,165
- With Zimmerman. How's your gin?
- How was he?

282
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:18,665
He has a quality
that can only be described as... chrome.

283
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,999
- And?
- He seems to wanna help me.

284
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,332
How can he help you?

285
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,915
He didn't say.

286
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,665
He's got great stories.
I'd love to hang out with him again.

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,707
Do we have plans?

288
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,624
- Do we have plans when?
- Whenever.

289
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,665
Yes, Philip, I'd say sometime in the
indeterminate future, we may have plans.

290
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,915
Good shoot today?

291
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,040
Can you just leave me alone?

292
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,665
I have to do this.

293
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,499
You're fucking with
other people's money here.

294
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,582
Money, money, money.
What about my integrity?

295
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,582
You know, I can think of
a few other important writers

296
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,165
who also took a firm no-press position.

297
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,249
I just wanna know that you've
thought it through thoroughly.

298
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,540
I haven't.

299
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,749
It's a very impulsive decision,
and I'm very pleased with myself for that.

300
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,040
Philip, this is Josh Fawn.

301
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,999
Josh, this is Philip,
who's being a baby and an asshole.

302
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,957
Ciao. Yes, we've met before.
We've done some panels together.

303
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,207
Er... I remember one of them.

304
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,999
Phil, Josh is going on a promotional tour
for his new book.

305
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,915
That's what responsible authors do.

306
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,707
It helps them sell copies
and benefits all parties involved.

307
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,374
- Noted.
- We're wanting you to cover this

308
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,832
as a feature for one of several magazines,
that we're currently negotiating with.

309
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,749
I just like the new book,

310
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,999
and this idea came up,
and I kind of suggested you.

311
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,207
- Thanks, Josh.
- Interest?

312
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,374
Terms?

313
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,374
You'll take whatever we can get you.

314
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,999
It'll be two to three weeks.

315
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,874
I assume we can get you
something like 5,000 to 8,000

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,040
depending on where
we ultimately sell it to.

317
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,707
Right in my pocket. Sounds great.

318
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,957
See, when I slam a door,
life opens a window. When do we leave?

319
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,332
You gonna be speaking in little turns
of phrase like that the whole time?

320
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,790
I might. I don't know.

321
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,957
I think this is gonna be fun.

322
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,332
You wanna go sit somewhere
and talk more about it?

323
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,165
I think we're pretty much
on the same page.

324
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,999
Hey, thanks for doing this, by the way.

325
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,915
You don't seem to give a shit
about this at all.

326
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,249
Sure, I do.

327
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,290
I'm a nice guy.

328
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,249
Read an article about me.
I'm self-deprecating.

329
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,957
No, I'm not thrilled you're going away
for over a month.

330
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,415
That is why I'm acting like this.

331
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,374
Can we please not
talk about this in public?

332
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,790
It strikes me as unlikely,
as you supported ideas like this

333
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,415
when I still could have turned them down.
I need the money.

334
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,874
What I said was,
it would be good for your career.

335
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,457
I thought you meant "career"
with a dollar sign.

336
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,374
I think we need more.

337
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,582
Fireworks, shooting guns.

338
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,457
Maybe we need to get arrested.

339
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,290
Yeah, that might be
a little bit problematic

340
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,415
for some of my younger,
more impressionable fans.

341
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,290
I have a lot of those, I'm told.

342
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,624
Hi.

343
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,624
Ashley.

344
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,124
Oh, my God. Hi.

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,082
- Josh.
- Josh.

346
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,374
Yeah.

347
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,707
- Wow. How are you?
- I'm good. How you doin'?

348
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,582
It was...

349
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,082
- Beth's wedding?
- Beth's wedding, right.

350
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,790
Wow. Was a fun night.

351
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,582
I'm foggy.

352
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,957
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, nice to see you as well.

353
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,957
You guys know each other.

354
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,415
Yeah, we fucking live together.

355
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,740
Nice.

356
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,624
How you take a punch, Josh?

357
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,290
- Excuse me?
- I think we should get into a fight.

358
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,874
For the article.
I think it'd be a neat idea.

359
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,457
- Stand up, Josh.
- OK.

360
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,082
- I'm gonna show you how to take a punch.
- I know how to take a punch.

361
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm gonna show you the right way
to take a punch.

362
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,082
OK, hit me.

363
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,457
- Where?
- Right in my stomach.

364
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,124
Hit me as hard as you can,
just at my stomach.

365
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,290
That wasn't as hard as I can.

366
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,832
I know. I hope not.

367
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,665
Hit me again. Harder. Seriously.

368
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,874
- Yeah, OK.
- Go.

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,790
- You ready?
- Yeah.

370
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,665
- Harder?
- Go. Harder.

371
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,165
I'm fine.

372
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,207
What I did was essentially,
breathing is key.

373
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,332
- Think of it as, like...
- Just hit me.

374
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,082
- All right, you ready? OK.
- Yeah.

375
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,040
One...

376
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,582
Two...

377
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,749
It's cancelled.
I'm fired, if you can believe that.

378
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,499
The whole damn time, he had another guy

379
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,999
and was talking to another magazine,
and just goes with that.

380
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,665
It's sociopathic, is what it is.
Fucking snake.

381
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,249
Feel like a real fat loser right now.

382
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,457
You should use the time
doing something equally as productive.

383
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,749
Well, I was actually planning
to stay home and suffer quietly

384
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,790
as I can no longer afford
to do much else.

385
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,749
Come to my country house. Stay with me.

386
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,957
Rub two sticks together.

387
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,624
Make a fire.

388
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,290
I know most people expect
surprising and generous offers

389
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,582
to be politely refused,

390
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,040
but I might have to call your bluff
and emphatically accept.

391
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,124
How does Memorial Day sound?

392
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,249
That's next week.

393
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,374
Yeah. Sooner the better.

394
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,499
I have a girl, Melanie, up there.

395
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,915
She looks after the place.

396
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,707
I'll mention it to her.

397
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,749
Thank you.

398
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,540
Skol.

399
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,540
'Philip had begun to feel
that the city was rejecting him,

400
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,790
'and Ike's sudden offer of solitude
and respite was immediately appealing.

401
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,374
'So much so that Philip even requested
that the invitation be open-ended,

402
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,999
'and that he be allowed to stay until he felt
emotionally capable of returning to the city.

403
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,790
'To Philip's surprise,
Ike considered this a terrific idea,

404
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,540
'and even said so.'

405
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,415
Actually, that's a terrific idea.

406
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,374
I admire you for being so bold
as to come right out and ask.

407
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,540
I know that sounds like
I'm being sarcastic, but I'm not.

408
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,415
'Ike had begun to lose his passion
for being alone all the time,

409
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:12,915
'and was eager to have an impressionable
young mind on which to impart his wisdom.

410
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,999
'It was under these circumstances
that Philip agreed

411
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,332
'to spend a portion
of his summer upstate with Ike,

412
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,915
'rather than in the city with Ashley.

413
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,332
'Ashley had not been the first to notice

414
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,040
'Philip's increasingly
marginal role in her life.

415
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,540
'It was talked about often
by friends and colleagues,

416
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,707
'none of whom ever had
a relationship with Philip,

417
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,957
'but grew used to hearing about him
much more than they had been lately.

418
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,290
'It had been months since Ashley felt
any real connection to Philip.

419
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,999
'He began to drift away while applying
the finishing touches to his new book

420
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,582
'and had never come back.

421
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,874
'She tried her best to ignore
the mounting signs,

422
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,915
'but the more often they were
brought to her attention,

423
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,540
'the harder it became.

424
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,207
'The most difficult part of which
was her own increasing ambivalence

425
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,415
'regarding her role in Philip's life,
or his in hers.

426
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,290
'She wanted him to want her,

427
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,790
'and the slowly dawning realisation
that he might not

428
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,374
'was enough to push her
into emotionally unprecedented levels

429
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,415
'of doubt and misdirected anger.'

430
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,374
So it's cancelled,
and you're suddenly leaving again?

431
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,749
Looks like it.

432
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,665
God, you'd do anything
to get away from me.

433
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,874
You see, it's remarks like that
that tell me I'm doing the right thing.

434
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,249
Can we please talk?

435
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,624
OK.

436
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,207
Talk.

437
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,882
Kind of figured you would say something.

438
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,299
Nope.

439
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,040
Actually, I do have something to say,

440
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,374
and I imagine you'll not care
to hear it, and it is this.

441
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,957
I'm not going to Ike's for just the week.
He invited me to stay for longer.

442
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,874
- Wait, longer?
- Yeah.

443
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,749
I don't understand.

444
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,790
Honestly, I don't see myself
returning till July or so.

445
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,332
So, you're basically leaving me
for the whole summer.

446
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,832
Not if you look at it like that.

447
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,790
- How am I supposed to look at it?
- Look at it like this.

448
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,874
I was supposed to be gone
most of June anyway, right?

449
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,124
I don't see how this is any different.

450
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,624
I can't breathe here,

451
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,999
and you seem to resent my presence.
Thus I'm unable to work.

452
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,040
It's ugly. It's loud.
It's always moving.

453
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,540
I never feel still long enough
to hold a thought.

454
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:04,999
I feel sick out there among the people.

455
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,165
I need to remedy this,
and an opportunity has presented itself.

456
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,124
I'm gonna take it. I've got no money
and no hope of another advance.

457
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,082
I'm doing what's best for me.

458
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,415
Yeah, you're doing what you're best at.

459
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,457
You're looking out for
your own self interests

460
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,624
without thinking about how it might
affect me or anybody else. Typical!

461
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,582
You're hardly around anyway.
You won't even notice.

462
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,999
Hey, don't tell me I'm not gonna notice
that I'm alone all of a sudden.

463
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,915
Why can't you do something
that involves me?

464
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,624
Why can't we go somewhere together?
You know, alone or...

465
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,332
Is it the money? Because I don't mind
if you need to borrow some again...

466
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,457
Put your money away, all right?

467
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,874
I'm not taking any money from you.

468
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,749
Those days are behind me.
Forever, I told myself.

469
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,124
I hope this will be good for us.

470
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,624
But especially for me.

471
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,124
You are selfish and unsentimental.

472
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,874
- Everyone knows this about you.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

473
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,332
On the contrary.

474
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,749
An admirable trait, if you ask me.

475
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,665
I come from an unsupportive background.

476
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,832
Yeah, I do, too, but don't cling to it.

477
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,415
It'll make you lazy and angry.

478
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,790
- Your work will suffer.
- I'll keep that in mind.

479
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:29,415
And I don't believe you need to
exacerbate these instincts in yourself

480
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,540
more than you already do.

481
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,415
You got it.

482
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,749
Ah... now, your room's out the back.

483
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,707
I, erm...

484
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,457
I have to go to the city
for a couple of days.

485
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,790
- Do you think you'll be all right here?
- Yes, I do.

486
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,249
I thought so.

487
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:05,540
Hello?

488
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,749
Dad?

489
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,124
Hello?

490
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,290
Are you that kid?

491
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,290
You're the caretaker, Melanie?

492
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,124
Dad mentioned you might be here.

493
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,790
So, this comes as no surprise.

494
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,624
Not to me, no.

495
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,082
"Dad"?

496
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,624
Beautiful sunset.

497
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,165
- Productive day?
- Not particularly.

498
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:46,082
I'm glad that he's replaced himself
with a younger surrogate

499
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,665
to handle the forlorn moping.

500
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,790
I'm glad it pleases you.

501
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,874
He'll be back in a few days.

502
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,499
I know.

503
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:00,457
I wasn't sure if you cared about
me being here and him not.

504
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,415
- I do not.
- Right.

505
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:04,290
Because you are a guest.

506
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,457
And this is probably your summer home.

507
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,540
He used to bring other women here
so he could cheat on my mother.

508
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,332
So, no family vacations.

509
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,332
Only horrible, traumatic ones.

510
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,749
You never smell cut grass in the city.

511
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,499
I don't find you charming.

512
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,749
You are just like him, and I hope you learn
to take responsibility for yourself

513
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,457
before you destroy the lives
of people who care about you.

514
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,749
This is really nice.

515
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:22,874
Thanks, Dad.

516
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,957
So, how's it been up here?

517
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,540
It's been good.

518
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,707
I've really enjoyed all the alone time.

519
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,457
I'm sorry about the scheduling problem.

520
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,790
Will you admit that you made a mistake?

521
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,499
I don't think that's necessary.

522
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,915
It was a simple misunderstanding.

523
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,499
Could happen to anyone.

524
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,124
Was anybody speaking to you?

525
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,915
- I thought I was part of the conversation.
- Well, you weren't supposed to be.

526
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,040
In fact, you're not even
supposed to be here.

527
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,540
I am. Does that make sense?

528
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,415
You are the scheduling problem
I was referring to.

529
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:57,332
I thought you were talking about
how your father had to go back to the city.

530
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,624
- Yeah, I thought so too.
- Well, I wasn't.

531
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,332
You didn't make that clear, sweetheart.

532
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:10,665
I can't process how grossly dissatisfied
I find myself feeling.

533
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,249
Things I've coveted for years are mine now,
and all I feel is miserable.

534
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:16,749
That is so cliché.

535
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:20,082
But you know that, so I won't bother
reminding you of how silly you sound.

536
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,957
Didn't you say you, erm...
you placed on some

537
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,499
silly list of young so-and-so's?

538
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,915
35 under 35.

539
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,457
That's it. Yeah.

540
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,165
Yeah, we didn't have crap like that
when I was your age.

541
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,707
You're ahead of the game.

542
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,999
Yeah, but when you were 32,
didn't you win the National Book Award?

543
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,332
That's true.

544
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,832
But you are not me.

545
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,499
How would you like to accept
a gracious favour I've done for you?

546
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,082
Depends on what it is.

547
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:57,332
That answer is at once
both arrogant and correct.

548
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,832
Don't accept too readily
something you might want.

549
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,540
In any event, a friend of mine
from Lambert College got in touch.

550
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:08,999
They're looking for an
adjunct creative writing instructor

551
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,415
for the fall semester.

552
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,415
I teach there occasionally, as you know,

553
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,374
but usually more advanced
seminars, so...

554
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,165
I find this to be beneath me,

555
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,499
but it's a good opportunity for you.

556
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,790
He'd like to interview you tomorrow.

557
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,415
- You can take my car.
- What does it pay?

558
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,124
At that level, I have no idea.

559
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,874
But, hey, you haven't got
the position yet.

560
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,374
I've merely placed you on their radar.

561
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:36,207
But you're notable now, and that helps.

562
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:40,957
We're so excited you accepted.

563
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,457
The new book is really terrific.

564
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,999
Oh, boy.

565
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,124
I wish somebody here
would say something mean.

566
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,540
- Mean?
- Or honest.

567
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,582
It's unlikely that everybody here
has nothing but praise.

568
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,415
It's not real.
I don't like how this is starting.

569
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,165
These are decent people.

570
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,957
They just want to be your friend.

571
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,332
I know, that's the problem.

572
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,874
Sorry to bother you again.

573
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,832
- Is there trash in here?
- Yes, I'm right here.

574
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,999
Hey.

575
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,832
It's Philip.

576
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,915
You look like you're asleep
with your eyes open.

577
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,999
I didn't even see you there.

578
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,790
You were looking right at me.

579
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,040
You were right. This place is beautiful.

580
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,999
You sure you don't want any of these?

581
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,457
Brought you a whole box.

582
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,124
I'd rather just look around
and stare at people.

583
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,290
I was surprised you called me.

584
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,832
I didn't see any way that I couldn't.

585
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,582
Things are pretty hectic
with my new book and everything.

586
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,540
That's pretty cool.

587
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,749
No, it's not cool. It's fucking amazing.

588
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,957
Do you know how few people
reach this level?

589
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,457
You seem to not care.

590
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,249
I really don't.

591
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,374
Did you ask me here
so you could talk about yourself?

592
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,957
Next question.

593
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,874
Does talking about this stuff
make you feel happy?

594
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,874
No.

595
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,540
I find thinking about it all
to be unfulfilling and exhausting.

596
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:00,832
Does nothing for me.

597
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:03,207
Well, that's how the rest of your life
is gonna be.

598
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,999
Unfulfilling and exhausting.

599
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,290
I think success has made you ugly.

600
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,332
I think you've gotten far too in touch
with your selfish instincts,

601
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,999
and it's not healthy.

602
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,957
But I still think about you.

603
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,999
I think the guy I used to know
would have made a really great boyfriend.

604
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,999
I want to take that cupcake
out of your hand right now

605
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,415
and throw it
so fucking far away from you.

606
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,457
Goddamn it, you make me sick.
You're just a big baby.

607
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,457
Babies wanna be around sugar all the time.
No wonder you're a baker.

608
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,374
You're the worst.

609
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:39,374
I'm not successful, I'm notable.
There's a difference.

610
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,415
Besides, I'm not notable, either.

611
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,124
Noteworthy at best.

612
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,415
I once considered you
my favourite ex-girlfriend.

613
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,957
That's very sweet of you.

614
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,582
Let's... let's turn this day around,
do something fun.

615
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,082
Maybe, I don't know, break into a bank,

616
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,415
or rob a car or something.

617
00:33:58,541 --> 00:33:59,874
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

618
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,624
Got some wire hangers at my place.

619
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,665
Oh, great, well, let's steal a car,
go to your place, get the wire hangers,

620
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,457
come back, steal another car,
and just drive off.

621
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,582
OK.

622
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,790
I feel like it wouldn't be weird
for you to kiss me right now.

623
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:25,332
Every girl's so beautiful to me.
I don't wanna think about her at all anymore.

624
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,540
- You should have followed her.
- She wouldn't have me.

625
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,207
And besides, she's moved on.

626
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,332
And in a way, so have I.

627
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,332
Just not actually, of course.

628
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:44,249
Well, I speak from experience
when I say that it is horrible...

629
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,332
to be treated in a way that only points out
how meaningless you are.

630
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,832
Never thought of it that way.

631
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,540
He's here.

632
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,749
Yeah, he just walked into your bedroom.

633
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:35,124
Oh, hey, how's it goin'?

634
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,749
You're a monster.

635
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,624
I hate you.

636
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,499
Then I doubt you'll mind me
being gone through December.

637
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,415
I don't even know
how to respond to that.

638
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:55,332
I've been offered a position teaching
creative writing at Lambert College.

639
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,290
I'm moving there for the semester.

640
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,207
You stood in my way
when I had so many opportunities.

641
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,457
I guess that's why I'm telling you
about this after I agreed to it.

642
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,499
So you decided to sneak back
in the middle of the night?

643
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:15,374
It's not the middle of the night, Ashley.
It's 10:00pm.

644
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,332
Besides, I had some meetings
in the city that ran late,

645
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:19,915
and I considered
just buying new clothes,

646
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,207
but I needed to get some books
I wanted to re-read.

647
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,999
Also, I want my car.

648
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,457
Oh, shit, I forgot about the car.

649
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,790
You haven't been moving it
for street cleaning?

650
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:35,207
I've been gone for three weeks.
Do you know how many tickets I must have?

651
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,124
I kind of would have thought
this to be beneath you.

652
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,290
You know, at one time
I would have as well,

653
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,790
but look at me now.

654
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,040
- You're a man of contradictions.
- No, I'm not.

655
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,749
Who are all these assholes?

656
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,832
They're my friends.

657
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,457
"They're my friends."

658
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,124
Mostly.

659
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:10,165
I got this job, this...

660
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,124
This national ad campaign, so...

661
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,249
We're celebrating.

662
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:22,915
That's great.

663
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,082
'Philip wished Ashley
had not reminded him

664
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,332
'of how great it felt
to be proud of her.

665
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,457
'His own relationship with success
had forced him

666
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,499
'to grow out of feeling resentful
towards her accomplishments.

667
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,707
'He was not prepared to lose
that constant stream of enthusiasm.'

668
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,040
You see? You don't even need me.

669
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,374
God, you really believe that, don't you?

670
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,290
I'm not sure how to answer that
without making things worse.

671
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,999
I supported you when
nobody gave a shit about you.

672
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,249
I want you to know I regret that now.

673
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,707
Good.

674
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,249
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.

675
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:15,957
So you can just...
you can be somebody else's charity case.

676
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:19,457
- Maybe Zimmerman will take care of you.
- He already has, and he will gladly continue.

677
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,040
Get out of my house.

678
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,499
My house too.

679
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:25,165
No. It was never your house.
You just lived here.

680
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,415
You know, I'd like to hope
that in a few months' time,

681
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,874
we'll both have some perspective on this

682
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,957
and be able to move somewhere,
like forward.

683
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,540
This feels irreparable.

684
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,249
You accusing me of indifference?

685
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,415
You don't seem to be struggling.

686
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,040
I am.

687
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,749
Just not in the ways that you notice.

688
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,082
You need a haircut.

689
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,415
I know.

690
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,499
I'm pretty sure I'm missing a brush.

691
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,249
I'll bet one of those models yoinked it.

692
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,874
You got any plans tonight?

693
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,957
Just gonna stay in,
or are you going out?

694
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,415
We were together for almost three years.

695
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,832
Do you want to come over?
We were just gonna make dinner at home.

696
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,624
You should come.

697
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,540
No, thanks. I don't want to be a burden.

698
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,374
You're not being a burden.

699
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,624
I couldn't tell him anything without him
getting depressed and jealous.

700
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,415
Now he's gone.

701
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,540
He owes me a lot of money.

702
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,499
You know, when he was writing
and had no income.

703
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,499
Thousands of dollars.

704
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,540
I don't mean to bring you into it.
I just...

705
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:29,957
I don't think dinner tonight's
a good idea.

706
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,749
No, it's not a good idea at all.

707
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,540
I'm allergic to cats.

708
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:42,374
Can we just, like, put them down
until you're ready?

709
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:46,040
No, 'cause then
they're likely to run away.

710
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,499
And then where are we?
Stuck with no cats.

711
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,165
Is everything OK?

712
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:05,374
What is this cat's name?

713
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,249
This little guy is called Prescott.

714
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,040
That was my grandfather's name.

715
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,290
'For the first time in years, Ashley
found herself feeling truly alone.

716
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:22,915
'Despite being surrounded
by people most of every day,

717
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:26,249
'she was unable to connect to them
in a way she considered meaningful

718
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:29,165
'and found herself passing
through their lives, and her own,

719
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,124
'in a state of total isolation.

720
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,957
What size are these shirts?

721
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:55,290
I don't know. Small or medium.
Try it on.

722
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,624
I'll give you an ill-fitting discount.

723
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,207
They seem expensive.

724
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,582
Sold to the highest bidder.

725
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,540
- This too.
- Yeah, why not?

726
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:06,249
This? Throw this in.

727
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,874
It's not very good, but you can use it
as a coaster or something.

728
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:11,874
No good. Naw.

729
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,957
Take the jacket too. Two for one.

730
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,832
Look at that.

731
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,415
You would date that man, right?

732
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,749
Yeah.

733
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,915
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

734
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,624
- You're late.
- Yeah.

735
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,457
- It's OK.
- Yeah.

736
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,040
You lost? Goddamn it.

737
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,790
Well, at least there's one
pinball player in the family.

738
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,165
- That's a triple take.
- Yeah?

739
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,082
Is that with the spin?

740
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:17,249
You do that... Wait, let me try.

741
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,249
- You missed mine.
- Let me see it again.

742
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,832
I was... We were both double-taking
at the same time.

743
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,957
Hey, that was three.
That was pretty good. That was good.

744
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,249
Erm...

745
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,507
What do you get
if you cut a bra in half?

746
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:33,332
- What?
- A yarmulke with a chin strap.

747
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,374
- Can you guys keep it down, please?
- What?

748
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,499
Can you please keep it down?

749
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,999
How dare you tell me to keep it down?
I'm here with my better half here.

750
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,207
Go fuck yourself!

751
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,790
You can't come into my place
where I'm with my friends,

752
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,374
drinking, playing pinball,
having a fun time, celebrating.

753
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,749
You're not welcome. Get out of here.

754
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,207
Get the fuck out of here!

755
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,124
I'm not kidding you.
Get the fuck out of here right now.

756
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,165
I hate that man.

757
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,415
Hey, sweetheart.

758
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,332
What?

759
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,749
What are you staring at?

760
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:05,957
Nothing.

761
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,749
- Nothing?
- Thought I smelled gasoline.

762
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:10,832
That's me.

763
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,457
- You look lost.
- I'm not.

764
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:14,915
Wanna come hang out?

765
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:22,999
- You want something to drink?
- Sure.

766
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:24,624
All right, sit down.

767
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,874
'When she had first spoken to
the lowlife at the bar,

768
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,874
'it was the first time in four days
Ashley heard her own voice out loud.

769
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,082
'She became devastatingly aware of
her own desperation, loneliness and torment.

770
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,415
'Quickly she could take no more
and went home.'

771
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:35,932
Nobody here is in pain.

772
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:37,832
This is a no-kill shelter.

773
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,749
We have plenty of available
foster parents

774

who are able to take care of them
for as long as necessary to find a home.

- What?

776
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,040
Cats! Do you have any cats?

777
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:04,457
This guy is really friendly. Loving.

778
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,874
Do you have any black and white ones?

779
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,207
Like, that resemble a panda?
Or a raccoon?

780
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,915
You really care about the colour.

781
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:18,749
Yeah, kind of.

782
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,374
He chooses you.

783
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:32,957
You want a snack? Do you want a snack?

784
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,582
This is your new home.

785
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:36,915
What do you think?

786
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,582
There we go. Get familiar.

787
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,457
OK, come on. Ready?

788
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,082
Ready to find your bed?

789
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:52,499
What do you think?

790
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,665
- Hey!
- Hey!

791
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,290
- Hey, you're here.
- I'm here.

792
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:27,832
- How was your trip?
- Ugh, I feel sick.

793
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,082
- You feel sick?
- Yeah. Oh, it's a beautiful day.

794
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:31,207
Right?

795
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,040
Place looks good.

796
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,374
I'm excited you finally
get to see our renovations.

797
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,207
Can't believe that excites you.

798
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,582
God, you sound like a brat
who lives in a dump in New York.

799
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,582
Don't be shitty. My house is not a dump.

800
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,415
Wouldn't know. I've never been.

801
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,499
Lots of fights happened in this room.

802
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,082
Only with you.

803
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,457
We're going out.

804
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,915
Get yourself dressed up.

805
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,790
It's gonna be a big night.

806
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,332
OK, could you stop doing that?
It's really annoying.

807
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:36,957
I planned on going away for a week.

808
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:38,624
- You know this is important to me.
- I know,

809
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,290
but it wasn't supposed
to start for 10 days.

810
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,999
They changed it.
I don't know what to tell you.

811
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,165
You're not being really
supportive right now.

812
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,165
You know this is
an amazing opportunity for me.

813
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,624
Tell me the good version
of this conversation.

814
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:53,665
"You got the job?

815
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:56,207
"Congratulations, Ashley.
I'm so happy for you.

816
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,540
"Although I admit to being
a little disappointed,

817
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,582
"I understand that these things happen.

818
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:02,665
"I'm so proud of you, baby."

819
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,624
That's basically what I said.

820
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:06,874
I would never say that.

821
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,124
I am proud of you.

822
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,582
Come here.

823
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,165
I wish you wanted to go out.

824
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,374
I am out. I don't live here.

825
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:23,874
Oh, I adopted a cat.

826
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,749
I know. You send me pictures.

827
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,374
I send them or I sent them once?

828
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,874
- Oh, more than once.
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.

829
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,957
You have a little situation there.
With your...

830
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,374
Oh.

831
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,582
I love him.

832
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,999
You should love a human.

833
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:54,124
I just don't want him to be one of those exes
I have to see every few years.

834
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,249
You know?

835
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:57,749
He's making it really easy.

836
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,374
I hate that you think this is easy.

837
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,790
That's nice.

838
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:09,249
- Should I do anything?
- No, no, no, just look that way.

839
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,707
There you go. Smile.

840
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,999
Think of something funny.

841
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,582
Nice.

842
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:21,040
There you go.

843
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:23,082
It's me.

844
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:24,999
Work it. Work it.

845
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,207
Classic, but not a comedy.

846
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,957
And he got 'em all!

847
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,749
- You want another one?
- Not another banana joke.

848
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,124
Can I take one of you?

849
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,624
- So, you pull the thing back?
- Oh, it looks nice, yeah.

850
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,665
- Did it click?
- Yeah. Smile a little.

851
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,040
I don't feel like smiling.

852
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,707
- Focus up there. You all right?
- I'm getting addicted to this.

853
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:48,207
It's gonna be a bit fuzzy,
I have a feeling.

854
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:51,165
- There you go. Turn that thing, don't be shy.
- They're art house.

855
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,374
That sun.

I get a fright</i>

it don't come out right</i>

868
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,499
<i>Like an actor in the wings</i>

869
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:51,999
<i>Like a man before he sings</i>

870
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,499
<i>You know you're gonna make it if you try</i>

'Philip had returned for his winter
clothes the third week of July.

'By early September,
Ashley had at last begun to feel

876

'as though her life was her own again.

and finally read

'as Philip had always promised,

886

'that she had no idea of
what he had been doing all summer,

'ones formerly enjoyed with Philip,

898

'a seasonally-augmented
sense of melancholy,

'The ease with which
their conversation flowed

slowly breathed back in.'

Got nothing to say.

How is he?

919
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,999
I did so well. Can you not ask?

00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:43,040
Please.

921
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,624

I feel him weighing on me
more in his absence,

923
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:51,249
than I did when he was around.

924
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:53,749
Where is he?

925
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,082
He's just gone.

926
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:59,665
It's like he was a figment
of my imagination.

927
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,749
I'm fairly certain I'm not welcome here.

Ding-ding-ding.

929
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,665
It's late. I've been sitting here
waiting to make a scene for hours.

930
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:23,374
What do you want?

931
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,874
I'm very lonely.

932
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,624
That's unfortunate.

I don't like teaching creative writing
as much as I assumed I would.

934
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:31,457
Well, you're a cruel, miserable person,

935
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:33,999
so it makes sense you'd end up
in a miserable situation.

936
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,915
What happened to my desk?

937
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:38,082
That's my bonus desk.

938
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,832
- Nobody at the school likes me.
- Nobody here likes you.

939
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:44,124
I think I might resign and come home.

940
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,124
You don't live here.

941
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,582
You live upstate.

942
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,249
No, I don't want that to be my home.

943
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:54,790
It's lonely and sad
and the faculty have turned on me.

944
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:57,790
Boo-hoo! The last few weeks
have been so hard for you.

945
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,374
Whose cat is this?

946
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,082
It's my cat.

947
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:06,624
- We don't have a cat.
- Apparently I do.

948
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,832
Oh, look, see? There it is.

949
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:11,790
Come here, big boy.

950
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,624
This is Gadzookey.

951
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,874
Gadzookey, meet Philip.

952
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,332
Don't get attached. He was just leaving.

953
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,249
Do you ever make a decision
that at the time seems sound,

954
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,582
but quickly reveals itself to be empty?

955
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,749
Good-bye, Philip. I don't like you.

956
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,457
He's kind of an asshole.

957
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,165
What a strange feeling.

958
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:39,582
So off... it's like my head is a car,

959
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,207
but I can't drive fast
because there's too much traffic.

960
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,999
So instead I'm just
moving very, very slowly.

961
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:49,665
It's so hard, what I do.

962
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:52,165
I mean, it's not at all,
and that is the joke, right?

963
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,290
- God, this is so boring.
- A big joke.

964
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,790
Ashley's so bored right now.

965
00:57:56,916 --> 00:57:58,915
Just go back where you came from.

966
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:01,499
I'm getting angry at myself,
do you understand?

967
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:04,832
Because it doesn't even upset me
to see you like this.

968
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:06,999
I want you to leave and leave me alone.

969
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:10,624
I don't know why you are here,
but I'm not interested, so don't tell me.

970
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,374
God, do you remember
there was a time when we just...

971
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,707
We wanted to go to sleep together
and wake up together,

972
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,874
every day, indefinitely.

973
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,124
Now I don't even give a shit
if I ever see you again.

974
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,457
I want you to leave,
and just don't come back

975
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,249
and stop hurting me.

976
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,957
I got asked to write a short story
about photography.

977
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:35,207
By who?

978
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,207
Oh, God, you'd be so mad if I told you.

979
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,290
Isn't that what you want?

980
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,707
I don't know what you want me to say.

981
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,582
You used to be so exciting.

982
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,999
Now you're just pitiful.

983
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:56,582
I'm afraid you've seen
the last of me for a long, long time.

984
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,415
- Hey.
- I know you.

985
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,249
Do you know where he is?

986
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:48,790
I don't.

987
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:52,749
Do you, like, live here now?

988
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,165
I still have the keys.

989
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,874
No, now I live
in a depressing faculty apartment.

990
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,165
How is the college?

991
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,665
It's fine.

992
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,999
I assumed he'd be here.

993
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:05,374
- Seems I was mistaken.
- Yeah, that makes two of us.

994
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,874
Hey, you can stay if you want to.

995
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:11,707
That won't be necessary.

996
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,457
'For reasons unclear to him,

997
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:17,749
'the exchange with Melanie
caused overwhelming anxiety in Philip,

when Melanie was not around,

in conversation.

1001

'Philip would have forgotten about her,

1002

to his pitiful life at the college.'

1008
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,999
Tell him I was here.

1009
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,957
Your little protégé
stopped by yesterday.

1010
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:08,249
He's not a protégé, he's a...
He's a friend.

1011
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:11,332
I still haven't read his book.
I couldn't find it anywhere.

1012
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,749
My copy is in the city.

1013
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,582
Should I read it?

1014
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:19,124
Well, it is remarkable.

1015
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,915
He suffers a little
from being too arrogant,

1016
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:26,207
both in his writing and as a person.

1017
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,999
Oh. Match made in heaven.

1018
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:38,874
I don't know if I can continue
to accommodate you here.

1019
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,124
Why is that?

1020
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,332
Because you're a pain in the ass.

1021
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,749
I have to go to the city today.

1022
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:59,290
What for?

1023
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,915
See my agent.

1024
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:05,165
- Henry?
- Henry? No.

1025
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:07,415
Henry's not been with me for 10 years.

1026
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,582
Why not?

1027
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:12,665
Because he's a cocksucker
and a little piece of shit.

1028
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,249
Oh, fuck!

1029
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:19,374
Jesus, God Almighty.
Fucking thing. Look at this.

1030
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,374
Is this a meeting about something new?

1031
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,290
Hmm? Well, potentially.

1032
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,457
It's complicated.

1033
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:32,290
We're hoping for some money
from a sale of movie rights.

1034
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,707
Is that woman still your editor?

1035
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,249
No. She's an asshole
with no loyalty as well.

1036
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,915
- What about...
- Are you here only to put me on the spot?

1037
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,915
None of this is worth revisiting to me.

1038
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,582
I've been betrayed by a lot
of small-minded and worthless people.

1039
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,457
Do I need them to accomplish anything?

1040
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:54,374
The answer is no.
They are altogether nothing.

1041
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,999
Having once known me will always be
the most interesting thing about them.

1042
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:00,540
Those fucking vultures
have fed off me longer

1043
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:02,290
than any sane man would have allowed.

1044
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:08,249
That sounds like a horrible example
to set for your little student.

1045
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,624
So what? He's not my kid.

1046
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:19,665
'Ike's time with Philip

resulted in Ike feeling stronger

presence and volume.

01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,332
This is my place. My humble home.

1088
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:08,707
I know.

1089
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,582
- You want to take your coat off?
- Oh, thank you.

1090
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,790
Yeah, I'll set it right here.

1091
01:06:12,916 --> 01:06:15,832
- So, er... drinks?
- Sure, of course.

1092
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:17,999
We have some wine, red wine, white wine.

1093
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:19,457
- Erm... red.
- Red?

1094
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:21,040
- Norm?
- Prosecco.

1095
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:22,707
- Ah...
- Prosecco!

1096
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,582
That's fancy, Norm.

1097
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:30,124
You know, I love movies.

1098
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,582
So here's a line from a movie.
You have to guess.

1099
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:43,957
She says to a younger man who's trying
to woo her, to flirt with her...

1100
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:47,832
And she says to him, "You don't want me.
You want somebody young and fresh."

1101
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:51,999
And she goes,
"Armies have marched over me."

1102
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:54,749
- All right, guess that one.
- Right away.

1103
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:56,207
Thank you.

1104
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,999
Are we supposed to guess who said that?

1105
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,582
- Well, maybe. Yeah.
- What movie?

1106
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,957
- What was your name again?
- Thank you. Flo.

1107
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,790
Flow gently, sweet Afton.

1108
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:10,665
It is spoken by Rita Hayworth.

1109
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:12,457
- Do you remember Rita Hayworth?
- Of course.

1110
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,499
- Yes!
- They don't remember Rita Hayworth.

1111
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:19,374
In a movie called Fire Down Below.

1112
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,707
Hey, you know that?

1113
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,207
There's snow on the roof,
but there's fire down below.

1114
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,457
- Santé! Santé!
- You're French, right?

1115
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,457
Come here. It's more cosy.

1116
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:30,415
- Yeah, come on.
- Is there anyone else coming tonight?

1117
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,790
Well, I'm younger than Norm.

1118
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:38,082
Oh, I thought you said
there was a party happening.

1119
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:40,374
Oh, I'm sorry, I... Maybe I...

1120
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,040
I have a secret weapon.

1121
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:43,624
- Oh!
- I'll go get it.

1122
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,832
Just hold it right there.

1123
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:47,957
Yeah, he's young.

1124
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:50,499
He's not tall, but he's young.

1125
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:57,332
Philip. Philip, get over here.

1126
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:00,249
No, now, as quick as you can.

1127
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:02,999
Get here now.

1128
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:08,374
So there was these two old men
sitting in deck chairs on the beach,

1129
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,332
and one of them turns to the other
and he says, "It's nice out today,"

1130
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,999
and the other one says,
"Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."

1131
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:20,790
Hey, let's hope it's a boy! Huh?

1132
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:23,249
Philip!

1133
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:26,915
Come on, stand up. Oh, you are standing.

1134
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,165
Come in, come in. Hey.

1135
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:30,457
- Hey.
- Hey.

1136
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:32,332
Oh! In you come.

1137
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,874
We will be social
with these women tonight.

1138
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,665
Son, you're young. Come on.

1139
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,374
Huh? What are you?

1140
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,082
- Old.
- Yeah?

1141
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,665
Wise.

1142
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:45,665
And also rich, which helps.

1143
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:49,332
Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich.
Now get in there.

1144
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,457
Come on. Enjoy yourself!

1145
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:58,165
Call me son, yeah? Hi, I'm Philip.

1146
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,290
My name is Philip.

1147
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:02,665
- Hello.
- Hi.

1148
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,665
I know who you are,
but it's a real pleasure.

1149
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:09,374
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?

1150
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,332
Well, I've never met him personally,
but, um...

1151
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:14,999
- You've heard of me.
- I've read. I've read who I think you are.

1152
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:18,665
- Wow.
- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?

1153
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:22,332
No, should we know who he is?

1154
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,374
- Yeah, he's one of the...
- I don't know whether you should...

1155
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,874
- I... I write.
- He's what they call essential.

1156
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,374
- A writer.
- Like the profession.

1157
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,374
This guy is like, they teach this guy.

1158
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,499
- You know...
- Oh, really?

1159
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:35,624
Yeah, I'm gonna just go check
really quickly on the lord of the manor.

1160
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:38,499
Oh! Well, get yourself a drink.
You need a drink.

1161
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:39,874
Well, I shouldn't, probably.

1162
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,165
I've already taken, like,
all kinds of strange things

1163
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,124
before coming over here,
so I don't know.

1164
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,332
- Good, you'll be able...
- You look very put together.

1165
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:48,999
You handle your things well.

1166
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:51,249
I do handle them well, but...

1167
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:54,957
I'm speaking of allergy medicine in this case,
'cause upstate really fucks with me.

1168
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:56,124
All right, have yourself...

1169
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,582
All right, have yourself a merry
little Christmas. I'll be right back.

1170
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:01,249
- Good to see you.
- It's an honour.

1171
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:02,832
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

1172
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:03,957
Sit down.

1173
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,540
What are you doing in here?

1174
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:09,999
- They said they want you to come back.
- You fucked up.

1175
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,332
- Huh?
- Get back in there.

1176
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,915
I could have made that transaction
in two minutes when I was your age.

1177
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,874
Twice a week. Fucking get back in there.

1178
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,915
Well, it's my understanding
that was a different time.

1179
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,915
Women were, you know... looser then.

1180
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:23,957
Also much more impressed by authors.

1181
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:26,040
Yeah, authors like me.

1182
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:27,290
Get in!

1183
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,707
You wrote that book?

1184
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,499
- Well, no. No, no, no. Listen.
- Oh, my god.

1185
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:35,207
- Can we have an autograph?
- You wanted to know about Joseph Conrad.

1186
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,165
And we're back.

1187
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,624
Hey, hey, how about you give us
a little tune on the piano, huh?

1188
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,332
- Uh...
- Come on, come on.

1189
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:44,749
You want a little song?
A song from Philip?

1190
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,040
Georgia on My Mind.

1191
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,040
More upbeat. Upbeat.

1192
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:49,665
Let's dance. Let's dance.

1193
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,915
Oh, that's it.

1194
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:17,207
Melanie! Hey, hey, hey!

1195
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,540
Look who's here! Hey!

1196
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:20,665
- Hey.
- Hi.

1197
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,374
That's my daughter, huh?

1198
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,999
I hate you both.

1199
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,499
- I have nothing to do with this.
- Oh, didn't you?

1200
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,499
Go fuck yourself.

1201
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,124
You've ruined this night for me.

1202
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,499
OK, OK, OK. No, no.

1203
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,499
It's over, it's over.

1204
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,915
OK, you should go.

1205
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:50,915
Go, go, go!

1206
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,749
Thanks for coming.

1207
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,374
- Bye.
- Bye.

1208
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:09,790
Ike. What just happened?

1209
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:12,374
I told you what she's like.

1210
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,499
- I didn't think it was that...
- Yeah.

1211
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,624
I'd completely forgotten she was here.

1212
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,082
Oh, she can be such a bitch sometimes.

1213
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,249
To hell with her.

1214
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,457
- Norm?
- Yes, sir.

1215
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:30,999
Little drink for the road.

1216
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,874
- Thank you.
- Huh?

1217
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:36,165
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

1218
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,332
Smell that? '25.

1219
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,415
All right, the good stuff.

1220
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,874
Philip, I've, er...

1221
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,374
I got something special for you.

1222
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,082
I don't talk to her mother anymore.
Did I tell you that?

1223
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:51,332
I guess I just sort of assumed it.

1224
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,874
She asked me about it the other day.
I didn't know what to say to her.

1225
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,624
Oh, God.

1226
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,082
She can be such a pain in the ass.

1227
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,124
Anyway, here's to us.

1228
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,915
Cheers. Philip.

1229
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:10,082
Seems like it's just you and me left now,
Norm, huh?

1230
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,290
Oh, hey.

1231
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,082
I forgot to tell you.

1232
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,874
I saw this the other day.

1233
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,040
Hmm?

1234
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:23,249
The guy you were supposed to do
the journalism piece on, that snake?

1235
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:26,415
It seems he took his own life.

1236
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:29,957
- Jesus.
- Who is it? Who's that?

1237
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,457
What's he called?

1238
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,707
Josh Fawn, the writer.

1239
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:37,915
I mean, I'm glad he's dead
and all, but...

1240
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:41,665
Doing that interview would have been
a really great opportunity for me.

1241
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:45,499
Last interviews are hard to get,
because you never know.

1242
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,915
I know this guy. I like his work.

1243
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,957
- I had lunch with him recently.
- You did?

1244
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:52,832
- I did.
- You had lunch with him?

1245
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,582
- Yes.
- Lunch, and, whoo!

1246
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:00,207
Oh, well.

1247
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:02,915
Erm... you know, I'm looking forward
to reading your work.

1248
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:05,374
Hey, hey, hey, don't buy a copy.
I got plenty here.

1249
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,957
You can have one of mine.

1250
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,582
Anyway, listen...

1251
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,915
I gotta go to bed, OK?

1252
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:15,290
Old Ikey has got to get some rest.

1253
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:16,874
Why don't you stay here tonight?

1254
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,082
I've got a meeting at the college tomorrow.
You can drive me there.

1255
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:22,790
- Erm...
- Is that good?

1256
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,374
- Yeah.
- OK.

1257
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,499
- I didn't bring a toothbrush.
- Good night, everybody.

1258
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,332
Good night.

1259
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:30,207
- Night.
- Good night to you.

1260
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,999
- Norm.
- Take care.

1261
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,707
Was a pleasure.

1262
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:34,957
Take care.

1263
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,082
- And...
- Be well.

1264
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:38,207
- I can, I will be.
- Oh, well, don't look at that.

1265
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:39,915
Jesus Christ.

1266
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,790
You dick.

1267
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,499
- Good one?
- Good enough.

1268
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:59,207
Even looking at the girls here
brings on a cascade of conflicting emotions.

1269
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,082
They're always gonna want more
than you're prepared to offer.

1270
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,957
You remember that.
You'll learn it yourself one day,

1271
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,624
if you haven't already.

1272
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:11,415
What are you thinking about?
Are you thinking about what I just told you?

1273
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,207
This place looks unforgiving.

1274
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:17,499
Suffers in comparison to the guest room.

1275
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:20,124
Well, the offer's still on the table.

1276
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,957
Don't sit on the car.

1277
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:26,374
Listen, this isn't the city.

1278
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,832
They're a different breed
of snob up here.

1279
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,124
It's academia.

1280
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,790
Academia nuts.

1281
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,082
I fail to understand the distinction.

1282
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,707
Yeah, I do, too, sometimes.

1283
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,499
It's been really awful.

1284
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,499
I consider you my good friend.

1285
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,707
I appreciate that.

1286
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,082
But you'll soon find
how little that counts for.

1287
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:54,374
I'm not referring to myself,
but there's a lot of assholes out there.

1288
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:58,832
Less up here than in the city,
but it's all relative.

1289
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:20,207
You say it yourself. You don't see anybody.
You have no friendships.

1290
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:23,790
And you have ruined every relationship
in which you ever could have found meaning.

1291
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,332
Who?

1292
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:29,290
Huh? Associates? Sycophants?

1293
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:32,290
Who the fuck needs pissants like that?
Good riddance.

1294
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:34,040
Me. Mom.

1295
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:36,540
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, as usual.

1296
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:39,457
Why do you assume
that she never talked to me?

1297
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:41,874
Oh, I'm sure she was only too eager

1298
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,207
to fill your head with some inane,
fictitious bullshit.

1299
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:47,124
But one thing I know for a fact,

1300
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,249
you only got one version of events

1301
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:53,707
told from the perspective of a very sad,
very lonely, pathetic woman.

1302
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,832
You insult again.

1303
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,332
This is my mother you're talking about.

1304
01:16:58,458 --> 01:16:59,915
And? Go on.

1305
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:03,332
You talk about her like she's
some leech that sucked you dry.

1306
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:07,082
Yeah, well, she would have done,
given half the chance.

1307
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:08,749
Her and everyone else.

1308
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:12,082
You know, she is my biggest regret, hmm?

1309
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:15,499
The strongest and saddest proof
that you cannot change anyone,

1310
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:18,790
and that your first instinct about them
will always be right.

1311
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:22,582
Yeah, well, that just proves that you
yourself can't be changed, either.

1312
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,749
Yeah, well, much to my chagrin,
I prove my own point.

1313
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,457
I always try to lead by example...

1314
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:33,124
To show everyone
how I can put aside preconceptions

1315
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,040
and find new feelings, new ideas.

1316
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:38,624
But the innate ineffability
of human disappointment

1317
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,374
overcomes my faith every time.

1318
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,457
- So, when you belittle me...
- "Belittle you"?

1319
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,540
- I didn't even fucking say anything to you.
- Yes!

1320
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,915
- What are you talking about?
- "Belittle me"!

1321
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,665
For my self-made disconnect
from those who want nothing from me

1322
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:55,665
but to further their own
petty feelings of self-delusion.

1323
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:59,874
Then you reinforce the degree to which
I saved myself from future disappointment

1324
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,999
by cutting myself off
to the extent that I did!

1325
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,624
Do you hear yourself?

1326
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,874
'The emotions which arose

1327
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,249
'from the spectacular confrontation
with his daughter

1328
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:18,624
'enraged and excited Ike in such a way
as he no longer felt possible.

1329
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,332
'Philip's unbridled respect
and reverence for his idol,

1330
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:24,457
'compounded with his
youthful sense of rage and entitlement,

1331
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:27,415
'had forced unwanted introspection
upon Ike.

1332
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:31,374
'And what he saw was
a shamefully complacent old man,

1333
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,540
'who had long since given up
the forcefulness

1334
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:37,207
'that had once motivated him
to create some of his best work.

1335
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:07,374
'The autumn months had brought about
an overwhelming sense of shame in Ike,

1336
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,374
'as he tried and failed
to put out of his mind

1337
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,790
'the vigour and dissatisfaction
that once drove him to succeed,

1338
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:17,040
'replaced with frustration,
self-pity and disappointment.'

1339
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:37,790
And of course, the frustrating thing is

1340
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,624
to want to focus your energies
on something

1341
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:44,665
that, well, at this point in my life,
should be something of an opus.

1342
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:46,749
- A culmination.
- Right.

1343
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,374
Could we swap seats?
I don't feel right sitting here.

1344
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,124
I'd rather not sit in a pupil's chair
in my own office.

1345
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:58,624
We can both sit over there,
or we can both stand.

1346
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,332
I've had years of this shit.

1347
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:09,249
How long did yours take?

1348
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:10,749
Something like two years apiece.

1349
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,915
Oh, God, I used to be faster than that.

1350
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:16,665
Two years would be humiliating for me.

1351
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:18,874
Well, for anyone.

1352
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,957
I... I didn't mean it like that,
but you get the idea.

1353
01:20:24,525 --> 01:20:26,207
This could be so big for me.

1354
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,040
Instead, I... I'm suffering here.

1355
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:33,624
More than you could know
or I could possibly explain.

1356
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,415
I just don't see anything clearly.

1357
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:40,665
I'm trying to do my best here.

1358
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,040
Oh, fuck it.

1359
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,374
I should have this figured out by now.

1360
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,665
Well, thank you for listening

1361
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:51,874
to the sentimental and frustrated
ramblings of an old man.

1362
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,374
- You've done a lot for me.
- I didn't do much.

1363
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,249
No. But your work did.

1364
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,082
That's true.

1365
01:20:58,208 --> 01:21:00,124
Bonjour, Yvette. Ça va?

1366
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,957
- She's Yvette?
- Yeah.

1367
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:10,832
'Yvette Dussart was entering
her third year on the faculty

1368
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:14,290
'when she was informed that a young,
newly successful author from the city

1369
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,165
'would be joining
the English department,

1370
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,749
'which she took as a personal attack
on her territory,

1371
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:21,874
'as it relieved her of the title
of youngest faculty member,

1372
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,707
'a distinction from which she derived
no small amount of satisfaction.

1373
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:28,749
'Philip and Yvette were only about
three years apart in age.'

1374
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:36,749
'Prior to his arrival and introduction,

1375
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:39,374
'Yvette had decided to act
unkind towards him,

1376
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,874
'and was able to convince
several other faculty members

1377
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,999
'that, in fact, a novelist
with no teaching experience

1378

'did not belong among their ranks,

1379
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:50,207
'a cunning move that created
an environment of tension and hostility

1380

with nothing more to do

'and to doing as good a job teaching
as possible.'

1387
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:14,540
I wonder what type of style we should
be working on for these exercises.

1388
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,832
I'm not sure I can answer that question.

1389
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,124
In fact, I'm certain I cannot.

1390
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:21,999
I don't have a very academic relationship
with form or style.

1391
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:24,790
So... what is your advice?

1392
01:22:24,916 --> 01:22:27,457
The best thing I can offer is what I do,

1393
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:31,124
which is to kinda goof around
until you find what works.

1394
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,290
Besides, in my experience,

1395
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:34,332
more than half of you
will probably abandon writing,

1396
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:36,624
creative or the other kind,
very shortly after graduating.

1397
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:37,749
If you haven't already.

1398
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:41,540
I'm thinking of a few of you specifically
when I say that last part.

1399
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:42,874
Hey, hey.

1400
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:45,582
Are you at all qualified to be teachin'?

1401
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:50,165
I never use the word "teach".
I always say "instruct".

1402
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:53,957
Nice try.

1403
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,999
You've made it a point
to turn others against me,

1404
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,457
and I don't understand why.

1405
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,499
I've not.

1406
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:17,707
You have.

1407
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:20,040
And as a result, I'm sad and alone...

1408
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:24,082
I don't like it here.

1409
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:40,874
- Hello.
- Hi.

1410
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:46,499
I read Obidant. I really liked it.

1411
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,874
- I didn't realise it had come out already.
- About two weeks ago.

1412
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,332
Huh.

1413
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,040
Listen, it's nothing personal, but...

1414
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:55,999
I'm really trying to do my best up here,

1415
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:59,249
and part of that means
not getting involved with anybody

1416
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:02,165
in, er... say, a human way.

1417
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:05,582
So if you'd like, you could
come visit me at my office.

1418
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,207
This is not my office.

1419
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:16,249
Please don't act like somebody
who doesn't know how to handle themselves.

1420
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:18,915
I don't know what you mean.

1421
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,707
Act as though you attend these things
all the time.

1422
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:22,957
How?

1423
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:25,207
Feel like you don't want to be here.
Like me.

1424
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:26,999
See how little I wanna be here?

1425
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:29,707
But I very much want to be here.

1426
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,624
Oh, Jonathan.

1427
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,540
Are you proud of me?

1428
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:38,082
In what way?

1429
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:40,749
Never mind.

1430
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:44,124
You seem to have
a decent situation here.

1431
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,957
- This place is just fine.
- Yeah.

1432
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:10,499
You do not need to look away
every time you see me.

1433
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:16,874
Was it your father
I saw you with earlier?

1434
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,040
He's my uncle. Mon oncle. Like the film.

1435
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:22,290
You look sad with him.

1436
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:26,582
I don't think you're saying
what you think you are.

1437
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,832
I meant to say...

1438
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:32,249
When with him, it makes you look
as though you are not happy.

1439
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:35,290
Oh. I guess that's pretty much
what you said the first time.

1440
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:36,999
Why is this?

1441
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:38,915
Your own family makes you unhappy?

1442
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:41,665
I don't feel comfortable
talking to you like this.

1443
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:44,207
- Why?
- Because we don't like each other.

1444
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:45,915
Or you don't like me.

1445
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:48,874
It's not like that. I mean...

1446
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:52,249
OK, it's true that I am upset that

1447
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:55,540
I study for years to obtain
a teaching degree, and you...

1448
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:59,999
You just publish two slim novels
and get a job many would murder for.

1449
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:06,749
I, however, think it is possible
we could be friendly together.

1450
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,457
You encouraged the faculty
to turn on me.

1451
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:11,249
Nobody likes me here.

1452
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:14,249
Nobody ever talks to me.

1453
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:17,957
We like it here.
We have family and community.

1454
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:20,499
And you've just come here
with your new novel

1455
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:23,999
and turned them against yourself
with your arrogance and ego.

1456
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:27,457
You're to blame nobody
but yourself for these things.

1457
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:28,874
I don't know how to process that.

1458
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,249
I'm not sure how quickly
I can absolve you of wrongdoing

1459
01:26:31,375 --> 01:26:33,040
and shoulder the blame myself.

1460
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:38,040
I'd like to go elsewhere and talk.

1461
01:26:38,791 --> 01:26:39,790
Speak with you more.

1462
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,249
Just not standing here, outside.

1463
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,957
OK.

1464
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,790
Just not back in there.

1465
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:02,040
Hello.

1466
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,665
I thought it best if my students
don't ever see me out of class.

1467
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:10,874
So, what do you do at night?

1468
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:13,749
I stay home, I read, and I think.

1469
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:16,499
It'll make my life harder
if people see me differently.

1470
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,332
Does that make sense?

1471
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:20,957
And you only want to be thought of
as a talented writer

1472
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:22,665
and not as a real person?

1473
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:26,749
Hmm, yeah.

1474
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:29,415
Yeah. That's probably about right.

1475
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:32,207
In fact, that's exactly right.

1476
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:35,957
Thank you.

1477
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:38,915
All right.

1478
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:45,124
Be a good boy. Give me a call, OK?

1479
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,749
Yeah.

1480
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,040
I never had a weekend on campus
where I went to school.

1481
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,374
I can't really quite adjust.

1482
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,749
Last night your uncle and then me...

1483
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,207
It's your first real conversation
since you arrived here?

1484
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:02,915
Conversation that took place on or around
campus and was substantial? Yes.

1485
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:05,790
Wow. You must be really lonely.

1486
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,624
Can't see your eyes in that hat.

1487
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:10,415
That's better. Where are you going?

1488
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:38,124
- Are your office hours over?
- For the time being.

1489
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,499
Also they're for people in classes I teach.
That's not you, is it?

1490
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:42,957
- No, but I was hoping...
- No, it's urgent.

1491
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:48,374
So, today we'll be learning
about the Romantic period,

1492
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,665
and the impact of the French Revolution,

1493
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,874
such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and...

1494
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:58,124
Erm... William Godwin and...

1495
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,790
Erm... did anyone read it?

1496
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:06,257
Er... we'll be also talking about the...

1497
01:29:07,616 --> 01:29:09,724
romantic themes.

1498
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:13,624
Sorry, the cult of sensibility,
emphasising...

1499
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,915
Sorry, what were we talking about?

1500
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:29,665
Well, this is the most amount of visitors
I've ever seen during a single session.

1501
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:31,040
And on a Friday, no less.

1502
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,499
What a world.

1503
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,457
One second.

1504
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:45,165
Come right in.

1505
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:47,582
When I was in school,
I never went to these things,

1506
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:49,582
- so I tend to forget about them.
- That's OK.

1507
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:51,499
I was hoping we could discuss my story.

1508
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,624
Right. Which I read.

1509
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:56,124
I think the perspective was very clear.

1510
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:59,665
Erm... and, also, I should say that...

1511
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:02,040
What was the title of it again?

1512
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:05,207
I'll be honest.
That's not the main reason I'm here.

1513
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:08,540
Thank God, because honestly,
I don't even think I've read yours yet.

1514
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:11,082
Or any of them, for that matter,
so don't be offended.

1515
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:13,790
I was hoping you could provide me with
a letter of recommendation

1516
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:16,790
for an internship I'm pursuing
at Paragon Press.

1517
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:22,082
- OK.
- Is that not possible?

1518
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:25,374
Look, I'll say this,
and then we can proceed accordingly.

1519
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,540
Number one, internships are a waste
of time, so you shouldn't bother.

1520
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:30,707
Two, that company sucks,

1521
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:33,207
and you wouldn't gain
any worthwhile experience there.

1522
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:36,749
And three, I don't actually think
that I know you very well.

1523
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:38,332
Or at all, now that I think about it.

1524
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:41,290
So, I wouldn't be the best person
to sing your praises.

1525
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:44,707
Where does that leave us
on the whole letter of recommendation tip?

1526
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,165
I think they can be somewhat generic.

1527
01:30:47,291 --> 01:30:49,624
It's kind of a formality anyway.

1528
01:30:50,958 --> 01:30:52,290
Nah.

1529
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:57,790
Does your publisher have
an internship programme?

1530
01:30:57,916 --> 01:31:00,124
To be honest with you, I have no idea.

1531
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:02,415
I'm not thinking about this right now.

1532
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,165
Here's a piece of paper
with some staples in it.

1533
01:31:10,416 --> 01:31:11,915
Wish I could be of more help.

1534
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:16,790
'The semester drew to a close,

1535
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:20,499
'and an impending sense of melancholy
and longing developed within Philip,

of the extent to which she disliked him.'

1566
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:52,790
I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

1567
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:55,249
You know what I want you to tell me.

1568
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,999
Oh, the situation is
becoming really irritating.

1569
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:01,540
I have a life somewhere. Or had one.

1570
01:33:01,666 --> 01:33:03,874
I'm not sure which.
It's probably not even there anymore.

1571
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,582
Then forget it. And come back home
with me for the holiday break.

1572
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,999
I've nothing to do when I get back.
Also, I've nowhere to live.

1573
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:12,165
I don't work here permanently.
Only you do.

1574
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:15,207
I'm sure you can get
one more semester of work.

1575
01:33:15,333 --> 01:33:17,124
Hang on while I put
my head in this sweater.

1576
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,790
Keep going.

1577
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:20,124
It is possible.

1578
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,957
A lot that would need to change
for that to happen.

1579
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:27,707
Are we still going to Ike's for Thanksgiving?
What are we bringing?

1580
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:30,207
- Really?
- Yeah.

1581
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:39,790
You know what? Why don't you stay
at your own apartment tonight?

1582
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:42,749
My apartment is sad
and has improper heating,

1583
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:46,165
which you know
because we're standing in it right now.

1584
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,915
Oh!

1585
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,915
So, you don't want to be
trapped by academia.

1586
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:05,082
There are some people over there
who I wish I could still call my colleagues.

1587
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:07,915
They didn't want this life
for themselves.

1588
01:34:08,041 --> 01:34:09,874
I told this to our boy here.

1589
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,082
You know, you have to be very careful.

1590
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:16,540
Don't believe too strongly
the structures they put in front of you.

1591
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,207
This is good advice.

1592
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:21,290
For you more so than him, though.

1593
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:23,790
Excuse me.

1594
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:31,332
You seem ill-equipped
to deal with someone like that.

1595
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:33,332
We began by hating one another.

1596
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:35,457
I think we're coming back
down the other side now.

1597
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:37,665
That's a very potent image.

1598
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:39,332
You should write it down and use it.

1599
01:34:39,458 --> 01:34:41,665
I came up with it on the silent,
excruciating drive over here.

1600
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:44,374
- I'm glad you approve.
- Oh, I do, indeed.

1601
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:47,124
I should go check on her.

1602
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:49,665
Excuse me.

1603
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:59,082
I think you're being rude to Ike.

1604
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:02,082
I'm glad his feelings are so important.

1605
01:35:04,541 --> 01:35:06,374
I think I need to leave.

1606
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:10,749
You said you wanted to meet him.

1607
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:12,624
Besides we just got here.

1608
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,540
Why don't you leave me alone?

1609
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:26,415
My uncle, who you saw in passing,

1610
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:28,499
raised me

1611
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,915
because both of my parents
were killed in a car accident.

1612
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:34,499
Why are you telling me this?

1613
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:44,790
Because I want you to
contextualise my sadness.

1614
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:48,665
Put whatever you're going through
into perspective.

1615
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:52,040
My mom was pregnant at the time.

1616
01:35:52,666 --> 01:35:53,707
Seven months.

1617
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,040
I was on the news.

1618
01:35:57,375 --> 01:35:59,374
I'm telling you this
to hurt you right now,

1619
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,249
because you're trying
to make me feel bad,

1620
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:03,749
horrible even,

1621
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,499
which I don't appreciate.

1622
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:08,874
But I never will...

1623
01:36:09,541 --> 01:36:10,999
Because nothing ever feels bad

1624
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,249
once you learn
what that emotion is capable of.

1625
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:17,665
Now let's not make a big deal about it.

1626
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:19,332
I usually don't.

1627
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,249
But you really forced my hand on this.

1628
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:25,957
Do you know that expression?

1629
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:28,290
"Forced my hand"?

1630
01:36:29,666 --> 01:36:31,249
It's one of my favourites.

1631
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:57,207
- She seems difficult.
- She is. Very.

1632
01:36:58,208 --> 01:37:00,832
Well, you're putting her
in an ugly situation.

1633
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:02,832
What with you trying
to have two girlfriends.

1634
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,249
That's a tawdry way to phrase it.

1635
01:37:07,733 --> 01:37:11,665
You... You have one living in a house
that you share with her in the city

1636
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:13,540
and another one up here
that you're living with.

1637
01:37:14,666 --> 01:37:16,415
Yeah, I can see the appeal.

1638
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,374
I practically invented it.

1639
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,915
But I did it better than you.

1640
01:37:22,541 --> 01:37:24,415
Nobody hated me then.

1641
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:28,124
I could enjoy it. Until later, of course,
when it all came crashing down.

1642
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:32,165
But by then, I had
my escape all planned.

1643
01:37:32,291 --> 01:37:35,790
You see, you haven't put enough thought
into something as delicate as this.

1644
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:39,707
Ever since I was a teenager,
I wanted to fall in love with a French girl.

1645
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:44,082
I'm proud of you, boy.

1646
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:52,499
You'll find yourself
referring to this experience often

1647
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:56,332
when you opt to pull your head
out of your own ass and get back to work.

1648
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:58,957
Can you offer any suggestions
about what I should do until then?

1649
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:01,332
Well, I could.

1650
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,499
But this really belongs to you.

1651
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,374
You'll find a solution.

1652
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,749
I gave you the '25, by the way.

1653
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:12,082
Oh, thank you.

1654
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:17,499
The way I see it,
you have two possible scenarios.

1655
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:20,832
Either you abscond to France
with a girl you just met three months ago,

1656
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:22,749
thus becoming a cliché,

1657
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:26,124
leaving the city in disgrace
and your former life in shambles,

1658
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:30,790
or you'll return to your kind,
successful, tolerant,

1659
01:38:30,916 --> 01:38:34,374
and probably very attractive
girlfriend in the city.

1660
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,165
Immerse yourself in work,

1661
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:38,999
and become miserable for eternity.

1662
01:38:39,916 --> 01:38:42,999
Two fine options,
as far as you're concerned.

1663
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:45,457
You're lucky to have them already,
at your age.

1664
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,790
You're a good friend, Ike.

1665
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:58,249
It's an honour to say that I know you.

1666
01:39:00,666 --> 01:39:04,290
Don't make yourself any more miserable
than you need to be.

1667
01:39:04,416 --> 01:39:06,082
Leave that to the women you love.

1668
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,499
That's what they're
pretty much there for.

1669
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,624
In my experience.

1670
01:39:21,375 --> 01:39:24,457
I believe that I'll need to return home
to the city at some point.

1671
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:27,790
It's highly likely that I'll realise
I made a huge error,

1672
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:29,874
at which point I might try
to return to this place

1673
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,082
to see if you'd ever
still care about me.

1674
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:37,249
I'm fairly certain that what I just said
is exactly what's gonna happen.

1675
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:42,207
I can't believe you still think
that's your decision to make.

1676
01:39:43,041 --> 01:39:45,749
Just trying stuff out to see
what the right thing to do is.

1677
01:39:55,166 --> 01:39:56,665
Thank you.

'he found himself thinking back
on a quotation,

1698
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:54,999
'which he had hoped to one day use
as the opening of a novel,

Open the door. Let me show you.
Let me show you that you're wrong.

It's OK.

'alone in his isolated home

self-imposed exile.'

close with Ike,

and publication of several more novels,

invest so much of himself in anybody else,

to so much as consider emotional honesty,
