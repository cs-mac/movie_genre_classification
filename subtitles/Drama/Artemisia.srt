1
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:38,206
<i>Apointed finger... </i>

2
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:40,473
<i>drapery... </i>

3
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>a raised hand... </i>

4
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:46,478
<i>a leg which is not a leg, </i>
<i>but an arm... </i>

5
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:51,321
<i>a confused ballet</i>
<i>of gigantic bodies... </i>

6
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,792
<i>the sweeping movement</i>
<i>of the limbs... </i>

7
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,726
You should hang your head
in shame.

8
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,560
She is without a doubt...

9
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,428
the daughter of a painter.

10
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,433
Such behavior...

11
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,561
could compromise future commissions
from the Church.

12
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:56,041
The Cardinal would never be influenced
in his aesthetic judgments...

13
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,134
by a woman.

14
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,907
Even a saintly woman, like you.

15
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:06,342
You have much to learn,
but not here.

16
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:32,532
Raise the candles.
They're all wrong.

17
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,232
Move, Artemisia.

18
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,445
Like this, Master?

19
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:41,343
Yes, that's fýne.

20
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:45,214
Saint Cecilia, look up!
Look at Marco.

21
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:50,251
Marco, where's that
angelic smile of yours?

22
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,892
Just a little longer.
It's almost over.

23
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,138
You scared me, Fulvio!

24
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:48,112
- Some sea treasures for you.
- Get away!

25
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,445
All the colors you like.

26
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,479
There's red, silver.

27
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,818
There's blue and green!

28
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,970
Remember our marriage
by the sea?

29
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,350
Your breasts are growing!

30
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,120
Fulvio!

31
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:28,037
Shield in the left hand,
sword in the right.

32
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:36,747
That's fýne.
Now get undressed.

33
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:39,307
Draw the curtain for Artemisia.

34
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:50,228
I'll never get anywhere
if I can't paint naked men.

35
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:53,360
Artemisia.

36
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:57,967
It's the Papal Father,
not your father...

37
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,097
who forbids women
to paint male anatomy.

38
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:05,133
- I'm forbidden half of art!
- You want to go to jail?

39
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,611
Or send your father there?

40
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:11,206
Lower the sword. Lower it!

41
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,785
You're killing a lion.

42
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,014
We don't have one, so pretend.

43
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:20,893
Roberto, prepare my pigments.

44
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,557
Artemisia, what are you doing?

45
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,064
Stop!

46
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,835
Finish your painting by yourself.

47
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:47,843
Painting is hardly
a suitable activity for a woman...

48
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,286
but my son insisted.

49
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:54,019
I have agreed to let Artemisia
do his portrait.

50
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,824
Artemisia will be very honored.

51
00:11:57,897 --> 00:11:59,558
Won't you?

52
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,727
And what better way
to get acquainted?

53
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,896
If my husband agrees...

54
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,703
the payment will be part
of her dowry.

55
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,049
Can he pose naked for me?

56
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,893
Excuse her. She doesn't know
what she's saying.

57
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,590
She's become very diffýcult...

58
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:35,065
since her mother died.

59
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,863
I told you about painters!

60
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,280
If I let you kiss me...

61
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,951
could I then ask a favor of you?

62
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,354
If you like.

63
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,302
Kiss me then.

64
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,666
Undress.

65
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,607
Take off your pants.

66
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,645
Everything. That too.
That white thing...

67
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,019
breaks the flow of your body.

68
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,462
This is only for drawing?

69
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:43,155
Look how the back muscle...

70
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,561
crosses your side...

71
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:47,861
and joins your thigh muscles.

72
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:51,293
It's less visible in girls.

73
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,270
- Really?
- Yes.

74
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,273
Show me.

75
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,037
Don't move. Let me do this.

76
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:04,412
These are the studios.

77
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:19,025
No, that's something else.

78
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,690
Here it is.

79
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:27,439
You've outdone yourself.

80
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:31,043
Very impressive.

81
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,203
It's vivid...

82
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,179
forceful.

83
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,011
It's superb.

84
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,816
Your sense of color is unrivaled,
Gentileschi.

85
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,090
I am honored.

86
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:50,652
I'm surprised that you chose silver
for the armor.

87
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:55,060
I posed in gold armor.

88
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:59,298
But this portrait is ideal...

89
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:03,741
and timeless and perfectly balanced
in terms of color.

90
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,603
Moreover, the silver sets off
your true stature.

91
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:11,275
It makes you seem taller.

92
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:17,320
I seem to remember
having suggested the change myself.

93
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,657
Undoubtedly. Your advice
was always helpful to my work.

94
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:27,257
Deliver it to me by Friday.

95
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,292
I'm having a party
and I want the portrait there.

96
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:35,173
Remember to replace
the silver with gold.

97
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:43,175
For him, color means matching
his stockings and breeches!

98
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,774
He doesn't know what color is!

99
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:48,445
For whom do we work, my child?

100
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,818
I paint for myself.

101
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,918
I paint for those who buy my paintings.
There's more at stake than talent.

102
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,793
Under his hideous gold paint...

103
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:02,095
is our silver,
our magnifýcent silver.

104
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,493
He's painting outdoors.

105
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,798
Doesn't he have a studio?

106
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,377
To the right!

107
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:47,571
Perfect. That's fýne.

108
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:58,118
He's painting the world.

109
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,684
He's outside,
but he's looking out a window.

110
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:13,335
Hurry! We're not in Florence.
Paint dries faster.

111
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:20,309
He uses a white undercoat
to bring out the light.

112
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,313
It's a simple technique.

113
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,042
Batiste!

114
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,050
That's enough for today.

115
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,988
Let's pack up.
Aaron, get the boats.

116
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:39,030
Fisherman, come help us.

117
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,813
This green, Master?

118
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,318
Very nice.

119
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,098
What is she doing out there?

120
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,430
- She's drawing.
- Drawing what?

121
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:53,199
Why draw in a fýeld,
like a peasant?

122
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,770
It's the latest fashion in Florence,
or so she says.

123
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,674
Tassi must have arrived.

124
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:02,646
I'll send him a note
to welcome him.

125
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,343
We have to be
very friendly with him.

126
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,332
He reproduced...

127
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,003
every crease...

128
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,410
every wrinkle.

129
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:38,973
A Biblical character...

130
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:42,349
with wrinkles and defects
doesn't please everyone.

131
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:46,686
Caravaggio has had problems
because of that.

132
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,421
He shows us a beheading...

133
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:52,464
as if it were like slicing bread.

134
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:55,967
Quiet. We say too much
in front of paintings.

135
00:20:57,469 --> 00:21:02,065
You should be grateful that
he makes us want to surpass him.

136
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,406
I think she's a prodigy.

137
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:10,582
She betters all the others
in my studio.

138
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,920
The Academy does not accept girls.

139
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,421
I said she paints like a man.

140
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,018
Lost your way, cutie?

141
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,259
What brings you here?
Waiting for your boyfriend?

142
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:32,933
No recommendation
is higher than that...

143
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,973
of Orazio Gentileschi, but...

144
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:46,473
Let me introduce myself.
Orazio Gentileschi.

145
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:50,847
I know your work, sir.
And I admire it.

146
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:53,254
Yes, I know you too.

147
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:56,556
And if you're a student here,
it's thanks...

148
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,188
to these.

149
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,960
Make sure you don't lose them!

150
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:14,472
Look what he's doing.

151
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,748
I want to adjust the light!

152
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:21,650
She wants to be able
to raise and lower it.

153
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:26,282
Knot them so I can undo them
from inside.

154
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,536
He'll never allow this.

155
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:43,472
Put that there.
The rack goes there.

156
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:46,474
He'll make you
take it all down.

157
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:21,342
<i>A vigorous consistency</i>
<i>of flesh and blood. </i>

158
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:25,144
<i>A whiteness which opens out</i>
<i>to the limits... </i>

159
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:28,675
<i>where its fragility vanishes. </i>

160
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,925
Too skinny!

161
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:52,635
I've prepared full-scale drawings.

162
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,804
We don't need models.

163
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,510
Gentileschi, you know
the central composition is mine.

164
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:02,644
The Pope put me in charge
of the project.

165
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:05,952
I was chosen for it fýrst.

166
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:09,357
Are we talking about the past
or the future?

167
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:13,459
We'll do an excellent job, Orazio.

168
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:18,933
Tassi and Gentileschi
will be considered great artists.

169
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:23,168
And only the greatest
of connoisseurs will recognize...

170
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:26,678
that Tassi was a little greater
than Gentileschi.

171
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:29,441
Tassi and Gentileschi?

172
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:33,542
I think I'll survive
this collaboration.

173
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,648
Come to the bordello.

174
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:39,952
We'll get a girl
and share the work, like here.

175
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:43,886
Her knickers.

176
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:50,765
Painting signs by day
and sinning by night!

177
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:54,135
I'll leave the night work to you.

178
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:11,751
- He stole my angels.
- I know.

179
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:15,385
I was supposed to do the angels
and two saints.

180
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,291
What can I do?

181
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:20,024
He steals your work
from under your nose!

182
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:25,468
We're lucky we didn't lose
the entire commission for the frescoes.

183
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,506
Tassi has powerful friends
in the Church.

184
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:32,874
They say he's a master
of perspective.

185
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:37,211
Maybe we'll learn something from him.

186
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:41,013
We mustn't lag behind
the latest innovations.

187
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:46,520
See if he can do the nave
and leave the vaults for us.

188
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:55,300
He's too long.
It looks ridiculous.

189
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,028
It's deliberate.

190
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:02,134
High up on the wall
of the church...

191
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:04,869
it will look normal.

192
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:07,377
Look.

193
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:14,011
Look from here.
It seems less long.

194
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:20,751
It must be like when you look
between your legs.

195
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:25,126
It's smaller than when you see it
in a mirror.

196
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:33,300
I don't spend my days
in front of mirrors.

197
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:36,466
What would you know?
Aren't you a virgin?

198
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,670
Agostino, look.

199
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,618
I'm looking for Mr. Gentileschi.

200
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:27,152
He's not here.

201
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,086
You'd make a good model...

202
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:33,563
but I'd have to see you up close.

203
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:40,201
Aren't frescoes made
to be seen from this distance?

204
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,206
True!

205
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,605
Don't tire yourself.

206
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:45,506
I pose only for myself.

207
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:47,238
A girl who paints?

208
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:51,504
What courage,
to try painting yourself.

209
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,742
But it's a lost cause!

210
00:27:57,222 --> 00:28:01,682
Who is talented enough
to render such beauty?

211
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:07,923
Tell Mr. Gentileschi
I fýnished his drawings.

212
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,134
And who are you?

213
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:12,067
His daughter.

214
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,230
As long as the Pope trusts me...

215
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:23,706
God Himself will be your client.

216
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,505
Don't worry.

217
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:46,482
Get your master!

218
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:50,078
I thought you were a pupil.

219
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:52,656
That's no way to treat people!

220
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,991
First I mistook you for a model...

221
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:59,053
now for a boy.

222
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,621
And also perhaps...

223
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,827
for a ghost at my window.

224
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:11,204
I'll forgive you
if you forgive me.

225
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:19,405
Show me one of your paintings,
chameleon child.

226
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,284
Come to my studio.

227
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,293
Your studio?

228
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:49,869
- This is your father's work.
- It's mine.

229
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:52,883
My face painted by me.

230
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,747
There you are.

231
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,916
Artemisia has lured you
into her web.

232
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,689
- He asked to see my work.
- He's a gentleman.

233
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:08,223
Shall we dine?

234
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:19,000
Take me as your pupil!
You must!

235
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,097
My father has taught me all he can.
The Academy won't take me.

236
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:01,043
The Academy didn't see these...

237
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:03,939
I suppose.

238
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:09,386
Nor has your father.

239
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:17,884
You chose to share
your secrets with me?

240
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:27,699
Should I be your professor
or confessor?

241
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,778
One Gentileschi is hard enough.

242
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:47,418
No, I will not and I cannot.

243
00:35:58,736 --> 00:36:00,931
I'll surpass you one day.

244
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,175
You'll come and ask
to be my pupil.

245
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,141
What did you say to Tassi?

246
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:52,145
He said you provoked him.

247
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,452
I told him the truth.

248
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:59,827
That I'm a good enough painter
to be his pupil.

249
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:01,957
You have to be nice to him.

250
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:06,197
Now that I've persuaded him
to take you as a pupil.

251
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,345
- Where are you going?
- To my lesson!

252
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,040
Wait until tomorrow, Misia.

253
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:20,346
- I'll go with her.
- No, Marisa can.

254
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:23,682
You'll mind the house
while I work at the church.

255
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:13,067
Greet our guest
with words of welcome.

256
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:16,864
Come in. They're harmless.

257
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:26,341
You've come with an assistant.

258
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:31,120
Am I supposed to open a school?

259
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,720
I can't paint with you watching.

260
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:19,802
Take your material.
We'll try something else.

261
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,325
What do you see there?

262
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:52,733
A ship.

263
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:54,738
A ship. What else?

264
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:58,467
Ships don't inspire me much.

265
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,670
Try. Make an effort.

266
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:04,338
I can't draw outdoors.

267
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:07,680
Without characters,
it's like drawing a void.

268
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:10,015
- A void?
- Yes.

269
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:52,527
Look at things in a new way.

270
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:55,225
I'm not used to so much light.

271
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:56,857
Start over.

272
00:40:56,934 --> 00:41:00,392
Don't keep doing what you know.
Start over.

273
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,350
Enough for today.

274
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,300
Who's that charming thing?

275
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:34,065
- You must have braved heaven and hell.
- Hell suffýced.

276
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,067
- You fled without saying good-bye.
- There was no need.

277
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:42,909
What I needed to say was this:
Go away!

278
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,914
Let me stay with you.

279
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:47,610
- I don't love you.
- I can accept that.

280
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:51,014
Pass me off as your sister.

281
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,225
My dear, sweet sister.

282
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:06,060
This is Costanza...

283
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:07,729
my sister.

284
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:12,709
Take good care of her.

285
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:16,235
Give her the love
a brother can't give.

286
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,350
More earth, less sky.

287
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:35,356
Good.

288
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,365
You cut the world in pieces?

289
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,544
You've always painted your subjects
from up close.

290
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:54,413
But the world is vast.

291
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:58,214
Relations between things
are more complex.

292
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:06,559
The frame gives order
to our vision of the landscape.

293
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,924
Cutting up the canvas like this...

294
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:13,402
gives us the exact relations.

295
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:23,512
Look how many faraway things...

296
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:26,015
are contained
in the squares above...

297
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,950
and how few things
are in those below.

298
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:34,451
All I see is land and water.

299
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:39,453
You're not looking.
Close your eyes.

300
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,556
I'm to learn painting
with my eyes shut?

301
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:45,568
- You're some teacher!
- Close your eyes.

302
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:48,396
Trust me.

303
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,457
The earth invades the composition.

304
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:18,927
It occupies...

305
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:22,972
almost all of the center.

306
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:29,142
It pushes the sky up
to the upper two-thirds.

307
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:38,579
On the horizon...

308
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:42,949
the earth circumscribes the water.

309
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,960
It holds it back.

310
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,225
The water itself is...

311
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:51,826
deep green in the distance,
bluer near us.

312
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:55,263
And the sun.

313
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:03,570
The sun dances on the water,
forming a mirrored path...

314
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,912
which comes to meet us
wherever we are.

315
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:12,288
Open your eyes now.

316
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:15,223
Yes, the water is changing color.

317
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:22,864
And the sun is a mirrored path
coming towards us. It's true!

318
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:24,867
Well...

319
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:26,630
now...

320
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:30,265
we can add your characters,
if you insist.

321
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:31,865
Who?

322
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:36,779
I can see the sun!

323
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:09,206
How's that?

324
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:12,212
Why don't you ask her?

325
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,811
What's wrong?

326
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:18,121
I want to work on color.

327
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:20,157
I can't teach you color.

328
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:22,953
Why not?
I'm willing to learn!

329
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:24,619
You know as much as I.

330
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:34,595
It was mean not to have
told me before.

331
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:38,232
Do I stay like this?

332
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:41,945
Yes, that's just fýne.

333
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:24,845
How do you capture
such physicality without knowing...

334
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:26,889
what the body is capable of?

335
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:30,919
I never said I didn't know.

336
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:36,157
Who was the model for your nudes?

337
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,202
Would you pose for me?

338
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,678
I don't mean naked.

339
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,181
Marisa!

340
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:55,251
Find something to clean.

341
00:47:58,255 --> 00:48:01,281
Go sweep the beach!

342
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:41,063
Lie down.

343
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,830
Let your head hang off the side.

344
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:56,007
Now lift your hands
to push Judith away.

345
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:13,222
Pretend you're fýghting me off.

346
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,243
It's time to go.

347
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:28,497
Calm down.

348
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,176
Let yourself go.

349
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,565
I'm hurt.

350
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,130
I'm sorry, Artemisia.

351
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:13,608
I didn't know.

352
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:15,611
I thought...

353
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:41,701
You've taken over my mind
like no one before.

354
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:43,706
I love you.

355
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:16,138
We have to go.

356
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:41,297
Yes, madame! Here I am!

357
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:43,526
Misia, I need you.

358
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,534
Yes, Father. I'm coming.

359
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:51,852
<i>The exalted lover... </i>

360
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:55,997
<i>held the young woman against him. </i>

361
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:59,866
<i>He entered her and embraced her... </i>

362
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:03,929
<i>in the confused mixture</i>
<i>of forms and dreams. </i>

363
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:06,737
<i>Such faraway material... </i>

364
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:10,610
<i>so miraculously near now. </i>

365
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,563
Batiste...

366
00:58:18,642 --> 00:58:21,406
your master is a great artist.

367
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:25,104
I'm very happy I like his work.

368
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:28,444
It saves me from having to lie.

369
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,724
I have some new drawings for you.
You'll like them.

370
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:43,732
You have to keep them coming.

371
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,134
These images lose
their power quickly, unlike art.

372
00:58:57,614 --> 00:59:00,913
He's found <i>"</i>art"
with the Gentileschi girl.

373
00:59:02,686 --> 00:59:05,621
Her power doesn't seem
to wear off.

374
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,193
She's the reason
Agostino won't see me.

375
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:22,035
I don't intend
to beg for his respect.

376
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,770
- See you tomorrow?
- What if my father...

377
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:05,713
He'll fýnd it strange
if you don't come. Tomorrow.

378
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:10,618
Do they mention
the shared commission with Tassi?

379
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,348
I wanted to tell you...

380
01:00:12,455 --> 01:00:15,322
Has this made me
lose face in Rome?

381
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:18,759
It's in the past.
It's almost forgotten.

382
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,955
But some people claim...

383
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:24,057
that you're sharing
more than the frescoes.

384
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:26,932
That's untrue.
I don't share in his depravity!

385
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,938
They say that Artemisia...

386
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:33,601
He's her teacher
and she's never painted better.

387
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:38,944
But she works only for my studio,
not for his.

388
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:42,542
They refer to more
concrete things between them.

389
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:47,821
Dirty gossip.
They're jealous of a girl...

390
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:50,223
who has the talent of a man.

391
01:00:50,293 --> 01:00:54,525
Besides, she has a chaperon,
and he's an honest man.

392
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:57,225
Don't listen to that nonsense.

393
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,394
I'm thrilled to hear it.

394
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:03,735
I brought the pigment you asked for.

395
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:06,275
Who says such things?

396
01:01:26,429 --> 01:01:28,397
Our Florentine friend...

397
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:30,660
what did he teach you today?

398
01:01:30,734 --> 01:01:32,668
Perspective.

399
01:01:35,071 --> 01:01:38,700
Lines converge towards
the horizon, like this.

400
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:55,054
You're tanned.

401
01:01:56,893 --> 01:01:59,657
We were outside,
painting the horizon.

402
01:02:01,898 --> 01:02:04,162
And you stayed in the shade?

403
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:06,168
I was under the parasol.

404
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:08,966
It protects the canvases.

405
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:40,802
Batiste...

406
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,804
your master isn't coming?

407
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,806
He doesn't tell us everything.

408
01:02:52,949 --> 01:02:56,077
You're going?
But the plaster will dry!

409
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:37,186
I didn't tell.

410
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:39,755
Father?

411
01:04:39,856 --> 01:04:42,290
He's gone.

412
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:43,950
Gone?

413
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:48,521
He says I'll go to jail
for helping Agostino!

414
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:11,278
Promise me
you didn't touch my daughter.

415
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:15,818
Promise me!

416
01:05:15,892 --> 01:05:18,622
Answer! Answer me!

417
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:26,067
I trusted you.
Tell me you didn't betray me.

418
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,470
You're my friend.

419
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:31,905
Agostino, tell me!

420
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:45,645
Why won't you answer, Tassi?

421
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:50,351
If you stole her from me,
you have to keep her and marry her.

422
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:54,362
The only way to save her
is to marry her.

423
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,366
You have to marry her!
You hear me?

424
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:04,431
You can't do this to me!

425
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,016
Coward!

426
01:07:39,469 --> 01:07:41,403
What have you done?

427
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:44,939
You let that man seduce you.

428
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:48,204
- I trusted you!
- I love him!

429
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:52,572
- And he loves me!
- He raped you!

430
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:54,741
No, he gave me pleasure.

431
01:07:54,817 --> 01:07:57,377
- Stop! Shut up!
- Leave her alone!

432
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:59,614
Talk to her! I can't.

433
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:09,022
If you tell them he raped you,
he'll have to marry you.

434
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:11,498
Tell them? Tell who?

435
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:14,563
Don't tell me what to do.

436
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:19,132
Sleeping with my father
won't make you my mother.

437
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,342
You...

438
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:26,177
You only want one thing.

439
01:08:26,249 --> 01:08:29,707
Everything for yourself.
Me and the frescoes!

440
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:38,977
A child of 15! His pupil!

441
01:09:39,088 --> 01:09:40,385
Not 15! 17!

442
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:43,653
Was she born in 1593 or 1595?

443
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:45,717
It's my money he wants!

444
01:09:46,596 --> 01:09:48,496
My commission for himself.

445
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:51,499
He's driven by jealousy!

446
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,559
I ask only that amends be made
for damage done...

447
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:58,903
to an honorable name
and to my daughter's reputation.

448
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:02,433
Ask Artemisia
if I ever hurt her!

449
01:10:02,512 --> 01:10:05,606
I love Artemisia. I love her.

450
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,941
And I've done her no harm.

451
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:12,220
Then why not marry her?

452
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:15,248
You'd have your beloved...

453
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:18,452
and a dowry
from Orazio Gentileschi.

454
01:10:18,528 --> 01:10:21,053
Don't sell me like that!

455
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,566
I'm a virgin.
I have no reason to be here.

456
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:27,369
Where is the crime then?

457
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:31,600
Help me to protect you.
I've done all this for you.

458
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:37,572
So?

459
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,835
She lost it a while ago.

460
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:41,843
How many times?

461
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:46,273
Anyway, she's no longer a virgin.
Far from it.

462
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:52,579
Mr. Gentileschi,
all you've proved up to now...

463
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:54,986
is that your daughter is a liar.

464
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:31,325
Why are you here?

465
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:43,500
My poor child, the man you love
has been evil since he was a child.

466
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:47,241
Take your seat.

467
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,155
You may speak.

468
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:10,223
I've come alone from Florence...

469
01:13:10,299 --> 01:13:14,133
to say things which, till now,
I've only said to God.

470
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:22,866
My brother is a wicked person...

471
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:25,505
who must be stopped.

472
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:27,071
Continue.

473
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:33,649
I've come to spare Gentileschi
and his daughter.

474
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:37,387
My brother has a wife in Florence.

475
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:41,385
A legal wife?

476
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:45,264
She left me of her own free will
three years ago.

477
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:50,799
He shamed her by having relations
with her younger sister.

478
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:53,706
Slander!

479
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:56,768
You ran away,
but we remember in Florence.

480
01:13:56,846 --> 01:13:58,814
Next witness.

481
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,640
Artemisia.

482
01:14:02,752 --> 01:14:05,243
This is slander, Artemisia!

483
01:14:07,256 --> 01:14:09,156
It was never proved.

484
01:14:09,225 --> 01:14:10,749
Quiet!

485
01:14:12,061 --> 01:14:13,824
And you protect him.

486
01:14:13,896 --> 01:14:15,363
Artemisia, never!

487
01:14:19,101 --> 01:14:22,593
- A liar.
- All this for you.

488
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:26,102
The young painter girl.

489
01:14:29,445 --> 01:14:31,504
You need a defense.

490
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,878
I won't let you spoil your life.

491
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:36,577
Nothing will stop Orazio.

492
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:40,121
Your sister revealed
your misbehavior in Florence.

493
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:44,825
Your sentence may be severe.

494
01:14:46,128 --> 01:14:48,596
My friend...

495
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:50,689
here you are in prison.

496
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:54,131
Meanwhile, she is free...

497
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:56,228
to see whomever she wants.

498
01:14:56,305 --> 01:14:58,364
She's not worth it.

499
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,376
I can't bear to see you
in jail for her.

500
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:08,676
I'll say nothing against her.

501
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,894
We'll save him anyway.

502
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:14,668
Is there a window in your cell?

503
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:19,877
Tell me what you see from it.

504
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:24,175
Two hills.

505
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:27,747
One runs into the other.

506
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:31,786
On one side...

507
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:38,332
near the hill that's farther away...

508
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:42,163
I can see a tree.

509
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:47,900
Our eyes follow its branches
up to the sky.

510
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:51,939
Early in the afternoon...

511
01:17:52,014 --> 01:17:54,949
its dark green shadow...

512
01:17:55,017 --> 01:17:57,076
almost reaches a rock formation...

513
01:17:57,186 --> 01:18:00,485
<i>strikingly white... </i>

514
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:03,787
<i>a white too pure</i>
<i>ever to be painted. </i>

515
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:06,885
<i>It would seem to spurt</i>
<i>from the canvas. </i>

516
01:18:06,962 --> 01:18:08,827
<i>In the evening... </i>

517
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:12,025
<i>when the light begins to fade... </i>

518
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:15,468
<i>my hills become greenish</i>-<i>gray... </i>

519
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:17,698
<i>and lose their depth... </i>

520
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,532
<i>like paper cutouts. </i>

521
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:28,408
You hurt me.

522
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:32,452
You lied to me.

523
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:35,285
I lied in order to keep you.

524
01:18:36,358 --> 01:18:39,191
I'd do anything to keep you.

525
01:18:40,462 --> 01:18:44,125
Orazio is the cause of our problems.

526
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,463
He never lied to me.

527
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:49,231
And your past is not his doing.

528
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:54,407
If only I could erase it all.

529
01:18:58,113 --> 01:19:01,173
You're part of me now.

530
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,048
That cannot be erased.

531
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:08,823
I love you.

532
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:37,551
<i>Legs spread, muscles taut. </i>

533
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:41,953
<i>Twisted faces upside down. </i>

534
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:43,992
<i>An arm stretches out. </i>

535
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:47,153
<i>A fist is raised. </i>

536
01:19:47,229 --> 01:19:51,188
<i>A round breast</i>
<i>escapes from a corset. </i>

537
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:53,598
<i>A sword strikes... </i>

538
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:56,729
<i>cutting with all its edge. </i>

539
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:59,137
<i>An eye stares. </i>

540
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,267
<i>And the color red... </i>

541
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:03,470
<i>erupts onto the canvas. </i>

542
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:16,880
Here are 20 drawings by Artemisia.

543
01:20:16,992 --> 01:20:20,689
All of them depict male genitalia.

544
01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:22,753
Ladies, avert your eyes.

545
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:26,767
Souvenirs, perhaps,
of 20 lovers.

546
01:20:26,835 --> 01:20:28,393
In any case...

547
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,735
proof of her knowledge
of the things of flesh.

548
01:20:31,807 --> 01:20:34,833
And a violation of divine law!

549
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:38,875
I did those drawings
of the human body!

550
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:42,144
The human body
which God gave us!

551
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:43,775
He's lying!

552
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:47,788
It's not the work of a painter,
but of a woman.

553
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:49,790
Look.

554
01:20:49,858 --> 01:20:51,485
Artemisia!

555
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:03,997
She says she is virtuous...

556
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,006
and this is what she produces.

557
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:13,973
Artemisia sees herself
as a <i>"</i>Judith."

558
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:15,539
A criminal.

559
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:18,780
A traitor.

560
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:20,479
And Agostino...

561
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:26,717
as the victim of her scheming.

562
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:31,698
Artemisia and Agostino.

563
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:36,198
Who is the victim of whom?

564
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:37,966
Agostino...

565
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,565
will you stand up
and defend yourself...

566
01:21:40,642 --> 01:21:42,803
before it's too late?

567
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,778
Wake up.

568
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:55,418
Show them into my offýce.
I'll settle this.

569
01:21:57,926 --> 01:22:00,087
Let me go!

570
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:17,745
Tie her hands.

571
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:20,475
The truth.

572
01:22:20,549 --> 01:22:24,041
We will know the truth
that God alone knows.

573
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:26,552
Hands together,
as if for prayer.

574
01:22:26,622 --> 01:22:29,250
Pretend.
You're no stranger to that.

575
01:22:47,376 --> 01:22:51,107
Did Agostino Tassi rape you?

576
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,164
I love only you.

577
01:23:11,233 --> 01:23:13,167
Tighter.

578
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:29,077
Stop.

579
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:34,247
- She's suffered enough!
- I'll tear the truth out!

580
01:23:34,356 --> 01:23:38,486
I raped the virgin, Artemisia.
I took her by force...

581
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,927
and did it repeatedly,
promising to marry her.

582
01:23:41,997 --> 01:23:44,488
Punish me.
She doesn't deserve this!

583
01:23:46,468 --> 01:23:47,958
Untie her hands.

584
01:24:00,849 --> 01:24:02,783
What did I do?

585
01:25:13,922 --> 01:25:16,447
<i>Tassi of Florence... </i>

586
01:25:16,558 --> 01:25:20,255
<i>I declare you guilty of rape. </i>

587
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:23,058
<i>I sentence you to two years in jail. </i>

588
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:12,646
Artemisia, please.

589
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:19,786
We still have work to do together.

590
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,759
Should I help you
fýnish the frescoes...

591
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:31,264
or paint over his?

592
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,970
Don't worry about me, Father.

593
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:41,736
You gave me something
no one can take away.

594
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:43,937
You taught me to paint.

595
01:26:46,114 --> 01:26:51,609
No, I gave you the suffering you put
into your paintings, not the talent.

596
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:55,255
You made things easier for me.

597
01:26:55,323 --> 01:26:59,657
You blocked the paths that
might have diverted me from painting...

598
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:02,959
had I remained a respectable woman.

599
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:10,000
You've done a magnifýcent painting,
a powerful one.

600
01:27:12,974 --> 01:27:15,636
We say too much
in front of paintings.

601
01:27:42,904 --> 01:27:45,065
Take it down.

602
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,937
Excuse me?

603
01:27:48,009 --> 01:27:50,204
Take all this down!

604
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:15,269
Now, I have to forget her face.

605
01:29:06,254 --> 01:29:08,188
Your father wanted to save you.

606
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:13,385
If you leave, it will kill him.

607
01:29:18,366 --> 01:29:20,493
No one dies of sorrow.

608
01:29:22,604 --> 01:29:25,164
That's one thing I've learned.

609
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:30,303
You know I have to leave.

610
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:36,049
He knows it too.

611
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:38,997
<i>Two hills. </i>

612
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:44,144
<i>Two hills running into each other. </i>

613
01:31:45,213 --> 01:31:47,807
<i>Nearby, a single tree. </i>

614
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:53,450
<i>Our eyes follow it</i>
<i>up to the sky. </i>

615
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:55,614
<i>In the afternoon... </i>

616
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:58,055
<i>its dark green shadow... </i>

617
01:31:58,126 --> 01:32:01,186
<i>almost reaches a rock formation... </i>

618
01:32:02,197 --> 01:32:04,631
<i>whiter than anything. </i>

619
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:07,099
<i>Too white to be painted... </i>

620
01:32:07,168 --> 01:32:11,195
<i>for it would seem</i>
<i>to spurt from the canvas. </i>
