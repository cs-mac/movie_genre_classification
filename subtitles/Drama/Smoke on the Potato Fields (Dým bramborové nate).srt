00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,270
Episode 90
Bermes came out with a new purse!

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,350
Oh, this is the new item.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,070
The design is so lovely.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,750
What do I do?

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,550
What do you mean what do you do?
You improper married woman!

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,350
Get your head straight!

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,310
But it's so pretty.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,070
Should I buy this and stop? And think
that it's the last purse of my life.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,190
I heard you got fired from
your dad's company.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,590
And you have money to buy it?

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,070
Of course I don't. No money, and
no where to get money.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,390
But you're impressive! How'd you think
of biting your brother's ear?

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,830
You think I can think straight
when I'm pissed off?

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,590
Is there really no way?

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,030
Stop drooling and give up!

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,910
You'll be comfortable
once you give up.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,910
There's no way right?

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,790
Ah hah! There was that!
/ What's that?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,990
I thought of it! Where I
can get money.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,190
According to asteroid 2013 QR3,
Korea's astronomical observation

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,230
center's magnetic field will
be temporarily disturbed.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,030
On the 18th, a section of radiowave
communication may be hindered.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,910
What is she saying?

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,070
She's not saying anything hard.

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,510
Because of the potato star, there
can be a peak.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,350
More than a peak, she's saying there
could be a communication disturbance.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,110
Something like your
cell phone not working.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,550
You rascal, you didn't know either!

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,990
That's that! A peak and
your cell phone.

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,470
That something like that can happen.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,750
Wouldn't it be different? A peak is
electronic, and phones are radiowaves.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,830
That's enough. Just leave it alone.

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,150
Okay. / All right!

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,030
I'll ask him. Okay, hang up!

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,150
Why is Min-hyuk so late / I'm home!

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,590
Oh, you're here?
/ You came at a good time.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,270
Why? / You want to go on
a blind date?

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,590
She's the daughter of the president
of Min-guk company, and she's from UCLA.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,310
I don't want to.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,670
Why? Just meet her at least once?

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,750
Hearing about her, it's such a waste!

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,590
No, I don't want to.
/ Is there someone you're meeting?

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,590
There's no one like that.
/ Then why not?

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,550
He really...

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,430
Brother-in-law!

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,750
Sister-in-law! What brings you here?
With no call?

47
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,190
I just stopped by while in the
neighborhood.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,110
Yeah? Good, come in!

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,910
There's nothing going on?

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,670
No, there's nothing. I just wanted a
date with you!

51
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,390
Date? I like it! Let's go eat
something delicious.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,110
You're the best!

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,590
Sit there, wait a little. I'll finish
this quickly. / Take your time!

54
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,230
When is everyone coming?

55
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,310
Should we get some coffee? I'm tired
from coming in early.

56
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,350
Klimt is having an exhibition
in Korea.

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,910
What? Print?

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,910
Klimt is having an exhibition.
Gustav Klimt.

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,470
What's a klmit?

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,270
He's an artist! You dummy,
you don't even know that?

61
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,270
Oh, an artist?

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,310
Then we can go see it! I'll show it to
you. Where is it being held?

63
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,830
No thanks!
You don't even know his name.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,350
You said it's Klimt.
I just learned his name.

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,430
No thanks, the tickets are expensive
and we don't even have time.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,110
Brother-in-law! Why do I like
you so much?

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,350
I like you a lot, too!
The sushi earlier was good, right?

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,750
Yeah, it was so good!
I'm gonna come again next time!

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,390
Yeah, when your husband comes,
bring him. I'll buy.

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,390
Really? There's really no one
but my brother-in-law!

71
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,030
It's a department store!
Should we stop by?

72
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,870
A department store?
Do you have something to buy?

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,750
Nope! I just want to eye shop!

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,390
Are you busy? Then you can go first.

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,910
Okay! Then I'll leave. / I'm so happy
that I'm here with you.

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,990
I'm such a fool for you!

77
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,070
This purse is so pretty!

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,710
It's exactly my style!

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,470
I can't have these bags anymore, right?

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,430
I would've bought it if it was
before marriage.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,270
'Cause I'm not a poor
musician anymore...

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,390
[5 years ago]
Is it okay to get this much from you?

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,470
What do I do? I feel bad.

84
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,430
Well, it's been a while since
you've come to Korea.

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,390
I love you! You know that I like
you the most in this world!

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,390
This break, I came to Korea
to see you!

87
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,590
Yeah, thanks Sister-in-law.

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,630
Kim Do-san, get your head straight!
Don't fall for that expression!

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,430
Remember the hard time you had
'cause of the card debt!

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,670
Don't ever fall for it!

91
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,310
Yeah Sister-in-law, you're married now.
These bags...

92
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,110
Oh yeah! I forgot that I had an
appointment with a client later!

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,390
I'm sorry, I'll leave first.
Look around and go!

94
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,350
He didn't fall for it.

95
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,630
What do you mean what do I do?
I'll try it again.

96
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,910
Drink this. Oh! I heard Soo-young
came by your office earlier!

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,550
Yeah! Did Sister-in-law tell you?

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,030
No, I called earlier and your
assistant told me.

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,070
But why didn't you tell me?

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,270
Just... I forgot.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,990
Why did she go to your office all
of a sudden?

102
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,430
Is there something that brat
wants from you?

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,110
Be careful! Don't suffer like
that like before.

104
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,790
Honey, you think I'm stupid?

105
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,950
To suffer the same as before?

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,870
Mr. President!

107
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,510
Are you on your way to work?

108
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,230
Yes, I was on my way from getting
a lift lap. / Get in, I'll take you.

109
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,070
No, it's okay. There's a bus stop right
up... / Get in. You have luggage.

110
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,470
I'm on my way to work anyway, too.

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,790
Okay then...

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,910
What's that?

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,950
"Brother-in-law, have a great day!"

114
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,950
I'm so jealous.

115
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,670
Your sister-in-law is beautiful,
but her actions are pretty too!

116
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,190
I'm truly jealous. It's 'cause I
don't have a sister-in-law.

117
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,110
If I had a sister-in-law like this, I
would've given everything to her!

118
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,350
For sure, this is a maneuver.

119
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,070
If you look outwardly, it looks like
an extremely thoughtful gift.

120
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,710
But, it's actually really easy to
order this through the computer.

121
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,510
Sister-in-law is using a
maneuver on me.

122
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,510
"Sister-in-law"

123
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,310
Brother-in-law! Did you receive
what I sent you?

124
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,110
But Sister-in-law, why this
kind of stuff?

125
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,990
I'm so touched! Thanks!

126
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,950
Nah, it's not much!

127
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,990
Okay then, bye! / Brother-in-law!

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,590
Yeah? What?

129
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,990
I'm going to that area tomorrow,
but can you buy me dinner?

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,230
Dinner? / Yeah, are you busy?

131
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,310
Tomorrow, I have an appointment.
/ Aww, what?

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,270
I even sent you a gift!

133
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,590
Wow, I'm so sad!

134
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,750
The brother-in-law I liked the most in
the world is becoming 2nd place!

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,430
Ahhh, really? Then...
let's... get dinner!

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,550
Really? Wow, I'm so happy!

137
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,590
then I'll call you when I get
to that area. Okay!

138
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,550
Yeah, dinner should be okay.

139
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,590
But no more. Never. Don't go
against your opponent Kim Do-sang!

140
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,150
Are the public relations going well?

141
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,510
Yes. Because it's a college student
area, we're doing an event for them.

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,630
Something like finding
your fated partner.

143
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,870
And as a gift for applying
we're giving Kong Kong burgers.

144
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,870
Give the details to Team Manager Yoon.

145
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,190
So you're saying that it's going well?
/ Yes.

146
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,110
Do you believe in fate or soul mates,
too, Nah Jin-ah?

147
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,430
Girls believe that kind of stuff.

148
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,990
Yes. Two people being together
from many many people.

149
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,110
Honestly, I think that's a miracle that
occurs through a series of events.

150
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,630
There's that! That you'll meet
the person you'll meet.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,990
That's fate's / That's what girls!

152
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,990
Yes?

153
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,350
That's a a fairy tale
that girls believe.

154
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,750
Excuse me? / That's not fate,
that's probability.

155
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,670
Person A throws a dice and if six comes
out five times in a row, that'll be cool.

156
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,390
Saying, how can six come out five
times in a row?

157
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,350
But if there are thousands of people
throwing the dice like person A,

158
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,310
and if there's not a single person who
gets six five times like person A,

159
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,630
isn't that even more weird?

160
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,790
It's such an obvious result
of probability.

161
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,510
Those who believe in fate don't go
beyond the average in total.

162
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,830
Yeah...

163
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,710
How do you know so many delicious
places? Of course, you're the best!

164
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,150
Nah, eat a lot!

165
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,150
Eating steak is making me
want a glass of wine!

166
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,390
Shall we get a glass of wine each?
/ Wine?

167
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,430
Sure! Let's drink a little.

168
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,590
What is this? Wine in the
middle of the day?

169
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,230
Let's be careful. There's some
kind of plan.

170
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,470
Excuse me.

171
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,150
Father, should we fish here?

172
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,070
Sit down here.

173
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,990
It's great weather to fish. / Right?

174
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,350
Sister-in-law, aren't you drinking
too much? It's still early.

175
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,950
Wine is okay.

176
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,630
Brother-in-law...

177
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,990
Honestly, I'm having a hard
time these days.

178
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,510
What is?

179
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,750
Married life.

180
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,150
I did get married, but Jang-yool
goes to America right away.

181
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,110
I wondered to myself "what is this"
while sitting at the single room.

182
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,430
The sympathy card? It's finally begun.

183
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,790
Should I not have gotten married?

184
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,070
Was I too immature?

185
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,750
I think like this...

186
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,870
I can't even sleep at night.

187
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,350
Even though I try to sleep, I end
up staring at the ceiling.

188
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,950
Sister-in-law, why are you crying?

189
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,110
Oh, the crying card? That's too easy!

190
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,670
Now she's gonna talk about
not having money.

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,590
In order to get out of this
sadness,

192
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,510
if there was some small
thing of happiness,

193
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,390
something I can feel...

194
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,230
In my position, it's not like I can
enjoy what I want to enjoy...

195
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,630
Honestly...

196
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,790
I can't even buy the things I like...

197
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,150
Exactly. The blow is coming
out slowly.

198
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,590
Sister-in-law, even if you're like
that, I'm not the same Kim Do-sang!

199
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,990
I'm the upgraded Kim Do-sang!
You shouldn't do this.

200
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,030
Brother-in-law, you should've gone
against our marriage even more.

201
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,870
You should have stopped me till the end.

202
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,830
If you did, then I...

203
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,910
Sister-in-law.

204
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,830
I guess she's taking the crying card
a little longer.

205
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,510
If I don't do anything,
she'll continue to...

206
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,390
Okay, I have to backfire in order
to end this thing quickly.

207
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,390
Sister-in-law...

208
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,910
I'm having a hard time too.

209
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,750
Excuse me? Why?

210
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,870
People think if you're a lawyer,
you earn money so easily.

211
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,750
But honestly, there's no other job
as hard as a lawyer's job.

212
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,710
Because the economy's hard,
just to finish one job,

213
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,070
I have to endure and hear
all kinds of stuff!

214
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,950
Why am I like this?

215
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,350
What is this? Is he using
a maneuver?

216
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,270
And I hear all this cussing and
so many bad words!

217
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,230
Sometimes I get treated worse
than a bug!

218
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,270
Brother-in-law, you've upgraded.

219
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,590
No, who would treat you
worse than a bug?

220
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,950
Be strong!

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,030
There's stuff you don't know.

222
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,310
I don't want to talk about this
anymore. If you're done, we should go.

223
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,190
What is this? This backfire?
Noh Soo-young, concentrate!

224
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,390
What do I do? Think of a way to
get out of this critical situation!

225
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,870
What're you doing? Let's go.
/ Oh, yeah...

226
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,230
No, grab him
Brother-in-law!

227
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,710
Huh? / Just throw anything!

228
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,950
Oh yeah! Can I tell that thing to my sister?

229
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,870
That thing?

230
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,950
Yeah, that thing.

231
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,470
I threw it!

232
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,030
You threw it? / Yeah.

233
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,110
Isn't your bait too big?

234
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,190
The bait has to be big in order
to catch a big one.

235
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,030
But that's too big. / It has to be at
least this big to catch a big one.

236
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,230
What is that thing...?

237
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,310
It's nothing. Never mind.

238
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,910
That thing? Right at the end
of the game?

239
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,190
No, it's a bluff. Don't fall for
it Kim Do-sang.

240
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,390
I ate the steak well! Let's go.

241
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,390
Wait, Sister-in-law! / Yes?

242
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,110
Why do you stop mid-sentence?
Kim Do-sang! Ignore it! It's a bluff!

243
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,590
What?

244
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,030
That thing...what is it?

245
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,070
Don't get sucked in!

246
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,670
You know the best!

247
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,150
Am I falling for it?

248
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,150
Honestly, although I'm a girl,
I understand.

249
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,550
That can happen to you too...

250
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,430
Huh? What does that...?

251
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,950
Should we drink just one more
glass of wine?

252
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,830
It bit! It bit it!

253
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,870
We don't know yet, we should
wait a little more.

254
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,710
One more glass?

255
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,670
Nah, I want to go home, I'm tired.

256
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,750
What? You should finish something
you started.

257
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,310
What is that thing?

258
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,910
Why are you being like that?
You know everything.

259
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,590
Darn, what do I say? A bar? Warranty?
Emergency funds? A girl?

260
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,750
Brother-in-law, the four things a woman
can't handle of her husband are

261
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,110
bars, warranties, emergency
funds, and other women.

262
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,750
But Brother-in-law, how can you do
that? That's just too much...

263
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,070
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Let's talk next time.

264
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,390
So what? What about those things?

265
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,750
I have no idea what you're
talking about!

266
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,190
Wow, I'm starting to get mad.
I liked you the best.

267
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,950
But okay. Let's talk next time.
/ Sister-in-law!

268
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,990
Yes?

269
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,270
Since we're already out, should
I buy you a purse?

270
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,550
Yes? A purse?

271
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,950
Yeah! The one we saw at
the department store.

272
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,110
It looked like it'll look good on you.

273
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,190
Why? I don't need a purse.

274
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,350
No, just, it's 'cause
I want to buy it for you!

275
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,870
Please let me buy it for you. I want
to see you holding it.

276
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,750
Please, it's my wish!

277
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,630
Your wish?

278
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,390
It jerked!

279
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,390
It jerked, right?

280
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,470
You got it!!

281
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,390
You'll meet the person
you have to meet.

282
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,070
Why are you saying this nonsense
all of a sudden?

283
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,510
Do you believe that? The fated love
that comes out in dramas and movies.

284
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:16,230
Crazy. Movies and dramas are what
plant ridiculous fantasies in women.

285
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,590
Do you believe that stuff too?

286
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,830
Never.

287
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,990
But there are times when I wish
that it's true.

288
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,230
Are you talking about her?

289
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,270
If it were true,

290
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,110
if it were fate for me to come all
the way here to meet her,

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,830
what's the meaning of that fate?

292
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,870
Miss Nah Jin-ah?

293
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,870
Is there anything you're good at?

294
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,910
Why didn't you say that you were sick?

295
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,790
Because, I wanted to win it.

296
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,950
Mr. President? You were here?
At this hospital?

297
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,270
Who are you?

298
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,710
It's me, Nah Jin-ah.

299
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,510
It'll get caught by us.

300
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,510
It's Miss Nah Jin-ah.

301
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,550
If I get better after the surgery,

302
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,030
will you marry me?

303
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,790
Mr. President.

304
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,230
Am I now an official employee?

305
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,390
Congratulations, Miss Nah Jin-ah.

306
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,230
Thank you!

307
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,510
Driver Kim, drop me off here
and go home first.

308
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,830
Here?

309
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,670
Yes, Mr. President!

310
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,750
What are you doing?
Are you still at the office?

311
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,670
Yes? Yes.

312
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,990
Is everyone there?
/ No, I'm here alone.

313
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,990
Everyone left, and Hongb- I mean Jun-
hyuk went to Myungdong for an event.

314
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,350
Do you have a lot of work left?

315
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,070
No, I just need to send one more
email and I'm done.

316
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,550
Then...

317
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,470
you know Namsan tower?
Go there by 8.

318
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,150
The Namsan tower? Why-
/ I'll wait for you.

319
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,150
Brother-in-law! You didn't have to do
this! It's so expensive.

320
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,110
It's okay! Expensive?

321
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,910
Make it over 36 months...

322
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,830
If unni finds out, she'll get mad.

323
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,550
Keep it a secret from her.
About that too...

324
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,390
We got a big fish, a big fish!

325
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,110
Isn't it impressive?

326
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,030
Wow, there are even fish that
get caught by you!

327
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,950
Yeah!

328
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,190
Yeah, the more you look,
the stupider it looks!

329
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,750
That's why it gets caught by you!

330
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,190
What's wrong with this?!

331
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,630
What do I do?

332
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,230
The internet's not working!

333
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,070
But I have to send it...

334
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,350
Mr. President, there's a problem, so I
have to personally turn in the papers.

335
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,870
I'll be about 20 minutes late.
I'm sorry.

336
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,310
Because of Asteroid 2013 QR3's
sudden change,

337
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,190
radio wave connections are disturbing
internet connections,

338
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,670
as well as signal lights, causing
more traffic than usual.

339
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,350
Mr. President, I'm on my way to
mountain Nam,

340
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,790
but because of the traffic, I'll be a
little more late. I'm sorry.

341
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,190
I didn't receive a call.
Did you call?

342
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,470
It's probably because of the radio
wave disturbance from the potato star.

343
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,590
Okay, I'm on my way.
Oh!

344
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,870
You didn't get a call from Sister-in-law?

345
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,310
No, just cause. Okay!

346
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,470
I at least blocked it with a purse.

347
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,670
Yeah, although I lost money,
at least I blocked that.

348
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,110
Yeah...

349
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,070
But...

350
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,670
what did I block?!

351
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,110
What did...

352
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,390
I block...?

353
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,470
I'm sorry, but which way is it
to the Namsan tower?

354
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,950
You can go this way.

355
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,430
Mr. President, I'll be one hour late
'cause I don't know the way there.

356
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,030
I'm truly sorry. If you're not there,
I'll think that you left.

357
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,030
Excuse me, we're sorry but...

358
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,470
Okay, I'm taking it.

359
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,430
You could've at least counted 1 2 3.

360
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,670
You have a new message from
Nah Jin-ah.

361
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,670
Driver, wait! Just drop me off here!

362
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,470
Excuse me, all the signal
lights are broken from here on out.

363
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,030
All vehicles are being stopped
so we can't go any further.

364
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,710
If you cross the street, there's a
bus that goes back the other way.

365
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,150
So please use that bus, or
the subway.

366
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,350
I'm sorry.

367
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,550
Nah Jin-ah!

368
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,750
What are you doing here?
/ What about you?

369
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,870
Me? It just happened. You?

370
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,190
Me too, it just happened.

371
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,510
What a surprise!

372
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,510
But you don't even know Klimt. Why
are you staring at it? You know it?

373
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,550
I'm a Klimt expert.
He's my favorite artist.

374
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,550
Meeting at a place like here. I
guess it's our ill-fated relationship!

375
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,990
I was hungry anyway, should
we eat fishcakes on the way home?

376
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,190
Hyung!

377
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,870
Mr. President!

378
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,150
I arrived so late at Namsan Tower.
I'm sorry.

379
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,110
I contacted you, but
I couldn't reach you.

380
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,710
If there's something for me to do,
I can do it-

381
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,550
It's okay, I had someone else do it.

382
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,830
I'm sorry.

383
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,070
But you two met and came together?

384
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,110
No.

385
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,270
We met in the streets really
surprisingly.

386
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,070
The bus I was riding had to stop
because of the stop lights...

387
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,470
I think the fact that two people meet
together is the result of

388
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,830
many events, so it's like a miracle.

389
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,550
There's that saying: The person you'll
meet, you will meet no matter what.

390
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,870
That's fate working.

391
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,630
Come eat! You were sleeping so
well, so I didn't wake you.

392
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,070
Someone who didn't know what
sleeping in was, slept in!

393
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,030
Yeah, weird things are happening!

394
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,110
Eat this spicy soup!

395
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,470
I caught this yesterday. I caught one
as big as my arm yesterday!

396
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,230
Mom? / Yeah? What?

397
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,830
The blind date you were talking
about? / Yeah.

398
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,830
If it's not too late, I'll do it.

399
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,070
It's a little uncomfortable...
/ It's not comfortable.

400
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,750
I saw an article about you.
I wanted to meet you in person.

401
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,110
Anyway, it'll end with disappointment.
/ How can you think so rationally?

402
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,230
Honey, you can play like this too!

403
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,310
How was it? / Aren't you gonna
meet again?

404
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,710
We're watching a concert
on the weekend.

405
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,510
I don 't think it's a bad idea
to have a third child.

406
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,710
Okay! / You don't have anything
to do tomorrow, right?

407
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,270
Why tomorrow? / It's best to do it when
the man is at his healthiest.

408
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,870
I heard you're doing well with the
person you met. Congratulations.
