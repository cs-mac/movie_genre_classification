1
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,500
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,170
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,640
We're doomed.

5
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,270
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,070
What's that?

7
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,880
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,900
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,110
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,490
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,700
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,510
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,220
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,140
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,190
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,900
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,860
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,910
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:22,120
" FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun! "

21
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,920
There's one. Set for stun.

22
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,310
She'll be all right.

23
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,310
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

24
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,390
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

25
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,440
You'll be deactivated for sure.

26
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,030
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

27
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,780
Come out, before somebody sees you.

28
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,370
Secret mission? What plans?

29
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,080
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

30
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm going to regret this.

31
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,130
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

32
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,550
It must have short-circuited.

33
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,970
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

34
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,310
Are you sure this thing is safe?

35
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

36
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,683
The Imperial Senate will
not sit still for this.

37
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,490
When they hear you've
attacked a diplomatic...

38
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,630
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

39
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,630
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

40
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,840
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

41
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,810
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

42
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

43
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

44
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,980
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

45
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,020
Take her away!

46
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,860
Holding her is dangerous.

47
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,997
If word of this gets out,
it could generate sympathy...

48
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:16,705
for the rebellion in the senate.

49
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,980
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

50
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,750
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

51
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,750
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

52
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,500
Leave that to me.

53
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,090
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

54
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,300
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

55
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,840
and no transmissions were made.

56
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,140
An escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.

57
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,230
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

58
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,900
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

59
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,060
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

60
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,730
Yes, sir.

61
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,330
How did we get into this mess?

62
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,790
I really don't know how.

63
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,760
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

64
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,970
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

65
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,060
What a desolate place this is.

66
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,240
Where do you think you're going?

67
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,820
Well, I'm not going that way.

68
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,110
It's much too rocky.

69
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,620
This way is much easier.

70
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,120
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

71
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,620
Don't get technical with me.

72
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,960
What mission? What are you talking about?

73
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,380
I've just about had enough of you.

74
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,420
Go that way.

75
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,340
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

76
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,150
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

77
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,680
because you won't get it.

78
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,860
No more adventures.

79
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,950
I'm not going that way.

80
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,860
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

81
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,070
He tricked me into going this way...

82
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,080
but he'll do no better.

83
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,460
Wait. What's that?

84
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,290
A transport. I'm saved.

85
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,130
Over here!

86
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,840
Hey! Hey!

87
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,380
Help! Please help!

88
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,890
R2?

89
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,690
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

90
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,470
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

91
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,430
Look, sir. Droids.

92
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,410
We stopped.

93
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,290
Wake up. Wake up!

94
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,840
We're doomed.

95
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,140
Do you think they'll melt us down?

96
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,110
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

97
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,700
Will this never end?

98
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,530
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

99
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,110
Luke!

100
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,620
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a
translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

101
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,250
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

102
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,560
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

103
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,600
No, not that one.

104
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,350
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

105
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs...

106
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,860
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

107
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,700
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

108
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,830
I need a droid who understands the
binary language of moisture vaporators.

109
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,210
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

110
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,460
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

111
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,090
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

112
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,455
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

113
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,670
Luke!

114
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,800
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

115
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,810
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

116
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,230
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

117
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,810
Now come on. Get to it.

118
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,110
All right. Come on.

119
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,480
And the red one. Come on.

120
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,700
Come on, red. Let's go.

121
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,510
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

122
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,350
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

123
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,850
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

124
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,810
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

125
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

126
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,440
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

127
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,990
Take this away.

128
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,660
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

129
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,660
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

130
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Here he comes.

131
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,380
Okay. Let's go.

132
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,210
Don't you forget this.

133
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,800
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

134
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,220
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

135
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,310
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination, I can barely move.

136
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,020
It just isn't fair.

137
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,860
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

138
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,490
Is there anything I might do to help?

139
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,780
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

140
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,530
or teleport me off this rock.

141
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,200
I don't think so, sir.

142
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,330
I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

143
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,330
Not on this planet, anyway.

144
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,830
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

145
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,040
Well, if there's a bright center
to the universe...

146
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,380
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

147
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,420
I see, sir.

148
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,510
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

149
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,390
Just Luke.

150
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,230
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

151
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,980
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

152
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,100
Hello.

153
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,281
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.

154
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:39,260
Looks like you boys have seen
a lot of action.

155
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,530
With all we've been through...

156
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,880
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

157
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,620
what with the rebellion and all.

158
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,660
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

159
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,580
That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

160
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,580
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

161
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,580
There's not much to tell.

162
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,250
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

163
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,880
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

164
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,510
Well, my little friend...

165
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,680
you got something jammed
in here real good.

166
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,260
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

167
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,180
" Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope. "

168
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,890
What's this?

169
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,100
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

170
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:26,190
" Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope. "

171
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,000
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

172
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,410
Old data. Pay it no mind.

173
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,580
Who is she? She's beautiful.

174
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,050
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

175
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,300
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

176
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,380
A person of some importance, I believe.

177
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,890
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

178
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,220
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

179
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,100
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

180
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,850
" You're my only hope. "

181
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,860
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts...

182
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,740
and it's a private message for him.

183
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,860
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

184
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,950
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

185
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,700
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

186
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,960
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

187
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,710
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

188
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,250
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...

189
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,220
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

190
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,090
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

191
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,220
I wonder who she is.

192
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,220
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

193
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,270
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

194
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,190
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

195
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,030
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

196
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,240
Oh, yeah. Well...

197
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,830
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

198
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,120
Okay.

199
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,620
There you go.

200
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,500
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

201
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,590
"What message"?

202
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,010
The one you've just been playing.

203
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,260
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

204
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,680
Luke! Luke!

205
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,010
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

206
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,230
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

207
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,770
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

208
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,280
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

209
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,240
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

210
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,280
No, I don't like you either.

211
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,274
I think that R2 unit
might have been stolen.

212
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:43,870
What makes you think that?

213
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,880
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

214
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,470
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

215
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,350
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

216
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,640
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

217
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,520
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

218
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,530
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead
and have its memory erased.

219
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,690
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

220
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,070
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

221
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,280
He won't.

222
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,250
I don't think he exists anymore. He died
about the same time as your father.

223
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,460
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

224
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,590
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

225
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,630
In the morning, I want them on the south
ridge, working on those condensers.

226
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,800
Yes, sir.

227
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,640
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

228
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,100
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement...

229
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,980
about me staying on another season.

230
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,690
If these new droids work out,
I want to apply to the academy this year.

231
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,530
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

232
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,450
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

233
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,570
Harvest is when I need you the most.

234
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,700
It's only one season more.

235
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,950
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

236
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,330
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

237
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,290
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

238
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,300
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

239
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,460
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

240
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,050
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

241
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,930
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

242
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,390
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

243
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,520
It means so much to him.

244
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,600
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

245
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:29,230
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

246
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,530
That's what I'm afraid of.

247
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,870
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

248
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,750
Please don't deactivate me.

249
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,500
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

250
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,800
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

251
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,680
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

252
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,390
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

253
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,730
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

254
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,520
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

255
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,570
Blast it!

256
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,280
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

257
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,570
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople
around. We'll have to wait till morning.

258
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,660
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

259
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,700
I'll be there in a few minutes.

260
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,870
Boy, am I gonna get it.

261
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,962
That little droid's gonna cause me
a lot of trouble.

262
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,000
He excels at that, sir.

263
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,630
Come on.

264
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,610
Have you seen Luke this morning?

265
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,110
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

266
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,280
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

267
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,780
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

268
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,540
or there'll be hell to pay.

269
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,120
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

270
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,210
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

271
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,690
Where do you think you're going?

272
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,530
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

273
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,610
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

274
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,450
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

275
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,660
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

276
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,790
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

277
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,420
What's wrong with him now?

278
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,590
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

279
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,260
Sandpeople. Or worse.

280
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,840
Come on. Let's go have a look.

281
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,930
Come on.

282
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,390
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

283
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,270
Wait a second.

284
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,230
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

285
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,060
Hello there.

286
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,730
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

287
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,190
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

288
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,910
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

289
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,700
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

290
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,170
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

291
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,250
Boy, am I glad to see you.

292
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,380
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

293
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,100
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

294
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,430
This little droid.

295
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,110
I think he's searching
for his former master...

296
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,270
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

297
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,440
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

298
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,150
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

299
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,370
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

300
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,240
Obi-Wan.

301
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,170
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

302
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,750
A long time.

303
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,840
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

304
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,630
He's not dead.

305
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,930
Not yet.

306
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,010
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

307
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,470
He's me.

308
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,440
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

309
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,190
since, oh, before you were born.

310
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,900
Then the droid does belong to you.

311
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,650
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

312
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,990
Very interesting.

313
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,950
I think we better get indoors.

314
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,330
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

315
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,250
but they'll soon be back...
and in greater numbers.

316
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,460
3PO.

317
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,520
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

318
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,230
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

319
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,060
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

320
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,190
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

321
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,160
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?

322
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,160
Quickly. They're on the move.

323
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,830
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

324
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,670
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

325
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,880
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

326
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,930
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

327
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,680
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

328
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,980
I wish I'd known him.

329
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,810
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

330
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,610
and a cunning warrior.

331
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,230
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

332
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,240
And he was a good friend.

333
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,410
Which reminds me...

334
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
I have something here for you.

335
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,250
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

336
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,040
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

337
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,000
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...

338
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,550
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

339
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,590
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

340
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,260
Sure. Go ahead.

341
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,350
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

342
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,730
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

343
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,650
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

344
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,900
An elegant weapon...

345
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,990
for a more civilized age.

346
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,240
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights...

347
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,290
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

348
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,120
before the dark times...

349
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,920
before the Empire.

350
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,880
How did my father die?

351
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,890
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

352
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,560
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

353
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,640
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

354
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,900
He betrayed and murdered your father.

355
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,940
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

356
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,910
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

357
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,580
The Force?

358
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,330
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

359
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,540
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

360
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,210
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

361
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,340
It binds the galaxy together.

362
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,970
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

363
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,310
and where you come from.

364
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,560
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

365
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,980
" General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars. "

366
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,530
" Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire. "

367
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,740
" I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person. "

368
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,700
" But my ship has fallen under attack... "

369
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,127
" and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed. "

370
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,460
" I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion... "

371
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,620
" into the memory systems of this R2 unit. "

372
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,540
" My father will know how to retrieve it. "

373
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,510
" You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan. "

374
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,840
" This is our most desperate hour. "

375
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,970
" Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope. "

376
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,990
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

377
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,530
Alderaan?

378
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,490
I'm not going to Alderaan.

379
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,950
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

380
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,460
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

381
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

382
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,680
I can't get involved. I've got work to do.

383
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,300
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

384
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,970
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

385
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,980
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

386
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,940
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

387
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,730
Learn about the Force, Luke.

388
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,120
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

389
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,200
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

390
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,420
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

391
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,600
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

392
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,850
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

393
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,850
They're more dangerous than you realize.

394
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,850
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...

395
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,650
not to this battle station.

396
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,360
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

397
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,150
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

398
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,030
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

399
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,790
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

400
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,870
That's impossible.

401
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,315
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

402
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:38,880
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

403
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,260
Fear will keep the local systems in line.

404
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,470
Fear of this battle station.

405
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,720
And what of the rebellion?

406
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,060
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

407
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,100
it is possible, however unlikely...

408
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,310
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

409
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,650
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

410
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,030
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

411
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,110
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

412
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,830
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

413
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,250
I suggest we use it.

414
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,580
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

415
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,090
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

416
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,000
next to the power of the Force.

417
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,550
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

418
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,300
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

419
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,180
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

420
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,350
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

421
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,190
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

422
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,030
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

423
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,580
As you wish.

424
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,870
This bickering is pointless.

425
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,750
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

426
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,920
by the time this station is operational.

427
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,760
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

428
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,310
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

429
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,775
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

430
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:22,150
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

431
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,150
These tracks are side-by-side.

432
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,410
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

433
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,370
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

434
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,660
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

435
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,250
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

436
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,880
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

437
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,300
If they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to...

438
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,390
and that would lead them back... home.

439
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,770
Wait, Luke.

440
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,850
It's too dangerous.

441
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,840
Uncle Owen.

442
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Aunt Beru.

443
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,170
Uncle Owen.

444
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:22,060
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

445
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,400
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

446
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,150
You'd have been killed too...

447
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,950
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

448
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,740
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

449
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,490
There's nothing for me here now.

450
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,580
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

451
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,640
Mos Eisley spaceport.

452
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,520
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

453
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,980
We must be cautious.

454
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,230
How long have you had these droids?

455
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,490
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

456
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,490
Let me see your identification.

457
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,870
You don't need to see his identification.

458
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,330
We don't need to see his identification.

459
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,950
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

460
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,000
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

461
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,540
He can go about his business.

462
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,880
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

463
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,550
Move along. Move along.

464
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,030
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

465
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,530
Go on, go on.

466
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,580
I can't understand how we got by those
troops. I thought we were dead.

467
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,000
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

468
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,340
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

469
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,380
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

470
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,300
Only watch your step...
this place can be a little rough.

471
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,140
I'm ready for anything.

472
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,390
Come along, R2.

473
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,450
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

474
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,490
Your droids... they'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here.

475
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,040
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

476
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
I heartily agree with you, sir.

477
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,260
I'll have one of those.

478
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,170
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

479
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,720
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

480
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,390
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

481
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,310
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

482
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,350
This little one's not worth the effort.

483
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,713
Come, let me get you something.

484
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,840
I'm all right.

485
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,720
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

486
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,690
I don't like the look of this.

487
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,080
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

488
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,380
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

489
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,790
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

490
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,670
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium Falcon?

491
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,380
Should I have?

492
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,640
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

493
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,930
I've outrun imperial starships.

494
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,020
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

495
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,270
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

496
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,110
She's fast enough for you, old man.

497
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,070
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers...

498
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,990
myself, the boy, two droids...

499
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,080
and no questions asked.

500
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,160
Is it some kind of local trouble?

501
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:42,460
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

502
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,630
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

503
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,670
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

504
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,260
10,000, all in advance.

505
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,310
10,000?

506
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,140
We could almost buy our own ship for that.

507
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,480
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

508
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,650
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot.

509
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,150
We don't have to sit here and listen...

510
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:09,110
We can pay you 2,000 now...

511
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,490
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

512
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,450
Seventeen?

513
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,410
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

514
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,000
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

515
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,290
Ninety-four.

516
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,340
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

517
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,010
All right. We'll check it out.

518
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,320
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

519
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,860
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

520
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,990
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

521
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,120
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

522
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,540
Going somewhere, Solo?

523
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,790
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

524
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,130
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

525
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:08,130
It's too late.

526
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,630
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

527
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,840
Jabba's put a price on your head so large

528
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,640
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...

529
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,310
I'm lucky I found you first.

530
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,600
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

531
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,270
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

532
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,520
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba...

533
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,320
Jabba's through with you.

534
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,780
He has no time for smugglers...

535
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,470
who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

536
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:40,490
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

537
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,710
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

538
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,920
Over my dead body.

539
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,130
That's the idea.

540
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,210
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

541
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,760
I'll bet you have.

542
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,440
Sorry about the mess.

543
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,870
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

544
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,370
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

545
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,040
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

546
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,380
What course shall we set?

547
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,880
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

548
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,590
What do you mean?

549
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,640
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

550
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,220
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

551
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:45,430
Lock the door, R2.

552
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
Check this side of the street.

553
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,320
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

554
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,870
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

555
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,080
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

556
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,420
You watch your language.

557
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,010
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

558
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,430
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

559
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,510
It'll be enough.

560
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,160
Solo, come out of there, Solo!

561
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,290
Right here, Jabba.

562
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,040
I've been waitin' for you.

563
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,340
Have you now.

564
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,340
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

565
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,430
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

566
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,180
Why haven't you paid me...

567
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,100
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

568
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,730
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come see me yourself.

569
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,190
Don't send one of these twerps.

570
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,610
Han, I can't make exceptions.

571
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,610
What if everyone who smuggled for me

572
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,200
dropped their cargo at the first sign

573
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,910
of an Imperial starship?

574
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,330
It's not good business.

575
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,790
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

576
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,500
You think I had a choice?

577
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,380
But I got a nice, easy charter.

578
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,510
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

579
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:44,390
Han, my boy, you're the best.

580
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,510
So, for an extra twenty percent...

581
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,770
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

582
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,730
Okay, fifteen percent.

583
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,730
But, if you fail me again...

584
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,900
I'll put a price on your head so big,

585
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,990
you won't be able to go
near a civilized system.

586
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,410
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

587
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:06,850
Come on!

588
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,670
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

589
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,280
What a piece of junk.

590
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,910
She'll make .5 past light speed.

591
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,780
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

592
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,870
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

593
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,870
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

594
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,960
Hello, sir.

595
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,140
Which way?

596
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,140
All right, men, load your weapons.

597
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,360
Stop that ship. Blast them.

598
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Chewie, get us out of here!

599
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,170
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

600
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,150
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers are hotter than I thought.

601
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,830
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

602
00:55:59,835 --> 00:56:02,028
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

603
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,500
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

604
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,660
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

605
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,000
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

606
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,630
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

607
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,090
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

608
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,220
Here's where the fun begins.

609
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,100
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

610
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,100
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

611
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,850
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

612
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,900
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

613
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,440
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star...

614
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,150
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

615
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,610
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

616
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,660
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

617
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,970
We've entered the Alderaan system.

618
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:20,940
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

619
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,690
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

620
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,240
Charming to the last.

621
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,820
You don't know how hard I found it...

622
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,820
signing the order to terminate your life.

623
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,780
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

624
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,040
Princess Leia, before your execution...

625
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,330
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

626
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,420
that will make
this battle station operational.

627
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,340
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

628
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,170
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

629
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,930
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

630
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,760
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

631
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:59,890
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

632
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,100
that'll be destroyed first.

633
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:06,730
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

634
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,610
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

635
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,700
on your home planet of Alderaan.

636
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,450
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

637
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,870
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

638
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:20,200
Then name the system.

639
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,460
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

640
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,210
Where is the rebel base?

641
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,380
Dantooine.

642
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,840
They're on Dantooine.

643
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,310
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

644
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,270
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

645
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,520
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

646
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,060
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

647
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,740
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

648
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,240
Commence primary ignition.

649
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,770
Are you all right? What's wrong?

650
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,350
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

651
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,650
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

652
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,690
and were suddenly silenced.

653
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,440
I fear something terrible has happened.

654
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,410
You'd better get on with your exercises.

655
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,370
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

656
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,450
I told you I'd outrun them.

657
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,500
Don't everybody thank me at once.

658
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:54,010
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

659
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,560
Now be careful, R2.

660
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,530
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

661
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,780
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

662
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,240
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

663
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:25,910
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's
arms out of their sockets when they lose.

664
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,210
Wookiees are known to do that.

665
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,750
I see your point, sir.

666
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,510
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

667
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:57,610
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

668
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,700
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

669
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,700
But it also obeys your commands.

670
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:12,170
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are
no match for a blaster at your side, kid.

671
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,550
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

672
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,800
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

673
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,800
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

674
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,140
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

675
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,600
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

676
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,810
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

677
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:32,770
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

678
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,730
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

679
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,110
This time, let go your conscious self...

680
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,160
and act on instinct.

681
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,700
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

682
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,250
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

683
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,970
Stretch out with your feelings.

684
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,570
You see? You can do it.

685
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,320
I call it luck.

686
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,030
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

687
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,370
Good against remotes is one thing.

688
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,450
Good against the living,
that's something else.

689
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,580
We're coming up on Alderaan.

690
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,630
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

691
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:43,130
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

692
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:49,890
Yes?

693
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,980
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

694
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,980
They found the remains of a rebel base...

695
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,440
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

696
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,900
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

697
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,490
She lied. She lied to us.

698
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:07,280
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

699
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,410
Terminate her immediately.

700
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,460
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

701
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,300
What the...

702
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,590
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower...

703
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,090
some kind of asteroid collision.

704
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,510
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

705
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,930
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

706
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,270
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

707
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,190
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

708
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,980
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

709
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,280
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

710
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,940
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

711
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,790
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

712
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,160
It's an imperial fighter.

713
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,790
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

714
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,101
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

715
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:02,050
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

716
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,260
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

717
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,720
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

718
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,810
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

719
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,560
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

720
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,560
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

721
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,940
He's heading for that small moon.

722
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,570
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

723
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,240
That's no moon.

724
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:34,700
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

725
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,460
I have a very bad feeling about this.

726
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,420
Turn the ship around.

727
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,760
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse.

728
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:53,760
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

729
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:57,730
Why are we still moving towards it?

730
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,730
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

731
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,400
There's gotta be something you can do.

732
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,230
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

733
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,897
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

734
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,950
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

735
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,720
" Clear Bay 327. "

736
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,180
" We are opening the magnetic field. "

737
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,700
To your stations. Come with me.

738
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:59,750
" Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields. "

739
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,420
Yes?

740
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,500
" We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system. "

741
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,420
" Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. "

742
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,340
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

743
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,510
She may yet be of some use to us.

744
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,860
" Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9.
Release charge. "

745
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,110
There's no one on board, sir.

746
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,990
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

747
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,580
It must be a decoy.
Several escape pods have been jettisoned.

748
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,620
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

749
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,595
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

750
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:48,170
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

751
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,510
Yes, sir.

752
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,170
I sense something...

753
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,720
a presence I've not felt since...

754
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:59,850
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

755
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,820
There's no one here.

756
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,830
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

757
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:25,040
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

758
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,330
This is ridiculous.

759
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,960
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

760
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,380
Leave that to me.

761
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,510
Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that.

762
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:37,090
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

763
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:50,360
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

764
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,440
All right. Let's go.

765
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,130
Hey, down there.

766
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,800
Could you give us a hand with this?

767
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,640
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

768
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,810
TK-421, do you copy?

769
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,780
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

770
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:03,010
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

771
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,210
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

772
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:08,520
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

773
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,400
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

774
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,520
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

775
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:28,210
He's found the controls to the power beam
that's holding the ship here.

776
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,170
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

777
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,500
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

778
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:38,630
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

779
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:44,640
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

780
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,140
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

781
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:52,100
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

782
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,150
They must be delivered safely...

783
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:57,440
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

784
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:00,860
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

785
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:06,410
The Force will be with you...

786
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:07,910
always.

787
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,720
You said it, Chewie.

788
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,220
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

789
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,850
Ben is a great man.

790
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,890
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

791
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,020
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

792
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,440
Who do you think...

793
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,770
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

794
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,440
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

795
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,150
Who? Who has he found?

796
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,990
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

797
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,780
- Princess?
- Where is she?

798
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,790
Princess? What's going on?

799
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:57,000
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

800
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,470
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

801
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:07,550
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

802
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,100
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

803
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,100
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

804
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:15,060
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

805
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:18,440
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

806
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,980
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

807
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:24,660
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

808
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:27,830
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

809
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,740
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

810
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,840
She's rich.

811
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,840
Rich?

812
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:48,550
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

813
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,430
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

814
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,520
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

815
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,690
- You'll get it.
- I better.

816
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,270
You will.

817
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:59,820
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

818
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,900
- All right.
- What's your plan?

819
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,400
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

820
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:08,370
Okay.

821
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,990
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

822
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,330
Okay, Han, you put those on.

823
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,880
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

824
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,380
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

825
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:24,720
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

826
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,640
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

827
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,760
That isn't very reassuring.

828
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:55,700
" 517 to scan control.
517 to scan control. "

829
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,440
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

830
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:58,560
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

831
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,640
I did say so before.

832
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,830
Where are you taking this... thing?

833
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,670
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

834
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,920
I wasn't notified.

835
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I'll have to clear it.

836
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,890
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

837
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,150
Look out.

838
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:14,010
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

839
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:16,300
Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.

840
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:18,390
I'll hold them here.

841
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,940
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

842
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,230
" What happened? "

843
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,230
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

844
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,650
but everything's perfectly all right now.

845
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:33,990
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

846
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:36,740
- How are you?
" - We're sending a squad up. "

847
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,910
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

848
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:44,920
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

849
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,580
" Who is this? What's your operating number? "

850
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,470
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

851
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,650
Aren't you a little short
for a Stormtrooper?

852
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,530
Oh, the uniform.

853
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,030
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

854
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,103
You're who?

855
01:16:17,104 --> 01:16:19,391
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

856
01:16:19,395 --> 01:16:21,515
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

857
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,600
Come on.

858
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,580
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

859
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:31,670
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

860
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:35,590
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

861
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:38,140
Surely he must be dead by now.

862
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,640
Don't underestimate the Force.

863
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,980
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

864
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,400
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

865
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,400
Yes.

866
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,980
" We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23. "

867
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,200
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

868
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,990
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

869
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,910
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

870
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:07,500
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

871
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,340
Get behind me. Get behind me.

872
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:32,520
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

873
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:38,450
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

874
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,070
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

875
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:45,790
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
" - Yes, sir? "

876
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,370
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

877
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,790
What was that? I didn't copy.

878
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,340
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

879
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,970
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

880
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,300
All other information on your level
is restricted.

881
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,970
Open up in there. Open up in there.

882
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,640
Oh, no.

883
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,350
There isn't any other way out.

884
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,110
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

885
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,965
This is some rescue.
When you came in here,

886
01:18:18,996 --> 01:18:20,770
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

887
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,870
He's the brains, sweetheart.

888
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:24,700
Well, I didn't...

889
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:29,370
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

890
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,380
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

891
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:41,880
Get in there!

892
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:46,050
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

893
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,600
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

894
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,100
Wonderful girl.

895
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,440
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

896
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,900
Get in there.

897
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,050
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

898
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,590
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

899
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,390
Let's get out of here.

900
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,810
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

901
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,020
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

902
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:39,360
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

903
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,400
Absolutely, Your Worship.

904
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,970
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

905
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,950
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

906
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,240
It could be worse.

907
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,080
It's worse.

908
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,250
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

909
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,130
Something just moved past my leg.

910
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,880
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

911
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,030
Kid! Luke!

912
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,550
Grab hold of this!

913
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:45,050
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

914
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:47,890
- Where?
- Anywhere!

915
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,130
Help him!

916
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,210
- What happened?
- I don't know.

917
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,130
It just let go of me and disappeared.

918
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:35,180
I got a bad feeling about this.

919
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:44,440
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

920
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,950
Help me.

921
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,340
Wait a minute.

922
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:14,430
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

923
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,180
" 3PO! "

924
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:19,310
" Where could he be? "

925
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,690
Take over. See to him.

926
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:29,650
Look, there.

927
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,450
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

928
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,450
If you hurry, you might catch them.

929
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,040
Follow me.

930
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,790
You stand guard.

931
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,340
Come on.

932
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,930
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

933
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:04,150
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

934
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,810
All right.

935
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,700
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

936
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:22,080
3PO.

937
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,000
- Get on top.
- I can't.

938
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,000
Where could he be? 3PO.

939
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,210
3PO, will you come in?

940
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,220
They aren't here.
Something must have happened to them.

941
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,510
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

942
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:42,770
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

943
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,400
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

944
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:56,110
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

945
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,990
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

946
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,040
I forgot. I turned it off.

947
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,340
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

948
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,920
- We've had some problems.
" - Shut up and listen to me. "

949
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:16,760
" Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy? "

950
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:23,640
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

951
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:26,480
" No, shut them all down.
Hurry! Oh, no. "

952
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:39,450
What?

953
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:42,410
You did great, 3PO!

954
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:44,870
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

955
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,960
Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough.

956
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,340
It's all my fault. My poor master.

957
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,000
We're all right. You did great!

958
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,800
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number... Where are we?

959
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,260
" 3 2 6 3 8 2 7. "

960
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,600
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

961
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:51,560
Let's get moving.

962
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,940
Where you goin'?

963
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,530
Wait! They'll hear!

964
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:00,450
Come here, you big coward.

965
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,200
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

966
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,830
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

967
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:08,750
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

968
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,580
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

969
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:15,340
I take orders from just one person... me.

970
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:17,970
It's a wonder you're still alive.

971
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:21,260
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

972
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,640
No reward is worth this.

973
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,770
Give me regular reports, please.

974
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:36,940
Right.

975
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:42,410
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

976
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,450
You seen that new VT-16?

977
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:52,000
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

978
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,000
They say it's quite a thing to see.

979
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,090
What was that?

980
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:59,420
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

981
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:06,470
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

982
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,640
" Yes, sir. "

983
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,600
- Are you safe?
" - For the moment. "

984
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,060
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

985
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,650
We're right above you. Stand by.

986
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,530
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

987
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:20,610
Nice. Come on.

988
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:25,910
It's them. Blast them.

989
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,910
Get back to the ship!

990
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:30,950
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

991
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,750
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

992
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,650
I think we took a wrong turn.

993
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,530
There's no lock.

994
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,540
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

995
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:17,790
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

996
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,670
They're coming through.

997
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,690
Here, hold this.

998
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,090
Here they come.

999
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:14,020
For luck.

1000
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:24,150
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1001
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,000
Where could they be?

1002
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,630
Close the blast doors.

1003
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,230
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1004
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:19,370
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1005
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,830
The circle is now complete.

1006
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,130
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1007
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,590
Now I am the master.

1008
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:28,670
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1009
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,280
Your powers are weak, old man.

1010
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,030
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1011
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,500
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1012
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,010
You should not have come back.

1013
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,370
Didn't we just leave this party?

1014
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,370
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1015
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:42,960
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1016
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,170
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1017
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:00,890
Look.

1018
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,560
Come on, R2. We're going.

1019
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:09,360
Now's our chance. Go!

1020
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:43,180
Come on!

1021
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,400
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1022
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,570
" Run, Luke, run. "

1023
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,851
I hope that old man got
the tractor beam down,

1024
01:33:03,882 --> 01:33:05,990
or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!

1025
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:39,450
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1026
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:42,950
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1027
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:54,130
I can't believe he's gone.

1028
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,550
There wasn't anything you could have done.

1029
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,640
Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.

1030
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,740
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1031
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:33,710
Here they come.

1032
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:53,560
They're coming in too fast!

1033
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:05,410
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1034
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,950
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1035
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,640
Got him. I got him!

1036
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:35,150
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1037
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,110
There's still two more.

1038
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:14,520
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1039
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,320
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1040
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:27,740
Are they away?

1041
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:30,200
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1042
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:34,290
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1043
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,880
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1044
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,880
This had better work.

1045
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:42,210
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1046
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,010
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

1047
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:48,430
That doesn't sound too hard.

1048
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:52,180
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1049
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:55,060
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1050
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,980
Not this ship, sister.

1051
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:00,730
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1052
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:03,280
What's so important? What's he carrying?

1053
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,570
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1054
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:09,870
I only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.

1055
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:13,330
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1056
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:16,790
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1057
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:19,750
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1058
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:22,050
You needn't worry about your reward.

1059
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:25,050
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1060
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:30,140
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1061
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:33,470
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1062
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,060
I care.

1063
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,320
So...

1064
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,320
what do you think of her, Han?

1065
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,280
I'm trying not to, kid.

1066
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:50,410
Good.

1067
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:56,750
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1068
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:01,920
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me...

1069
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,900
No.

1070
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:53,470
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1071
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:55,470
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

1072
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,560
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1073
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,640
It's our only hope.

1074
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:24,460
- Yes.
" - We're approaching the planet Yavin. "

1075
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,880
" The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side. "

1076
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,960
" We are preparing to orbit the planet. "

1077
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:40,060
The battle station is heavily shielded...

1078
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,600
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1079
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:48,400
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1080
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:53,740
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1081
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:59,290
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1082
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:03,960
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1083
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,040
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1084
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,170
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1085
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:13,340
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1086
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,140
The approach will not be easy.

1087
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:19,390
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1088
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:22,100
and skim the surface to this point.

1089
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:25,650
The target area is only two meters wide.

1090
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:29,400
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1091
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,860
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1092
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:36,700
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1093
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,990
which should destroy the station.

1094
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:42,620
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1095
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:45,870
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1096
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,130
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1097
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:52,010
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1098
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:54,510
They're not much bigger than two meters.

1099
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:57,760
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1100
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:08,610
" Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. "

1101
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:12,990
" The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes. "

1102
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:15,700
This will be a day long remembered.

1103
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,780
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1104
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:20,450
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1105
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:28,630
" All flight crews, man your stations. "

1106
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:38,050
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1107
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,140
That's right. Yeah.

1108
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,850
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1109
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:48,020
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1110
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,730
Why don't you come with us? You're
pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1111
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:54,820
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

1112
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,570
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1113
01:41:57,650 --> 01:42:00,450
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1114
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:02,950
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1115
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,000
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1116
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,000
It's more like... suicide.

1117
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:13,630
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1118
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:16,380
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1119
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:17,840
Hey, Luke.

1120
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:23,510
May the Force be with you.

1121
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:33,230
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1122
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:40,110
" All pilots to your stations. "

1123
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,290
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1124
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,880
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1125
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,510
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1126
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:00,970
I only wish Ben were here.

1127
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:10,980
" Open main launch tubes. "

1128
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:13,900
" Main launch tubes opening, sir. "

1129
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,650
Hey, Luke!

1130
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:18,940
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1131
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:21,110
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1132
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,530
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1133
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:27,120
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1134
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,620
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1135
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:33,830
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1136
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,840
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1137
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,670
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1138
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,760
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1139
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:49,560
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1140
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,810
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1141
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:53,940
You okay, R2?

1142
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,980
Good.

1143
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:00,780
" Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure. "

1144
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:04,450
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1145
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,330
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1146
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:59,670
" Luke, the Force will be with you. "

1147
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:15,230
" Standby alert. Death Star approaching. "

1148
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:18,480
" Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes. "

1149
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:33,830
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1150
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:36,170
" - Red Seven standing by. "
- Red Three standing by.

1151
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:39,000
- Red Six standing by.
" - Red Nine standing by. "

1152
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,130
- Red Two standing by.
" - Red 11 standing by. "

1153
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,170
Red Five standing by.

1154
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:46,430
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1155
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,680
" We're passing through the magnetic field. "

1156
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:55,560
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.

1157
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,100
" Double front. "

1158
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,900
Look at the size of that thing.

1159
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:04,610
" Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed. "

1160
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:10,740
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1161
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:13,700
" - I copy, Gold Leader. "
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1162
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:17,250
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1163
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:34,970
" - Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees. "
" - I see it. Stay low. "

1164
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,940
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1165
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:49,490
" Luke, pull up! "

1166
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:53,490
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1167
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:03,380
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1168
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,380
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1169
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,590
Get the crews to their fighters.

1170
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:12,049
Watch yourself.
" There's a lot of fire coming... "

1171
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,040
" from the right side of
that deflection tower. "

1172
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,390
I'm on it.

1173
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:18,930
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1174
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:27,070
I've got a problem here.

1175
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,570
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1176
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,820
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1177
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:38,000
" The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes. "

1178
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:44,500
" Luke, trust your feelings. "

1179
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,970
Squad leaders...

1180
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:56,100
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1181
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:58,140
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1182
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:59,930
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

1183
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:02,230
- Pick up your visual scanning.
" - Here they come. "

1184
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,190
You've got one on your tail.

1185
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:13,430
I'm hit!

1186
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:17,410
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1187
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:21,160
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1188
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:24,880
I'll be right there.

1189
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:40,520
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1190
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:47,060
" - Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke. "

1191
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:49,530
" Fighters above you, coming in. "

1192
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:58,490
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1193
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:00,740
" Hang on back there. "

1194
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:03,500
" Red Six, can you see Red Five? "

1195
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:06,000
" There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you? "

1196
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:07,540
I can't shake him.

1197
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:13,090
I'm on him, Luke.

1198
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,930
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1199
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,730
- Thanks, Wedge.
" - Good shooting, Wedge. "

1200
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:30,940
" Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run. "

1201
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:35,150
" I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. "

1202
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:39,870
Stay in attack formation.

1203
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:42,790
" The exhaust port is marked and locked in. "

1204
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:55,130
" Switch all power
to front deflector screen. "

1205
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:01,600
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1206
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:04,930
" Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers. "

1207
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,850
" Death Star will be in range
in five minutes. "

1208
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:13,030
Switch to targeting computer.

1209
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:17,490
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1210
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:21,990
The guns. They've stopped.

1211
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,250
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1212
01:50:26,330 --> 01:50:28,830
" They're coming in. Three marks at 210. "

1213
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,960
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1214
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:34,340
Yes, sir.

1215
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,310
- It's no good. I can't maneuver.
- Stay on target.

1216
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:53,320
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1217
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:56,030
Loosen up!

1218
01:50:59,030 --> 01:51:01,910
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1219
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:04,370
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1220
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:13,340
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1221
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:15,340
Should I have your ship standing by?

1222
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:18,300
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1223
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:20,880
I think you overestimate their chances.

1224
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:23,600
" Rebel base, three minutes and closing. "

1225
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:26,220
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1226
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:28,020
" Rendez-vous at mark 6.1. "

1227
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:31,650
" - This is Red Two flying toward you. "
- Red Three standing by.

1228
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:33,690
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1229
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:36,440
" Keep half your group out of range
for the next run. "

1230
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:39,150
" Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three. "

1231
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:42,570
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1232
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,250
This is it.

1233
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,920
We should be able to see it by now.

1234
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:02,380
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1235
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,560
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1236
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:09,640
" - No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35. "
- I see them.

1237
01:52:11,190 --> 01:52:12,270
I'm in range.

1238
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,270
Target's coming up.

1239
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:19,990
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1240
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,450
Close up formation.

1241
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,950
Almost there.

1242
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,300
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1243
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,340
I can't hold them.

1244
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,460
It's away!

1245
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:56,440
" - It's a hit!
- Negative. "

1246
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,610
Negative. It didn't go in.

1247
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:01,360
" It just impacted on the surface. "

1248
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:09,490
" Red Leader, we're right above you. "

1249
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,750
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

1250
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:14,790
" Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine. "

1251
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:17,840
" Get set up for your attack run. "

1252
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:33,810
" Rebel base, one minute and closing. "

1253
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,100
" Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. "

1254
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:39,570
" We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back. "

1255
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:41,780
Right with you, boss.

1256
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:44,150
At that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1257
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,240
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1258
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:55,830
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1259
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:58,500
" My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port. "

1260
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:00,040
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1261
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:05,550
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1262
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:06,930
What about that tower?

1263
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:09,430
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1264
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:19,440
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1265
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:30,410
" Fighters coming in .3. "

1266
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:41,840
" - I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge. "

1267
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,420
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1268
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:47,420
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1269
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:52,600
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1270
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:59,480
R2, try and increase the power.

1271
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:06,110
" Hurry up, Luke. Quick. "

1272
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:08,150
Quick.

1273
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,750
" Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing. "

1274
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:18,960
I'm on the leader.

1275
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:23,920
Hang on, R2.

1276
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:41,900
" Use the Force, Luke. "

1277
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:47,150
" Let go, Luke. "

1278
01:55:48,610 --> 01:55:50,990
The Force is strong with this one.

1279
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:53,030
" Luke, trust me. "

1280
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,040
" His computer's off. "

1281
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,250
" You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong? "

1282
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:05,000
" Nothing. I'm all right. "

1283
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:19,180
" I've lost R2. "

1284
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:25,560
" The Death Star has cleared the planet. "

1285
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:28,230
" Rebel base in range. "

1286
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,240
You may fire when ready.

1287
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:32,400
" Commence primary ignition. "

1288
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:47,840
I have you now.

1289
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,420
What?

1290
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:54,950
Look out.

1291
01:57:01,730 --> 01:57:04,560
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1292
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:17,450
" Stand by. "

1293
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:29,880
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1294
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:35,760
" Remember, the Force
will be with you always. "

1295
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:03,000
I just knew you'd come back.

1296
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:05,620
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1297
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:07,670
I knew there was more to you than money.

1298
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:09,630
Oh, no.

1299
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:12,170
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1300
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:15,720
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1301
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:19,050
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1302
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:22,060
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1303
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:24,140
He'll be all right.
