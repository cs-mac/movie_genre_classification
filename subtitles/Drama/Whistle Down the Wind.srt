1
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,570
Come on, then.

2
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,011
That's it.

3
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,895
Come on, where are you?

4
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,539
But He did come to me
and He did comfort me.

5
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,969
I was alone. I needed help.

6
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,774
In His infinite goodness,
He reached out and gave me help,

7
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,617
even though I'd sinned,

8
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,778
even though I'd turned my back on Him
and renounced His word.

9
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,415
Friends, He came to me, not I to Him.

10
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,894
And He is with me forever.

11
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,898
And I will dwell in His house forever.

12
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,129
- 'Ey up, want a kitten, Jackie?
- No, I've got one.

13
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,811
- Want another?
- No.

14
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,898
# All our sins and griefs to bear

15
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,968
# What a privilege to carry

16
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,218
# Everything to God in prayer

17
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,979
# Oh what peace we often forfeit... #

18
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,534
- Do you want a kitten?
- Do I want what, love?

19
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,298
A kitten, it's not dead.

20
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,252
That's very kind but I don't think
I can take your kitten.

21
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,415
We can't have 'em at home
and Eddie keeps trying to drown them

22
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,610
and she keeps having more, you see.

23
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,128
Oh dear. I am sorry.

24
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,536
Me dad doesn't want 'em
so Eddie keeps putting them in a sack.

25
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,059
Oh dear.

26
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,093
Jackie doesn't want it either,
so do you want it or don't you?

27
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,290
Charlie!

28
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,135
Do you see? So, if you believe in Jesus,
He'll take care of it.

29
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,011
Come on, our Charles!

30
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,492
- Now shut that!
- Our Charles is coming, Dad.

31
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,498
I don't care who's coming,
go back and shut it.

32
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,334
Shut the gate.

33
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,450
Shut it.

34
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,293
I shut it. I shut the gate, Dad.

35
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,490
He shut it, Dad.

36
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,174
- What have you been up to, then?
- Nothing.

37
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,530
- Do you want any help, Dad?
- No, I don't need your help.

38
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,170
Come here.

39
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,408
What have you got under your coat?

40
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,735
- Me pully.
- I don't mean that.

41
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,852
You know what I mean and don't
be so clever. What is it?

42
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,050
Something I found.

43
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,455
Are you sure I can't help you, Dad?

44
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,848
Go on, get on.

45
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,378
You don't go far, I've your tea ready.

46
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,257
Yes, Auntie.

47
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,614
Did he ask you? What d'you tell him?

48
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,457
- Nothing.
- Did you tell him a lie?

49
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,492
- I told him nothing.
- Come on, then, quick.

50
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,329
- Have you been at my traps again?
- No, we haven't, see.

51
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,618
No, well you'd better not
else I'll tell your dad, then you'll cop it.

52
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,051
- Cost me good money, them traps.
- We haven't been near your rotten traps.

53
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,853
And I'll tell me dad
that you pinch his paraffin.

54
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,491
Close it.

55
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,368
Hurry up or we'll get old trap face in here.

56
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,011
Let's find a place to put them.

57
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,096
Over there.

58
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,256
We'll find you a place.

59
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,450
Ooh, the box.

60
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,570
Put some stuffing in.

61
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,736
Right, come on, then.

62
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,613
There, that's a good... Come on.

63
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,656
Yours looks poorly.
I think it wants its mother.

64
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,658
- Do you want your mother?
- Shut up, yours wants...

65
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,975
Yours... Yours wants its mother.

66
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,009
What shall we call them, Kathy?

67
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,211
I don't know.

68
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,216
We'll have to think.

69
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,091
I'm gonna call mine Spider.

70
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,937
You can't call a cat Spider.

71
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,210
I can call it anything I like.

72
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,410
You're daft. You're soft in your head.

73
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,931
When mine grows up, I'll teach it
to hate yours and it'll eat it all up.

74
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,335
- Don't.
- Oh, shut up, you two.

75
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,372
And listen, you're not to say nowt.

76
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,572
You're not to breathe it to our Aunt Dolly
or she'll tell me dad.

77
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,009
That's it. Let's put 'em in, then.

78
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,620
That's it. Come on, then.

79
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,733
And don't keep running in
and out of here, else they'll know.

80
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,489
Who's going to look after them, then?

81
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,019
Jesus.

82
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,857
Don't talk wet.

83
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,099
Yes He will, then,
because that woman told me.

84
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,928
- What woman?
- The woman in the Sally Army.

85
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,019
I asked her to look after it
and she said Jesus'd look after it for me.

86
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,814
- What does she know about it?
- She knows cos she lives in His house.

87
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,658
How can she when He's dead?

88
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,691
Ooh, our Kathy.

89
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,856
Well, what's up? He is, isn't He?

90
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,928
Well fancy saying. You'll have
something terrible happening now.

91
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,019
Yes, you just wait till Jesus
comes and gets you.

92
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,528
I'm not bothered. It's only talk.

93
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,888
Well, come on, then.

94
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,819
Didn't say nothing, did I?
Only said what's true.

95
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,055
Can't hurt you for that.

96
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,978
I can't fix this any road.
Haven't I got another one?

97
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,535
Not clean, you haven't.
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

98
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,255
Well, it's shrunk or something.
That's what's wrong with it.

99
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,734
Anyone'd think
I didn't wash 'em properly.

100
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,850
'Ere. Stand still.

101
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,973
With you and the children, it's
no wonder poor Beatie was laid to rest.

102
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,569
I should think she got fed up with it
between the lot of you. I have.

103
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,408
- All right, don't start on that.
- All right for you. You don't do much.

104
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,896
- No, no.
- It's not my home. And they're not mine.

105
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,852
The way you'd be if you didn't have me,
I don't know.

106
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,893
I am only your sister, of course,
but I've got me feelings, you know.

107
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,500
- There.
- I can't breathe in it.

108
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,737
No. I expect you'll get beer
past it, though.

109
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,455
Come on, you two, bed.

110
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,453
- I haven't finished yet.
- You've finished. Come on.

111
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,456
Auntie said I had to eat slowly.

112
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,412
Never mind that. Put it in your mouth
and get upstairs.

113
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,451
- Night, Dad.
- Night, love.

114
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,619
- Night, Dad.
- Straight up, now.

115
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,015
I have to say good night
to Auntie and Kathy.

116
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,857
Well, say it from there.

117
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,891
Good night, Auntie.

118
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,613
She didn't hear me.
Can I go in and say it?

119
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,890
Look, I'll not tell you again.

120
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,090
- Good night, Kathy.
- Night.

121
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,255
I'm going down there for half an hour.

122
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,614
Don't let her stay up
half the night reading.

123
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,777
Don't tell me, tell her.
She's your daughter.

124
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,015
You heard what she said.

125
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,534
What are you at?

126
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,211
Just... just off to the lavvy, Auntie.

127
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,048
Mind you don't leave t'door open,
banging all night.

128
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,656
Dusty? Dusty.

129
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,538
Dusty?

130
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,492
Dusty? Dusty?

131
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,419
Dusty? Dusty?

132
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,978
Dusty?

133
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,296
Are you in there, then?

134
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,379
There you are.
Have you been looking for them, then?

135
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,809
Yes. Come on, then.

136
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,737
Let's go find them, then.

137
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,613
Good girl. Come on, then.

138
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,572
Good girl.

139
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,297
There you are.

140
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,858
Who is it?

141
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,934
Jesus Christ.

142
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,731
Jesus.

143
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,811
Auntie?

144
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,811
Auntie?

145
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,931
Nan?

146
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,691
Nan?

147
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,016
Wake up, Nan.

148
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,011
Nan.

149
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,370
- What?
- I got something to tell you.

150
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,615
You what?

151
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,457
Something important.

152
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,936
- You've got to wake up. I've seen Him.
- You what?

153
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,653
Listen, you've got to listen.

154
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,009
I've seen Him.

155
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,255
Who?

156
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,211
Jesus.

157
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,339
He's in our barn. He's come back.

158
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,697
Kathy, are you sure?

159
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,455
What are we going to do, then?

160
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,775
I don't know.

161
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,970
I expect He'll tell us.

162
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,691
What does He talk like?

163
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,935
Well, He didn't say much.

164
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,210
He just told me who He was.

165
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,770
I think He was very tired.

166
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,814
Well, He would be, wouldn't He?
Did He say why He'd come to our barn?

167
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,569
Do you think it was because
of what you said, Kathy?

168
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,417
I don't know.

169
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,213
I bet it was. I told you, didn't I?

170
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,132
- Is He stopping?
- He didn't say.

171
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,497
Do you think He'd like to see me
in t'morning?

172
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,895
- I don't know.
- I expect so.

173
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,534
I mean, I didn't say anything, did I?

174
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,299
Funny, isn't it, Him coming to our barn?

175
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,456
It's like a miracle.

176
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,370
Come on, hurry up.

177
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,892
I don't think I want to after all, Kathy.

178
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,295
It's all right. I promise.

179
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,331
Promise.

180
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,730
'Ave we to curtsy?

181
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,055
I think He's gone.

182
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,854
- He was asleep.
- Yes, asleep in the hay.

183
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,693
Here, it's got to be a secret.

184
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,731
You've not to tell nobody.

185
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,739
He'll tell us. When He wakes up,
He'll tell us what to do.

186
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,210
What's happened, up at this time?
Have you wet the bed?

187
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,411
You're daft, you are, and dirty.

188
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,654
Oh dear. Sticks and stones'll break
me bones but names'll never hurt me.

189
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,250
198.

190
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,291
198 what?

191
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,218
That's how many eggs I've had
since last Easter.

192
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,219
Come on, don't string it out.
I want to get cleared up.

193
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,571
Won't a certain person
want some breakfast?

194
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,330
It says in a certain B-l-B-E-L

195
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,338
that a certain person eats bread.

196
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,177
Shut up, big mouth.

197
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,893
What are you talking about?

198
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,090
- Nothing.
- You are, then.

199
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,813
- I know what you're talking about.
- Who, then?

200
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,932
I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm gonna keep it to meself.

201
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,369
Shan't tell you anything ever again.

202
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,530
Eddie! Eddie, what are you doing?

203
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,334
- Doing?
- I thought I told you to shift that calf.

204
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,053
Yes, well, I was waiting on you, you see.

205
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,534
I told you to shift her yesterday.

206
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,174
It's draughty in that pen, she's worse.

207
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,293
Well, I was on me way to shift her.
I was waiting for you to look at her.

208
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,491
I've looked at her,
so shift her up to the big barn.

209
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,735
We'll get Weaver in to have a look at her.

210
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,295
And another time, don't wait for me,
just do what I say when I say it.

211
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,490
Right, I'll do that now, then.

212
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,098
Right.

213
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,248
What are we doing?
Are we playing with Jackie Greenwood?

214
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,292
One of us might be, two of us aren't.

215
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,013
You rotten cows, what are you doing?

216
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,170
Ask no questions, get no lies told.

217
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,532
- You rotten cows, you're nothing else.
- You watch your tongue.

218
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,097
It's always me. I always get it.

219
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,089
I'm off to hide, then.

220
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,212
- And no following.
- We don't want to follow you.

221
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,820
Well you'd better not, then.

222
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,169
Rotten cows.

223
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,818
What else?
Shouldn't we have some fishes?

224
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,570
- No, that's only in the miracle.
- Oh, I thought He had to have fishes.

225
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,136
- What about some vinegar?
- Wine. He has bread and wine.

226
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,492
Oh, Kathy, that's me dad's,
for after Christmas, after the Queen.

227
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,176
Eddie?

228
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,256
Eddie?

229
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,459
Eddie!

230
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,538
- Well, what are you doing?
- What does it look like?

231
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,378
- Thought the house was on fire.
- Isn't she any better?

232
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,014
Nah, she eats too much,
like somebody I know.

233
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,769
- Can I put her in t'barn?
- Trying to get my job or something?

234
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,459
No but me dad says
I've got to help more.

235
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,650
He says I'm useless and I'm not, see.

236
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,419
It's just that nobody lets me.
Will you let me?

237
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,655
Please, then I can tell me dad.

238
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,531
I don't know. Do you know how?

239
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,334
Yes, I've seen how you do it,
seen how clever you are.

240
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,769
Then you could go and look at your trap.

241
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,539
There's something in it.
I saw as I come along.

242
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,616
- Trap?
- Aye.

243
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,572
That wood pigeon,
the one you've been after.

244
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,656
Right. That's right.

245
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,658
Long as you know how.
In the trap now, is he?

246
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,370
Right. I'll 'ave him.

247
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,968
Does He always sleep?
He doesn't look well, does He?

248
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,613
He looks poorly.

249
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,890
He's got a nice face, though.

250
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,374
Is He like what you thought?

251
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,809
I'm glad He came to our barn, aren't you?

252
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,328
He could have gone
to Jackie Greenwood's.

253
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,013
Shh. Go on. Go on out of here.

254
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,052
Why should I?
It's my barn as much as yours.

255
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,375
Any road, I wanna see my kitten.

256
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,658
Who's that? Who's that fella?

257
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,290
It's not a fella. It's Jesus.

258
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,694
- Is he dead?
- Course not.

259
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,094
- That isn't Jesus.
- Well it is, then, Mr clever Dick.

260
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,575
Jesus wore a long dress.

261
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,373
Well, that was in them days.

262
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,050
Is it? Is it really Him?

263
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,690
And listen, it's a secret.

264
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,731
You're not to tell anyone

265
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,977
because we don't know yet
what He wants us to do.

266
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,532
And we've got to look after Him.

267
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,368
Oh, gentle Jesus, boom...

268
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,534
When you're looking
for a murderer, you've got to move fast,

269
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,095
especially with children around,
you've got to close in quickly.

270
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,256
They were slow off the mark for a start.

271
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,530
They should have closed in
but they didn't.

272
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,219
- No, no.
- It puts the onus on us, you see.

273
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,457
Course, your superintendent Teesdale's
a very good man.

274
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,015
Detective sergeant Wilcox
hasn't been to bed for three nights.

275
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,654
Yes, yes, Wilcox, yes.

276
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,898
I'm still waiting to hear from him
about the guttering that went missing.

277
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,329
Get out of that puddle, boy.

278
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,500
When you're warning them, you see,
the thing is not to alarm too much.

279
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,134
Not to alarm them, yes.

280
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,856
Six yards of guttering stolen, two
dustbin lids to my certain knowledge,

281
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,972
notice boards, they've walked,
wire netting.

282
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,499
Not to alarm them. Yes.

283
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,772
Right now, everybody, close your books.

284
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,699
- Now, put your hands up. Wait a minute.
- Miss, Miss.

285
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,856
Don't all shout at once.

286
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,415
Now, was the Samaritan
a good person or a bad person?

287
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,735
- Me, me.
- Miss, Miss...

288
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,018
Yes, Pam.

289
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,733
Please, Miss,
David Edwards has just come in.

290
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,135
Hello, David.

291
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,256
He looks like another person
who's been crossing the road.

292
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,531
Only you're not a good Samaritan,
are you, David?

293
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,619
No, M... No, Mrs... Miss Lodge.

294
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,373
You'd better go and find
Mrs Reeves and get those clothes dried.

295
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,536
Go on, hurry up.

296
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,293
Right, now let's all pay attention.

297
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,854
Jenny, Robert, this way.

298
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,851
We'll have question time now, shall we?
Has anybody got any questions?

299
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,690
About today's lesson?

300
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,328
- Or anything else?
- Miss?

301
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,575
Yes, Kathy?

302
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,373
What would happen if Jesus came back?

303
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:31,253
Well, Kathy, of course,
Jesus has never really left us, has He?

304
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,939
He's with us all the time.

305
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,448
Here, in this room,

306
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,456
at home,

307
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,058
everywhere.

308
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,251
- Isn't He?
- Yes, Miss.

309
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,497
Only I mean if He came back
in t'person, like.

310
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,853
Well, for one thing, He'd find a great
many changes, wouldn't He?

311
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,577
Now that's a good one. What sort
of changes would He find? Mm?

312
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,293
- Telly, Wagon Train.
- Beat The Clock.

313
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,416
That's right.
There wasn't any televisión, of course.

314
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,136
But I was meaning other things.
What else can you think of?

315
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,092
- ... final.
- What's that, Jackie? Speak up.

316
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,210
Cup final.

317
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,177
Anybody else?

318
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,609
Cup final, cloth ears.

319
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,732
But what would they do to Him
if He did come back?

320
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,374
If Jesus came back?

321
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,692
I'm afraid the worid hasn't changed
all that much.

322
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,174
There are still bad people
as well as good.

323
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,290
But would they crucify Him?

324
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,457
I suppose some of the bad people
might try.

325
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:45,336
But this time, all the good people would
have to try even harder to stop them.

326
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,530
We know what we'd do, don't we?

327
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,493
What would we do
if Jesus came back on earth?

328
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,213
What would we do?

329
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,898
Mm?

330
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,891
We'd praise Him, wouldn't we?

331
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,090
What would we do?

332
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,177
Praise Him, Miss.

333
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,576
- Praise Him.
- Praise Him.

334
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,810
It's stopped raining.
Do you think He stopped it, Kathy?

335
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,328
Yes, He could do anything, Jesus.

336
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,771
Do you think He could make me a nice
chocolate cake for me birthday?

337
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,573
- And some chocolate logs, eh?
- No, you mustn't.

338
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,215
Miss Lodge says you've only
to ask Jesus for love and not for things.

339
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,650
Oh, she talks out of t'back
of her neck, she does.

340
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,654
I'd like to see her face when she
knows we've got Jesus in our barn.

341
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,976
- Are we going to tell her?
- No, not till He's ready and better.

342
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,818
Then everybody'll know.
They'll all come and see Him.

343
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,249
- Who?
- Oh, everybody.

344
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,816
Shepherds, wise men, lords, ladies,
bishops and people.

345
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,657
The Mayor of Burnley.

346
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,659
There'll be thousands around
our barn before He's finished.

347
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,534
You just wait and see.
I'll bet you anything you like...

348
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,335
Come on, Charlie.

349
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,530
Don't be so slow.

350
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,616
Hello.

351
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,611
Are you feeling any better, then?

352
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,291
Oh, you've broken your wine.

353
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,732
We brought you that.

354
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,771
And the bread.

355
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,770
Did you?

356
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,811
Mm.

357
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,091
Sorry it wasn't very much.

358
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,450
I didn't bring you any dinner

359
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,968
but I brought you my kitten.

360
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,976
It's name's Spider.

361
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,174
We've not told anyone.

362
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,816
You don't want us to tell nobody,
do you, till you're better?

363
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,579
No. Don't tell nobody.

364
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,857
We know who you are.

365
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,129
And we're going to look after you.

366
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,296
We'll try and get you
some better stuff next time.

367
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,370
Good night, gentle Jesus.

368
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,536
Sleep well.

369
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,935
Did you come straight home
from Sunday school today, Kathy?

370
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,096
Yes, Dad.

371
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,291
- You didn't hang about anywhere?
- No, Dad.

372
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,376
No, well that's right.

373
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,537
I don't want you hanging around,
talking to people and that.

374
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,889
You didn't talk to anyone, did you?

375
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,135
No, Dad, only the vicar.

376
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,890
No, I mean strangers, like.
You didn't talk to any strangers?

377
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,330
- No, Dad.
- I don't want you talking to strangers.

378
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,935
There's some very funny
people about these days.

379
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,779
Funny men and that.

380
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,177
I don't want you to be bothered
with anybody you don't know.

381
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,814
Kathy, what are you doing?

382
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,452
- Nothing, Auntie.
- What have you got under table?

383
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,453
- Nothing, Auntie.
- There's summat going on between you.

384
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,855
You know summat about it, too.

385
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,697
What have you got in your hands?

386
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,856
Nothing, Auntie.

387
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,335
Well, eat your tea properly.

388
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,612
And mind what I say. I don't want
you having to do with strangers.

389
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,855
Just mind what I say.

390
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,936
Yes, Dad.

391
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,370
Come on, you two.

392
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,490
Come on.

393
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,657
- Did you get the stuff?
- Don't shout. Yes, I did.

394
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,772
Got an extra bar of soap,
some toothpaste

395
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,617
and an individual fruit pie.

396
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,379
Oh, quick, put it up your jumper.

397
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,208
- Do you think Auntie'll find out?
- No, I'll say I lost t'bill.

398
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,455
- Do you think it's wicked?
- No.

399
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,971
How can it be, when we're
doing it for Him? Come on, quick.

400
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,011
Come on.

401
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,371
It's you. You told them.

402
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,775
No I didn't, I only told Jackie Greenwood.

403
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,129
You told them.
I told you not to tell anybody.

404
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,978
I didn't tell anybody. I only told Jackie.

405
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,012
- What do you lot want, then?
- We've come to see Him.

406
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,171
- Who?
- Jesus.

407
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,017
Yes, Jesus.

408
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,937
Well, you can't, see.

409
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,972
Yes we can, then.
He's not your private property.

410
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,773
Everyone can see Him if they want.

411
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,451
Well,

412
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,171
if I tell you,

413
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,370
if I let you see Him,

414
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,615
it's got to be a secret.

415
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,890
You've got to promise.

416
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,171
It's got to be a secret society
from the grown-ups.

417
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,654
Do you promise?

418
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,411
Because if you don't,

419
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,770
they'll come and take Him away again,
like last time.

420
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,617
Do you understand?

421
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,532
Right.

422
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,019
You can't come past our house
for a start. You'll have to go right round.

423
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,130
Our Nan and our Charles'll take you.

424
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,377
You're not to make any noise
and you have to wait for me.

425
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,729
Do you understand? Come on.

426
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,134
- Do you want to see Jesus or don't you?
- Yes.

427
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,330
Well, shut up, then.

428
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,497
Here are your groceries, Auntie.
I'm just out to play.

429
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,055
Mind you don't get yourself
all mucked up.

430
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,489
You're all to wait here until I say.

431
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,050
And keep back out of sight.

432
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,250
Nan, give me the stuff.

433
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,816
Keep back.

434
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,454
I brought you these, like I promised.

435
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,414
Oh, your leg.

436
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,690
Yeah.

437
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,176
If you want to, you could get me
some water and a bit of cloth.

438
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,814
Yes, sir. I'll send our Charles.

439
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,579
- Charles?
- Me little brother.

440
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,179
Oh, yeah.

441
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,017
Who else knows I'm here?

442
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,416
Only Charles and me sister, Nan,
and the other children.

443
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,769
Other children?

444
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,970
How many are you, then?

445
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,774
Oh, they're not ours but they're all right.

446
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,694
You can come in now
but come in quietly.

447
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,809
- Go get some water from t'yard.
- What in?

448
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,533
Oh, use your loaf and find something.

449
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,377
Well, say hello.

450
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,417
Go on, say hello.

451
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,251
Hello.

452
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,860
Hello.
Hello, sir.

453
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,930
It's got a free gift inside it.

454
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,888
In there.

455
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,569
It's an Arabian charm bracelet.

456
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,457
Yeah.

457
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,817
Very nice.

458
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,575
I've brought you your book.

459
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,774
Will you tell us a story, please?

460
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,095
- Story?
- Yes, please.

461
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,979
- What about?
- Erm, the Good Samaritan.

462
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,375
No, loaves and fishes.

463
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,297
No, the 'Oly Ghost.

464
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,333
- Go on, will you?
- Yes, tell us a story.

465
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,417
- Go on, tell us a story.
- Yes, please tell us a story.

466
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,372
Story. Story. Story!

467
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,139
Story! Story! Story! Story!

468
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,852
Shut up!

469
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,169
You mustn't make so much noise.

470
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,610
If you keep quiet,

471
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,651
I'll read you a story.

472
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,810
Sit down.

473
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,417
"Ruth Lawrence, air hostess...

474
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,770
"The stranger paused.

475
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,015
"'Yes, I have ze parcel,' he said.

476
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,937
"They were interrupted

477
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,733
"by the sound of the loudspeaker.

478
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,779
"'Flight 504, leaving for Hamburg."'

479
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,096
That's why she's worse.
Has she been sick long?

480
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,210
- Not long.
- Hello, young man.

481
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,615
What are you doing? Look at your boots.

482
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,810
Turn that tap off.

483
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,889
"Ruth Lawrence
was the youngest air hostess

484
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,249
"at Redbridge airport.

485
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,097
"She was only 17."

486
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,734
Dad!

487
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,053
- Dad!
- What?

488
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,979
- Are you gonna look at the calf?
- You can't come, so don't suggest it.

489
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,535
We've had bad luck with the weather.
Should have sown last month.

490
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,970
It's been terrible all round.
Good for business, though.

491
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,410
- Not mine.
- I'm not exactly complaining.

492
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,736
What are you lot doing in here?

493
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,015
Come on, out of it. Go and play outside.
Go on, all of you.

494
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,497
- Can't I stay, Dad?
- Mr Weaver doesn't want your advice.

495
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,294
Oh, please can't I stay?
I have been looking after her.

496
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,059
Oh, all right,
as long as you keep out of the way.

497
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,693
You're lucky not to have foot and mouth.
They've had it all over.

498
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,857
Come on, let's have a look at you,
young lady.

499
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,051
- Is she off her grub?
- No, she's keeping it down.

500
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,614
Come on, girl. I shan't hurt you.

501
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,216
Aye.

502
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,728
Yeah, come on.

503
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,294
I want to have a look at
your mouth. Come on.

504
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,618
Well, don't seem much wrong
with her now.

505
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,289
Could have saved myself your bill.
No wonder you're not complaining.

506
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:39,368
I don't know about that.
I'll have a look at her while I'm here.

507
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,616
She's got over it, whatever it was.
Are you gonnna keep her?

508
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,537
I was but I'm not bothered.

509
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,777
Once they're prone
to colic, you're best rid of them

510
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,459
but it's up to you.
There's nowt wrong with her now.

511
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,491
I'll get shut of her next week.

512
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:59,499
If you take my advice,
that's the best thing.

513
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,376
Oh, what's this?

514
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,733
Is this yours, young lady?

515
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,169
- Well, what do you say?
- Thank you.

516
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,135
They don't take care of nothing.

517
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,252
I don't know what they're up to
half the time.

518
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,651
It's all right.

519
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,089
You can come out now, they've gone.

520
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,450
You all right?

521
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,090
Yeah, it's OK.

522
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,568
We'll have to find you somewhere safer.

523
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,974
Thanks for not giving me away.

524
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,569
Oh, we would never
give you away. Not ever.

525
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,414
Why are you and all them other kids,

526
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,539
why are you helping me?

527
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,969
Because we love you.

528
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,050
Oh, I forgot.

529
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,050
I brought you this.

530
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,774
- What is it?
- It's a picture of you.

531
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,655
Course, it was taken a long time ago.

532
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,573
Oh, and don't worry
about the other thing.

533
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,009
We won't let the grown-ups find you.

534
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,290
You're quite safe with us.

535
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,333
Quite safe with us.

536
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,733
# The corporation dustcart
was full up to the brim

537
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,375
# The corporation driver
fell in and couldn't swim

538
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,208
# He sank right to the bottom
just like a little stone

539
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,253
# And all the time was whistling
There's No Place Like Home #

540
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,411
- What you got?
- Nothing.

541
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,654
Well, give it us, then, if it's nothing.

542
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,260
# We know something you don't know

543
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,336
# We know something
you don't know

544
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,134
# We know something you don't know
we know something you don't know

545
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,890
# We know something you don't know
we know something you don't know

546
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,693
- What do you know?
- Give over!

547
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,776
- Tell us what you know.
- Give over.

548
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,015
- What do you know, then?
- Get off, man.

549
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,018
- What do you know that I don't know?
- Get off me.

550
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,620
- Get off.
- What do you know that I don't know?

551
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,412
- Jesus. We've seen Jesus.
- You what?

552
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,489
I just told you. We've seen Jesus.

553
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,771
- Yeah and who else? Donald Duck?
- No, honest, Patto.

554
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,936
- Cross me heart.
- You haven't, have you?

555
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,096
- Yes.
- Have you?

556
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,015
- Yes.
- Have you?

557
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,850
Have you?

558
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,889
- No.
- Say it, then. Say "I haven't seen Jesus."

559
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,657
I haven't seen Jesus.

560
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,577
Again.

561
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,414
- I haven't seen Jesus.
- Again!

562
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,534
I haven't... seen Jesus.

563
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,418
All right. Who else has seen Him?

564
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,572
Who else, then?

565
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,216
Come on, who else?

566
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,251
I have.

567
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,815
Leave her alone, Patto.

568
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,975
She has, Patto, we've all seen Him.

569
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,569
And I've seem Him as well, so you know.

570
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,458
- Have you got it?
- I'm just looking, just looking.

571
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,491
Oh.

572
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,176
Can't quite lay me hands on it.

573
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,859
Can't lay your hands on it. What's this?

574
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,368
- I looked over there.
- Not hard enough.

575
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,495
- Where'd this come from?
- No idea.

576
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,657
It's funny but I looked over there
when I first come in.

577
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,772
- Then I went over the other side.
- All right, all right.

578
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,175
Trouble with the tractor...

579
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,449
Where's mine? Where's mine gone?

580
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,492
- Who's had mine?
- I don't know, do I?

581
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,371
Jesus?

582
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,851
Jesus.

583
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,892
- What is it?
- Have you got my kitten?

584
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,534
- What kitten?
- The kitten I gave you.

585
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:03,173
- No, I haven't got it.
- But I gave it you to look after.

586
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,290
Well, I haven't got it.

587
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,577
It's dead.

588
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,811
It's dead. He let it die.

589
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,411
He let it die.

590
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,376
He let it die.

591
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,418
Has he gone to heaven, Jesus?

592
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,254
You've gone to heaven, haven't you?

593
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,898
- What's up?
- It isn't all true, in t'Bible, is it?

594
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,454
What? Course it is.

595
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,378
- It isn't. Cos He's just told me.
- Who?

596
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:35,290
Gentle Jesus. He does things for other
people but He won't do anything for me.

597
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,376
Cos it isn't Him.

598
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,411
It's just a fella.

599
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,530
It is Him, Charlie.

600
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,936
It isn't. Cos I gave him my kitten
to look after

601
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,096
and he let it die.

602
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,696
And he's supposed to look after animals
and he doesn't.

603
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,254
Yes, He does. It's just that...

604
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:02,055
Well, He has to let some things die,
I suppose.

605
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:06,338
It were my kitten, not his.

606
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:10,168
He can't stop everything from dying.
Nobody can.

607
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,336
God can't, even.

608
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,257
There must...

609
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,530
He must have had a reason.

610
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,579
I'll find out for you, shall I?

611
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,498
Shall I find out for you? Shall I?

612
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,531
Shall I?

613
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,652
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

614
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:18,610
Can we have one bottle of orange
and two straws?

615
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,651
Thank you.

616
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:46,535
- Mr Reeves.
- Hello, Linda.

617
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,253
It's not Linda, it's Kathy Bostock.

618
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,850
Oh. Oh, yes, is it?

619
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,050
Kathy, that's right.

620
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,058
- Can I interrupt you for a minute?
- Yes.

621
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,409
You know how He used to cure people?

622
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,975
Jesus, I mean.
He cured a blind man once, didn't He?

623
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,738
That's right.

624
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,090
And He could bring people back
from t'dead, too.

625
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,693
Mm. Lazarus.

626
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:23,653
Only He must have let
some people die, mustn't He?

627
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,130
Why did He let those people die?

628
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,731
Mm.

629
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,890
Well, er...

630
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,534
You see, er, people...

631
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,538
babies are being born all the time.

632
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,571
And, er,

633
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,736
those of us who are here already

634
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,613
have got to make room for them,
haven't we?

635
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,298
Yes, sir.

636
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,251
The Lord giveth

637
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,416
and the Lord taketh away.

638
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,293
- That's what the Bible says, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

639
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,094
God has got more than us
to think about, not only people dying.

640
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,337
It's what we are doing to the worid,
that's what worries Him.

641
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:10,497
You see, we hurt God much more
than He hurts us.

642
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,418
You don't have to go far
to see people offending God.

643
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,851
What about when you get children taking
guttering and lead from the church?

644
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,698
It's not only the value. It's God's house.

645
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:24,210
- But that's nothing to do with Jesus.
- It's going to stop.

646
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,615
I'm going to stamp this vandalism out.

647
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,016
I'm going to take very strong measures
in the future.

648
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,858
- Yes, sir.
- Mm.

649
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,619
So you pass it around.

650
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,855
He doesn't know, does he?

651
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,819
Hello.

652
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,089
What have you got for me today?

653
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:32,733
Erm, I got some sausage and cheese

654
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,930
and a custard slice.

655
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,098
They've all got a bit mixed up, I'm afraid.

656
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,732
- You didn't bring any snout, I suppose?
- Snout?

657
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,691
Yeah, snout.

658
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,970
Fags, ciggies.

659
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:58,013
Oh, no. I didn't know you smoked.

660
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:04,096
No, well, er, I never used to but...

661
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,937
I do now, sometimes.

662
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:11,130
Well, I'll try and get you some.

663
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,528
How did you get hold of this grub, then?

664
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:21,136
I just took it. Is that all right?

665
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,849
All right if you don't get caught.

666
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,258
What would your mother say?

667
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:33,293
She's dead. She's in heaven.

668
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,257
Oh, yeah.

669
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,291
Yeah.

670
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,131
Who looks after you now, then?

671
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,455
Me Auntie Dolly, she lives with us.

672
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:51,129
There's me, there's me dad,
our Nan and our Charles.

673
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:54,616
It's his birthday tomorrow, as you know.

674
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,651
Yeah.

675
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,489
What day is it?

676
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,179
- Charles' birthday? The 14th.
- No, today.

677
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,093
Oh...

678
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,732
Tuesday.

679
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,376
I'll have to be going soon.

680
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:21,016
Oh. Are you going a long way?

681
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,019
Yeah.

682
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:29,930
Will you have time to see
some more children before you go?

683
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,938
No. Oh, I'll have to see.

684
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,777
I don't know.

685
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,414
She's taking her time, your Kathy.

686
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,131
Oh, give over!

687
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:48,614
If she in't here in five minutes,
I'll get you.

688
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,174
Give over.

689
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:54,417
Do you think she'll be here
before I count a hundred?

690
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,371
Well, I'm going to count.

691
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:00,208
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

692
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,251
thirteen, fourteen...

693
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,651
Why did you let that kitten die?

694
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,217
Oh.

695
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,894
Well, I got a lot on me mind just now.

696
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:25,650
Look, would you like to do
something else for me?

697
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,691
Will you run me an errand?

698
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,856
Only, if you do, nobody's to know.

699
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,290
- You haven't to tell the others. Right?
- Oh, I won't.

700
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,532
Well, I seem to remember
there's a tunnel near here,

701
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,652
near a canal or a reservoir or something.

702
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,895
I haven't been round here for some time.

703
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:47,616
There is one, the Castlewood tunnel.
It's on t'canal but they don't use it now.

704
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:52,336
Yeah, that'd be it.
Well, there's a parcel I want bringing.

705
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:57,092
It's just inside the tunnel, wrapped
in sacking and wedged under the line.

706
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,897
- Do you think you could find it?
- Oh, yes, I'll find it.

707
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,817
That's a good lass.

708
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,533
Now you go by yourself
and don't open it.

709
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,689
- Right?
- Yes, I'll go now.

710
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,531
541,

711
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,775
542,

712
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,776
543,

713
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,651
544,

714
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,656
545,

715
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,611
546,

716
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,616
547,

717
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,457
548,

718
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,491
549,

719
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,337
550,

720
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,893
551.

721
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,209
- What's up with her?
- I don't know, do I?

722
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,172
You're her sister.
Thought she was taking us to see Him.

723
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,290
- She will.
- What, next year?

724
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,615
- No, tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.

725
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:58,697
- It's your Charles' party tomorrow.
- Who's asking you?

726
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,174
- I was only saying.
- She'll take you tomorrow.

727
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:06,055
She'd better or I'll go and tell Him
a thing or two, so you tell her from me.

728
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,975
Don't ask him to the party.

729
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,571
I shan't.

730
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:43,418
Oi!

731
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,894
What are you doing down there?

732
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:50,297
- Who is it, some kid?
- I don't know. I can't see.

733
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,369
Hey! Come here!

734
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,769
Ah, it's only a kid.

735
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,656
Ha ha ha.

736
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,850
Oh, don't, Charlie.

737
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,939
British Bulldog. British Bulldog.

738
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,576
- We're going to play my game now.
- It's my party. I can play what I like.

739
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:33,180
You mind,
otherwise your party'll be over.

740
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,496
And I know somebody who might
find themselves in bed.

741
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,849
We'll play blind man's buff.

742
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,334
- I don't like it. It's rough.
- It isn't.

743
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:44,099
- Course it isn't.
- I'm gonna be a blind man and get you.

744
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,291
Oh, Dad, tell our Charles to stop it.

745
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,013
Now watch it, love.
You're getting overexcited.

746
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,494
I want to be the blind man. It's my party.

747
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:56,010
- Have you got a hanky, Dad?
- Can I? Can I be the blind man?

748
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:59,689
I don't care who's the blind man
as long as you behave yourselves.

749
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,971
- You can use t'duster.
- Me dad said I could be it.

750
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,090
- Did you, Dad?
- Oh, let him, let him.

751
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:07,938
- It's the last game so make the best of it.
- Oh, Dad.

752
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,529
Don't start. You've had
a good innings. Come on.

753
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:15,175
- It's too tight.
- I don't want you cheating. That's why.

754
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,331
I'd like another cup of tea now.

755
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:22,692
You'll have to use one of the best cups
and be careful with it.

756
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,731
Stop it.

757
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:35,209
- Where's that bottle of port, then?
- I don't know. Don't look at me.

758
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,332
- Well, it's not here.
- You must have drunk it.

759
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:44,170
It's never passed my lips. I haven't had a
drop since V-E Day and I didn't like that.

760
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:47,018
Tea's in there.

761
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,930
Gotcha!

762
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,096
Kathy. Kathy!

763
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:03,179
Kathy, have you shifted t'bottle of port
out of t'sideboard?

764
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:22,570
Mind what you're at!

765
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:26,135
Give over. Give over.
That'll do. That's enough. Now quiet.

766
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,171
Quiet!

767
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,929
Right. Now it's cake time.

768
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,813
If you want cake,
queue up in front of Auntie Dorothy.

769
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:38,011
- Me! Me!
- Don't drive me insane.

770
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:47,372
Hey, miss, put that down. Who's this for?

771
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:51,208
- Me. It's mine.
- Not that. I mean t'other one.

772
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,330
It's for Jesus.

773
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,811
Who d'you say it's for, love?

774
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,730
Who d'you say it's for?

775
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,178
Jesus.

776
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,529
It isn't Jesus.

777
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,571
It's just a fella.

778
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,970
Eddie! Eddie!

779
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,014
Here. Give me that quick. Come on.

780
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,098
He's got a gun. Now look,
you stay here and keep out of the way.

781
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,290
I'll be back.

782
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,375
You're not going there,
so make up your mind.

783
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,251
- I'm going to see Him.
- You're not.

784
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,895
- I'm going to see Him.
- You don't know. You don't understand.

785
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,934
- You don't understand anything.
- You don't know who he is.

786
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,494
I do. I do. It's Jesus.

787
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:19,179
Look, he's got a gun, love.
He's got a gun.

788
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,893
You're making it up
because you want to get Him.

789
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:24,249
You can't leave anybody alone.

790
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,054
- I'm going to see Him and I don't care...
- Stop it, Kathy, stop it.

791
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,568
You're not going up there
so make up your mind.

792
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,656
- Oh, please.
- Come along.

793
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,373
Come along! Now behave.

794
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,218
- Kathy, behave. Come along.
- It's Jesus.

795
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,410
Come on. Now get along.

796
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,217
Go along.

797
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:53,219
Now listen, all of you.
You're to stay here and not to come out.

798
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:57,538
Just do as I say, there's good kids,
and there won't be any more trouble.

799
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,730
Just do as I say.

800
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,493
It's half-day closing. He's at t'cemetery.

801
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,292
Ann Green.

802
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,331
Who?

803
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,931
Excuse me.

804
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:34,051
Hello.

805
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,535
Yep. Right.

806
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,010
We've got him, Frank.

807
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,890
What do you think he's doing?

808
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:17,939
Jesus?

809
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,691
Jesus?

810
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,169
Oh, please, Jesus, please.

811
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,611
Jesus.

812
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,820
Oh, please talk to me.

813
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,216
I believe in you.

814
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,769
I won't hurt you. It wasn't me.

815
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:23,252
I love you. I love you.

816
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,690
Go away, kid.

817
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,539
Go away.

818
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,699
I brought you something.

819
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,650
Your snort.

820
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,610
Did you bring any matches?

821
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,091
Oh, I forgot matches.

822
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,736
Doesn't matter.

823
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,336
You remembered the snout.

824
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:31,019
I didn't give you away. It was Charles.

825
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:35,099
But he didn't mean to.
It's just that he didn't think.

826
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:38,371
- That's all right.
- He didn't mean to.

827
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,457
- Will you forgive him?
- Yeah.

828
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,139
Then me Aunt Dolly went for the police.

829
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:47,570
What'll you do?
Are you gonna get away this time?

830
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:51,855
It's not up to me, is it?

831
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:58,130
- It's up to them, innit?
- There's lots of other children.

832
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:02,651
I sent for them to help you. I know
they'll come. I just know they'll come.

833
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,373
Did you hear what I said?

834
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:14,219
- Yes, I heard.
- We wouldn't have sent for the police.

835
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,979
Not ever. Not ever.

836
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,212
They're coming now.
What are you going to do?

837
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,329
There must be something you can do.
You can do anything.

838
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,531
- Is that what you all think?
- Yes.

839
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,696
Yes, we all believe in you.

840
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:02,291
He's in that barn, I gather. You stay here.
I'll go up with Wilcox, a couple of men.

841
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,535
He'll cover the back...

842
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:18,968
- Where the hell are they coming from?
- I've no idea, sir.

843
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:25,615
Well, I want this whole area cleared.
He's got a gun, you know.

844
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:27,776
Come on, Frank.

845
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:35,575
Please, you must hurry.
Please, you must.

846
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,253
Will we see you again?

847
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:43,450
Will we see you?

848
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:50,057
- You bet.
- What did you say? I didn't hear.

849
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,570
I said yeah.

850
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:57,410
You'll hear about me again.

851
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,291
Do you promise?

852
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,049
- Promise?
- Come on, love. Out of it.

853
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:17,095
Yes, I promise.

854
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,731
You there, Blakey?

855
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:36,577
Gonna be a good lad?

856
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,934
What about it, Blakey?
What's it gonna be, then?

857
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,092
Gonna make more trouble for yourself?

858
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,539
You'll need more than that, Blakey, lad.

859
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,934
Has He gone?

860
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,972
Yes.

861
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,011
Yes, you missed Him this time...

862
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,528
but He'll be coming again.
