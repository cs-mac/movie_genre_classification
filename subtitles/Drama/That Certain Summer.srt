    I had thought...

    this place would
    continue to remain vacant.

00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:41,400

    Yu Jian, tell me when you
    come back to Qianchuan.
   

141 
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,880

    I'll come to see you.
   

142 
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:44,859

    Bye now.
   

143 
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:10,599

    Mister.
   

144 
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,542

    Now that we're really leaving,
    I feel a bit reluctant.
   

145 
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,559

    We've lived here for
    so many years, after all.
   

146 
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,720

    Yes, I do feel a bit reluctant to leave.
   

147 
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:27,039

    Don't be so hard on yourself.
   

148 
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,440

    I hope you won't regret your decisions.
   

149 
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,519

    I have no regrets.
   

150 
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:39,160

    All right. It's time to part at last.
   

151 
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,440

    Let's go.
   

152 
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,039

    <i>[Demolition notice]</i>
   

153 
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,920

    Hello.
   

154 
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,359

    Watch your step.
   

155 
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,599

    - Right here?
    - Yes.
   

156 
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,039

    Hi, I've been by to
    view the house before.
   

157 
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,880

    I want to show the place
    to my girlfriend this time.
   

158 
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,160

    - Go right ahead.
    - Thank you.
   

159 
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:29,839

    - Straight ahead?
    - Yes.
   

160 
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,200

    Go straight.
   

161 
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,279

    - We're not there yet?
    - Soon. Don't rush.
   

162 
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,200

    Surprise!
   

163 
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,720

    Do you like it?
   

164 
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,119

    I like it. This place is beautiful
    and it's huge.
   

165 
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:49,640

    We just arrived in Shanghai
    and we don't have much in savings.
   

166 
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,039

    Your house is so well-decorated.
    Is the price really that low?
   

167 
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:59,000

    - There's a piano over there.
    - Go take a look.
   

168 
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,480

    This is great.
   

169 
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,319

    I'll be able to play the piano here.
   

170 
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,559

    Okay, all right.
    If you like it, let's rent it.
   

171 
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,160

    You can do the things you love here.
   

172 
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,720

    Leave it to me to earn money.
   

173 
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,119

    - Thank you.
    - No need to.
   

174 
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,519

    Is everything here available for use?
   

175 
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,920

    Yes.
   

176 
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,940

    You like music too?
   

177 
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:37,400

    I really hope I can
    release my own album one day.
   

178 
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,599

    If you're interested,
    I also have a guitar upstairs.
   

179 
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,160

    It's been with me for many years
    but I have no use for it now.
   

180 
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,920

    I'll leave it for you too.
   

181 
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,559

    - Really? Thank you!
    - Thank you.
   

182 
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,640

    I put a lot of thought into
    decorating this house.
   

183 
00:26:57,623 --> 00:26:59,539

    I don't want to see it go to waste.
   

184 
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:03,740

    If you like it here, you can move in
    as soon as you want.
   

185 
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,079

    - All right, thank you.
    - Thank you.
   

186 
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,480

    I hope your dreams come true.
   

187 
00:27:14,414 --> 00:27:16,000

    - Thank you.
    - Thank you.
   

188 
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,960

    <i>[Duan Qiao and Yu Jian's Home]</i>
   

189 
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,400

    You have so many things.
    Will you be able to manage?
   

190 
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,839

    I used to roam the world
    with one backpack.
   

191 
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,759

    Now, I'm no longer roaming.
    I'm returning home.
   

192 
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,680

    I actually feel quite reluctant.
   

193 
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:06,119

    All right, don't walk me any further
    or else I'd start crying.
   

194 
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:12,559

    Is this how we're parting ways?
   

195 
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,079

    I never imagined that in the end
   

196 
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,960

    it'd just be the three of us left.
   

197 
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:25,400

    Remember to contact us
    after you're there.
   

198 
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,940

    Don't disappear on us.
   

199 
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,039

    I'm returning home.
    We're not going our separate ways.
   

200 
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,839

    You won your countercharges
    against Ding Yi Yang for libel.
   

201 
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,039

    Your new book, "Angel",
    is also sold out everywhere.
   

202 
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,920

    You're a winner at life.
    Stop looking so miserable.
   

203 
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:42,839

    Come on.
   

204 
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:47,680

    I'm leaving now.
   

205 
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,859

    Take care.
   

206 
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,119

    Take care.
   

207 
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:56,039

    Thank you for taking care of me
    all these years.
   

208 
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:23,960

    <i>I mulled over this for a long time
    and I think I should tell you.</i>
   

209 
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,279

    <i>Li Xia has been away for two months.
    She's now back in Shi County.</i>
   

210 
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,920

    <i>Go find her.</i>
   

211 
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:47,920

    Hey, little girl. Have you fallen?
    Let's get you up.
   

212 
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,119

    Xuan Xuan!
   

213 
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,579

    Thank you, thank you.
   

214 
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:20,599

    <i>Li Xia.</i>
   

215 
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,160

    <i>Am I destined to lose you?</i>
   

216 
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,759

    You can put this plant in your study.
   

217 
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,799

    It can absorb the radiation
    when you're on your computer.
   

218 
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,720

    How can I depend on this little plant
    to absorb radiation?
   

219 
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,599

    At most, it's just for show.
   

220 
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,039

    So after we get married,
    should we have a baby just for show?
   

221 
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,599

    Then we'll seem like a family.
   

222 
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,940

    What are you saying? You're terrible.
   

223 
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,359

    <i>[Fu Xiao Si's works]</i>
   

224 
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,079

    That's a pretty nice painting.
   

225 
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,359

    We can buy a few and
    hang them in our house.
   

226 
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:50,460

    Let's go inside.
   

227 
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,000

    Do you like anything?
   

228 
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:22,559

    If you like them, I'll buy all of these.
   

229 
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:28,200

    Young man.
   

230 
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:34,039

    High school girls all like
    these paintings.
   

231 
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,680

    You're quite up to date on the trends.
   

232 
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,759

    Thank you.
   

233 
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,559

    Enjoy your time here.
   

234 
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:54,880

    I also think this is
    the best painting here.
   

235 
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,039

    I'll buy it then.
   

236 
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,160

    I'm sure it'll look wonderful
    hanging in the living room.

    be considered a happy life?</i>
   

241 
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:01,440

    <i>Time is like water.
    It easily submerges our lives.</i>

250 
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,039

    <i>your mischievous smile

    It's okay. Don't worry about it.

00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,440

    My son is no match.
   

276 
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,679

    Not at all, CEO Zheng.
    Please don't say such a joke.
   

277 
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,159

    Your son is a fine-looking man.
   

278 
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,840

    - Here.
    - Cheers.
   

279 
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:27,880

    Let's dig in.
   

280 
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:30,199

    - You--
    - Eat.
   

281 
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,559

    Eat up.
   

282 
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,559

    Let's eat.
   

283 
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,248

    Handsome!
   

284 
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:51,320

    - Look, Xiao Si is so gorgeous.
    - So handsome!
   

285 
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,000

    Being his girlfriend
    would make one so happy.
   

286 
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,679

    Leave that in your dreams.
   

287 
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:00,519

    He is like a wall,
    warding off any who come at him.
   

288 
00:41:01,456 --> 00:41:04,059

    Do you still remember
    that female colleague next door?
   

289 
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:06,880

    Her confession has failed
    for the nth time.
   

290 
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:10,219

    She's so pretty.
    Even she would be rejected?
   

291 
00:41:12,748 --> 00:41:15,360

    "I suggest you focus on
    your work at hand."
   

292 
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,099

    "Don't waste your time on me."
   

293 
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:21,079

    He's like a large iceberg.
   

294 
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,440

    He's so hard to approach and
    rejects all who like him.
   

295 
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,800

    Do you think he's gay?
   

296 
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:29,539

    No way!
   

297 
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:31,400

    I think it's possible.
   

298 
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:36,659

    This is our last class.
   

299 
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,079

    Regardless of...
   

300 
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,280

    how many drawing techniques
    I've taught you
   

301 
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,639

    you must rely on yourselves
    to draw a perfect piece of art.
   

302 
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:50,559

    Sir, do you have any tips for this?
   

303 
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,719

    Follow your heart.
   

304 
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,000

    That's why...
   

305 
00:41:56,081 --> 00:42:01,880

    You must find what
    you believe to be most beautiful
   

306 
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,519

    and then use art to show everybody
    the world you see through your eyes.
   

307 
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:11,780

    Sir, where does
    your creative inspiration come from?
   

308 
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,480
