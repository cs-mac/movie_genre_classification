1
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,932
This is the best
my back has felt in three years.

2
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,261
Joseph, you're a genius.

3
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,472
That's my job. I'm a surgeon.

4
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,523
But I'm no genius.

5
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,397
Oh, my God. It's Mitch.

6
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,193
I was just telling
your uncle here he's a genius.

7
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,478
Now he's arguing with me.

8
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,569
Well, you know us doctors,
very famous for our humility.

9
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,073
- How you feeling?
- Like a man who can't wait to tee off.

10
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,495
How long till I can start playing again?

11
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,369
Well, let's see how you heal first.
Could be four to six weeks.

12
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,291
Really'? That long?

13
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,538
We only want to do this once.

14
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,203
Okay.

15
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,751
That's good.

16
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,127
It was great to see Ellie and the baby.

17
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,378
When are they heading back to New York?

18
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,382
Beth and Grace are taking them
to the airport right now.

19
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,759
Bet Beth hates to see them go.

20
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,090
She's fine.

21
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,141
Ethan, Ethan, we must say good-bye.

22
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,722
I know it's gonna be hard, but...

23
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,355
We just gotta suck it up
and not let our emotions get the best of us.

24
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,062
Is that okay? Is that okay with you?

25
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,239
Because I know you're thinking hard.

26
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,363
Well, when you finish your thesis,
you should come to New York.

27
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,819
We'll invite Jeffs friend for dinner.

28
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,028
I don't think he's my type.

29
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,573
You haven't even met him.

30
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,618
- Could you cover your mouth?
- Sorry.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,452
Maybe you're right.

32
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,708
All right, Mom, you gotta hand him over.

33
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,914
Give Grandma a kiss.

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,499
Give Mi-Mi a kiss good-bye.

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,301
Give Mi-Mi kisses.

36
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,503
- No...
- Hey, buddy.

37
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,839
Now, call me if it looks like
he's about to take his first step.

38
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:52,889
I'll fly to New York.

39
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,092
Okay, we'll keep him off
the floor till you get there.

40
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,768
- All right, honey. Bye-bye, love.
- I love you.

41
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,560
How can a person not cover
his mouth when he sneezes,

42
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,765
especially around a baby?

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,691
Yeah, especially around you.

44
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,519
Babies are exhausting.

45
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,604
It's different when they're yours.

46
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,445
You're great with Ethan.

47
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,902
Were you that patient with us?

48
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,702
Still am.

49
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,701
What did I do with my keys? There.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,125
Do you think he'll remember us
next time he sees us?

51
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,674
- God, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

52
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,843
- That's okay, honey.
- He won't forget you.

53
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,467
- I know. I know. I know.
- I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

54
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,469
No, you're not an idiot.

55
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,719
Oh, God.

56
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,803
Please.

57
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,013
Hi, Dad.

58
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:43,974
I thought I called your mom.

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,648
You did. She's busy.

60
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,729
<i>Did they get off all right?</i>

61
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,530
They're on the plane.

62
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,408
Ask Mom if she remembered
to pick up my stuff at the cleaners.

63
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,864
Did you get Dad's stuff?

64
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,329
Yes, she did.

65
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,951
<i>Put her on. I have to ask her something.</i>

66
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,324
She'll call you back.

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,163
Well, she can't. I'm going into surgery.

68
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,923
Wait a minute. She's upset.

69
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,172
Of course. Is she crying?

70
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,925
A little. We all cried.

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,632
Okay, you can do this.

72
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,267
Tell her to please calm down.

73
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,389
Okay.

74
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,273
Thank you, sweetie.

75
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,437
- I'll drive.
- No.

76
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,563
Okay.

77
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,903
Dad can be kind of a prick sometimes.

78
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,075
He thinks I overreact.

79
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,782
When you do what he does,
you gotta have a thick skin.

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,492
Honey, he's not a prick.

81
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,293
You always defend him.

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,132
Oh, my God.

83
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,965
- Turn around!
- What?

84
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,971
- Oh, my God!
- What? We're on the freeway.

85
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,302
We got to go back. I saw something.

86
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,431
What... Like a body?

87
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,979
- Take that exit right there!
- I'm taking it!

88
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,977
- God, take it easy, Miss Daisy.
- Turn around!

89
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,400
I can't turn around. We're on the freeway!

90
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,275
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

91
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,652
Mom, are you sure about this?

92
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,358
Get out on this side.

93
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,693
No shit.

94
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,750
Here.

95
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,725
Hey! Hey, fella!

96
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,644
Here, boy.

97
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,815
Hey!

98
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,357
- Don't touch him!
- Okay.

99
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,816
He's filthy.

100
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,486
- He could have rabies.
- I know.

101
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,034
- It's okay.
- Why isn't he standing up?

102
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,410
Is this like one of those subway accidents,

103
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,083
where you lift him up
and all his guts fall out?

104
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,836
Honey, he's terrified.

105
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,663
What can we feed him to make friends?

106
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,756
I know. All right, I got it.

107
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,218
Yes, hello, 9-1-1?

108
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,092
Listen, this isn't
a life-and-death emergency, exactly.

109
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,047
No one has a gun or anything.

110
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,724
No, I said no gun!

111
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,718
- I got it!
- Hello?

112
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,802
- Here we go!
- Hello?

113
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,229
- Damn it.
- Look, look, look, look.

114
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,308
Ethan loves these. He loves these.

115
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,482
I think you will too.

116
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,818
Watch it!

117
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,322
Hey, buddy. That's a boy.

118
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,235
Good boy!

119
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,537
There. Oh, my God, he took it.

120
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,704
9-1-1?

121
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:49,164
Thank God, I am on I-70
near Chambers Road.

122
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,961
And this is a life-and-death emergency.

123
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,215
Never mind. We're cool.

124
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,964
Mom, look.

125
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,009
We're just not allowed
to deal with animals of an unknown threat.

126
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,138
I mean, this...

127
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,434
- Durley.
- Yeah?

128
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,103
- We gotta go.
- What do you mean?

129
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,806
I talked to Animal Control.

130
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,812
They'll be here sometime
in the next two hours.

131
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,019
Two hours!
That's all you're gonna do for us?

132
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,945
Well, no, in this circumstance,

133
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,194
we are authorized to put the animal down.

134
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,319
I think you'd better go.

135
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,368
I'm sorry, folks. Them's the rules.

136
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,744
Good luck.

137
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,916
Do you think we can move him?

138
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,338
You mean, touch him?

139
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,916
This is one of those rare occasions
when I wish I had a man I could call.

140
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,209
Me too.

141
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,389
Honey, there really are
a lot of great men out there.

142
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,932
You have to make some effort.

143
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,635
Mom, let's keep our eye on the ball.

144
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,061
How are we supposed to move him?

145
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,646
Where is it?

146
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,642
Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,819
Okay.

148
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,284
Here is a giraffe.

149
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,741
What kind of assholes left you
out here all alone, huh?

150
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,745
Silk. Good idea.

151
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,501
Good boy. Good boy.

152
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,833
Now, nobody's gonna hurt you.
Get ready for him to go crazy.

153
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,759
Just get ready. Here we go.

154
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,970
There you go. Okay.

155
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,798
Okay. There you go.

156
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,303
Now, here we go. Okay.

157
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,181
Come on. Come on, darling.

158
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,307
- Come on, boy.
- Come on.

159
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,854
- Take a right.
- Look! No broken bones!

160
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,431
Look at that! Yeah.

161
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,357
It's gonna be so warm in there.

162
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,984
Now, on the count of three,
we're gonna throw this shirt over his head

163
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,188
and lift him in, okay?

164
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,866
Don't you want to use
one of Dad's suits to protect the seat?

165
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,194
Pay attention.

166
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,574
Ready?

167
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,246
Okay!

168
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,120
One, two...

169
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,167
There.

170
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,089
Three.

171
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,545
Thank you.

172
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,556
Hello. I'm Dr. Bhoola.

173
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,180
So, Mrs. Winter, you saved this dog's life?

174
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,011
I don't know about that.

175
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,347
Not many people would have stopped
in this weather.

176
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,852
You must have a dog of your own.

177
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,978
No, no.

178
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,309
Then you must be a dog person.

179
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,311
Well, I don't know.

180
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,526
How about you? Are you a dog person?

181
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,287
Yeah, I can't keep my hands off 'em.

182
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,499
Well, there's no chip in him.

183
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,171
There's no way to trace the owner.

184
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,247
He's a little nicked up.

185
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,334
He has a cut on his muzzle, a few hot spots.

186
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,045
We'll get the blood panel back tomorrow.
But if I had to guess,

187
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,634
there's nothing wrong with this dog
a few good meals and a bath won't fix.

188
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,763
That's great.

189
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,016
I hope one of you will take him home.

190
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,774
I just can't.

191
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,944
I have my thesis, and it's time-consuming,

192
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,441
and I don't even know why I'm doing it.

193
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,647
It just goes on and on.

194
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,363
And I can't have pets in my building, so...

195
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,539
Mrs. Winter?

196
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,459
Me? No, no, no.

197
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,664
No, the last thing
my husband wants right now is a dog, so...

198
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,211
That's too bad.

199
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,169
His teeth are worn down,
if you'd just like to have a look.

200
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,129
Yeah? No.

201
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,092
Yeah, it looks like he was left alone a lot
and spent his time chewing on a chain.

202
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,808
He's about seven.

203
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,889
And the chances of a dog like him
being adopted from the shelter are minimal.

204
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,270
So in about a week,

205
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,735
he's likely to be put down.

206
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,401
Mom?

207
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,545
- Good dog.
- Beth?

208
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,550
Hi, honey.

209
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,923
Dad, we're in here.

210
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,472
Hello.

211
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,054
Hey, it's okay, boy. It's okay.

212
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,561
Stay calm. Stay calm.

213
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,851
You know, I think he's just startled by you.

214
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,189
That's all. Easy.

215
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,351
Hey! No!

216
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:26,941
No barking!

217
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,529
What's going on? Whose dog is this?

218
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,326
Mom's. She saved his life.

219
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,449
He's not mine.
I'm just gonna find him a home.

220
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,704
Why is he here?

221
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,702
I just couldn't let them
take him to the pound.

222
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,873
So what I'm gonna do is,

223
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,701
I'm gonna call
a few rescue societies tomorrow,

224
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,001
and somebody's going to want him.

225
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,587
Yeah, but not us, right?

226
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,756
We're not getting a dog, right?

227
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,175
I think you should keep him. I'll help.

228
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,589
You're at school.

229
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,670
She's not gonna come back
every morning and walk a dog,

230
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,506
- and neither am I.
- I wouldn't mind doing that.

231
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,889
Beth, I don't want a dog.

232
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,558
I told you, I'm gonna find him a home.

233
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,102
Yeah, I know you.

234
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,303
And what's that supposed to mean?

235
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,723
- That was Dr. Bhoola.
- Who?

236
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,523
The veterinarian. He's gonna stop by.

237
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,021
What is he... He's coming here now?

238
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,444
Yeah, he has some medicine or something.

239
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,318
I'm gonna use your shower,
'cause it's filthy in here.

240
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,532
The veterinarian makes house calls?

241
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,615
He's very attractive.

242
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,786
Did you see that?

243
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,459
- He's an amazing dog.
- I know.

244
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,289
- You did a great thing by picking him up.
- I couldn't leave him.

245
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,999
A lot of people just don't care.

246
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,335
Joseph, I want you to meet Dr. Bhoola.

247
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,418
Sam, please.

248
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,504
- It's nice to meet you, Dr. Winter.
- And you.

249
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,139
Is this enough paper?

250
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,467
Yeah, that's great.

251
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,017
You don't want to get this stuff on the floor.

252
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,187
Come on, buddy.

253
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,764
Okay, so...

254
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,229
There's the irritation, right there.

255
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,187
So you give it a little spritz, like so.

256
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,649
- What are you naming him?
- Freeway.

257
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,616
You've named him?

258
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,912
Freeway, I bet you didn't think
you were going to a spa today, did you?

259
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,204
Looks like you lucked out, buddy.

260
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,452
Well, we're not keeping him.

261
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,950
So says the pharaoh.

262
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,252
If you keep him, you'll be getting a great dog.

263
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,709
Well, thanks for coming by.

264
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,382
I hope my patients don't hear
that you make house calls.

265
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,758
Do you think I could take him for a walk?

266
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,669
Yeah, let's see how he does on a leash.

267
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,005
I'll go with you, if you like.

268
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,591
That'd be great. I'll get my coat.

269
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,267
Would you like to come?

270
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,313
No, no, not at all. No.
I'm going to clean that bathroom.

271
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

272
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,936
Come, Freeway.

273
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,567
Let's go.

274
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,653
Come on, boy.

275
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,899
- Should I go with them?
- God, no.

276
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,903
Come on.

277
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,625
Come on.

278
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,046
Hey, wait for us! Freeway!

279
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,092
Hey, where do you think you're going, huh?

280
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,263
Hurry up, honney.

281
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,341
I'm here. I'm behind you.

282
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,097
Look what I found. Look at that.

283
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,225
Yeah. Come on.

284
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,273
How did you two meet?

285
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,851
- Don't ask.
- Don't... Yeah.

286
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,185
- No.
- I don't want to talk about it.

287
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,191
- Why not?
- Let's just say...

288
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,943
Well, it was embarrassing.

289
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,322
There you go.

290
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,542
That's his choice.

291
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,249
He can get as many opinions as he wants.

292
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,005
Morning!

293
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,890
Carmen, I'm out of basil. Can you save me?

294
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,764
There's extra in the shelf
behind the spice rack.

295
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,516
Good.

296
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,977
- Carmen, we can't find the big ladder.
- Don't talk to me. I have to get this right.

297
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,442
The ladder...

298
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,901
In the shed, left side, under the tarp.

299
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,866
- The ceremony is starting.
- Okay.

300
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,711
Aunt Grace is so pretty!

301
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,981
Dad.

302
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
<i>Namaste.</i>

303
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,785
Welcome, everyone. I'm Todd.

304
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,573
Grace and Sam have foolishly asked me
to officiate today.

305
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,544
I recently was ordained
on the Internet, about last Wednesday,

306
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,917
so feel confident, I know what I'm doing.

307
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,394
If the disk is massively herniated,
it's either got to be a laminectomy

308
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,187
or it'd be microdiscectomy.

309
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,015
It's unavoidable.

310
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,396
Have Ruthie send the MRI up here,
would you?

311
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,476
- Right now.
- Come on, Ethan.

312
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,107
I'll see you Monday.

313
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,735
Dad, everyone's leaving. Grandma's waiting.

314
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,657
We have to go. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

315
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,236
Listen, I know he calls your mother "Mi-Mi,"
but does he have to call me "Pee-Pee"?

316
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,414
He's trying to say "Poppy."
He just can't say it yet.

317
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,287
We're working on it, though, right? Poppy?

318
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,618
You're doing a great job with him.

319
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,749
Thank you.
Did you see Sam playing with him?

320
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,580
I think he's going to be
a pretty amazing father.

321
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,757
- Yeah. Hope so.
- Hope so.

322
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,585
Speaking of amazing,
you girls looked amazing today.

323
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,921
I've never seen Gracie look so happy.

324
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,221
Yeah.

325
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,430
Bride.

326
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,758
- Hi!
- Here's the pretty bride.

327
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,808
Hi, honey.

328
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,477
- All right, we're loading up.
- Okay.

329
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,691
Gracie, you know, it's not too late
if you want to change your mind.

330
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,859
Maybe after the honeymoon.
I want to see Bora-Bora.

331
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,979
Fine. Just don't sleep with him.

332
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,942
<i>Dad, you know how when your daughter
asks for something on her wedding day,</i>

333
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,277
you have to do it?

334
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,453
What, is that from The Godfather?

335
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,748
These next few weeks may be hard on Mom.

336
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,416
I'm sure, she'll be fine.

337
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,289
Will you make an effort?

338
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,041
Well, I always do.

339
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,667
More?

340
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,216
Will you try harder?

341
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,793
Promise?

342
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,549
Of course I will.

343
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,509
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

344
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,762
- Get home safe.
- Thanks.

345
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,343
So why didn't Joseph invite me
to stay tonight

346
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,473
since you're going to be here?

347
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,724
Did you want to stay?

348
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,057
No, I can't sleep in this altitude.

349
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,518
Where's your new boyfriend?
I want to say good-bye.

350
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,400
- Really?
- I'm right here, darling girl.

351
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,607
Let go of me, you sexy minx.

352
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,194
We don't want everybody to know, do we?

353
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,699
Muriel, it's a delight.

354
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,202
I should have known
Penny's mom would be a fox.

355
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,874
Stop it, please.

356
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,496
Mom? Mom?

357
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,250
I can't sit in the back. I'll get carsick.

358
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,002
Especially on these horrible roads
you've got here.

359
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,004
I know, Mom.
That's why I'm putting you in the front.

360
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,426
I'll probably get sick anyway.

361
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,841
Well, that's the spirit, Mom.

362
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,139
Here, you know,
that's why I gave you that Tigan,

363
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,091
to help with the carsickness.

364
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,934
I didn't take it.

365
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,307
I don't know what's in that stuff.

366
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,186
You know what's best for you, Mom.

367
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,641
Bye.

368
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,323
Jeff, thanks for sacrificing your sanity
for the good of the family.

369
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,108
No problem. I'll get her to the airport.

370
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,111
Sam, you got a lot to live up to.

371
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,449
Wait till you get to know my family.

372
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,789
- Say it? Say it?
- Bye, Ethan.

373
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,041
- Say POPPY
- POPPY

374
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,460
- Pee-Pee.
- We're trying!

375
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,209
That'll do. Love you.

376
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,880
- Bye, I love you.
- Bye.

377
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,708
I love you! See you soon!

378
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,758
- Bye-bye!
- Bye, Mom.

379
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,960
Bye!

380
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,304
You shouldn't have told her we were staying.

381
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,687
Bye!

382
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,533
- Bye!
- Bye!

383
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,825
Bye-bye!

384
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,993
Have a wonderful time!

385
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,207
Bye!

386
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,626
It was really nice, actually.

387
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,253
Everybody was in a good mood.

388
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,172
No, Penny didn't say anything.

389
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,501
Violet, no one was insulted.
Don't worry about it.

390
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,714
I told them it was important
for you to be at your thing. It's fine.

391
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,173
Russell?

392
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,145
No one will mistake him
for a rocket scientist.

393
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,065
Except for my grandmother, who loved him.

394
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,643
Kind of wish she'd marry him.

395
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,649
Okay.

396
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,321
Yeah, go ahead.

397
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,615
All right. I love you.

398
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,737
Hi.

399
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,988
Why didn't your wife come?

400
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,695
I'm not married. You're Carmen, right?

401
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,949
I'm Bryan. I'm Joseph and Beth's nephew.

402
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,752
So, what, you live here?
You take care of this place?

403
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,958
Caretaker a hard job?

404
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,791
My other two jobs are harder.

405
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,380
What's going on with your neck?

406
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,215
It's killing me.

407
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,217
- Maybe I can help.
- Are you a masseur?

408
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,219
No, I'm a surgeon.

409
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,634
Maybe you can help me slit my throat.

410
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,683
Wow, tough day. Wait, let me get it. I got it.

411
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,021
All right, where to?

412
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,977
- Out there.
- Okay.

413
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,198
You guys really rocked. You didn't rock.

414
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,901
You were bluegrassing. I'm sorry.

415
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,328
- Had a good time.
- Thank you. Okay.

416
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,825
Oh, God.

417
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,832
Sweetie. Hello, sweetie.

418
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,041
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

419
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,842
We've unloaded both girls.

420
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,465
That just leaves Freeway.

421
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,218
No, he's not going anywhere.

422
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,718
He's a real mama's boy.

423
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,348
What do you think about Russell?

424
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,645
Penny has outdone herself this time.

425
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,017
I don't know. It could be serious.

426
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,474
She said she wanted to tell us something.

427
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,231
Maybe they're getting married.

428
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,652
- To that idiot?
- Hey...

429
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,104
Come on.

430
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,407
He's got the personality
of a used car salesman.

431
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,735
Penny is a bright woman.

432
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,445
He charmed your mother at the reception.

433
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,618
Exactly my point.

434
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,360
Russell, Penny tells me you're in demolition.

435
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,282
Twenty-two years, eight in London.

436
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,068
Really? I love London.

437
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,370
Greatest city in the world, aside from Omaha.

438
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,905
We should all go there.

439
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,744
Well...

440
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,666
So you're no longer in demolition?

441
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,374
- What happened?
- The business blew up.

442
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,008
Completely collapsed. Demolished.

443
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,209
What are you doing now?

444
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,508
You know,
I got something pretty good brewin'.

445
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:46,058
I'm so glad you sat us with,
you know, Sam's parents.

446
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,261
Was that Pramilla's sister in the pink sari?

447
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,018
I know. Gorgeous.

448
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,815
What have you got "brewin"'?

449
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,769
Well, we don't want
to steal your thunder today,

450
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,072
you know, 'cause that was
one heck of a wedding you put on,

451
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,776
but since you're family,
I gotta spill the beans.

452
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,954
No, I thought we'd wait until tomorrow.

453
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,451
We're opening an English pub.

454
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,168
Where... Who's opening a pub?

455
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,917
In England, is that...

456
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,004
In Omaha! Me and Penny.

457
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,175
I'm sorry. What?

458
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,129
Wait a minute. Penny.
You're not leaving the newspaper?

459
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,933
Well, I was about to be laid off,
and so I took the buyout.

460
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,634
At least they'll pay me for a year.

461
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,934
How could you not tell me this?

462
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,933
Do you know there's not one English pub
in Omaha?

463
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,731
If you want bangers and mash,
you got to go all the way to Des Moines.

464
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,147
Really? Who's financing this?

465
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,775
You know, finally, you'll be able
to get a decent pint in Nebraska,

466
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,356
and fish and chips, I mean, the real thing,

467
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,441
in newspaper, soaked with grease.

468
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,526
And...

469
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,986
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

470
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,662
No, it's okay. Don't worry.

471
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,533
This is genius, if I do say so myself.

472
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,492
It'll be the only place in the Midwest,
that I know of,

473
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,248
where you can have... Are you ready?

474
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,749
Warm beer.

475
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,086
Wow. Warm beer.

476
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,166
Yeah.

477
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,919
Where's the money coming from?

478
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,220
Bottom-line guy, Bryan.

479
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,763
You got that from your mother.

480
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,931
First thing Penny asked me.

481
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,008
Good. What'd you tell her?

482
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,685
Well, I got some money saved,
and I sold my condo.

483
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,560
And I got a friend whose brother
wants to put up half the money,

484
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,891
after we raise the first half.

485
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,523
And, you know,
we're talking to other investors.

486
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,150
Okay, what are you contributing to this?

487
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,527
Not one cent, if Russell has his way.

488
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,113
- Nothing?
- That's right. Nothing.

489
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,862
Look, I mean, of course,

490
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,451
we may dip into my buyout
until we have some cash flow.

491
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,136
And Russell's moving in,
so we won't have that expense.

492
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,134
Penny's enrolled in a bartending class.

493
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,133
Mom...

494
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,935
We want to give all of you the opportunity
to get in on the ground floor.

495
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,357
How would you like to all be part-owners

496
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,979
of the Partridge and the Plough?

497
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,028
Mom, are you serious?

498
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,827
Yeah?

499
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,540
Wait, wait. He's canceling on me

500
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,242
so that he can have
the surgery done by Ed Ritter?

501
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,747
Does he know I trained Ed Ritter?

502
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,003
Ruthie, tell me his exact words.

503
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,754
Really?

504
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,086
"Surgeons reach their peak at 45"?

505
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,671
Who told him that?

506
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,932
Freeway! Shit!

507
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,855
I got to go, Ruthie. I'll see you Monday.

508
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,278
Freeway!

509
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,858
Freeway!

510
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,530
Hi, Ellie called.

511
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,956
They got your mother on her plane.

512
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,454
And you know what? Ethan asked about you.

513
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,253
You know what he said? He is so cute.

514
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,456
He said, "Where's Pee-Pee?"

515
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,758
Honey, what are we going to do
about the Partridge and the Plough?

516
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,634
- What are we going to do about Russell?
- I don't know.

517
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,760
Has Freeway been in here?

518
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,433
I thought he was with you.

519
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,056
He was, but he took off on me.

520
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,597
What? Wait a minute. Where's the dog?

521
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,189
I told you. He took off.

522
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,642
When was this?

523
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,771
About 20 minutes ago.

524
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,523
He chased a deer and wouldn't come back.

525
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,696
Did you use the whistle?

526
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,818
I whistled.

527
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,400
I didn't have the whistle, per se.

528
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,861
You were on the phone, right?

529
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:34,991
It was an emergency.

530
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,242
God.

531
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,415
He's probably right outside.

532
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,702
Freeway! Come on, boy!

533
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,332
Freeway!

534
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,885
Where are you, sweetheart?

535
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,339
You lost the dog
while you were talking on the phone!

536
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,425
Freeway!

537
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,846
He's not lost, believe me.

538
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,473
Freeway!

539
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,772
- He knows how to get home.
- Freeway!

540
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,603
Is something wrong?

541
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,605
The dog's run off.

542
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,982
Shit. We'll be right there.

543
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,362
Yeah, be right there.

544
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,280
Dogs find their way across the country
all the time. Haven't you read that?

545
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,287
Freeway!

546
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,582
Is Freeway missing?

547
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,582
Yes, we've got to spread out
and search before it's too dark.

548
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,878
I'll get the keys.

549
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,752
- Freeway!
- You're panicking.

550
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,879
Don't you know how much
that dog means to me?

551
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,882
Yes, of course I do. I like him too.
I'm just not obsessed with him.

552
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,055
How could you be,
when you're obsessed with yourself?

553
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,850
- Where'd you see him last?
- On the back trail.

554
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,393
- Wait, the dog's gone?
- Yeah.

555
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,560
Come on, let's go.

556
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:41,979
I'm with you. Where should we start looking?

557
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,476
Okay, we'll go this way.

558
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,728
I'm gonna go out to the road
and look around.

559
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,685
I got a light. I'll come with you.

560
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,355
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Use your whistle!

561
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,569
Hi!

562
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,992
Okay.

563
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,242
Here, boy!

564
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,915
- Careful.
- Shoot.

565
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,413
Bryan thinks I should have my knee scoped.

566
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,962
Yeah, I've been begging you
to do that for years.

567
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,291
You can't fix a torn meniscus
with herbal enemas.

568
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:15,258
You know, Bryan's much more open
to Eastern approaches.

569
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:19,137
And it's colonics, not enemas.

570
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:23,221
You should try one.
It might dislodge that enormous bug.

571
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,939
- What?
- You're so negative about Russell.

572
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,688
Don't you think we've given
the pub a lot of thought?

573
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,482
The Pig and the Poke? No.

574
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,278
What are you doing with this guy?

575
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,448
Just because
your first husband was a genius

576
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,276
and he turned out to be a dick
doesn't mean you can never trust

577
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,781
another man with half a brain.

578
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,487
You're the dumb one.

579
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,914
Have you ever heard
of emotional intelligence?

580
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,210
You know, Russell makes you
look like a five-year-old.

581
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,296
Plus, he's the most generous lover
I've ever known.

582
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,669
Stop. Spare me that image.

583
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,259
Freeway, come back,
you son of a bitch bastard!

584
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,888
Your girlfriend,
she didn't come to the wedding.

585
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,227
Doesn't she like Grace?

586
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,477
Violet likes Grace just fine.
She had to go on a retreat with her firm.

587
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,899
A retreat?

588
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,069
Yeah, they all go away somewhere
and talk about IPOs, government regulations.

589
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,613
- To avoid the regulations?
- Yeah.

590
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,942
No, how to comply with them, sort of.

591
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,279
Anyway, it's my mother that is hard on Violet.

592
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,535
She says you can't trust a woman
who wears four inch heels all the time.

593
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,366
All the time?

594
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,872
She looks good in them.

595
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,587
My mother says, "What's she selling?"

596
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,751
I have an idea. Wait.

597
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,552
- Come on, boy.
- Hey, buddy!

598
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,979
I'm just so pissed he didn't take the whistle.

599
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,353
Joseph's got a lot on his mind
with the wedding

600
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,275
and then our news
about the Partridge and the Plough.

601
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,895
Trust me, he wasn't thinking about you
or the wedding.

602
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,901
If you want his attention, herniate your disk.

603
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,859
- Hey, buddy!
- Hey, guys, stop talking about Joseph!

604
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,534
We can hear you!

605
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,487
We could use a little help here.

606
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,618
- Wait a second.
- Her knee, her knee.

607
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,290
- Get some ice on this.
- Don't. Your back...

608
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,793
- It's nothing. It's nothing.
- This way.

609
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,462
- What did you do...
- Honey, it's my knee.

610
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,298
What are you looking at?

611
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,845
It's 10:00,

612
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:29,226
and you are deep
in Possum's Burrow on KGO-FM.

613
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,808
Coming up, we have Blue
by the Living Sisters.

614
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,453
Hello, big bear!

615
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,327
Oh, my God.

616
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,658
Woof!

617
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,124
Possum!

618
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,250
Wow.

619
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,425
You know, I had a dream last night
that you were gonna come down here.

620
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,047
I need a favor.

621
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,800
Anything, darling.

622
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,006
What's this, fresh meat?

623
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,683
I'm Bryan.

624
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,679
Bryan.

625
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,015
Are you ready to have your heart broke, man?

626
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,143
She's legendary.

627
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,070
Possum, my boss lost her dog.

628
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,241
I'm on it.

629
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,162
<i>All right, everybody,
I got a friend who needs our help.</i>

630
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,864
<i>She's looking for a lost dog,</i>

631
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,541
big brown-white mutt,

632
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,539
<i>means about as much to his people as...</i>

633
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,042
<i>Carmen means to me</i>

634
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,964
Get to the point, Possum.

635
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,837
<i>Dog's name is Freeway.</i>

636
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,386
<i>So everybody step outside
and give a big shout-out for Freeway.</i>

637
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,341
<i>There's a cash reward, if that matters.</i>

638
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,722
Here you go.

639
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,350
Now, you need to keep that elevated.

640
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,102
And I want you to take these.

641
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,978
What are they?

642
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,402
It's a mild anti-inflammatory
and a muscle relaxant.

643
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,488
They're organic.

644
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,907
Made from the hearts of endangered species.

645
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,952
You know I don't take chemicals
into my body.

646
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,779
You want to be laid up here
by yourself tomorrow

647
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,661
while we're all out looking for the dog?

648
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,464
Say, "Aah."

649
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,056
Thank you.

650
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,263
<i>Now, remember, everybody,</i>

651
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,770
<i>if you see Freeway, call this number...</i>

652
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,140
He dedicated Searching to you.

653
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,774
Which one?

654
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,309
Erykah Badu.

655
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,978
Nice.

656
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,421
It's gonna be fine.
He'll probably show up in the morning.

657
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,467
He's out there with coyotes
and bears and porcupines.

658
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,794
But he's a dog. He can take care of himself.

659
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,963
But he has no wilderness experience.

660
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,634
Beth, I think you're overreacting.

661
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,972
I think you're under-reacting,
for somebody who actually lost the dog.

662
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,354
You know, I'm so sick of you
judging my feelings all the time!

663
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,026
Wouldn't want to be sleeping
with her tonight.

664
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,234
They are out of alignment.

665
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,413
No, the dog is definitely not black.

666
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,338
No, I do not want to come and check him out.

667
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,921
Possum had to mention my name.

668
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,010
Well, maybe we'll find him at the shelter.

669
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,337
It's a wasted trip.

670
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,464
Freeway is not there.

671
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,722
How do you know?

672
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,509
I know things.

673
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,519
You know things?

674
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,767
Like, what do you know?

675
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,687
I know Russell would like to be your friend.

676
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,196
Well, yeah, of course he would.
He's trying to close the deal with my mother.

677
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,368
And I know you were glad
Violet did not come to the wedding.

678
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,414
Excuse me. We've lost our dog.

679
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,495
Is there a report we can fill out?

680
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,374
Well, how long's the dog been missing?

681
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,041
Since last night.

682
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,547
Well, old Pipe here,
he'll take off for three days

683
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,304
anytime some bitch goes into heat.

684
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,885
He can smell 'em from five miles out.

685
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,605
That's really fascinating.
Our dog is neutered.

686
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,937
Yeah, could you put word out
to your deputies?

687
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,693
You'd have to talk to the Sheriff about that.

688
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,733
And how could we reach him?

689
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,695
- The Sheriff?
- Yeah!

690
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,070
He's probably fishing down by Slater's.

691
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,418
Hey, what's going on?

692
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,846
This is where I found Django.

693
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,138
Django died last year.

694
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,682
Your dog?

695
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,135
And spirit-mate.

696
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,470
Passed over in my arms.

697
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,930
I'm sorry.

698
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,606
He was 24 years old.

699
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,774
It's unusual for a dog to live that long.

700
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,032
What?

701
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,078
Good-bye, little boy.

702
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,380
I know.

703
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,129
Good-bye, beautiful boy.

704
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,052
I know someone will come for you.

705
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,222
A spirit-mate?

706
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,390
No. He's waiting for a man.

707
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,932
Joseph, you're a doctor.

708
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,062
Is it my imagination,

709
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,267
or does your dick shrink when you get older?

710
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,734
When you say "your dick"...

711
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,030
No, mature dicks, in general, dicks.

712
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,409
I think I see him.

713
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,997
Hey! Sheriff!

714
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,252
- Joseph Winter. Could we talk?
- Who?

715
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,666
Joseph Winter.

716
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,337
Well, look, tomorrow's Monday.

717
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,263
I'll be in the office all day, Joe.

718
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,554
Yeah, no, I understand.
I'm sorry about that, but it's an emergency.

719
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,348
You're the doctor, right'? Who's that?

720
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,359
- Future brother-in-law.
- Nobody.

721
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,024
Well, what's the emergency, Joe?

722
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,189
We lost our dog.

723
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,110
Yeah, actually, they call me Joseph,

724
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,945
which I prefer.

725
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,077
His wife talked to your deputy,
but she didn't get too far.

726
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:06,035
Yeah, that'd be Chaz.
He wants my job, you know,

727
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,337
if it didn't interfere with ski season
or hunting season

728
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,789
or getting drunk season.

729
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,419
What kind of dog did you lose?

730
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,797
A mutt. My wife rescued him.

731
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,093
A what?

732
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,546
A mutt!

733
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,632
Look, let me come over there,

734
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,217
and you can talk to me
on my good ear, okay?

735
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,594
This is my day off!

736
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,771
Yeah, yeah, I realize that.

737
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,478
This all happened on the freeway, did it?
In the snow?

738
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,606
In January.

739
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,322
Well, your wife must have some brass balls,
I'm telling you.

740
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,825
And your daughter,
she married the veterinarian, did she?

741
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,747
Yesterday, at our place.

742
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,913
Well, congratulations.

743
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,743
Thank you.

744
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,579
Hope they're happy.

745
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,923
What is it? Where does it hurt?

746
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,088
Kidney stone.

747
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,840
Okay, let's get you to a clinic.

748
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,796
No, I can move. I can...

749
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,549
Okay, you get this side.

750
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,633
Okay.

751
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,518
I can make it! I can make it. I can make it.

752
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,186
Don't get hung up on the hook here.

753
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,188
Come on, boy. Come on.

754
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,686
- Bring my dogs.
- Come on. I got 'em.

755
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,108
- Bring my dogs!
- I will.

756
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,945
Gettin' old really sucks, Joe.

757
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,649
You're not old. What are you, 60?

758
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,529
63.

759
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,407
My fifth goddamn stone.

760
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,908
Maybe this one will pass quickly.

761
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,125
Maybe it'll be over in time
for my colonoscopy next week.

762
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,752
You wouldn't want to miss that.

763
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,212
You're a doctor.

764
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,837
Why don't you come up
with a better way to do that?

765
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,087
I'd make a fortune.

766
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,053
I don't want to be insulting,

767
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,551
but just... Man, you just...

768
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,267
What's your PSA?

769
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,935
1.2.

770
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,513
You're lucky.

771
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,691
How's your good cholesterol?

772
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,143
I only have bad.

773
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,483
What kind of doctor are you?

774
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,155
Spine surgeon.

775
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,027
When do they start
pushing you out of that deal?

776
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,990
- Let's boogie, Joe.
- Okay.

777
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,074
Clinic!

778
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,250
- Got you.
- Hammer down.

779
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,173
<i>Hey.</i>

780
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,088
Come on, Beth, let's go inside.

781
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,348
Come on.

782
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,638
It's getting chilly.

783
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,519
Well, the dog...

784
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,690
There's a place for you if you're hungry.

785
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,655
Beth, you should eat something.

786
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,199
Freeway is gonna show up, Beth.

787
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,999
He has the microchip. He has the collar.

788
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,250
We've got flyers everywhere.

789
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,380
It's about the only thing playing on the radio.

790
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,714
They're getting complaints
from people who'd like to hear a little music.

791
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,295
We've done everything we can.

792
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,301
Someone will find him and call.

793
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,640
Let's talk about tomorrow.

794
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,308
My first appointment's at 11:00,

795
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,853
and Bryan has rounds starting at noon.

796
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,396
So that means Beth, Bryan and I

797
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,307
have to leave for the airport
no later than 6:30.

798
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,520
Penny, Carmen can drive you guys
to the airport later on.

799
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,694
I'm not leaving.

800
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,741
Honey, what are you gonna do?

801
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,948
You can't walk around all day
calling his name.

802
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,320
I'm up for another day.

803
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,072
We're not leaving Beth up here alone.

804
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,118
I'm not saying to leave Beth alone.

805
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,251
Look, I think that's great.

806
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,625
If you guys feel you can stay, that's cool.

807
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,173
That's fine. Yeah.

808
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,342
It's very nice of you.

809
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,419
The world goes on, though. Bryan and I,

810
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,927
we do have responsibilities to get back to.

811
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,009
I'm trying to be realistic.

812
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,062
What, that makes me the insensitive clod?

813
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,514
Yes.

814
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,724
Would you be leaving if I were missing?

815
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,401
That's ridiculous. It's nothing like that.

816
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,646
- Would you?
- I'm not even gonna dignify that.

817
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,732
- Dignify it.
- Beth, everything is a crisis with you.

818
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,488
There's no sense of proportion.

819
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,281
You just don't get it, do you?

820
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,950
What? What is it I don't get?

821
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,533
We haven't lost a person. We've lost a dog.

822
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,616
Love is love.

823
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,835
It doesn't matter if it's a dog.

824
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,330
Yeah, I know you love the dog.
You don't think I've noticed

825
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,040
that you care more about him
than you do about me?

826
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,717
Jesus, Joseph,
I don't believe you're making this about you.

827
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,839
Mom.

828
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:28,838
When I rescued Freeway,

829
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,767
I made a promise to him and to myself

830
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,095
that I was gonna take care of him.

831
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,306
He'd suffered enough already,

832
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,311
and I wanted to make it up to him.

833
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,688
But now I've let him down.

834
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,437
How? How have you let him down?

835
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,654
I never should have let you take him out.

836
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,200
I have walked that dog 100 times.

837
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,033
I know.
On a leash, around the block, in the city,

838
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,580
while you were talking on your phone.

839
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,657
I thought Freeway was our dog.

840
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,668
You never paid attention to him.

841
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,670
You know more about your patients

842
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,372
than you do about your own family.

843
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,417
I'm not having this conversation now.

844
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,672
You're irrational.

845
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,925
I would have had that whistle,

846
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,881
and he would have come back to me.

847
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,557
But now he's gone.

848
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,136
And for all I know,
he may be suffering somewhere.

849
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,847
He's probably terrified.
I don't know. He may be dead.

850
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,808
He's not dead.

851
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,190
- Freeway is alive.
- What?

852
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,942
What are you talking about?

853
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,991
I am certain he's alive.

854
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,411
You're certain?

855
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,706
I never told you this, but I find things.

856
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,117
What kind of things?

857
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,585
Missing things. Sometimes living things.

858
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,708
You mean like a detective?

859
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,173
My great-great-grandmother
was Madame Luminitsa.

860
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,374
You've probably heard of her.

861
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,175
I am of the Romany people.

862
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,638
Gypsies?

863
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,057
On my mother's side.

864
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,760
My father is a yogi.

865
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,062
The women in my family, they have a gift.

866
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,763
We see things.

867
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,858
You find it hard to believe.

868
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,230
<i>Gadje always do.</i>

869
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,736
But I can help you find Freeway.

870
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,479
<i>Gadje?</i>

871
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,360
How?

872
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,875
When I realized Django was my spirit-mate,

873
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,168
the animal world became visible to me.

874
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,870
As opposed to the vegetable
and mineral worlds?

875
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,330
Now, who's Django?

876
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,836
That was Carmen's dog. He lived to be 24.

877
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,177
It was then that the gift blossomed in me.

878
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,346
My third eye truly opened.

879
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,344
What Django felt, I felt.

880
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,597
I traveled through the world with him,
seeing what he saw.

881
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,768
And what did he see?

882
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,431
He saw things for what they are.

883
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,140
He was connected to the prana.

884
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,774
<i>The prana.</i>

885
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,069
Shut up, Joseph. You're such a tight ass.

886
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,771
Do you have to be so one-dimensional?

887
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,065
Excuse me for living in this dimension.

888
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,240
Carmen.

889
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,946
Do you see him? Is he all right?

890
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,570
Beth, are you kidding me?

891
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,908
Can you see what he sees?

892
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,950
- Yes.
- What do you see?

893
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,960
I see trees

894
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,628
and a shed with construction equipment in it
and mountains.

895
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,970
Wow. That really pinpoints it.

896
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,802
I see a redheaded woman.

897
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,426
What, Freeway's looking
at a redheaded woman?

898
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,352
She may have fed him.

899
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,521
He had some kind of interaction with her.

900
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,222
What should we do?

901
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,899
Yeah.

902
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,102
Go to bed.

903
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,563
What, are you closing for the night?

904
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,195
In the morning,
everything will be much clearer.

905
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,867
I need rest. And so do you.

906
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,664
Wait.

907
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,260
How long are we supposed to wait?

908
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,307
This is Freeway's hair.

909
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,687
Keep this close to your heart.

910
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,682
Freeway will feel our concern.

911
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,187
Are we supposed to sleep with this?

912
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,397
Makes sense to me.

913
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,447
Could I have mine in a baggie?

914
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,116
- Sure.
- Thanks.

915
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,201
Carmen, why are you getting her hopes up?

916
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,295
Gypsy trick.

917
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,122
So you're leaving in the morning, aren't you?

918
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,297
I have to. I'd stay if I could.

919
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,757
Violet is expecting you.

920
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,552
No, not Violet. I have patients to see.

921
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,798
My people have a saying.

922
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,758
"Those who don't push the caravan
from the muck

923
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,389
"become one with the muck."

924
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,514
Thank you. That's very understanding.

925
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,736
Good-bye.

926
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,361
Beth, what are you doing?

927
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:05,164
I'm looking for those night-vision glasses
I got you for Christmas.

928
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,832
They're probably still in the same box.

929
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,500
Beth, you have to get some rest.

930
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,920
You heard Miss Luminitska.

931
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,042
Let me get you a Xanax.

932
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,213
You think it's impossible

933
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,257
Carmen might actually know
something you don't?

934
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,381
About Freeway? Doubtful.

935
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,677
Unless she kidnapped him.

936
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,342
She's given me hope. Maybe she has a gift.
And unlike you,

937
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,766
I don't think
I know everything about everything.

938
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,012
Why are you turning on me?
I didn't commit a crime.

939
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,810
There are a few pivotal moments
in a person's life,

940
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:32,813
where one reacts
exactly right or completely wrong.

941
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,357
I forgot the whistle.

942
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,438
But that's not what I'm talking about.

943
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,656
This is a difficult time for you.
For both of us.

944
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,157
And especially for a woman,

945
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,284
there are physical changes
that affect everything.

946
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,458
Tell me about being a woman.

947
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,211
I think that the anger you're feeling
is not actually about me. It's hormonal.

948
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,873
No, it's not menopause.

949
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,957
It actually is about you.

950
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,475
Zee men in my family have a geeft.

951
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:21,323
<i>They find things
that no one else can find, gadje.</i>

952
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,569
<i>Gadje.</i>

953
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,464
- Hello?
- Dad.

954
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,843
Grace. Gracie, you surprised me.

955
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,971
<i>- What do you mean?
- Well, it's 5:00 in the morning here.</i>

956
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,518
<i>- It is?
- Yeah</i>

957
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:16,223
<i>Oh, God, you're right.
I counted wrong. Go back to sleep.</i>

958
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,774
No, no, no, no. I was up.

959
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,192
Tell me about Bora-Bora.

960
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,393
Amazing.

961
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,567
You've got to come here someday.

962
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,740
Dad, Sam and I can't stop talking
about the wedding.

963
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,487
It was just what we hoped.

964
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,568
And I know you didn't want Freeway
in the ceremony,

965
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,030
but you have to admit, it was sweet.

966
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,238
<i>How's Mom?</i>

967
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,541
She's great. She's fine.

968
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:39,211
<i>Really? Is she doing okay? No big letdown?</i>

969
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,381
She's relieved
that Sam took you off our hands.

970
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,917
When are you going back?

971
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,256
<i>Later on.</i>

972
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,093
<i>Okay, well, we're going to dinner,
but I want to talk to Mom.</i>

973
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,388
Call her when you wake up.

974
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,808
<i>- Okay, give her a hug for me.
- Sure.</i>

975
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:56,934
And give Freeway some of that salmon
that fell on the floor. He's earned it.

976
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:00,066
You got it, cookie. You just have fun.

977
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,188
<i>Okay, love you.</i>

978
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,066
I love you. Bye.

979
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,281
Hello?

980
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:57,699
I thought so.

981
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,787
Thanks.

982
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,372
This is good.

983
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,923
I was picturing a waterfall.

984
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,501
Now a hiker saw a dog
above Bear Creek Falls.

985
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,050
There's a reason you stayed,

986
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,640
but it's not the one you think.

987
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,268
No, I stayed to help find the dog.

988
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,141
Good.

989
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,772
Russell will need your help
finding the redheaded woman.

990
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,567
I'm supposed to find the redheaded woman?

991
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,024
Yes, it will take both of you to do it.

992
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:34,280
Okay. Where are we supposed to look?

993
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,034
I'm seeing a green house...

994
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,952
No, yellow. It's unclear.

995
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,877
- On a street named for a tree.
- Okay.

996
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,255
A tree.
Well, yeah, I'm gonna head up to Bear Creek.

997
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,505
Yeah, I'm gonna go with you.

998
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,753
Well, not with that knee.

999
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,968
No, you, please, come with me.
I need your help.

1000
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,341
Well, I could go with Beth.

1001
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,266
Or I could stick with Russell.

1002
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:58,926
I don't mind going alone.

1003
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,265
No.

1004
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,780
Hey, Joseph.

1005
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,451
Freeway!

1006
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,587
I don't understand
why you're not talking to me.

1007
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:38,428
I came back
because I wanted to be here for you.

1008
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,678
I understand searching for Freeway.

1009
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,980
But this Carmen crap?

1010
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,974
It's voodoo.

1011
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,895
But if another day of searching
is gonna make you feel better,

1012
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,480
I'm here to support you.

1013
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,942
Could we just not talk for a while?

1014
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,025
I don't need to talk.

1015
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,582
I think it's good for two people

1016
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,536
to have quiet time together,

1017
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:10,794
to heal, to smooth out the feathers
or whatever.

1018
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,016
Grace called.

1019
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,263
- What?
- Yeah.

1020
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,015
- When?
- This morning. You were sleeping.

1021
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,563
You didn't tell her about Freeway, did you?

1022
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,727
Of course not.

1023
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,643
- What did she say?
- They're having a great time.

1024
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,194
They loved the wedding.

1025
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,821
Anything else?

1026
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,315
She asked how you're doing.

1027
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,658
Excuse me. Sorry.

1028
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,945
Oh, hey!

1029
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,121
You didn't happen
to see a dog up there, did you?

1030
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,040
- Yeah.
- You did?

1031
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,748
Like that?

1032
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,916
Yeah, could be.

1033
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,462
Where exactly does this trail go?

1034
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,215
It heads up towards Purgatory,
then loops back.

1035
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,092
- Come on.
- Lt loops back? How is it?

1036
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,468
It's radical.

1037
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:11,942
Do you think you'll ever get married?

1038
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,520
Perhaps.

1039
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,651
I'm sure you have no trouble attracting men.

1040
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,609
They swarm like flies, but who wants a fly?

1041
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,788
I'm a passionate woman.
It's not easy to find a man

1042
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,831
who can keep up with me sexually.

1043
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,001
- Yeah, it's tough for women like us.
- Yeah.

1044
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,205
There was one. But he was a pickpocket.

1045
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,665
My family would not tolerate that.

1046
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,547
- No, of course not.
- It's not steady work.

1047
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,843
Russell is very cheerful.

1048
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,424
Can he keep up with you?

1049
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,727
Why do you think he's so cheerful?

1050
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:10,914
Do you want me to get that?

1051
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,249
I got it.

1052
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,838
Okay.

1053
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,134
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?

1054
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,337
Right now?

1055
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,054
We're way the hell up toward Purgatory.

1056
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,223
Where's that?

1057
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,301
<i>Above Bear Creek.</i>

1058
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,770
Yeah, we met a guy who saw a dog.

1059
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,769
Okay, you sound
like you're having a heart attack.

1060
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,066
<i>- Let me talk to Beth.
- Hold on.</i>

1061
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,027
- Beth.
- What?

1062
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,945
- Penny, for you.
- Okay.

1063
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,692
<i>- Hi, Penny.
- He sounds terrible.</i>

1064
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,244
No matter what you're feeling, don't kill him.

1065
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,321
<i>Where are you, anyway?</i>

1066
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,786
I'm underneath the gondola.

1067
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:53,244
Carmen had a vision
about porta-potties and took off.

1068
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,829
I think she's coming back.

1069
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,505
<i>Don't worry, I'll check in with you in an hour.</i>

1070
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,919
Don't drink that so fast.

1071
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,382
That's drinking too much.

1072
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,430
God, really.

1073
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,508
Careful.

1074
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,185
I love this.

1075
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,434
We're on the job, like those cop partners.

1076
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,311
I'm the grizzled old guy,
and you're the young kid

1077
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,017
who thinks he knows everything.

1078
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,104
You mean the one the older one resents
'cause the younger one's actually smarter?

1079
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,690
Yeah, until you save my life.

1080
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,070
You know, Carmen said there was...

1081
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,947
The house was either yellow or green.

1082
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,369
I don't know. Maybe she's confused.

1083
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,867
Yeah, maybe she's really a Gypsy.

1084
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,450
You think she's faking?

1085
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,536
Beautiful women get away with a lot of shit.

1086
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,880
Hello?

1087
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,707
Carmen?

1088
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,176
I am not sure about the color of the house.

1089
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,798
I'm getting mixed messages.

1090
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,255
Something about blue.

1091
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,885
Blue, okay.

1092
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,974
Don't lose faith.

1093
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,347
Hello? Carmen?

1094
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,975
- What?
- She's getting mixed messages,

1095
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,431
something about blue.

1096
00:57:55,514 --> 00:58:00,896
Okay.

1097
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,566
God, maybe we should have just taken...
I don't know, the other trail.

1098
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,192
- The one that went up'? No, no, no.
- No, because...

1099
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,651
If we'd done that,
we'd be sleeping out here tonight.

1100
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,986
No, we've got to get down.

1101
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,241
But we don't know where we are,

1102
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,368
so maybe we should backtrack or...
I don't know.

1103
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,744
No, no, no, no, no.

1104
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,918
Dear, we've been out here
for about five hours.

1105
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,501
- Yeah.
- It'll take at least that long

1106
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,079
to get back by backtracking.

1107
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,914
- How do you know?
- It's almost 4:00 now. It's gonna be dark

1108
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,545
- in a couple of hours...
- I know it's gonna be dark,

1109
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,173
but how do you know this is going down
and not just deeper into the woods?

1110
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,346
- We're following the creek.
- I think we should call someone.

1111
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,889
Creeks always run downhill.

1112
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,511
I think we should call someone.

1113
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,058
What? And say what?

1114
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,932
- And say that we're lost.
- We're not lost.

1115
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,183
- Oh, God.
- Honey, look, look.

1116
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,684
- See over there?
- What? Yeah.

1117
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,106
There. That's Mount Wilson.

1118
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,934
Yeah, which means what?
You can see Mount Wilson from Utah.

1119
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,645
Oh, shit.

1120
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,988
My battery is way down.

1121
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,565
Please, come on, come on.

1122
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,196
- What are you gonna say?
- Well, I'm just gonna tell them

1123
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,823
that if they haven't heard from us in an hour,

1124
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,119
they should call Search and Rescue.

1125
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,581
That's embarrassing. You're panicking.

1126
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,416
<i>- Penny!
- Hi.</i>

1127
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,914
<i>Penny, oh, God. Thank God.
No, I'm so happy.</i>

1128
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,167
<i>Listen, I just didn't think
this phone was gonna work.</i>

1129
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,132
<i>- Where are you guys?
- I don't know. I think we're lost.</i>

1130
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,505
<i>Listen, if you don't hear from us in an hour...</i>

1131
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,636
Penny?

1132
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,055
Penny? Oh, shoot!

1133
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,469
Beth?

1134
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,009
Beth?

1135
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,059
Lost...

1136
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,729
The phone is dead, honey.
Can you please turn yours on, quick?

1137
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:19,849
Shoot.

1138
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,023
Damn. It's already on. I forgot to turn it off.

1139
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,991
- Yeah?
- Joseph, what happened?

1140
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,742
<i>Penny, listen, listen, I've got to talk fast.</i>

1141
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:34,113
There's no reason to panic,
but we got Mount Wilson on our left,

1142
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,449
and we started out from Bear Creek,
so that means that right now,

1143
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,284
we are somewhere between those two...
Penny?

1144
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,415
Joseph?

1145
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,837
Joseph!

1146
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,792
Shit, Shit.

1147
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,127
Shit!

1148
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,883
You're panicking.

1149
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,721
What made her call right then,
right when we were talking about her?

1150
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,802
Gypsy shit.

1151
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,478
It's weird.

1152
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,946
Hi. How are you?

1153
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,819
Did Hector send you guys?

1154
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,283
No, no, we lost our dog.

1155
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,782
And we heard you might
have seen him, you know?

1156
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,201
Blue, behave. Blue.

1157
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,747
I seen this poster,
but I don't recall seeing Freeway his self.

1158
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,955
Let me think. You know what?

1159
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,085
Ever heard of Christus Bonheur?

1160
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,715
No, ma'am.

1161
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,381
Your dad's a charmer. Watch and learn.

1162
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,636
Yes, ma'am.

1163
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,718
I could tell you two was father and son
right away.

1164
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,220
You're so much alike.

1165
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,802
- Christus...
- Christus Bonheur,

1166
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,434
a stone-cold psycho, if you want to know.

1167
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:44,813
That degenerate's always got a bunch
of loose dogs hanging around.

1168
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,690
Seen him in town the other day,
which is unusual.

1169
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,237
Now, where could we find him, ma'am?

1170
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,657
He's got a filthy shack halfway to nowhere.

1171
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:56,327
You know where
you turn off North Fork to Rattlesnake Trail?

1172
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,076
Up behind 17 Heifers?

1173
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,203
17 Heifers? Yeah, I know where that is.

1174
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,376
Much obliged, ma'am.

1175
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,667
Blue.

1176
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,995
All right, thank you, ma'am.

1177
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,625
Hey, if you hit Squirrel Head,
you gone too far.

1178
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:07,831
Okay.

1179
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,052
All right.
You know how to lay on the charm, Russell.

1180
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,471
I just all of a sudden had a Southern accent.

1181
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,061
Did you ever hear of floaters?

1182
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,361
Yeah, in your eye?

1183
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,984
I never heard of them till last week.

1184
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,781
Now I got 'em for the rest of my life.

1185
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,360
It's no big deal. Older people get them.

1186
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,070
It's fine. Your brain will adjust.

1187
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,997
You won't even notice them.

1188
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,370
You know, I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

1189
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,123
You think maybe we should
get a deputy or something?

1190
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:50,129
No, we're just gonna go up there
and talk to old Christus, man-to-man.

1191
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,209
You mean, stone-cold-psycho-to-man?

1192
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,215
Well, my experience...

1193
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,137
And I've been around quite a bit, Bryan...

1194
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,386
Is that most people don't want trouble.

1195
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,469
In fact, old Christus will probably be happy
to have some company.

1196
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,636
Maybe.

1197
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,189
My father left us for one of his students,

1198
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,517
never lifted a finger for Penny or me.

1199
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,898
And the guy is an ethics professor.

1200
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,651
Hadn't been for Joseph,
I couldn't have gone to medical school.

1201
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,108
I bet you wish
your mom was dating a millionaire, huh?

1202
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,944
Not a millionaire, Russell, okay?
Just someone who's making a living.

1203
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,155
I mean, Mom worked hard
for that buyout money.

1204
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,115
She shouldn't have to support you with it.

1205
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:26,372
What happens if the Pigeon and the Truck
doesn't make any money, huh?

1206
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,124
Do you actually know anyone
who likes warm beer?

1207
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,917
It'll all work out. It always does.

1208
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,088
No, it doesn't!

1209
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,713
I love your mother,
and I'm gonna take care of her.

1210
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:37,171
And I've been working since I was 15,
so I can always find a job.

1211
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,052
And the pub is gonna do just great,

1212
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,632
but you shouldn't feel
any pressure to buy in.

1213
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,096
Well, I don't.

1214
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,928
Yeah, well, I think everybody who invests
is gonna make a lot of money.

1215
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,015
Why? Why? 'Cause anything's possible?

1216
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,022
That's my motto. Anything's possible.

1217
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,195
Snake!

1218
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,946
He's leaving. Don't piss him off.

1219
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,369
You got to relax.

1220
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,393
We've got no flashlight.
We've got no clothes. We've got nothing.

1221
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,061
It was hot and sunny when we left.

1222
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,598
You said we were only gonna be gone
a couple of hours...

1223
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,730
Right, it's my fault.
Look, we both screwed up, okay?

1224
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,312
Why can't you ever admit
you've made a mistake?

1225
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:39,025
No, I guess it's genetically impossible,
given your father.

1226
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,986
- I'm not like him.
- Well, then name one mistake you've made.

1227
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,820
Besides coming out here with you?

1228
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,951
I don't think in terms of mistakes.

1229
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,251
I take responsibility for everything.
That's what doctors do.

1230
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,036
That's right. I forgot. You're a doctor.

1231
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,837
You hadn't mentioned
it in the last eight minutes.

1232
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,165
Here we go. "Doctors think they're gods."

1233
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,671
"Doctors are self-absorbed egomaniacs."

1234
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,004
- And full of shit.
- Doctors are full of shit?

1235
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,807
No, I am not talking about doctors.
I am talking about you.

1236
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:09,312
Have I ever put my work
before you or the girls?

1237
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,856
Okay, sometimes.

1238
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:20,907
When I'm doing surgery on someone's spine
to relieve them of a life of pain,

1239
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,861
I have put my work first.

1240
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,287
The girls always understood,
and they never complained.

1241
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,448
Were we living in the same house?

1242
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,623
- You see Freeway?
- No.

1243
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,593
Wait, wait. The dogs are coming.

1244
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,257
They're right there.

1245
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,134
Stand slowly.

1246
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:46,883
Don't move too fast.

1247
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,889
- Hey, buddies!
- Hi, buddies.

1248
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,891
- Hey.
- Hi, Guys.

1249
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,439
- Beautiful. What a sweetheart.
- Yep.

1250
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,121
Shut Up!

1251
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,962
Mr. Bonheur, I'm Bryan. This is Russell.

1252
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,586
Yeah, we don't mean to bother you,
but we're looking for a dog.

1253
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,090
These is my dogs.

1254
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,964
And a handsome bunch they are, too.

1255
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,422
Yeah, we thought maybe our dog
had wandered up here and fallen in love.

1256
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:28,475
- He didn't.
- Okay, well, we knew we'd be intruding,

1257
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,724
so we got you a little something

1258
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,431
in the hopes that you might show us around.

1259
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:35,766
Now, we didn't know what you drink,

1260
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,353
but most men enjoy
a good scotch whiskey, so...

1261
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,608
Get off my land.

1262
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,281
It's not a single malt,

1263
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,951
because people who drink that
don't do it for the taste.

1264
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,404
They do it to make a statement
about who they are.

1265
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,535
But for you, sir, that is not an issue.

1266
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,545
Shut Up!

1267
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,391
Now get the hell out of here.

1268
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,404
Hold it, ass-wipe.

1269
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,902
Don't make me get out my shotgun.

1270
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,035
Don't make me get out my Glock.

1271
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,915
Freeway!

1272
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,916
- Get off me!
- Jeez, you stink!

1273
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,588
Freeway!

1274
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,418
Shit.

1275
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,842
There are two things
that I won't allow in my pub,

1276
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,973
and that's a troublemaker
and a man who stinks.

1277
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,351
So if you're ever in Omaha,

1278
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,606
you stay away
from the Partridge and the Plough!

1279
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,698
I don't think
I can be this close to you much longer.

1280
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,199
Shut Up!

1281
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,038
Russell!

1282
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:20,787
Let's go! Come on!

1283
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,189
Shit. Russell?

1284
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,988
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1285
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,331
Get me to a shower.

1286
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,243
Come on.

1287
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,380
Man, figures the son of a bitch
went to Harvard.

1288
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,959
They always got to let you know
about it too, don't they?

1289
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:18,974
Look at that.

1290
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,430
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

1291
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,106
What are they?

1292
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,354
Those are rams, and they can be nasty.

1293
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,936
But aren't they goats? Goats are small.

1294
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,771
- No, they're sheep.
- Do they bite?

1295
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,276
- No, they ram.
- Oh, my God.

1296
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,652
But they can be controlled.

1297
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,362
Little dogs control them just by yapping.

1298
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,906
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1299
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,449
I'll scare them off. You go back and hide.

1300
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:36,867
- Right now?
- Stay hidden, yes.

1301
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,072
- Okay, but are you all right?
- I'll be fine.

1302
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,203
Okay, all right.

1303
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,747
Oh, God! Be careful!

1304
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,078
I'll take care of it.

1305
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,750
Go away!

1306
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,551
Hey, go on with you! Go!

1307
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,341
Go back!

1308
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,594
Go back to your friends!

1309
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,008
Flock!

1310
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,513
Flock! Go back to your flock!

1311
01:08:58,926 --> 01:08:59,973
Go back!

1312
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,100
Are they leaving?

1313
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,730
Not yet.

1314
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,029
Honey, did it work?

1315
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,161
- Honey?
- Oh, shit!

1316
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,658
No!

1317
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,115
Oh, careful!

1318
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:30,879
Thank God you're all right!

1319
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,551
Of course we're okay.

1320
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:33,879
Hi, sweetheart.

1321
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:36,347
Oh, my God. What happened?

1322
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,390
It's a long story. What's wrong?

1323
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,184
Beth and Joseph are lost.

1324
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,682
Search and Rescue is looking for them.

1325
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:45,311
I'm sure Beth and Joseph are fine.

1326
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,484
- Was I right about these two?
- Yes.

1327
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,105
Beth and Joseph are cold and wet,

1328
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,438
but they'll be back here shortly.

1329
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,693
I made soup. Go in.

1330
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,615
- Thank you.
- Get some.

1331
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,785
I know. I'll tell you about it.

1332
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,547
Hold on! Let's head back up!

1333
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,000
We got to be well past the rams by now!

1334
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,508
All right. Honey, watch your step.

1335
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,346
It's slippery here!

1336
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:18,969
Hold on!

1337
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,971
Will you slow down a little bit?

1338
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,684
Oh, God.

1339
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,637
- I don't want to lose you.
- No.

1340
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,821
Let's head back up! Back to the trail!

1341
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,569
Okay. But, here, wait.

1342
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,151
Just grab hold of this branch right here
before you step!

1343
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,531
Right this way.

1344
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,112
Right here!

1345
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,786
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

1346
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,010
Oh, God! No, Joseph, are you okay?

1347
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:58,672
Where are you?

1348
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,390
God!

1349
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,390
Joseph, I'm coming!

1350
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,687
Joe! I'm coming!

1351
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,857
What is it? What's wrong?

1352
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,439
Tell me!

1353
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,694
I'm sorry!

1354
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,109
My shoulder.

1355
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,662
- You're gonna have to put it back.
- Put it back?

1356
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,205
- It's dislocated.
- What?

1357
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,999
You have to put the humerus
back into the glenoid socket.

1358
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,747
No, no, no, really, I cannot do that.

1359
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,544
Let's just get you to the hospital, all right?

1360
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:34,545
No, you have to do it now,
before the muscles tighten.

1361
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,548
All right, just, what about your arm?

1362
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,676
What if it ruins it?
What if you never operate again, Joe?

1363
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,007
- Honey. ..
- You can do it.

1364
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,638
You just have to do exactly what I say.

1365
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,014
- All right?
- Yes.

1366
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,016
First, get me sitting.

1367
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,439
Okay.

1368
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,725
All right, honey.

1369
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:01,280
All right, now I need you to bend this arm

1370
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:03,487
until it's in a right angle.

1371
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,116
Are you sure about this?

1372
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:09,201
Now, pay attention.
I'm going to help you, all right?

1373
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:12,708
Now hold one hand there.

1374
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:17,087
Lift into the right angle
with the other hand, all right?

1375
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,009
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1376
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,679
Beth, I want you to ignore me

1377
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,849
no matter how much I scream, all right?

1378
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:25,925
Ignore your screams?

1379
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,602
Yes, yes. Just go ahead.

1380
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,305
- Okay.
- All right.

1381
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,934
- Stop, stop! You're killing me!
- Okay, okay! I'm sorry!

1382
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,236
- I told you to ignore me!
- I know!

1383
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,110
So ignore when you say stop, right?

1384
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,408
Yes, ignore me. Keep going.

1385
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:45,282
- All right, I'm going!
- All right, that's it. That a girl!

1386
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,079
Okay, okay, okay, okay, all right, all right.

1387
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,373
There. Now, now, yes, I got it.

1388
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,418
All right, now I want you to push the arm

1389
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:55,463
into my side, okay,
till it's flush with my body.

1390
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,207
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1391
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,292
Shit, Shit, shit, shit!

1392
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,969
- There?
- Yeah.

1393
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,466
That's good. That's good.

1394
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,550
- All right. Is it back in?
- No.

1395
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,100
Now is the hard part.

1396
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,428
That wasn't the hard part?

1397
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,060
Honey, take my wrist here.

1398
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:17,144
Rotate the arm
away from my body until I say stop.

1399
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,728
Wait.

1400
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,360
So ignore...
Don't ignore you what you say this time?

1401
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,282
No, yes. Yes, don't... Don't ignore.

1402
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,700
Yes, I understand. I understand.

1403
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,573
- Okay, here we go.
- Go.

1404
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,581
- Yes?
- Stop, all right.

1405
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,533
- Okay, stop.
- All right.

1406
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:36,667
Now you're going to put my arm

1407
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,590
back in the socket, all right?

1408
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,088
So what do... I'm gonna do that.

1409
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,841
- Yeah. Good girl.
- Just tell me what it is, exactly.

1410
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,513
- I want you to put all your weight...
- I'm gonna put...

1411
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:46,840
Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,266
- Put all your weight...
- I'm trying, yes.

1413
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:51,936
...In the crook of my arm.
Push down. Lean in to me.

1414
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,638
It's gonna take all you've got, all right?

1415
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:54,938
- But you can do it.
- Yes, I can.

1416
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,266
All right, until it pops back in.

1417
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,396
Okay, Joe.

1418
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,944
Now lean. Go ahead. Go.

1419
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,275
Is that...

1420
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,780
I got it, Joe?

1421
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,238
That was it, wasn't it?
Okay, hon, I got it, right?

1422
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,203
Joe, honey, Joe?

1423
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,499
Oh, my God, Joe.

1424
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,040
Joe?

1425
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:19,998
That worked.

1426
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,923
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

1427
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,297
- Really?
- Sure.

1428
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,216
Are you cold?

1429
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,891
No, no, I'm fine.

1430
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,177
Are you worried?

1431
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:35,472
A little.

1432
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,939
You?

1433
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,778
As you know, I'm a doctor.

1434
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:51,070
Is that a house?

1435
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,494
It is. Yeah.

1436
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,249
Okay, honey.

1437
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,084
Hello?

1438
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,007
- Hello!
- Hello!

1439
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,885
It's nice in there.

1440
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,462
It looks like a good place.

1441
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,172
Please! Hello!

1442
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,553
Hello! Help! Help!

1443
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,642
Okay, okay. I got it.

1444
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,393
Should I do that?

1445
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,096
- Should I really do this?
- Yeah.

1446
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:18,601
Okay.

1447
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,857
Okay, honey, okay, this is a bigger rock.

1448
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,108
I think this should do it.

1449
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,114
Back off! Back away!

1450
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,288
I'd tell you to watch out for flying glass,

1451
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,290
if I thought there'd be any.

1452
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:38,708
Never mind!

1453
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,086
I can't believe it!

1454
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,585
I can't believe that I'm not strong enough
to break a window.

1455
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,041
No, no, you're strong enough.

1456
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,876
I think this has to be tempered glass,
that's why...

1457
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,132
What is it?
Are all the windows here tempered?

1458
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,719
So wait a second now. Wait.
Okay, should I do this?

1459
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,675
Yeah, but be careful. Watch your hand.

1460
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,181
Okay, here I go!

1461
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:58,683
- Oh, God.
- Hello?

1462
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:01,892
- Careful of your hand!
- Okay, okay, all right.

1463
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,103
Oh, my God, honey. Are you all right?

1464
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:06,654
All right, now...

1465
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,573
Oh, my God. Hello?

1466
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,446
Hello?

1467
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,993
Oh, my God.

1468
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:16,614
Hello?

1469
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,132
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

1470
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:38,678
Okay.

1471
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,184
I like their wine.

1472
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,312
Yeah, it's pretty good. Let's keep the label.

1473
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,353
Should we?

1474
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:55,779
Okay?

1475
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,033
Yeah?

1476
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:00,370
Delicious.

1477
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,292
- How come we never have these?
- We have.

1478
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,915
Really? I have no recollection.

1479
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,246
That's because you're in shock.

1480
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:06,455
Your shoulder, honey.

1481
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,000
- I know we haven't...
- Oh, my God!

1482
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,382
Lower that weapon, deputy dog.

1483
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,757
I had a feeling it'd be you guys.

1484
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,469
You know the whole damn county
has been out looking for you?

1485
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,095
How did you find us?

1486
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,347
Silent alarm.

1487
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,807
Would you let me through?

1488
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,233
Damn it. God.

1489
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,903
We got 'em! We got...

1490
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,981
No, they look great. They're in their pajamas.

1491
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,817
Are you guys Okay?

1492
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,276
Yeah, they're okay. Yeah, okay.

1493
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,612
No, I have to go. Yeah, I'll tell 'em!

1494
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:38,947
You scared the shit out of us.

1495
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,993
- Buddy...
- No, no, don't touch him. No.

1496
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,544
You know, he fell down.

1497
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,996
Poor guy.

1498
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,422
He hurt his shoulder.

1499
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,333
Well...

1500
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,662
Okay, here we go.

1501
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:13,670
Look at that.

1502
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,464
French toast.

1503
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,259
Clear!

1504
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,053
Nourishment. That's what we need.

1505
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:23,600
And a side of Lipitor, please.

1506
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:24,928
Come on. Eat, Beth, eat.

1507
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,262
- I can't. ..
- Last day.

1508
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,140
Last day, right, your last day.

1509
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,313
Sweetie, we've got to get back.

1510
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,894
You guys have been
more than generous already.

1511
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,984
We all have to get back to our lives.

1512
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,485
I think we're gonna find Freeway today.

1513
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:38,903
I don't know. Maybe.

1514
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,576
Well, honey, you found him once.

1515
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,488
Yeah, but that storm last night,
it was just so bad.

1516
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,077
So what's the plan?
Carmen, what do you got for us?

1517
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,951
Only one thing.

1518
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,378
When I put the bacon in this pan,

1519
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:54,332
I saw Freeway come out
of Lawson's Hill at Pioneer's Turn.

1520
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:55,758
He wanted to cross the highway.

1521
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,050
Cut the crap.

1522
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,298
Beth...

1523
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:01,176
Your visions sent us all over hell yesterday.

1524
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,552
Joseph got hurt.

1525
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,134
And what about Bryan and Russell
risking their lives

1526
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,471
because of some ridiculous
redheaded woman who knew nothing.

1527
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,056
Not one thing you've said has been right.

1528
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,186
Some were close.

1529
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:12,983
I understand you don't believe me.

1530
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,937
But you must believe
Freeway is out there somewhere.

1531
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,146
Is this a Gypsy thing,

1532
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,607
manipulating people
when they're at their most vulnerable?

1533
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:22,368
- Come on, Beth. She's trying to help.
- Don't defend me.

1534
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,911
You have to stay focused.

1535
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,780
The moment you lose hope

1536
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,787
is the moment your chances
of getting him back disappear.

1537
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,836
- You have to have hope.
- That's all we've got.

1538
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,332
That's all you need.

1539
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:37,508
<i>Don't you think Freeway wants to find you
as much as you want to find him?</i>

1540
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,127
I hope he's better at it than we are.

1541
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,801
We can't get discouraged, guys.
We got to stay positive.

1542
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,101
Hi? Hello?

1543
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,270
Carol.

1544
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,519
No, we haven't found him.

1545
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,980
Where?

1546
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,232
The gas station?

1547
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,318
That's near Pioneer Turn.

1548
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,906
Oh, my God, okay. So, 10 minutes ago?

1549
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,954
You saw him in the frying pan?

1550
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,199
You are one freaky caretaker.

1551
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:13,331
Listen, I lost a pair of really nice
horn-rimmed reading glasses last February.

1552
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,208
Maybe you could check the French toast?

1553
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,880
Just get the whistles! Grab a whistle!

1554
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,424
Thank you, Carol.
Thank you so much for calling, really.

1555
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,968
Oh, my God.

1556
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:24,384
Carmen, oh, look. I really... I'm sorry.

1557
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,689
Let's go up to Pioneer Turn.

1558
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,281
Sorry, bump)'-

1559
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,207
Mom called last night
when everyone was lost in the storm.

1560
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,875
I told her you were hiking.

1561
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,703
I'll call her today.

1562
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:58,084
Did she say anything about the wedding?

1563
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,211
She thought it was lovely.

1564
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,134
She said the food gave her gout.

1565
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,427
That's your mother.

1566
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,176
- Hey, she's your grandmother.
- Meaning what'?

1567
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,307
Meaning the dark side is strong in all of us.

1568
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,555
By the way, Joseph,

1569
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,352
it's your turn to go to Phoenix.

1570
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,221
Don't I get credit for the wedding?

1571
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:18,150
No, because you put her at my table
with Sam's parents.

1572
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:21,354
She asked Numendra
what he was in his last life.

1573
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,572
All right, Mom. I will go with you next time.

1574
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,399
Nobody should have to go
through that alone.

1575
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,825
Thank you.

1576
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,618
Russell offered to go with me.

1577
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,037
He's good with difficult people.

1578
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,034
I've noticed.

1579
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:33,536
The guy's pretty fearless.

1580
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,594
No luck.

1581
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:47,675
You want to come with me?

1582
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,516
You take a knife
and you cut into people's backs.

1583
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:52,889
How can you do that?

1584
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,185
They're asleep.

1585
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,059
That must take large cojones.

1586
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,315
Well, they trained me to do it.

1587
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,859
But, yes, I have large cojones.

1588
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,276
How long did it take?

1589
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:08,609
It's four years of medical school,
five-year residency,

1590
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,411
- and a two-year fellowship.
- Eleven years?

1591
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,493
Yeah, after college.

1592
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,332
What?

1593
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,831
When did they start calling you doctor?

1594
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,165
About 10 years ago, after med school.

1595
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,593
Maybe I should call you doctor.

1596
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:41,517
I just hate
the thought of leaving Beth up here alone.

1597
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:45,024
I told her,
come home for a few days, recharge,

1598
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,525
and we'll come back on the weekend.

1599
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,699
She's afraid the search will end if she leaves.

1600
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,367
But everyone's on the lookout.

1601
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,035
If he's out there, somebody will spot him.

1602
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,578
If he's out there.

1603
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,373
Okay, I'll go home with you tomorrow.

1604
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,578
I will.

1605
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:03,876
Anyway...

1606
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:06,876
Hi, sweetie.

1607
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,337
We're just having coffee
before we head out again.

1608
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,342
Okay, look, Carmen says, don't give up hope.

1609
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,547
<i>Wait, I'm gonna put you on the speaker.</i>

1610
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:14,049
Okay.

1611
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:16,809
Okay. We're all here.

1612
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,893
Carmen says Freeway
really wants to come in,

1613
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:21,474
but he's got to hear a friendly voice.

1614
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:24,901
Okay, what... Don't laugh. Wait a second.

1615
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:27,404
<i>- Okay.
- So...</i>

1616
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,490
Carmen has a strong feeling
about a basketball court.

1617
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,652
Okay, okay.

1618
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,870
Now, there are two basketball courts in town.
We're going to the high school.

1619
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:37,539
Can you guys cover the one in Town Park?

1620
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,618
- Town Park.
- Town Park, okay, okay.

1621
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,499
- All right, we're going to Town Park.
- Town Park.

1622
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:57,009
He's been gone two days,
so if you see a dog like this...

1623
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,266
Okay, well, no, your hands are full.

1624
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:01,938
Okay, well, thanks anyway. I appreciate it.

1625
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,436
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, bye-bye, guys.

1626
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,563
- Have a good picnic now.
- Smells good.

1627
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,144
Come on, darling.

1628
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:18,993
Freeway!

1629
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,416
Freeway, come on in!

1630
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,465
I can hardly remember the wedding.

1631
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,003
- Everyone loved it.
- They did?

1632
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,300
Especially my mother. It gave her gout.

1633
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:40,227
I'll bet you remember
how beautiful Grace looked.

1634
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,645
Yeah, and Ellie.

1635
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,893
Ellie, too.

1636
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,974
We're gonna have another doctor
in the family.

1637
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,184
Wow.

1638
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:49,861
Ethan could use a cousin.

1639
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,233
They should get right on that.

1640
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:52,986
Yeah, so to speak.

1641
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:56,410
I told Grace to throw away her pills
two months ago.

1642
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,658
I'm sorry I forgot the dog whistle.

1643
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,954
That wasn't it.

1644
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,835
No, I know.

1645
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,087
I'm gonna try to be better.

1646
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,461
I can't promise you I'll be much different.

1647
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,922
It may be a little late for that.

1648
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,221
I'm gonna try to calm down.

1649
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,353
You can't help it.

1650
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:25,723
It's a jolt finding ourselves like this.

1651
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:27,891
Like what?

1652
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:29,810
Not young.

1653
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,028
Oh, my God.

1654
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:36,029
Have you noticed the ages
of the people in the obits?

1655
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:39,157
- It's not funny.
- No, it is funny.

1656
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:42,702
I was thinking,
maybe we ought to invest in the pub.

1657
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:45,034
Yeah, I was thinking that, too.

1658
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,121
The Partridge and the Plough?

1659
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,171
It's growing on me.

1660
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,966
Doesn't mean I'm gonna drink warm beer.

1661
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,095
- Here, Freeway!
- Hey, buddy!

1662
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,218
Come on! Come on, Freeway!

1663
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,679
- Careful, baby. Careful.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1664
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:07,639
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1665
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:10,567
I was so scared last night.

1666
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,566
Everybody I care about was out in that storm.

1667
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,443
We all made it.

1668
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,282
I'm never letting you out of my sight again.

1669
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,698
Get used to it.

1670
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:27,125
Get used to it.

1671
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,332
You would make a fine husband.

1672
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,468
- For you?
- No. Not for me.

1673
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:38,591
Why not?

1674
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:39,967
It would never work.

1675
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:41,719
I could see the whole thing.

1676
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:42,845
Tell me.

1677
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:48,772
The wedding would be very strange
but funny.

1678
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:53,356
We would have to keep an eye
on my father around Penny.

1679
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:55,563
My mother would disapprove of everything,

1680
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:57,318
but Russell will melt her heart.

1681
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,694
Yeah.

1682
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,281
The sex will be fantastic.

1683
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,456
You will have no problem
keeping up with me.

1684
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,955
You've got good hands.

1685
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,254
They will make me want to devour you.

1686
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,923
Okay, this is all really good.

1687
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,216
What's the problem?

1688
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,549
You will take me to your world
of hospitals and cocktail parties.

1689
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:25,805
You will introduce me
to all your educated friends,

1690
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,511
and they will think,

1691
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:30,222
"Bryan has let his dick make this decision."

1692
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:37,570
I will know what they're thinking,

1693
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:40,490
but that will not bother me.

1694
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:44,195
What will bother me
is being in the wrong place.

1695
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:46,996
You and I will become out of alignment.

1696
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,749
Disaster will follow.

1697
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:56,290
Tell me about the sex again.

1698
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,937
What?

1699
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:19,905
- Okay.
- Vision?

1700
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:26,703
I was thinking, in case one of us drops dead,

1701
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,701
we shouldn't leave anything unsaid.

1702
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,536
I don't want to be in cardiac arrest
thinking I forgot to tell you something.

1703
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,791
Okay, go ahead.

1704
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,088
Okay.

1705
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,711
The girls were really lucky

1706
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,262
when they got you for a mother.

1707
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:49,594
While it's true that every so often,
you get on my nerves,

1708
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:53,306
I just want to say
that the things that bug me about you

1709
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,437
have never meant anything
compared with how much I love you.

1710
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,403
Your turn.

1711
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:08,824
Hey, guys-

1712
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,657
We've reached a conclusion.

1713
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,037
This is nuts.

1714
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:16,245
We've spent three days running around
on the word of a Gypsy psychic.

1715
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,621
Alleged Gypsy psychic.

1716
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,832
Well, it's all we had to go on, so why not?

1717
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:23,585
I know. I'm tired of it. I am. I'm tired of it, too.

1718
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,182
Hello?

1719
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:34,933
Okay.

1720
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,893
Carmen's had another vision.

1721
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:41,273
9:30, Freeway,

1722
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:44,027
between the ice cream parlor and the church.

1723
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,778
- Can we do this?
- Let's go.

1724
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,234
Thank you.

1725
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:48,694
Okay, okay.

1726
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:56,789
I really thought he'd be there.

1727
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,372
What dog goes to church at 9:30?

1728
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,371
He didn't say where he was going?

1729
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,205
Sneaked out before I woke up.

1730
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,636
And he just took your car?

1731
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:50,088
Stole it.

1732
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:52,432
Well, don't worry. He won't get far.

1733
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,934
I got his plane ticket right here.

1734
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,225
You all right?

1735
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:05,945
No, I got it. I got it.

1736
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,864
Here's Bryan now.

1737
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,816
Hi, honey. You made it.

1738
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:14,613
- Hey, Bryan.
- Thanks for everything.

1739
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:18,951
- There he is.
- He's got a dog!

1740
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:21,162
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God.

1741
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:24,919
- I wasn't sure I'd make it.
- Oh, look.

1742
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,124
You're one lucky dog.

1743
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,961
- Carmen, thank you.
- Don't worry. Bye.

1744
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:33,015
- I will keep looking.
- I'll see you on the plane.

1745
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:34,682
Sorry about the car.

1746
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,386
But I had to get to Norwood.

1747
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,564
It was supposed to be his last day.

1748
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:43,391
And you were right.
He was waiting for a man.

1749
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:44,601
But I think he's your dog.

1750
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,569
He doesn't have a name.

1751
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,071
What do you think'? Django junior?

1752
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,324
I think I will call him Doc.

1753
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,935
It's gonna be a little bumpy
till we get over the mountains.

1754
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:21,934
I will never forgive you for this.

1755
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:23,640
This isn't even a real airport.

1756
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,368
There he is! Freeway!

1757
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,697
He's down there! Oh, my God! I can see him!

1758
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,624
- You see him?
- Yes, he's down there. We've got to go back.

1759
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:43,414
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna tell them!

1760
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:45,336
No, no, no.
They're not gonna turn the plane around

1761
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:47,539
because you think you saw a dog.
They'll have you arrested!

1762
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:50,675
Joseph, I saw him.

1763
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,210
What? You saw Freeway?

1764
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:54,178
You saw Freeway!

1765
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:01,849
Oh, my God!

1766
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:07,059
I knew it! We're crashing! We're crashing!

1767
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,064
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

1768
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,146
Wait, are you okay?

1769
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:15,992
- Don't overdo it.
- Good plan, right?

1770
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,444
Okay. I got it.

1771
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:19,662
On three. One, two...

1772
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,708
Oh, God! Help us!

1773
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:29,084
Oh, please, help him!

1774
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:32,466
Hurry, please!

1775
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:34,044
I got it! I got it!

1776
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:35,754
Hold him. I got him.

1777
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,054
It's a hijacking!

1778
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,928
What the hell is going on back there?

1779
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,472
Something happened to my friend!

1780
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,229
Shut Up!

1781
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,643
I don't know.

1782
01:34:46,723 --> 01:34:48,475
- It's the appendix.
- Or it could be a kidney stone!

1783
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,310
Are we gonna die? Tell me the truth!

1784
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,612
No, ma'am, I've got a passenger in distress.

1785
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,652
We have to get this man
to a hospital immediately.

1786
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:56,028
Turn this plane around right now.

1787
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,734
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes!

1788
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:45,119
Look down. Look down.

1789
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,246
Watch your stairs. There we go.

1790
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:48,872
Watch your stairs.

1791
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:50,670
There you go. Nice, deep breaths.

1792
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:56,501
Okay, guys, yeah. Thanks.

1793
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:05,426
All right, here we go.

1794
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,944
Arm around me. Arm around me.
Come on. Come on.

1795
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,494
What's the problem here?

1796
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,073
This one said
that one's appendix was bursting.

1797
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:29,705
No, no, I said I thought it was his appendix,
but now I think more it's a kidney stone.

1798
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,285
You a doctor?

1799
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,586
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1800
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:34,297
You in a lot of pain, Joe?

1801
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:37,751
Well, no question it hurts.
Or rather, it was hurting.

1802
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,757
I feel you, brother. Let's get you to the clinic.

1803
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:42,464
Okay, okay, yeah. Thank you.

1804
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:46,305
Watch your head now.

1805
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,731
Nice work. What do we do now?

1806
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,200
Here! Right here is where I saw him!

1807
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:09,624
Okay, stop!

1808
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,417
No, no, Beth!

1809
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:13,161
Come on!

1810
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,039
Freeway!

1811
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,843
Here, Freeway!

1812
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,340
- Freeway...
- Freeway!

1813
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,172
Come on, Freeway!

1814
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:35,062
- Freeway?
- Here, Freeway!

1815
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:37,777
There! Right there! There they are!

1816
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:41,356
Here's good. Yeah, thanks a million, Sheriff.
We'll never forget this.

1817
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:42,816
Hope it doesn't cause you any problems.

1818
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,409
No one's ever gonna know about it.

1819
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:51,245
Hey, Carmen, wait up!

1820
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:02,130
Freeway!

1821
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,012
- Carmen?
- Bryan?

1822
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,179
Freeway?

1823
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:12,058
Come on, Freeway.

1824
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:14,563
Freeway!

1825
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:16,516
You see him?

1826
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:17,942
I don't know.

1827
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:28,286
Freeway!

1828
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:44,631
Freeway!

1829
01:38:57,557 --> 01:38:58,558
Freeway!

1830
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,991
Freeway!

1831
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:11,363
Freeway!

1832
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,543
Freeway!

1833
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,754
Hello. Look at you.

1834
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:31,219
Freeway, you're back!

1835
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:33,597
I missed you.

1836
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,220
Thank God.

1837
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,317
<i>- Gracie?
- Dad!</i>

1838
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:46,898
<i>Are you guys still in the mountains?</i>

1839
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,824
<i>What's going on?</i>

1840
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:52,325
Well, you know, we're having so much fun.

1841
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:56,453
<i>I'm so glad you guys
took a few days to unwind.</i>

1842
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:58,079
<i>We've been having the best time.</i>

1843
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,211
<i>I love being married.</i>

1844
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:03,172
<i>Dad, how's Freeway?</i>

1845
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,170
Freeway?

1846
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:06,922
Freeway's fine.

1847
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,178
You're back!

1848
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:11,176
You're back. I knew it. I knew it.

1849
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:13,257
Beth, I'm so happy for you.

1850
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:38,129
Shut Up!
