<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Tweeks Team @ Viki </i>

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,420
<i>I will wait until my Daddy comes.</i>

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,230
<i>Soo Jin.</i>

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,790
<i>Soo Jin, let's stop playing hide and seek.</i>

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>You devilish bastard!
It's my Soo Jin! My Soo Jin!</i>

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,320
<i>Oh Mi Sook's murder.
Go Man Seok's murder instigation.</i>

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,110
<i>Park Ho Sik's injury, abduction and so on.</i>

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,580
<i>Happy birthday, Daddy.</i>

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,300
<i>This child is smiling while looking at me.</i>

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,640
<i>For saving Soo Jin today,</i>

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,920
<i>let's call it even with what happened eight years ago.
I want to forgive you.</i>

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,080
<i>That way you will forgive yourself, too.</i>

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,440
<i>Relax your eyeballs now.</i>

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>I'm calling off the auction.</i>

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,330
<i>Cancel it.</i>

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,700
<i>We can just split Moon Il Seok and Hwang Dae Joon.</i>

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,890
<i>There are two days left until Soo Jin's surgery.</i>

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,350
<i>Only if we catch both Moon Il Seok
and Jo Seo Hee before then,</i>

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,780
<i>will I be able to enter Soo Jin's operating
room with my head held high.</i>

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,340
Do you have any concrete evidence
to catch Moon Il Seok?

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,670
Do you think I would dare to come to face you without it?

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,710
I will catch Moon Il Seok, so Congresswoman

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,470
just don't get Moon Il Seok out of jail.
 You just need to stay still.

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,500
After saving my daughter's life,
I will live as if I'm dead for the rest of my life.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,190
Fine.

26
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,400
Thank you.
Thank you, Congresswoman.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,020
Could you give me some proof of your promise?

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,120
Are you saying you want me to
write a statement at least?

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,460
No, nothing like that.

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,350
Since we both made a deal, it's more of a greeting that I look forward to working with you.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,670
How long has it been since we've met for us
that you want to see me again?

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,020
Let's just do it on the phone.

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,740
It would be best if we meet up.

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,910
Just a moment ago, Jang Tae San came to find me.

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,860
It's just as we expected.
They're moving right away.

36
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,160
Since there's not much time.

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,320
It just shows how important the charity auction is.

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,630
How did you predict this?

39
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,210
People really think of others...

40
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,700
make light of people they think are inferior to them.

41
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,400
Since, to them, I was a shadow...

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,840
Being careful with words and actions
 in front of a shadow...

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,930
There is no such person (who does that).

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,650
They didn't even know they would be had like this.

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,900
<i>There are two days until Soo Jin's surgery,</i>

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,460
<i>Only if we catch both Moon Il Seok
and Jo Seo Hee before then,</i>

47
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,060
<i>will I be able to enter Soo Jin's operating
room with my head held high.</i>

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,780
<i>Within 2 days, you're saying we are going
 to catch both Moon Il Seok and Jo Seo Hee?</i>

49
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,130
<i>How?</i>

50
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,820
<i>First, Moon Il Seok.</i>

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,550
<i>Instead of Moon Il Seok, we will drive
Hwang Dae Joon as the culprit.</i>

52
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,680
<i>Hwang Dae Joon?</i>

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,450
<i>Wherever Moon Il Seok goes, he brings
Hwang Dae Joon with him.</i>

54
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,680
<i>Just as when Mi Sook died,
Hwang Dae Joon was with him.</i>

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,760
<i>The knife belongs to Hwa Dae Joon,
and ordering to have my alibi fabricated,</i>

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,260
<i>and also...</i>

57
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,850
<i>today in the hospital, the woman who
 handed out the drinks laced with sleeping pills...</i>

58
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,650
<i>Hwang Dae Joon is sure to have ordered it.</i>

59
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,250
<i>By driving Hwang Dae Joon as the culprit,</i>

60
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,860
<i>and draw out the confession that Moon Il Seok
is the real culprit, is that what you mean?</i>

61
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,180
<i>No.</i>

62
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,310
<i>We're going to make Moon Il Seok
drive Hwang Dae Joon as the culprit.</i>

63
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,440
<i>We're going to make Moon Il Seok
 drive Hwang Dae Joon as the real culprit?</i>

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,360
<i>Yes.</i>

65
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,130
<i>Hwang Dae Joon won't be able
 to betray Moon Il Seok easily.</i>

66
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,850
<i>Since he's been by his side for over 20 years,</i>

67
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,360
<i>He knows that Moon Il Seok never forgives betrayal.</i>

68
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,950
<i>In addition to the fear that he can
be framed as the culprit,</i>

69
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,420
<i>we will have to make him feel betrayal, too.</i>

70
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,360
<i>Sense of betrayal?</i>

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,570
<i>If it's Moon Il Seok, then that could happen.</i>

72
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,220
<i>Then, I will have the detectives investigate
 Hwang Dae Joon as if he were the culprit.</i>

73
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,630
<i>And also,</i>

74
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,160
<i>you just said that Jo Seo Hee's house and
the photo studio was under the same company name, right?</i>

75
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,660
<i>It'll be Moon Il Seok's paper company, for sure.</i>

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,270
<i>Along with the building registration
documents for those two places,</i>

77
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,530
<i>Ah!</i>

78
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,530
<i>I have a telescope, so just get me a camera.</i>

79
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>And when she was captured in the studio,</i>

80
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,040
<i>the video of In Hye I sent you, put it on a CD, please.</i>

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,180
<i>What are you going to do with all of that?</i>

82
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,410
<i>If we can make a second "digital camera" evidence,
we'll be able to catch Jo Seo Hee, too.</i>

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,970
<i>A second "digital camera?"</i>

84
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,180
<i>You want to capture the two of them meeting together?</i>

85
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,720
<i>No.</i>

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,250
<i>Not Jo Seo Hee and Moon Il Seok,</i>

87
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,360
<i>but Jo Seo Hee and me.</i>

88
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,090
<i>You are meeting with Jo Seo Hee?</i>

89
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,780
<i>I will go see Jo Seo Hee,</i>

90
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,920
<i>and make a deal.</i>

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,960
<i>I will go see Jo Seo Hee with evidence of
the connection between Moon Il Seok and Jo Seo Hee,</i>

92
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,240
<i>I will tell her that I have sure proof that
Moon Il Seok is the murderer.</i>

93
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,910
<i>That's why, if she lets Moon Il Seok
be caught for murder,</i>

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,270
<i>I will offer to cover up the connection.</i>

95
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,820
<i>Then, even for the sake of the auction on the 26th,</i>

96
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,950
<i>she will call Moon Il Seok about me.</i>

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,500
<i>With only two days left to the auction, Moon Il Seok
will have no choice but to try and figure out something.</i>

98
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,200
<i>He'll do whatever it takes to keep himself
out of the investigation radar.</i>

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,620
<i>In the meantime, Prosecutor,</i>

100
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,540
<i>take pictures of me meeting with Jo Seo Hee.</i>

101
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,510
<i>The mayoral candidate for Seoul, whom
the whole nation respects, met with a fugitive.</i>

102
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,670
<i>However, she did not even report it and let him go.</i>

103
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,390
<i>It won't be a mess that'll be easy to clear up.</i>

104
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,120
<i>She can make excuses about Moon Il Seok,</i>

105
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,830
<i>but I am a person she can't make an excuse about.</i>

106
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,660
<i>Why?</i>

107
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,430
<i>Does it sound like I'm grappling for floating clouds?
(an impossible plan)</i>

108
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,270
<i>No,</i>

109
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,910
<i>for someone whose brain works this well,</i>

110
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,960
<i>I'm just wondering why you lived like that all that time?</i>

111
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,700
<i>Anyway, if we see Jo Seo Hee's reaction
when we spread those pictures,</i>

112
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,630
<i>perhaps, we may even find the answer
to the assignment that you haven't been able to solve.</i>

113
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,730
Now that we've cornered the dog,
then we just need to wait for the cat to bite.

114
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,640
Leave the dog to me.

115
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,990
As soon as I trace down the representative
for Winner's Commerce, I will contact you again.

116
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,620
I will obtain authorization to investigate again, too.

117
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,930
There's no time. Let's move fast.

118
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,080
Chairman Moon,

119
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,780
he said he had proof of your involvement in the murder,
 so if I stay out of it, he would not reveal my identity.

120
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,090
Crazy bastard!

121
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,860
How?!

122
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,000
When did he...

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,750
We...

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,710
Let's cancel the charity auction.

125
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,590
Cancel?

126
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,890
Be it tomorrow or the day after that,

127
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,850
we don't know when you will be arrested for murder.

128
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,680
Then who will get the winning bid?

129
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,460
Half of the money will be deposited
after confirming that you get the winning bid.

130
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,020
Let's say that you order someone else
 to get the winning bid.

131
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,690
Then, what about my money?

132
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,990
While you are detained for interrogation, do you think
 I can just rely on the money in your bank account

133
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,540
and proceed with this business?

134
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,260
You said he has all the evidence
 of my being the murderer?

135
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,180
What did he say they were?

136
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,520
You didn't ask?

137
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,110
Of course, I asked.

138
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,130
But do you think he would tell me?

139
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,500
You didn't even confirm that and agreed to him?
The almighty Joo Seo Hee did?

140
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,840
In you eyes, is this nothing to you?

141
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,890
All this is revealed.

142
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,390
His eyes were bloodshot with determination
 to save his daughter. How can I go up against that?

143
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,650
Here, here, why are you like this?
 The lady who has guts.

144
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,430
This...

145
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,460
This... this... isn't...

146
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,720
Jang Tae San, that bastard, what evidence does he have?!

147
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,560
That's for you to find out.

148
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,330
At the least,

149
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,050
cancel the shipment.
I will never proceed in this situation.

150
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,090
Are you saying that you will give up
the 200 billion won and just settle in this country?

151
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,040
I'm not settling, but I'm being settled.

152
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,870
Because of whom?

153
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,960
Crazy bastard! Where do you think this is?

154
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,400
Go and report me.

155
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,930
What?

156
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,780
Now, you can't even report me.

157
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,490
Cause if I get caught, you might be exposed.

158
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,220
And you haven't even prepared a way out.

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,410
What are you scheming?

160
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,710
Chairman Moon, right now... you're scared, right?

161
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,170
All evidence is pointing at you,

162
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,550
and you don't know what, that bastard, Jang Tae San is thinking.

163
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,850
Feel it, that unsettling feeling.

164
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,740
It's no use rattling up Hwang Dae Joon or Jo Seo Hee.

165
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,870
You're saying not to come between you guys?

166
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,710
This is not trying to come between you guys.

167
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,780
If the evidence comes out that that knife belongs to
Hwang Dae Joon, you were going to order him to confess.

168
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,540
But because of my recorder, you can't.

169
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,990
Now that you know about Jo Seo Hee's deal with me,

170
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,410
you are getting more scared, right?

171
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,640
You believed in Jo Seo Hee.

172
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,790
What did Jo Seo Hee say? She's doing as I say, right?

173
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,870
Hey! Don't fool around as if your fearless.

174
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,490
You're nothing but a mudfish stirring up the water.

175
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,820
Did you ever think that you could be the small fry?

176
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,910
What could Hwang Dae Joon be doing now?

177
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,660
I told Hwang Dae Joon that when you get the evidence, you would make him confess (of the crime that he didn't commit.)

178
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,710
That's what I told him.

179
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,340
How about the ship?

180
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,030
I told them to stop pretending that it's broken.

181
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,410
What are your thoughts about it, Director Kim?

182
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:57,040
It seems like Jang Tae San planned this with Prosecutor Park, right?

183
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,760
They said Prosecutor Park is not moving an inch from her apartment.

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,300
It looks like she is waiting for the disciplinary decision.

185
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,380
Tae San claims to have 100% evidence that I committed murder and

186
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,260
went to Jo Seo Hee and made a deal.

187
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,300
And that bastard even came to see me a while ago.

188
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,790
He appeared before you?

189
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,120
Of course...

190
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,570
Of course there isn't any concrete evidence.

191
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,830
If he had such then he could have given it to the police directly.

192
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,780
Why would he go to Jo Seo Hee and make a deal?

193
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,660
He's messing with me just because of a measly recorder.

194
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,610
That bastard, Jang Tae San, what's exactly in his head?!

195
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,540
This insidious killer snake like bastard!

196
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,160
The answer is Dae Joon.

197
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,470
Since Dae Joon is thoroughly faltering, don't even think about framing Hwang Da Joon.
 Is that it?!

198
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,300
Huh?!

199
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,590
<i>Long time ago, you told me to find a clean person without a criminal background, right?</i>

200
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,450
<i>In the meantime, he will leisurely figure out</i>

201
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,860
<i>how to trap you.</i>

202
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,620
Could it be that Hyungnim...

203
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,170
<i>Oh, and if there is any trace of you left,
hurry and get rid of them, too.</i>

204
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,820
<i>Hurry and move. We don't have time.</i>

205
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,140
Our Hyungnim isn't that kind if person.

206
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,430
President!

207
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,850
So, how did it go? What about Seok Doo?

208
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,530
For blabbing about the Chairman's murder to Jang Tae San,

209
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,370
he seems to have been pecked at a lot.

210
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,420
That bastard catches up fast.

211
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,160
Why all of a sudden are you searching for Seok Doo?

212
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,750
This bastard, exactly where is he hiding?

213
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,970
Geesh! He called me fucking so much!

214
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,550
What's this?

215
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,160
<i>This is Moon Il Seok.</i>

216
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,410
Yes, yes, Chairman.

217
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,530
Now let's quickly clean up.

218
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,270
It's not opening time yet.

219
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,630
I'm a detective.

220
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,130
How many girls do you have here?

221
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,110
<i>A girl who holds her tongue and whose face is less recognized...</i>

222
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,440
<i>Send her.</i>

223
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,720
Five.

224
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,170
Since I know there are six, bring them all here without leaving one out.

225
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,120
<i>She works in President Hwang's club.</i>

226
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,140
<i>Since she has so much make up her nickname is Magic.</i>

227
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,490
Remove your make-up

228
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,580
Why?

229
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,840
Just remove it.

230
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,510
A bit more

231
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,520
Try wearing glasses.

232
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,130
In investigating the ingredients in the beverage that you passed out to the control room employees,

233
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,470
sedatives were discovered.

234
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,270
I didn't do that.

235
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,440
I just brought the drinks.

236
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,420
I know. Who asked you to do it.

237
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,610
Well about that...

238
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,940
President Hwang did.

239
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,800
President Hwang Dae Joon.

240
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,080
Yes.

241
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,140
President Hwang told me not to wear make up

242
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,320
and to come to the front of the hospital,
dressed like a female college student.

243
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,800
He told me to say it was to celebrate my father's revival, that's why.

244
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,970
The drinks, did President Hwang give them?

245
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,230
Yes.

246
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,580
It was already it the car.

247
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,960
Therefore, the person who gave you the drinks with sleeping pill concoction

248
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,850
was Hwang Dae Joon. Isn't that right?
-Right.

249
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,440
Sunbaenim.

250
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,390
I found a picture of Hwang Dae Joon's sheath.

251
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,390
Why did you lose energy all of a sudden?

252
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,880
A bastard who has an endless list of things to do the day after tomorrow.

253
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,640
Aigoo, tsk, tsk.

254
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,470
Are you worried because of the recorder?

255
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,070
Did that bastard Tae San call you?

256
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,890
These idiot like bastards.

257
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,590
Did he think you looked like a bastard who would get swayed by his attempts to come between us?

258
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,580
Hyungnim.

259
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,320
What have you been doing? I told you to find a punk with a clean background.

260
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,300
How about Seok Doo, his background is clean.

261
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,410
In any case I've been searching for Seok Doo,

262
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,280
since I told him to close down the pawn shop and lie low,

263
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,130
he's not even answering his phone.

264
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,410
I called him.

265
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,150
You did?

266
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,460
Go to the pawnshop.

267
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,260
The Police found your sheath.

268
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,500
Go and give it to Seok Doo.

269
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,630
What do you mean by sheath?

270
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,250
The knife that was used in killing Oh Mi Sook and its sheath.

271
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,950
That's a custom-made set, right?

272
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,220
Without any concrete evidence

273
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,650
the police seem to have hustled.

274
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,830
Wouldn't it be clean if you said you gave it as a gift to Seok Do.

275
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,440
You said Seok Doo lives having shrugged off his family.

276
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,230
Since there is no family you can't threaten...

277
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,010
Hit him with money.

278
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,900
Your club, tell him that you would hand it over.

279
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,050
What?

280
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,250
My club?

281
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,340
Are you not the pillar that will take over this Seong Sil Capital, if I take over Yujin Gas?

282
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,720
You, until when are you going to depend on a construction company and

283
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,230
continue being a nightclub president? Think about your age.

284
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,840
Hyungnim.

285
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
Get moving.

286
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,470
Yes, Hyungnim.

287
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,450
Hurry!

288
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,800
Is this Seok Doo?

289
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,900
You bastard, why weren't you answering you phone?

290
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,430
Are you really going to the pawnshop?

291
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,430
I'm sorry, President.

292
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,140
I passed out after I drank last night.

293
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,800
Yes I'm headed to the pawnshop.

294
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,000
Go and wait there. Get it?

295
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,630
Why? Do you feel like you saw a ghost ?

296
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,200
Did you get on my car with your own feet?

297
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,620
That's great.

298
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,680
Aren't you going to meet Seok Doo?

299
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,440
You're going to meet Seok Doo because Moon Il Seok ordered you.

300
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,300
But if you go there will Seok Doo be there or will the police be there?

301
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,060
What did you say?

302
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,880
Seok Doo.

303
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,510
When you're going to meet Hwang Dae Joon call the police to go with you.

304
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,610
Say that you saw Hwang Dae Joon with the knife.

305
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,740
Seok Doo, if you don't do as I say, you'll have to go in instead of Hwang Dae Joon.

306
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,130
The knife that stabbed Oh Mi Sook belonged to Hwang Dae Joon.

307
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,100
The one that killed Oh Mi Sook was also Hwang Dae Joon.

308
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,820
Didn't Tae San say the same thing on the recorder?

309
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,970
What bullshit are you spouting?

310
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,510
President Hwang...

311
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,790
Now even if you kill me you can't shake off the fact that you're Oh Mi Sook's murderer.

312
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,520
I didn't kill Oh Mi Sook.

313
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,060
That lies on you.

314
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Abetting a murder, destroying evidence, fabricating alibi, accomplice in a kidnapping even...

315
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,890
Even if you put this all together... it would be only few years.

316
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,760
But then, if you as Oh Mi Sook's murderer,

317
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,490
you would receive at least 20 years.

318
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,630
In addition, kidnapping In Hye and an attempted kidnapping of Soo Jin...

319
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,180
And even kidnapping Prosecutor Park and I in Chuncheon, as well as an attempted murder!

320
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,410
This would get you at least 30 years.

321
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,720
Magic got caught.

322
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,910
You must have felt really desperate.

323
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,570
How many years have I lived in that neighborhood?

324
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,100
While kidnapping my Soo Jin, you bastard,

325
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,620
even if you used someone whose face I didn't know, I would have followed you till the end of the earth to kill you!

326
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,040
Did you think I wouldn't do anything?

327
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:16,360
When Prosecutor Park and I were kidnapped in Chuncheon, I'll testify that you were in the rear.

328
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,460
Then your crime will be just conspiracy and destruction of evidence ordered by Moon Il Seok.

329
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,810
Don't you have to go see with your own eyes

330
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,860
whether my words or Moon Il Seok's are right?

331
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,180
Tell him to meet you somewhere else or
that you will be a little late.

332
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, President.

333
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,180
Seok Doo, I'm going to be late a bit because of something.

334
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,410
Why don't you come to Abanggoong club.

335
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,260
What? To Abanggoong?

336
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,810
After you arrive,

337
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,740
wait there.

338
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,500
Wait, President...

339
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,110
Sir.

340
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,780
You know my cellphone number, right?

341
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,040
If you make a decision, call me.

342
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh, you can also call Detective Im over there.

343
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,220
<i>He said it's not important whether you believe them or not, but whether you need them or not.</i>

344
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,330
Please postpone the disciplinary committee for two more days.

345
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,370
I'll quit after that.

346
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,010
When I stood by Jo Seo Hee's side and got Moon Il Seok out, you didn't say a single word to me to ask why.

347
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,350
It's not that I didn't, but I couldn't.

348
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,630
I was afraid.

349
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,430
You know

350
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,260
how much I believed in you.

351
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,290
Why did you believe in me?

352
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,450
Why did you believe in people?

353
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,690
I'm still Han Jeong Woo.

354
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,730
From my heart to my insides, I'm still the Han Jeong Woo I used to be.

355
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,910
The Chief I knew

356
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,940
is not the person who would back-stab his junior staff in order to free Moon Il Seok because you couldn't withstand

357
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,850
Jo Seo Hee's pressure.

358
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,120
I'll leave after quitting my job.

359
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,100
I was told I couldn't be promoted.

360
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,870
Then it's customary in our field to quit of your own accord.

361
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,710
My children are in middle school and high school.

362
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,020
Don't find excuses.

363
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,960
Because you are going to be a lawyer,

364
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,510
are you saying that you've already got your income covered?

365
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,140
But, had I known that Jang Tae San was going to infiltrate Moon Il Seok's home,

366
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,650
I would not have agreed to set him free so soon.

367
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,870
It's your mistake

368
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,520
that you didn't say that.

369
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,680
I didn't tell you because I didn't want to burden you.

370
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,860
You said you were fighting against people crueler than snakes. Why didn't you think of all the situations?

371
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,530
You should have included me in your calculations as well.

372
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,740
Yes.

373
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,550
I know.

374
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,740
I know how lacking I was,

375
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,460
how rushed I was, how unqualified I was.

376
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,770
I know that very well.

377
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,020
Before you quit,

378
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,280
tell me why you need me,
someone who compromised with authority.

379
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,450
Soo Jin's surgery is in two days.

380
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,630
I want to let her have the surgery,

381
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,610
and I want to clear Jang Tae San's name

382
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,080
who was stained because of me.

383
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,270
Do you have the confidence to

384
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,730
catch Moon Il Seok as the culprit in two days?

385
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,670
I think I do.

386
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,710
Okay. Two days.

387
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,180
Do your best.

388
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,850
Thank you.

389
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,460
Yes. This is Park Jae Gyeong.

390
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,040
Hwang Dae Joon took the bait.

391
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,980
Is that so?

392
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,980
Prepare to catch him carefully and don't miss him.

393
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,470
I got it. I'll go prepare in the police headquarters.

394
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,850
You're back.

395
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,800
<i>Soo Jin.</i>

396
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,330
<i>Now Dad is</i>

397
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,600
<i>going to clear his name soon.</i>

398
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,150
How is Soo Jin doing?

399
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,140
Soo Jin.

400
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,490
Daddy said how are you doing?

401
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,660
Tell him I'm doing fine.

402
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,970
Do you want to tell him yourself?

403
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,650
Should i?

404
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,970
There's another text.

405
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,680
<i>How's Soo Jin?</i>

406
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,350
<i>Is she calmer from the shock?</i>

407
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,510
Why?

408
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
What did he say?

409
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,160
It's Ahjussi.

410
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,590
It's Ahjussi?

411
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,640
It's Ahjussi I see.

412
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,180
<i>Children's Art Contest</i>

413
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,680
<i>Hurry up and draw.</i>

414
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,630
<i>Time is up. Turn in your drawings please.</i>

415
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,980
<i>Please bring your drawings please.</i>

416
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,690
<i>Did you write your name?</i>

417
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,000
<i>All you done drawing?</i>

418
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,080
<i>Yes.</i>

419
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,820
<i>Good job. You did well.</i>

420
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,360
<i>Now we have to turn it in.</i>

421
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,000
<i>This is Ahjussi.</i>

422
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,810
This is dad on the left

423
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,000
and ahjussi is on the right.

424
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,330
<i>You drew Ahjussi and your Dad together?</i>

425
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,900
<i>Why did you...</i>

426
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,520
<i>Why did you draw it like that?</i>

427
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,960
<i>Because Ajuhssi came to Soo Jin's first day at kindergarten,</i>

428
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,630
<i>and also at the talent show at my preschool.</i>

429
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,750
<i>You've been my bodyguard instead of Dad during that time.</i>

430
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,000
<i>Seo Soo Jin,</i>

431
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,430
<i>are you really going to be like this?</i>

432
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,440
<i>Why?</i>

433
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,550
<i>It feels like I'm being proposed to to be your dad.</i>

434
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,500
<i>I feel more nervous than proposing to your mom.</i>

435
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,990
<i>Lies.</i>

436
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,890
<i>It's true.</i>

437
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,550
<i>Really?</i>

438
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,830
<i>How can it be real?</i>

439
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,400
<i>You like my mom.</i>

440
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,920
<i>If I like your mom a lot, I start liking the people she likes too.</i>

441
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,040
<i>Soo Jin is the person your mom loves the most in this world.</i>

442
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,720
<i>That's true.</i>

443
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,070
<i>That's why.</i>

444
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,660
<i>But I'm not like that.</i>

445
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,650
<i>Ahjussi is nice to me</i>

446
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,130
<i>so I like Ahjussi.</i>

447
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,400
<i>I'm not liking you because Mom likes you.</i>

448
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,770
<i>Aigoo.</i>

449
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,880
<i>Aigoo my Soo Jin. Kiss!</i>

450
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,840
<i>Aigoo aigoo.</i>

451
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,340
Let's go.

452
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,050
<i>We should turn it in now. Wow, you drew so well. Hand?</i>

453
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,580
<i>This hand.</i>

454
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,470
Seo Soo Jin, did you just sigh?

455
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,830
It's because I have a lot of worries.

456
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,610
What kind of worries do you have little kid?

457
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,370
You're not infected and your fever has gone down.

458
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,290
Mom, the mountains, the sun, and the moon

459
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,120
can't be all together at once, right?

460
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,330
The mountains, the sun, and the moon.

461
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,290
That's not possible.

462
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,470
The sun is only out in the mornings,
and the moon is only there at night.

463
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,480
But what the mountains need is the sun, right?

464
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,540
The mountains will sprout trees

465
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,180
and blossom flowers only if the sun is there.

466
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,240
That's true, more than the moon ...

467
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,900
Soo Jin ... Is that-

468
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,140
It's because I just like dad.

469
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,770
I like ahjussi, too

470
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,340
but dad is dad.

471
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:16,270
<i>Ahjussi, it's Soo Jin. Soo Jin is okay.</i>

472
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,550
<i>I have a slight fever left, but it's worth living through.</i>

473
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,200
The kid, she even cares for me.

474
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,460
She even met her dad.

475
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:35,170
<i>Dad, it's Soo Jin. Soo Jin is okay.</i>

476
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,980
<i>I have a slight fever left, but I can face it.</i>

477
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,930
What a relief. What a relief.

478
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,630
<i>In Hye. Moon Il Seok will be arrested soon.</i>

479
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,600
Did you come to meet Soo Jin?

480
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,340
I came, not necessarily to see her.

481
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,960
Once Moon Il Seok gets arrested, you know you have to confess and be investigated, right?

482
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,510
Yes.

483
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,590
Once Soo Jin's surgery is over.

484
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,790
But I don't think there will be any reason for you to be investigated by me,

485
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,340
so you don't have to worry about that.

486
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,790
After I arrest Moon Il Seok,

487
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,430
I need to go and get investigated as well.

488
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,580
I wasn't able to tell you because I was a coward.

489
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,500
I'm sorry. I gave that digital camera to Moon Il Seok.

490
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,390
I know.

491
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,130
In Hye told you, right?

492
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,200
What are the chances of In Hye telling me?

493
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,630
When you followed me to the construction site three days ago, that's when I found out.

494
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,560
<i>About shooting you that day,</i>

495
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,590
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

496
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,500
<i>Did you chase me here with a gun to say that?</i>

497
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,430
<i>I'll come by Soo Jin's surgery date, so don't waste your energy trying to chase me,</i>

498
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,470
<i>and watch over Soo Jin and In Hye.</i>

499
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,620
<i>Since Moon Il Seok knows In Hye,
I'm telling you to protect her.</i>

500
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,490
<i>I'm sorry for dragging even In Hye into this.</i>

501
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,760
<i>I ...</i>

502
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,780
<i>am also sorry.</i>

503
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,840
<i>Please take care of yourself until the day of Soo Jin's surgery.</i>

504
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,450
<i>If something happens, or if you ever need my help</i>

505
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,850
<i>Nothing like that will happen.</i>

506
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,830
<i>We are re-investigating Oh Mi Sook's case.</i>

507
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,960
<i>I'll find the real culprit before Soo Jin's
 surgery, no matter what it takes.</i>

508
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,260
Those apologetic eyes of yours,
your worry for Soo Jin's surgery,

509
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,800
and

510
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,250
the heart that wished for me to live until the surgery.

511
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,860
You're saying you figured it out then?

512
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,840
I made sure that In Hye wasn't followed.

513
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,740
<i>If you had found out at that time,
why didn't you tell In Hye about it?</i>

514
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,600
What's there to gain by telling In Hye?

515
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,740
It'll only hurt In Hye's heart.

516
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,700
<i>Hwang Dae Joon</i>

517
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,060
It's Hwang Dae Joon.

518
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,540
It's Im Seung Woo.

519
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,570
Right now, by the column by the police station,

520
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,490
I left an evidence.

521
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,440
It's the shirt that Moon Il Seok wore
 when he killed Oh Mi Sook.

522
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,070
Moon Il Seok's blood is also stained on it.

523
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,830
What about you?

524
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,660
I ...

525
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,360
until Moon Il Seok gets locked in the jail cell for good,

526
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,420
will never testify or confess.

527
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,710
If I get locked up first,

528
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,600
I will die in the hand's of the bastards he'll send.

529
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,010
Hello? Hwang Dae Joon!

530
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,380
What did he say?

531
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,230
He left the evidence at the police station,

532
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,450
and he says he'll testify after we catch Moon Il Seok.

533
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,270
Did he say the evidence was verified?

534
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,010
Since Prosecutor Park is at the police station right now, I'll tell her to verify it immediately.

535
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,840
You suffered a lot all this time.

536
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,290
I'm going to go catch Moon Il Seok, then.

537
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,090
<i>He said the address of the store Moon Il Seok frequents to get his shirt custom-made is in it.</i>

538
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,630
<i>It's even got his bloodstain and sweat when he cut his hand while killing Oh Mi Sook.</i>

539
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:41,200
Chief. Please send this to forensics and have it verified.

540
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,240
Geez, why did his underling keep this?

541
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,850
Wouldn't he have learned while watching?

542
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,930
Like like Moon Il Seok's habits and patterns.

543
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,760
<i>A long, long, time ago, the mountain
 and the sun were in love.</i>

544
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,590
<i>They were so, so in love,</i>

545
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,570
<i>but they broke up.</i>

546
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,100
<i>That's why, with no choice, the mountain</i>

547
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,450
<i>said he was boiling, and hot, and sweaty,</i>

548
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,550
<i>he got mad at the sun.</i>

549
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:26,140
<i>But in truth, the mountain liked the sun even when it couldn't sleep for one hundred nights.</i>

550
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,780
<i>So did the sun leave? Where did it go?</i>

551
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,720
<i>It probably went to the moon.</i>

552
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,890
<i>The story is indescribably sad, right?</i>

553
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,570
<i>Soo Jin's Dad</i>

554
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,210
Hello?

555
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,320
Yeah, In Hye. It's me, Jang Tae San.

556
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah.

557
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,120
The thing is,

558
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,150
evidence came out that said Moon Il Seok is the real culprit,

559
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:07,530
so I can prove my innocence, now.

560
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,100
Really?

561
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,550
So now, I

562
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,460
Where are you right now?

563
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,110
Are you at the hospital?

564
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,060
It's late and you said Soo Jin was
 sleeping, so why come here?

565
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,520
Because I wanted to see your face and congratulate you.

566
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,720
Congratulations. You suffered a lot.

567
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,440
What suffering?

568
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,180
I'll tell Soo Jin

569
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,880
that all the bad things stopped happening to dad.

570
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,330
<i>Are you Glue stick?</i>

571
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,280
<i>Keep the phone's battery charged.</i>

572
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,490
<i>Look at the photo in there.</i>

573
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,380
<i>I didn't give you the fountain pen to be used it as a knife.</i>

574
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,740
<i>The customer's phone is turned off.
You will be redirected to voicemail.</i>

575
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,970
<i>After the beep you will be charged for the call.</i>

576
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,140
You're here.

577
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Ahjussi, are you're still like this?

578
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,230
There's no reply as to whether he's seen it or not.

579
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,120
You should have asked Moon Il Seok a long time ago for clear answers.

580
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:15,130
If I did, Moon Il Seok would order that child to kill me.

581
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,240
What?

582
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,020
Even if he doesn't know,

583
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,180
I can't make him kill his own father.

584
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,980
Seriously...

585
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,850
I mean...

586
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:40,630
How could you think that far?

587
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,150
I'm still not sure.

588
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,420
If ever Moon Il Seok would make my son like that

589
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,240
<i>I would kill him right this instant.</i>

590
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,670
You couldn't kill him, either.

591
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,320
Pardon?

592
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,010
When Moon Il Seok kidnapped your daughter, you couldn't kill him then, either.

593
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,370
It was because of your daughter, right?

594
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,850
Even though you were angry,

595
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,020
you also held it in because you didn't want your daughter to be a murderer's child.

596
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,970
That's what all fathers are like.

597
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,730
Maybe...

598
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,400
my father would also have done this.

599
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,090
It's not that he didn't like me, but...

600
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,790
maybe he also had circumstances he couldn't talk about.

601
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,660
That's right, that's probably what it is.

602
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,470
I wish Glustick would be caught soon.

603
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,650
We would be able to catch him once Moon Il Seok is arrested.

604
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,620
Arrested?

605
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,950
Yes.

606
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,430
He will be arrested tonight.

607
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,380
Is this Seok Do?
Is there still no contact from Chairman Hwang?

608
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,170
He told me to go to Abanggoong,
so I'm on my way over there.

609
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,490
Right now?

610
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,030
Moon Il Seok!

611
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,460
What's this?

612
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,780
Hurry and search the whole house!

613
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,290
Yes!

614
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,560
Detective Im.

615
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,170
This bastard.

616
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,270
He ran away in a hurry.

617
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,660
He couldn't have gone far, the tea is still hot.

618
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,710
Where could he have gone to?

619
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,020
He wouldn't have gone back to his office, would he?

620
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,100
I'll order them to set up checkpoints as soon as possible.

621
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,790
Hwang Dae Joon, this bastard!

622
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,510
Bastard... that bastard!

623
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,430
How did it go?

624
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:06,220
Chairman Hwang... with the shirt that you wore that day...

625
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,660
He gave it to the police.

626
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,210
Is seems like he didn't burn all of the clothes.

627
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,550
What?

628
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,010
Hey! Why didn't he burn it?

629
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,530
I told him to burn everything even down to the shoes but why didn't he do it?

630
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,110
There's no way out, Chairman.

631
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,070
Tell Jo Seo Hee to take me out immediately.

632
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,190
Tell her to get a hold of that shirt.

633
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,670
Where are you right now?

634
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,310
Chairman.

635
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,020
It was this.

636
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,810
This was what that bastard, Tae San was planning,

637
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,240
I was wondering why that bastard came to me.

638
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,100
He planned to let Dae Joon know

639
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,500
that I was trying to deceive him.

640
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,060
You lost him?

641
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,290
How? Why?!

642
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,400
I don't know. He might have sensed it.

643
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,460
What about the office? The checkpoints?

644
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,860
We put out an alert on him.

645
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:50,480
Nothing has happened here.

646
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,120
I see.

647
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,870
What are you doing?

648
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:16,480
Where do you think this is to come in?

649
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,240
I bought this house. You didn't think I would have a key?

650
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,390
You've gone mad.

651
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,520
What's going on? Don't you even have the sense to look at what time it is?

652
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,320
I'm not in a condition to look at time right now.

653
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,790
Did Jang Tae San get you?

654
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,030
I know right.

655
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,100
Why did you come here?

656
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,310
Why would I have come?

657
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,430
You're asking me to proceed with the auction as planned,

658
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,580
so that we can get 200 billion won?

659
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,730
Because you are not the one to rot in a penitentiary for several decades.

660
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:01,560
After getting 200 billion won, arrange it so that I can get on the ship to leave this country.

661
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,520
Even to help you to be a stow away?

662
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,690
You know very well that if I am in trouble,
your 200 billion will be gone, too.

663
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,160
Money,

664
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,660
should be sent to my bank account first, right?

665
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,010
It was only yesterday when you threatened me with the talk of money.

666
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:20,970
After suffering that,

667
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,390
I would be stupid to let money fall so easily into your hands.

668
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,140
Jo Seo Hee.

669
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,490
Don't try to play games with me.

670
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:49,540
Until I get the 200 billion in my account, I will have a killer to watch you 24/7.

671
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:55,740
I don't use money to play games with someone who considers money as their life.

672
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,780
What are you going to do?

673
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,850
Are you going to shift to my account?

674
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,550
I will have Director Im take care of it.

675
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,190
So you need to be clear in your transaction.

676
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,150
As soon as I confirm account change,

677
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,260
I will proceed with the auction again.

678
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,280
Leave quickly. Before the bloodshot Park Jae Kyeong barges in here.

679
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,130
Here with a breaking news. The real culprit in the homicide of Ms. Oh on the 11th at Daebang-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu.

680
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:38,640
is not the escapee Jang Tae San,
but it's Chairman Moon Il Seok of Seongshil Capital Group.

681
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,830
With this, Jang Tae San who had been on the run for 13 days after escaping on the 12th while he was sent away

682
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,630
to the prosecutors was in fact framed for the homicide.

683
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:52,880
Chairman Moon Il Seok had barely escaped his arrest. He is now on alert for arrest.

684
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:59,560
So my life ends like this - because of Jang Tae San.

685
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,910
If you are to board the boat tomorrow, you should go to Incheon Port tonight.

686
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:08,880
I'm asking if my life is ending like this because
of that bastard, Jang Tae San!

687
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,970
Director Im.

688
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,650
Yes.

689
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:19,140
You know, right? That I can't leave like this.

690
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,980
It's too dangerous.

691
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,910
Before I leave,

692
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,450
even if I die, I need to grind him up before I go.

693
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,680
Director Im. Do you want to keep your feet out,
or do you want to inherit my shares?

694
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,790
Tomorrow at 9AM is Tae San's daughter's surgery.

695
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,930
Don't let him enter the doors to the operating room.

696
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:56,020
Before he can step over my casket, Tae San that punk

697
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,610
will never be able to save his daughter.

698
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:24,590
<i>When a poisonous snake bites its prey, it will never let it go.</i>

699
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,570
<i>Even if its head gets cut off,
it will eat its prey no matter what.</i>

700
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,430
<i>I...</i>

701
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,780
<i>That's how I lived and came to this point.</i>

702
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,130
<i>Moon Il Seok took revenge on you?</i>

703
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,830
<i>Yes.</i>

704
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:41,530
<i>That's why Moon Il Seok is a man to be afraid of.</i>

705
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:46,870
<i>If you step on him once, he'll step on you
a hundred times more.</i>

706
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,960
I'm sorry. I came in and waited without permission.

707
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,010
I watched the morning news. I heard
that you've been cleared.

708
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,710
Yes.

709
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,760
But more than that, Doctor,

710
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,080
can't we pull Soo Jin's surgery just a day forward?

711
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,300
Moon Il Seok will never let this be.

712
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,350
On the day of the surgery, we'll reinforce the police force.

713
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,560
That won't be enough.

714
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:37,130
He's the guy that won't rest until he swallows what he bites, even if it means getting his head cut off.

715
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:41,430
He's definitely going to retaliate in some way.

716
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:46,850
Is that why you asked Doctor Park if she
could move the surgery date?

717
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,870
I need your help, Prosecutor.

718
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,020
There's no time, we need to hurry!

719
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,810
Hey, look at this.

720
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,450
Jang Tae San?

721
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,720
Oh, isn't this Jang Tae San?

722
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,720
That's what I'm saying. How could he
be connected to Congresswoman Jo?

723
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,700
What's going on?

724
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,780
Congresswoman Jo, a word!

725
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,860
Congresswoman Jo!

726
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,530
Is this true?!

727
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,650
If I say that it's true, would you believe me?

728
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:01,510
If I say that it's false, will you believe me?

729
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:06,010
The truth about this picture will be revealed by the prosecutors and the police.

730
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:11,740
With our country's skills wouldn't 2-3 days be enough to reveal whether this picture is real or fake?

731
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,110


732
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:17,260
I plead for a speedy investigation.

733
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,050
You heard from Dr. Park, right?

734
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,120
That person, Moon Il Seok, is a disgustingly
scary person.

735
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,970
How can he make us worry like this to the end?

736
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,320
Don't worry. Even if something happens to
me, I'm going to save Soo Jin no matter what.

737
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,560
Why are you saying things like that?

738
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,760
Everything's going to be fine.

739
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,530
I know. Everything will be fine.

740
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,340
The exits are here, here, and here.

741
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,450
Emergency exits are here and here. Total of two places.

742
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:02,620
Tomorrow on the day of the surgery, I can't predict how many policemen will be there...

743
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,590
Trash all this crap!

744
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:08,480
I'm asking how I can get in there and
how I can kill Jang Tae San!

745
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,010
You bastard! It's your job to take care of the cops on your own.

746
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:13,810
I'm sorry.

747
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:18,560
Whether you blow up the hospital with a bomb or put everyone to sleep with a sleeping gas...

748
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,050
Hello?

749
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,530
This is Officer Park.

750
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:30,210
I called because I had some important
information I needed to tell you.

751
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,180
<i>Here.</i>

752
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,970
<i>I'm here at Busan for duty. I'm leaving now.</i>

753
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:39,340
<i>Prosecutor Park! Why wouldn't you
answer your phone?! Jang Tae San is-</i>

754
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:43,520
<i>What? Why don't you choose a place?</i>

755
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,920
<i>Where?</i>

756
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,490
<i>601 Seokhee-dong?</i>

757
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,660
<i>Okay, 601 Seokhee-dong.</i>

758
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:54,670
This kind of information can't even compare
to anything else I've given you, so

759
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,410
I think that I'll have to talk to Moon Il Seok, himself.

760
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,640
It's important information, so you have to talk to him.

761
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,700
Even this dumb cop thinks I'm nothing now...

762
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,740
Look here you punk! You're all juiced out and I have no use for you anymore.

763
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,320
Where do you think you're calling?!

764
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:19,250
If they were suspicious that I am a spy, do you think they would have me stand guard at the hospital?

765
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,920
While I was here to stand guard,

766
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,670
I overheard Jang Tae San and Seo In Hye talking.

767
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,970
Jang Tae San and Seo In Hye?

768
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,960
A billion (~$1 million) in cash.

769
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,500
A billion?

770
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,490
After I leak this information, I can't work as a police officer anymore.

771
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:48,010
I will hand in my resignation but I'll need some money to spend the rest of my life in hiding.

772
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,130
Tell me what it is first.

773
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:56,540
I have to see the money first. It's about
Jang Tae San's surgery.

774
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,790
Surgery?

775
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,050
If you're playing...

776
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:05,450
You're the man who will return from the dead to stab me.

777
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,640
I know it well.

778
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,940
I'll send someone, so wait.

779
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,430
Chairman, you know how dangerous it is
 if you make a wrong move now!

780
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,880
Take all my stocks.

781
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,700
Pardon?

782
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,500
I said, arrange it so that I can kill this bastard, Jang Tae San, before I leave.

783
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,010
Let's talk inside.

784
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,700
It's not a difficult task.

785
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,780
Just watch the CCTV and let them know about exactly 2 hours.

786
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,190
Is it okay to do this?

787
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:40,440
It's a hundred million won (~$100,000) for two hours.

788
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,220
They say they can draw out his marrow a day ahead.

789
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,620
So that's his scheme?

790
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,540
The surgery is tonight at 10PM.

791
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,310
The only vacant operation rooms are
number six and seven.

792
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,080
They're putting up the least number of police force there.

793
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,850
There are two operation rooms, you say...

794
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,740
You and I will each be responsible for one.

795
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,290
Yes.

796
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:09,840
The place isn't even guarded well. Why not we just send Mr. Kim to do the job?

797
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,640
It's because I want to kill him. Me.
With my own hands.

798
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:18,940
Because there are two operating rooms, I won't be able to cover it myself. That's why I'm taking him with me.

799
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:24,320
To watch for infection, you will receive a simple examination.

800
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,420
And then you will receive general anesthesia,

801
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,100
and after anesthesia is complete, we will draw out your marrow

802
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:34,130
from the hip bone for two hours.

803
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,000
Then after the marrow is drawn out, I can just leave?

804
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,060
No.

805
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:42,600
You need time to wake up from anesthesia, and in order to stop the bleeding,

806
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,220
it's good to lay down for 3 to 4 more hours.

807
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,890
If there's sign of anemia, you will need a blood transfusion, too.

808
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:07,820
Do well, Soo Jin's Dad.

809
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,410
Here you go.

810
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,880
You must not forget how to work it.

811
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,440
Let's go.

812
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,070
Father.

813
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,190
Who am I?

814
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:52,140
What are you saying all of a sudden?

815
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,730
Before we met coincidentally in Colombia,

816
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:02,100
did you already know me?

817
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,210
Who are you?

818
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,560
Who are you for me to know you?

819
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:17,350
Do you want to find your parents now?
You said you didn't want to then.

820
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:24,230
With all this going on now, do you want me to find you your parents?

821
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:25,800
No, sir.

822
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:30,470
I'm sorry.
I'll have the car ready.

823
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:13,250
It's the same today. We're doing a stakeout again tonight.

824
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:17,710
All detectives work hard like this, my friend!

825
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:35,520
I think Jang Tae San's operation room is number seven.

826
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,570
30 minutes ago, I saw the primary doctor leave the room.

827
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,540
Jang Tae San has not awoke from anesthesia yet.

828
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,250
<i>~ Upcoming Drama • Medical Top Team ~
From today onward, you are the top medical team.</i>

829
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,160
<i>I believe patients come first.</i>

830
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,470
<i>This is not the time to be like this!</i>

831
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:29,830
<i>You thought you were in the top team?</i>

832
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,590
<i>If I won't do it then you won't do it?</i>

833
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,920
<i>Top Team's main cardiothoracic surgeon is Seo Ju Yeong.</i>

834
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,710
<i>Is it that important?</i>

835
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:37,770
<i>It is important.
To me it's my lifeline.</i>

836
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,350
<i>I look forward to what's to come.</i>

837
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:40,410
<i>Life and Death, the moment of extreme!</i>

838
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,170
<i>We can't control the hemorrhaging.</i>

839
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,120
<i>Doctor!</i>

840
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,530
<i>Medical Top Team</i>

841
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:50,270
We were a fantastic combo on the day Professor Seo worked.

842
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:53,130
October 9th at 10PM
