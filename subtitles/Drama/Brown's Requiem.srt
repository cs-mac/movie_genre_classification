Why do you have to make such
a big deal out of this, ma?

18
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,192
You know you'll get the set

Why ya gotta make

What are you trying to do?

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,209
You trying to get me to
break my own mother's set?

22
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,627
Or break the radiator?

23
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,213
And maybe blow up
the whole house, ma.

24
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,215
Your own son, your own
flesh and blood, ma?

25
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,217
ls that what you're trying
to do? Your own son?

26
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,223
Why do you always gotta
play games with my head?

27
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,225
Harold, l wouldn't do that.

28
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,228
The chain isn't for you.

29
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,231
lt's for the robbers.

30

C'mon out? Please ma.

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,232
This isn't happening.

36
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,236
And if it should be happening
it would be alright.

37
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,239
So don't worry, Seymour.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,241
lt'll all work out.

39
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,243
You'll see already.

Shit, man!

42
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,256
That mother fucker's starting
to look a little seedy Jim.

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,258
What, are you particular
all of a sudden?

44
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,259
Hey, baby...

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,262
...ah don't care just as
long as we get our braid.

46
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,180

Whoopie fuck, the table too.

50
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,196
Hey, do you want me to
schlep it on my back?

51
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,198
You got a friend.

schlepper. Shit.

00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,201
Such a son. A goniff.

54
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,205
Your mother needs you like
a moose needs a hat rack.

55
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,234
Sheeit...

56
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,153

58
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,158
Yeah man, something else.

59
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,166
You know what
we need to do?

60
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,170
We need to get us a
piece of this Brody shit...

61
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,172
...cut it up, and off it.

62
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,174
We could double
our money. Easy.

63
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,178
Then we can buy us
a couple a pieces...

64
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,180
That'd be righteous.

65
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,182
l'll bet in no time at all...

66
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:34,186
...we'd get a pound of pure.

67
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,189
Oooh, that's what l'm
talking about, baby...

68
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,191
...no hassles.

69
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,195
-How's it going, babe?

-The usuaI?
-Yeah, sounds good,

71
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,193
Anything else?

72
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,198
Anything else?

73
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,200
Uh, no.

78
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,218
-And you?
-What can l say?

79
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,221
-Do you want your TV?
-Yes, if you don't mind.

80
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,224
Mrs. Goldfarb...

81
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,227
...can l ask you a question,
you won't take it personal?

82
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,147
How many years we
know each other?

83
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,149
Who's to count?

84
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,151
Why don't you tell
already the police?

85
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,154
Harry wouldn't be
stealing no more the TV.

86
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,157
Mr. Rabinowitz,
l couldn't do that.

87
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,159
Harold's my only child.

00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:00,179
Why are you so hard
on your folks?

116
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,181
l mean they give
you everything.

117
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,184
They hook you up with an
apartment, with a shrink.

118
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,187
Which is fine, you know,
it's great. lt's just...

119
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,192
Money is never what l really
wanted from them, you know.

120
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,196
That's pretty much
all l ever get.

121
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,199
Why don't you get
away from them?

122
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,201
How am l going to do that?

123
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,204
l don't know.

124
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,207
What about your clothes?
Your sketches are great.

125
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,209
Open up a store.

126
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,211
l can't.

127
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,213
Why not?

128
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,216
When will l have time

129
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,231
Well, so where's the party?

130
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,234
When l tell you you're going
to jump out of the window.

131
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,198
lt won't come up.

132
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,205

133
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,209

135
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,248
Be ex cited! Be,,, be ex cited!

136
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,152
l thought l would catch
a little sun today.

137
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,154
Really? Well in a
box you'll catch it.

138
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,157
Why don't you just relax...

139
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,160
...and think how gorgeous you'll
look with your new red hair.

140
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,162
Today the hair...

141
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,164
...tomorrow the sun.

142
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,168
Anybody wanna
waste some time?

143
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:25,175
AngeI says that this is the
time, we shouId do it now,

144
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,178
-I'II caII Brody tomorrow,
-Who's Brody?

145
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,680
That's my sweet connection,

146
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,181
He's got some
unbeIievabIe shit,

147
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,184
Marion, we got this idea,

148
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,185
What is it?

149
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,187
We get a piece of this
stuff, we can cut it up,,,

150
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,189
,, and doubIe our
money, no probIem,

151
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:43,193
Shit man, then we get us
a pound of pure and retire,

152
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,195
You know what that means?
No more hacks,

153
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,198
We get off hard knocks
and be on easy street,

154
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,201
What's the catch?

155
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,204
That's red.

156
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,207
l mean that's a red. l mean
it's not a red red but it's...

157
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,209
...that's a red. That's a red.

158
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,170
-Red?
-Yeah.

159
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,172
You're telling me that's red?

160
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,173
Yeah. l'm telling. lt's red.

161
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,175
Then what's orange?

162
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,178
lf this is a red l want
to know what's orange?

163
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,183
Well...

164
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,185
...it could be...

165
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:21,148
...that it's a little orange, too.

166
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,194
You know something?

167
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,195
What?

168
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,869
l always thought you are...

169
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,205
...the most beautiful
girl l've ever seen.

170
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,207
Really?

171
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,215
Ever since l first saw you.

172
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,218
That's nice, Harry.

173
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,226
That really makes
me feel good.

174
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,148
You know, other people
have told me that before...

175
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,151
...and it was meaningless.

176
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,160
Why?

177
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:18,163
Because you thought they
were pulling your leg?

178
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,166
No, no nothing like that.

179
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,168
l don't know.

180
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,171
l don't know or even
care if they were.

181
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,173
lt just...

182
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,177
...it was meaningless.

183
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,179
You know?

184
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,181
When you say it...

185
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,184
...l hear it.

186
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,187
l really hear it.

187
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:52,197
Somebody like you could really
make things alright for me.

188
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,200
You think?

189
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,164
What is it?

190
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,166
Remember when l told
you about the store?

191
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,168
Yeah.

192
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,171
l've been thinking
about it a lot.

193
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:10,174
l put together some
numbers and it's...

194
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,177
...it's not impossible.

195
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,179
l mean...

196
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,182
...you know, you could do.
You should do it.

197
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,185
l mean we could
do it together.

198
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,194
What do you think?

199
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,175
Stop already.

200
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:41,181
l felt better in a red
dress than a cheese danish.

201
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,219
Three things is aII I
did to change my Iife:

202
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,221
Three things,

203
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,224
No red meat,

204
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,226
Think about it, What do
they stick in red meat?

205
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,228
I ate red meat,,,

206
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,231
,,, to the point where I wouId
eat it sIab right off, raw,

207
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,233
I turned it around,

208
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,236
You need to be passionate,
No red meat,

209
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,239
No red meat for 30 days,

210
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,241
No red meat!

211
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,258
Ada told us. lt's gorgeous.

212
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,177
We're going to make it
a little darker tomorrow.

213
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,178
Why darker?

214
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,180
To go with my red dress.

215
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,681
Yeah, but now it's
looking like Madonna.

216
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,183
This is not Madonna.

217
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,186
And neither is this. But
soon... l'm going on a diet.

218
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,189
-What diet are you on?
-Eggs and grapefruit.

219
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,690
l was on that once.
Lots of luck.

220
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,192
lt's not so bad.

221
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,194
-How long you been on it?
-All day.

222
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,197
All day? lt's one o'clock.

223
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,201
-l'm thinking thin.
-She's thinking thin.

224
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,204
My Louise, she lost fifty
pounds just like that.

225
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,206
-Like that?
-Like what?

226
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,209
What did you do, put
her in a sweat box?

227
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,212
She went to a doctor.
He gave her pills.

228
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,215
-You don't want to eat.
-What's so good about that?

229
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:43,220
l'm sitting here not thinking
about pastrami on rye?

230
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,223
You really shouldn't talk like
that when someone's on a diet.

231
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,225
Oh, big deal.

232
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,227
l'll sneak another
wedge of grapefruit.

233
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,230
l'm thinking thin.

234
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,232
Oh Sara, the mailman...

235
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,234
Sara Goldfarb?

236
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,236
You have something
for Sara Goldfarb?

237
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,196
-l'm expecting something.
-Mrs. Goldfarb...

238
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,197
...Goldfarb...

239
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,199
-Sara Goldfarb.
-This is it?

240
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,201
That's it. Come on.

241
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:12,207
Alright, okay. Okay. Your
name. Spell out your name.

242
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,210
S-A-R-A

243
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,212
G-O-L-D...

244
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,214
...F-A-R-B!

245
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,215
Dynamite?

246
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,218
Dynamite.

247
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,222
Dynamite!

248
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,224
Alright we on our way.
Alright.

249
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:32,227
Brody's man says he got
some real fine shit, man.

250
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,228
Alright man.

251
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,231
Here we go.

252
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,232
Alright...

253
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,235
...let's do this right, man.

254
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,237
Come on baby...

255
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,238
...naturally.

256
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,242
Come on, hurry.

257
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,252
Maybe they'll send you
to the Tavern on the Green.

258
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,254
You know, that's where
they send all the stars.

259
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,174
l'm eating eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern on the Green.

260
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,176
Hurry before the
mailman comes.

261
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,177
Here we are.

262
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,180
Mail it!

263
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,214
There it is, jim.

264
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,219
There it is, baby.

265
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,179
Shit.

266
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,222
Shall we try?

267
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,225
Wait, Ty.

268
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,227
Look.

269
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,231
This is our chance
to make it big.

270
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,233
We play it right...

271
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:46,236
...an' we can get
a pound of pure...

272
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,238
...but if we get wasted...

273
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,240
...we'll fuck it up.

274
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,242
l know.

275
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,244
l ain't trying
to jive you, jim.

276
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,248
l don't want to be running
the streets my whole life...

277
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,168
...my sneakers all ripped up, my
nose runnin' down to my chin.

278
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:04,171
All l'm saying is we should
take a little taste...

279
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,173
...so we know
how much to cut.

280
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,174
lt's business.

281
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,178
Fair enough.

282
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,187
Sheeit...

283
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:40,207
Thank you, Three things is
aII I did to change my Iife,

284
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,209
Thirty days is aII
it takes, Three things,,,

285
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,210
Number two:

286
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,212
No refined sugar!

287
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,214
Now sugar's everywhere,

288
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:51,218
You know, they even put
sugar in bottIed water?

289
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:54,221
I was sick with sugar,
That was my medicine,

290
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:57,224
It nurtured my spiraIIing
brain that feIt I was a Ioser,

291
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,226
-Juice by you!
-Juice by you!

292
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,153
Sucking candies,
very good sir,

293
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,155
None of that stuff,
Just stay away from it,

294
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:15,159
No refined sugar,
Watch it for 30 days,,,

295
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,161
I'm going to eat right,,,

296
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,163
,,,I am going to
pick up my spirits,,,

297
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:23,167
,,, and I am going to try,,,

298
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,181
Stop!

299
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,175
-HeIIo?
-Rosie?

300
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,177
-Yeah?
-Sara,

301
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:18,180
l need the number
of that doctor.

302
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:23,185
l don't understand
why you got to see him.

303
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,187
Cut the son of a bitch
loose for Christ's sake.

304
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,190
Because l don't want him
mentioning to my parents...

305
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,192
...that l've stopped therapy.

306
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,194
They're already
so pissed off at me...

307
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,196
...they're thinking
of cutting me off.

308
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:37,199
Harry, l'm not going to
sleep with him or anything.

309
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,202
l'm going to come home
after the concert.

310
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:43,205
You're jealous!

311
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,208
Harry jealous?

312
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,212
Put your arms around me.

313
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,214
Oh you are so stubborn...

314
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,216
...put your arms around me.

315
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,220
Stop that!

316
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,139
l'll suck your eyeballs out.

317
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,142
Well...

318
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,146
l'm disappointed that
you're indisposed.

319
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,150
ls Anita out of town,
or something?

320
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,153
Why do you ask?

321
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,156
l was just wondering

We're on our way, baby...

...blue in the afternoon...

356
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,215
...orange in the evening.

357
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,219
That's my three meals,
Mr. Smarty Pants.

358
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,223
And green at night.

359
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,225
Just like that.
One, two, three, four...

365
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,205
One day l'd make it.

366
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,207
You don't have to
make anything, my sweet.

367
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:20,209
You just have to
love your momma.

368
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,211
What are you doing baby?

369
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,215
What are you doing baby?

370
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,217
Nothing.

371
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,222
l was thinking about you...

372
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:38,227
...and the nasty things
l'm about to do to ya.

373
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,230
l'm going to get on you.

374
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,234
You'll scare me to death.

375
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,236
Oh no, l wouldn't scare you.

376
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:50,239
l don't want to scare nobody.

377
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:56,203
All l want is a little bit
of peace and happiness.

378
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,248
Right now....

379
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:03,168
...you're the finest fox
l ever laid my eyes on.

380
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,174
That's what l'll do.

381
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:11,176
For my mother.

382
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,179
l've been thinking about
getting something for her.

383
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:15,180
Like...

384
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,182
...like a present or something.

385
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,184
But l didn't know
what l was going to get.

386
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,186
-Until now.
-And?

387
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,188
l finally asked myself, right...

388
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,190
...what's her fix?

389
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,193
Television, right?

390
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:31,196
l mean if ever there's a TV
junkie it's the old lady.

391
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,199
lf l figure l owe her
a new set anyway...

392
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:37,202
...with all the wear
and tear it got.

393
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:39,204
You really love
her, don't you?

394
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,210
l don't know.
l guess so, y'know.

395
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,215
Most of the time l just
want her to be happy.

396
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:52,217
Let's go get it.

397
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,222

The red dress.

-Of course. He's a doctor.
-What kind of pills?

492
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,199
A purple one, a blue one...

00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:32,201
l mean, like what's in them.

494
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:35,204
Harry, l'm Sara Goldfarb,

495
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:38,207

Ma, l can hear ya grinding

00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,216
-That goes away at night.

501
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,218
Yeah, when l take
the green one.

502
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:51,220
ln thirty minutes l'm asleep.

503
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,222
Poof, just like that.

504
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,224
Ma, ma, ya gotta cut

505
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,975
l'm telling you, it's no good.

506
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,227
What do you mean

507
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,187
-Twenty five pounds l've lost.
-Big deal.

508
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,190
Do ya wanta be a dope
fiend for krists sake?

509
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:07,194

l am telling you that
croaker's no good.

511
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,199
How come you know
so much, huh?

512
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:15,202
How come you know more
about medicine than a doctor?

513
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,205
Believe me, ma. l know.

514
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,210
You'll get strung
out for krists sake.

515
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:27,214
Oh come on. l almost
fit in my red dress.

516
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:30,217
The one l wore to your
high school graduation.

517
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,220
The one your father
liked so much.

518
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:36,223
l remember how he looked
at me in the red dress.

519
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:40,227
What's the big deal
about the red dress?

520
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:45,232
l'm going to wear the red...

521
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,235
You don't know?

522
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,237
l'm going to be on television.

523
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,240

an application and...

524
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:56,243
C'mon ma, whose
pullin' ya leg?

525
00:42:56,326 --> 00:43:01,165
Oh no, l'm going to be a
contestant on television.

526
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,167
l don't know when yet...

527
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,170
But you'll see how proud you
are when you see your mother...

528
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:10,174
...in her red dress on
television, in golden shoes...

529
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:12,176
What is the big deal
about being on television?

530
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:15,179
Those pills will kill you
before you ever get on.

531
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:17,181
Big deal?

532
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,183
You drove up in a cab.

533
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:22,186
Did you see who had
the best seat?

534
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,188
l'm somebody now, Harry.

535
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,191
Everybody likes me.

536
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,192
Soon...

537
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,195
...millions of people
will see me...

538
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,197
...and they'll all like me.

539
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,199
l'll tell them about you...

540
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,201
...and your father.

541
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,204
How good he was to us.

542
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,206
Remember?

543
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,212
lt's a reason to get
up in the morning.

544
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,215
lt's a reason to lose weight...

545
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:54,218
...to fit in the red dress.

546
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,221
lt's a reason to smile.

547
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,184
lt makes tomorrow alright.

548
00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:07,189
What have l got, Harry?

549
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:12,194
Why should l even...

550
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:14,196
...make the bed or
wash the dishes?

551
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,197
l do them.

552
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:18,200
But why should l?

553
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:20,202
l'm alone.

554
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,205
Your father's gone.

555
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:25,207
You're gone.

556
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:29,211
l got no one....

557
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:31,213
...to care for.

558
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,216
What have l got, Harry?

559
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:41,223
l'm lonely.

560
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:45,227
l'm old.

561
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,230
You got friends, ma.

562
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:51,233
lt's not the same.

563
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,235
They don't need me.

564
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:01,160
l like the way l feel.

565
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:07,166
l like thinking about the red
dress and the television...

566
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:10,169
...and you and your father.

567
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:15,174

568
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,182

00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:31,190
...l'll come. Me and Marion.
We'll come for dinner.

571
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,192
That's good, you bring her.

572

soup and a roast.

You're my dream.

But maybe you gave me
a weaker one last time.

That isn't possibIe,
Mrs, GoIdfarb,

But something isn't the same.

614
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:23,172
You're just becoming
adjusted to them,

615
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:26,175
It's nothing to worry about
Mrs, GoIdfarb, okay,

00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:06,210
Maybe we should dip in now.

644
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:08,170
Come Marion, l already
told you, alright...

645
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,216
lt's all we have.

646
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:15,177
Tyrone is going to score
in the morning, Harry.

647
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,227
l don't know...

648
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:25,187
lt's a bitch out there.

649
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,232
lt'll be okay.

650
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,237
lt'll be okay, Harry.

651
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,243
Yeah...

652
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,203
...l guess so.

653
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,254
l love you, Harry.

654
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:32,212
What seems to be the problem?
The weight's doing fine.

655
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:35,215
The weight is fine. l'm not.

656
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:38,218
The refrigerator...

657
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:41,221
Something wrong?

658
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:46,226
Everything's....

659
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:52,232
...all mixed up.

660
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,234
-Confused like...
-That's nothing to worry about.

661
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,236
Just get this filled.

662
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,238
Make an appointment
for a week.

663
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:09,166
Well?

664
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:12,169
Tyrone ain't
found nothing yet.

665
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:16,173
What are we going to do?

666
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,175
l don't know.

667
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:20,177
Well you have to
do something here.

668
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,180
lt's your fault that we don't
have something for the morning.

669
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,182
What are you talking about?

670
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,184
You were all hot in the
biscuit to get off last night.

671
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,187
-That is such bullshit!
-You didn't have to, okay.

672
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,189
-We could have something now.
-What was l supposed to do?

673
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,192
To sit around and watch you
push-off and not go myself?

674
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,194
Just don't put it
all on me, okay.

675
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,207
Don't worry, man.

676
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,209
We'll fill it up again.

677
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,211
Y'know, things'll get better.

678
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:58,215
Then we'll be filling
the box back up, y'know.

679
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,183
So you want to
hear the news?

680
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:10,185
What news?

681
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:13,188
You got your good news
and the bad news.

682
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,191
Shoot.

683
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,193
The good news is in
a couple of days...

684
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:21,196
...there's going to be some
prime back on the street.

685
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,198
Really!

686
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,203
-Who told you that?
-Angel.

687
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:29,204
Yeah?

688
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:32,207
Yeah, Sal the Geep let
go a couple a keys go...

689
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:34,209
...for the Christmas season.

690
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:36,211
Him being a good Christian...

691
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:39,214
...he wants no wanting during
this glorious season.

692
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:42,217
-You believe it?
-Well l did.

693
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,219
Until l heard the bad news.

694
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,226
Yeah...

695
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:54,229
The price is doubled...

696
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:57,232
...and you'll have to cop for
weight at least half a piece.

697
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:58,233
How much?

698
00:55:58,275 --> 00:56:01,153
-Two.
-Two?

699
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:03,155
That's fuckin' insane!

700
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:05,157
What the fuck you gonna do?

701
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,159
The man ain't goin' to lay
no nickel bag on you.

702
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,036
Where we gonna get two?

703
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:11,163
You mean Arnold?

704
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:15,167
Well, your parents won't
even return your call.

705
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,171
l haven't seen him in months.

706
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:21,173
So what? He's still
calling, ain't he?

707
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:22,174
l don't know.

708
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,178
Look, l don't know
what else to do.

709
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:30,182
Okay, this is our last chance
to get back on track.

710
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:33,185
We won't have to make that
freezing scene every day.

711
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:37,189
We need the bread.

712
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:41,193
Getting the money is
not the problem, Harry.

713
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:44,196
Then what is the problem
for Christs sake?

714
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:47,199
l don't know what l'm going
to have to do to get it.

715
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,206
Look...

716
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:56,208
...baby...

717
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:01,129
We'll be back in
business in no time.

718
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:03,131
We'll start moving again...

719
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,135
...and we'll start saving.

720
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:13,141
lt'll be perfect. Just like
it was. l promise, Marion.

721
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,147
You'll see.

722
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,158
No, l've just...

723
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:32,161
...l had the flu forever
it seems like.

724
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:36,165
Are you depressed?

725
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:38,167
No, it's nothing like
that. l've been...

726
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,170
...l've been really busy.

727
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:44,173
Actually l've been
designing non stop.

728
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:45,174
That's wonderful.

729
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:47,176
l'm glad to hear
you've been productive.

730
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,183
To be perfectly frank...

731
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,186
...l was a little surprised
to hear from you.

732
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:03,150
-ls something wrong?
-No.

733
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:06,153
-Why?
-Well...

734
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,155
...that's usually the case
when you get a call...

735
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:10,157
...from someone you haven't
heard from for a while.

736
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,159
Everything's fine.

737
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:18,165
Actually...

738
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,171
...l have a favor to ask.

739
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:33,180
You smug fuck!

740
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:35,182
What is it?

741
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:42,189
l need to borrow
some money.

742
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,191
May l ask what for?

743
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:48,195
Could you turn the light off?

744
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:50,197
What do you want
the light off for?

745
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,199
l just do.

746
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:56,203
-You never did before.
-Please, Arnold.

747
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:27,206
Where is everybody?

748
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:28,207
l don't know, man.

749
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,210
All they said was meet
at Waldbaum's.

750
01:02:34,254 --> 01:02:36,215
Are you sure this is
the right Waldbaum's?

751
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:38,217
Yeah man, l'm positive,
alright.

752
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:43,222
Look, you just watch my back,
and l'll watch yours, alright?

753
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:49,228
What the fuck are we
supposed to do now?

754
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,159
Everyone and their mother.

755
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:08,163
Yeah, the truck's going
to be here. Back up.

756
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:13,168
Back up!

757
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:44,218
Stupid fucking junkie, man.
We're fucked!

758
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,219
We are fucked.

759
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,221
That's the last shit for miles.

760
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:51,225
We'll sit here ass deep in
some motherfucking snow.

761
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:57,231
What would happen if we
went down there to cop?

762
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:59,233
-You serious?
-Why not?

763
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:01,151
What the fuck
are you saying?

764
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:04,154
We supposed to walk up to
some mutha fuckin' room clerk...

765
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:06,156
...at some hotel an' ask
him for a connection?

766
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,159
Can't you nose out some
dope when it's around?

767
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:11,161
Man...

768
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:13,163
...we got nothin' to lose.

769
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:15,165
lt's wide open, and if
we get there right away...

770
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:17,167
...we can name
our own price...

771
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,461
...and we can sit back
and be cool and have...

772
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:21,171
...those fucking fools
scufflin' the streets for us.

773
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:23,173
Hey man...

774
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:27,177
...las' summer was a mutha'
fuckin' ball, huh jim.

775
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:34,184
Seems like a thousan' years
ago since las' summer, man.

776
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:38,188
lt'll be back like
that again, man.

777
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:44,194
l could get Angel to
get us a short if...

778
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:47,197
...we promise him
some dynamite scag.

779
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:07,152
Where have you been?

780
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:09,154
Where the hell do
you think l've been?

781
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:12,157
Where's the score?

782
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:14,159
Well... we had a little
bit of a problem.

783
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,162
See, l mean everything was
going good. And then...

784
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:19,164
...some dumb ass junkie...

785
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:20,165
Did what?

786
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:24,169
Some dumb ass junkie did what?
You mean you fucked it up?

787
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:26,171
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

788
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:27,172
You promised me
that everything...

789
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:28,173
...was going to be okay,
remember?

790
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:30,175
l fucked that
sleazebag for you.

791
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:32,177
And l put myself through
fucking hell for you!

792
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:35,180
-There's nothing out there.
-l don't give a shit!

793
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,182
You fucking loser!

794
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:42,187
You want to be sure
we have some extra stuff?

795
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:45,190
Ty told me about a guy
who's holding some weight.

796
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:47,192
But he ain't selling it!

797
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,194
-Yeah?
-Hey Ty...

798
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:51,196
...give me that guy's number.

799
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,199
-What guy?
-The guy who Iikes broads,

800
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:56,201
-Big Tim? Why?
-Give me the fucking number,,,

801
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:57,202
...for krists sake.

Here, Mrs. Goldfarb, sip this.

Sometimes it takes awhile
to get called for a show...

900
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:34,201
...Mrs. Goldfarb.

901
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:41,208
-This her?

And you should see
my Harry on television.

Okay Mrs. Goldfarb.

God damned jim,

01:17:51,255 --> 01:17:53,215
A few days.

921
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:56,218
That shit don't
look too good.

922
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,220
lt don't feel too
good either, man.

923
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:03,142
But a little stuff will
take care of that.

924
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:05,144
Hey, what's wrong with you.
Don't shoot in there.

925
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:07,146
l'll blow it if l don't.

926
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:09,148
Fuck it!

927
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,163
Oh shit.

928
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:41,180
Hi, how are you.

929
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:42,181

01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:46,185
-Did you take anything?
-l took my red dress in.

931
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:48,187
No emergency.
Take her to psych.

932
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,116
Come on in.

933
01:19:11,168 --> 01:19:13,128
What's your name?

934
01:19:15,172 --> 01:19:17,132

935
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:19,134
Well what do you know.

936
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:21,136
Maid Marion.

937
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:29,144
l'm Little John.

938
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:34,149
You have a beautiful view...

939
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:40,155
What l like best about patty
chicks is they give good head.

940
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:43,158
Black broads don't know
nothing about no head.

941
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:45,160
l don't know why.

942
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:48,163
Maybe it has something
to do with some ancient...

943
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:49,164
...tribal custom.

944
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:12,187
Better save some
of that energy.

945
01:20:29,246 --> 01:20:31,206
l know it's purty baby...

946
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:34,209
...but l didn't take
it out for air.

947
01:20:50,267 --> 01:20:54,229
l told you to stay
away from that arm.

948
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:58,233
l gotta call Marion, man.

949
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:01,195
Well it's about to be a
long distance call now.

950
01:21:01,236 --> 01:21:03,197
That's six hundred miles.

951
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:06,200
Man, we are six hundred
miles closer to Miami.

952
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:09,203
Yeah. We're also six hundred
miles further away...

953
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:10,204
...from New York, Ty.

954
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,212
You know, l know where
you could pick up...

955
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:19,213
...a real nice taste.

956
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:23,217
Sunday night we're throwing
a little gathering.

957
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:24,218
All good people.

958
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:27,221
l can't. l'm busy.

959
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:29,223
Anyway, l'm not
really hooked.

960
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:33,227
Yeah, l know. But l'm tellin'
ya', it's a real nice taste.

961
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:41,235

Maid Marion.

962
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:45,239
Okay Mrs. Goldfarb. Just try

01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:39,209
Oh man.

We got to get you

978
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:56,226
What is that?

979
01:22:57,269 --> 01:23:00,189
What is that?

980
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:41,230
What's the problem?

981
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:42,231
My arm.

982
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:45,234
-My arm, it's killing me.
-Let's have a look at it.

983
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:51,240

986
01:24:26,275 --> 01:24:31,196
l tell them ''Hey, you guys go
ahead, l don't feel good.

987
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,198
Sure enough,
they leave the room...

988
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:35,200
Ready? One... two... three...

989
01:24:37,244 --> 01:24:39,204
And then as soon
as they leave...

990
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:41,206
...l go running back
down to the casino...

991
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:43,208
Sit at my blackjack table.

992
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:45,210
Man, l am there for

He's a security guard...

01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:04,146
...and he's telling me

...and you don't seem

...want to try some
alternative methods.

1032
