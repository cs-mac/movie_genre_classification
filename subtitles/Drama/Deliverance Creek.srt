1
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:51,016
- Hey.
- Nice shiny blade there.

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,201
- Stand easy.
They're ours.

3
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,070
- Stand easy!

4
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,315
- Looks like you claimed

5
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:27,319
another easy victory
for the union, major.

6
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,992
- Where's your regiment from?

7
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:38,730
- Kind of a ragtag bunch
from all over.

8
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:04,456
- Well, lookee here,
this one's still alive.

9
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,392
- Just finish him off, cyril.

10
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:11,163
- Well, now,
where is the fun in that?

11
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,466
- Don't kill me.
Look, I know something.

12
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,368
We're going to pick up our pay.

13
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,772
It's coming all in gold--
six union regiments' worth.

14
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,009
- Where?

15
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,578
- Uh, deliverance creek,
missouri.

16
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,880
- When?

17
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:32,951
- Ah, I don't know.
I didn't hear that part.

18
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,521
- You didn't hear that part.

19
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:38,357
Well, then I guess
you don't need

20
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,026
both these ears of yours,
now, do you?

21
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,162
And look, see,

22
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,331
I could use another pair
for my collection.

23
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,737
- No, please! Don't!
Stop! Aah!

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,386
- Forward!

25
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,189
- Come on, boys,
let's move out!

26
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,602
- Toby!

27
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,029
- I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

28
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,032
- Oh.

29
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,800
You have the worst timing.

30
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:33,705
- Oh, come on, I'm one
of only two deputies left.

31
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,542
- When I saw you riding up,

32
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,013
I thought you was harlan
coming home.

33
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,850
- You know, you want me
to stop coming by, belle,

34
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,318
just say so.

35
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,920
- No.

36
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,789
I want to see more
of you, nate.

37
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,659
In fact, I don't know
what we're waiting for.

38
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,594
I haven't had even a letter
in over two years,

39
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,397
and if that don't
make me a widow...

40
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,741
- Don't sit right--me being
with another man's wife,

41
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:14,146
but I couldn't have stopped this
even if I tried.

42
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:19,017
So, when the time comes,
will you marry me?

43
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,722
Yeah.

44
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,126
But you're not saying
we have to wait until then,

45
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,261
though, are you?

46
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,563
- No, ma'am.

47
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,667
I'm off duty sunday.
You can be back before sunup.

48
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,539
Now, come on...

49
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:45,677
Let's go scare the hell
out of those kids of yours, huh?

50
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,778
- Jeb.
What do you want?

51
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,814
- Oh, just making sure
everything's all right

52
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,583
over here, neighbor.

53
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,687
Thank you for checking in on us,
but we're making do.

54
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,222
You'll have to excuse me.
I have supper to fix.

55
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,790
- Well, now, come on, now.

56
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,527
I see deputy cooper
riding up here all the time.

57
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,630
Why accept his help
when I'm right next door?

58
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,805
- You're drunk.

59
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,007
Go on home and sleep it off.

60
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,443
- Yeah?

61
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,348
- You goddamn bitch!

62
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,450
Oh!

63
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,154
- Get off my ranch!

64
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,628
- You're gonna regret this.

65
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,665
- Give my regards
to your wife.

66
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,203
- Where have you been?

67
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,005
- I went over to tell
belle barlowe

68
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,973
her calves got
mixed in with ours.

69
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,608
She went off hollering.

70
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,610
I shouldn't even have
to deal with that woman.

71
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,413
That land should be ours,
cordelia.

72
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,482
- That burr in your boot
have anything to do

73
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,584
with that handprint
on your cheek, jeb?

74
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,520
- You even listening
to me, woman?

75
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,955
I'm telling you what's what.

76
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,391
- Well, go clean up for supper.

77
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,746
- You got to leave tonight.

78
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,982
It's true.

79
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,750
- You know I don't know
what it says.

80
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,752
- Slave auction's
coming here monday.

81
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,988
This was on master's desk
with a list.

82
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,058
You and the boys
are on it, moses.

83
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,392
There's peppers
to throw off the dogs

84
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,128
and enough food to last
till you get there.

85
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,197
- Wait. You're not
coming with us?

86
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,333
- Little edward's still poorly.
- Kessie.

87
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,768
- Master thinks I'm down here
making a mustard plaster.

88
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,238
If I leave now, he'll know
five minutes after I've left.

89
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,441
- Then we'll wait.
We go together.

90
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,276
- You go now. He won't even
notice you're gone till morning.

91
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,546
I'll pick my time and go.

92
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:38,116
It's okay, baby. We're gonna be
together real soon.

93
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,819
- Kessiah--kessie,
master's looking for ya!

94
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,088
- I'm coming, alma!

95
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,956
They'll leave you
at the schoolhouse

96
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,826
in deliverance creek, missouri.

97
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,863
- I know all about
the underground railroad, ben.

98
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,865
- I just want you to be aware,
now, that's all.

99
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,534
- You spent all summer trying
to talk me into this, ben,

100
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,902
and now you're trying
to talk me out of it?

101
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,470
- Don't--now, hattie gatlin--

102
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,705
- what's this, just wanting
to use my schoolhouse

103
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,407
but not have me pick them up?

104
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,711
- You heard what happened
to those quakers out in fayette?

105
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,048
- I understand
the dangers, ben.

106
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,953
But I've never felt so right
about anything in my life.

107
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:20,926
Oh, hi.

108
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,494
What are you doing here
on a saturday?

109
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,297
Don't you know
that there's no school?

110
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,032
Hey, where's your mama at?

111
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,733
- Hi, aunt hattie.
- Hi, caleb.

112
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,835
What a wonderful surprise.

113
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,038
Hi.

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,840
- All right, go play.
- Run along.

115
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,677
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,614
- Pleasure to see you,
mrs. Barlowe.

117
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,516
- Why, hello, ben.

118
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:49,187
- I'll be seeing
you ladies at church.

119
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,292
- Awfully early
to come a-courtin'.

120
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,928
- You ride all the way out here
to give me a hard time?

121
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,769
Can you come stay sunday night?

122
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,573
I can be back before sunup.

123
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:12,243
- Are you and nate
passing the night together?

124
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,179
This war's not gonna
last forever, belle.

125
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,548
What if harlan finds out?
- Harlan is dead.

126
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,617
- You don't know he's dead.
- I know he's dead.

127
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,119
- People around here
are gonna figure it out.

128
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,954
- Tongues wag
no matter what I do.

129
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,222
- Belle...

130
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,857
- Is it that crazy to think

131
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:30,362
maybe this time
I can choose who I love?

132
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:34,065
- I just hope all this
turns out like you want it to.

133
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,667
- Thank you.

134
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,347
- Benjamin?

135
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,982
- Yes, aunt cordelia.

136
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,250
- Why didn't you tell me

137
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,519
belle barlowe is behind
on her payments?

138
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,989
- She makes a little payment
each month...

139
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,258
Same as most other
widows in town.

140
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,127
- She's not a widow,
last I heard.

141
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,595
- A war widow.

142
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,397
- How's she gonna round up
her cattle alone?

143
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,232
She's only got little ones.

144
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,733
- Why do you defend her so?

145
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,301
- I...

146
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,372
- Go nail this

147
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,442
to belle gatlin barlowe's
front door.

148
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,716
- One, two, three.

149
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,430
What's wrong, ma?

150
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,966
- Nothing.

151
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,768
You up for branding
some calves?

152
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,671
Thought maybe we could
take a few to auction this week.

153
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,440
Yeah!

154
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,789
- Ma, come here! Look!

155
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,024
That thieving son of a bitch

156
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,859
branded all four
of our spring calves.

157
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,427
- Jeb?

158
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,031
- How many other thieving
sons of bitches do we know?

159
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,309
- You're not gonna shoot
an unarmed man

160
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,577
coming out of his privy.

161
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,213
- I do whatever
I goddamn please.

162
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,348
Isn't that what you do, jeb?

163
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,185
- Jesus!

164
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,087
- You missed your mark,
or are you asking him to dance?

165
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,423
- Haven't rightly warmed up yet.

166
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,525
- What are you up to, belle?

167
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,594
- Well, clearly
not as much as you two!

168
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,295
See, jeb here's
been branding my calves

169
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,564
while you've been
leaving love notes for me

170
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,632
on my front porch!

171
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,468
- I run a bank, belle,
not a charity.

172
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,638
- Stop jawing and get my gun,
cordelia.

173
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,174
Jeez! You could've
blown my knee off!

174
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,609
What do you want?

175
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,445
- You owe me four--

176
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,048
five--
five calves! You hear?

177
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,751
- Five?
I'm pretty certain that--

178
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,253
All right!

179
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,088
All right, all right, all right!
All right! All right!

180
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,390
Son of a--

181
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:16,161
fine.
We'll bring 'em round.

182
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,696
- No, we'll take 'em now.

183
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,735
- You heard her, boy!
Get those calves.

184
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,270
- Yes, master.

185
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,047
- I'm pretty sure if jeb
hadn't just visited the privy,

186
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,350
he'd have wet his pants
for sure.

187
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,670
- How we feeling,
master edward?

188
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,271
Let's have a listen.

189
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,440
- Okay.
- All the way up.

190
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,383
What do you hear, kessie?

191
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,587
- It's what I don't hear,
master edward.

192
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,755
Your chest ain't crackling
like a fire.

193
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:22,760
- Master grayson
wants to see you, kessie...

194
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,696
Now.

195
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,437
- You wanted to see me,
master?

196
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,144
- That day that I bought you,

197
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,480
it was hot.

198
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,016
You remember?

199
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,386
What was it--july?

200
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,289
I could tell
just by looking at you

201
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:55,193
what a waste of your potential
stooping over cotton was.

202
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:58,263
I took you
out of those fields,

203
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,633
brought you into my home.

204
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,337
And this is how you repay me.

205
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,841
- I'm sorry, master.
Have I done something wrong?

206
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:13,845
- Don't you do that! Don't you
insult my intelligence!

207
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:17,782
That dumb field slave
that you jumped the broom with

208
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,118
couldn't find his way
to the bottom of the road

209
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,854
without you drawing him a map.

210
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,723
You know what I'm doing here?

211
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm drafting up
etta mae's freedom papers.

212
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,562
You know why?

213
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,766
- 'Cause she can't
work the fields no more?

214
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:39,537
- I'm freeing etta mae
because she is loyal.

215
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,606
But you...

216
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,018
I'm never freeing you.

217
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,521
- Kessie?

218
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:00,758
- Master edward,
what are you still doing up?

219
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,628
- Looks like someone's
feeling better.

220
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,730
But shouldn't you be
in bed, edward?

221
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,799
- I'm not tired, daddy.

222
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,734
Look.

223
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,503
- Master edward.

224
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,206
Oh, edward.

225
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,607
- Come on, edward.

226
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:20,044
It's time for bed. Now.

227
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,451
Go on. Clean it up.

228
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:55,113
Yeah, in your dreams.

229
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,248
Morning, miss gatlin.
Hattie.

230
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,517
- I've been a barlowe
for some time now, duke.

231
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,720
- Oh, you'll always be
the gatlin sisters to me.

232
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,992
Pray for me, won't you, hattie?
- If you think it'll help.

233
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,664
Hey, give me that.

234
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,272
- Mind your manners.
- Yes.

235
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,041
- He came home, and...

236
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:27,879
- Morning, jeb. Miss crawford.
- Deputy cooper.

237
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,014
- How you doing?

238
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,486
I can't wait for tonight.

239
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,960
One, two, three.

240
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,796
- All right,
what are we gonna eat?

241
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,297
- We should make
a pie every day.

242
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,499
- Oh, pie.

243
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:55,473
Caleb, go take your brother
and sister to the barn, please.

244
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,700
- If it's food you want,
I'll fix it.

245
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,870
- All right, then...
I'll have a steak,

246
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,407
kidney pie with the crust
just ever so slightly burnt.

247
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,143
Jasper!

248
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,781
- Hey, little sis.

249
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,119
- Ooh!

250
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,654
- The hell was that for?

251
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,491
- Scaring me and the children
half to death.

252
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:57,295
What are you doing
in these damn uniforms?

253
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,332
You hurt?

254
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,135
- It's not my blood.

255
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,574
It's toby's, belle.

256
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,720
- I'll tell caleb
to go fetch doc burton.

257
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,323
- You're gonna have
to help him, belle.

258
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:29,293
No one can know we're here.

259
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,829
- Get!

260
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,231
Come on!

261
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,240
- It's safe.
Come on out.

262
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,750
- Five?

263
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,552
My sister's root cellar's
not gonna hold more than three.

264
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,454
I mean, or I could
come back in the morning

265
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,990
and take them straight
to the next pickup.

266
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,358
- One of the higgins boys
spotted me

267
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,727
coming back from
the schoolhouse this morning.

268
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,295
- Those higgins boys
work for indian john.

269
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:06,831
- That's right.
- Who's indian john?

270
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,633
- Slave bounty hunter.

271
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,002
He's a white man,
but he dresses like an injun,

272
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,704
scalps like one.

273
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,506
- I'll take them all.

274
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:19,110
- No, hattie. They won't be able
to hide behind the shelves.

275
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,078
- These folks were here
before us. They should go.

276
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,380
- But please take my boys now.

277
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,115
Together they barely
add up to one man.

278
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,616
- Huh?
- Pa, please.

279
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,451
- Go on, son. I'll wait here.
- No, pa, please.

280
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,520
- You can get me in the morning
when they're safe.

281
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,156
Maybe by then,
their ma'll be here.

282
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,432
- I got it.

283
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,802
- You did good, little sis.

284
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,004
- Don't congratulate me yet.

285
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:51,609
I still got to stitch him
back up now.

286
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,114
So...

287
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:00,017
You seen harlan?

288
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,387
- He's dead, belle.

289
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,598
- You certain about that?

290
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,603
- Crossed paths with ren
right after we left bloody bill.

291
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,539
He fought with harlan
at palmito hill.

292
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:26,610
No one from the creek
survived except ren.

293
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:30,047
- Well...

294
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,716
May he rest in peace.

295
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:35,586
- You don't need to play the
grieving widow with me, belle.

296
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:39,690
- Go burn those
union jackets now, you hear?

297
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,347
- You let her go.
That's my sister.

298
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,783
- What's going on here, belle?

299
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,184
- Hattie?

300
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:10,254
Come here and give
your big brother a hug.

301
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,892
- Jasper.

302
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,461
- You got big.

303
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,265
- What are you doing
bringing these men here?

304
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,135
- You heard the lady. Get.

305
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,404
Stop scaring all my kin.

306
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,240
Hey, runt,
put these on the fire.

307
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,610
Don't want to leave
no evidence.

308
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,745
- What is this? You desert?

309
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,581
- You're looking at my own
personal regiment.

310
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,850
Started with quantrill,
rode with bloody bill,

311
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,853
and now it's just us.

312
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,656
- Were you with quantrill
when he raided lawrence?

313
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,692
You murder all those
women and children?

314
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:49,860
- You a yankee now, hattie?

315
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,695
- She is no such thing.

316
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:55,433
- You forget about daddy
being hog-tied...

317
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,201
And hung...

318
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:00,304
By those very same yankees
you seem to love so much?

319
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,939
Hell, just the thought of it

320
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,742
makes me want to ride across
that river and kill some more.

321
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,877
- Those were innocent
women and children.

322
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,781
- Whose fathers and husbands
and sons murdered our daddy.

323
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,316
- That's enough, jasper.

324
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,318
Hattie, you come with me.

325
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,352
Help me fix something
for these men to eat.

326
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,922
- Good to see you, hattie.

327
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,561
- You best watch yourself,
hattie.

328
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,497
- Belle, they're
in the root cellar--

329
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,832
slaves.

330
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,733
- Throw
another jacket on, runt!

331
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,470
- Whoo!
- They're not safe here, hattie.

332
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:36,273
They find them, they're gonna
kill 'em just for fun.

333
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,281
Come on, now.

334
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:48,519
It's not safe.
We got to get you out of here.

335
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,156
You can't let jasper
and his gang stay, belle.

336
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,593
- These are just little ones.

337
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,561
Is that their ma and pa?

338
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,463
- Get in. Their pa
is back with the spencers.

339
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,066
- Why didn't they all
just stay there?

340
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,134
- Because bounty hunters
are after him.

341
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,139
- You are making me sick
with worry, hattie.

342
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,375
Did ben crawford
put you up to all this?

343
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:15,112
'Cause I don't like it.

344
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,248
You need to go tell nate
I'm not coming.

345
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,216
Just don't say why.

346
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,356
You be careful.

347
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:08,232
- I hoped I'd never set eyes
on you again.

348
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,636
- And I hoped you'd be
fat and ugly by now,

349
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,738
so I guess we're even.

350
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,779
- Ah.

351
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,484
I don't know why
you're so mad at me.

352
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,486
You're the one that ran off and
married that old son of a bitch.

353
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,123
- And when the preacher said,
"does anyone here object?"

354
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,626
You were nowhere to be found.

355
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:39,229
- We was just kids, belle.

356
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,500
- Now that we're all grown up,
did it ever occur to you

357
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:47,204
that maybe it wasn't my idea
to become mrs. Harlan barlowe?

358
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,375
You rest up now, toby.

359
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,481
- We should ambush 'em,
do what we're good at--

360
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,216
hit 'em from the trees,
get in and out

361
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,818
before they know
what's hit 'em,

362
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,054
kill half of 'em before
they even know they're dead.

363
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,091
- We robbed a bank
in daylight.

364
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:10,127
- Yeah, mayb--

365
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,263
- How's toby?

366
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,900
- Well, fever's down.

367
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,904
- I was gonna suggest you cheer
us all by playing the piano,

368
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,774
but it does seem to be missing.

369
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,010
- Times are tough.

370
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,347
You were born with that beard,
weren't you?

371
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:34,151
Why shave it off now?

372
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,120
What'd you do, jasper?

373
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,355
Roy...

374
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,557
- Robbed a couple saloons
in kansas.

375
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,561
- Now you think
you're ready to rob a bank...

376
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,130
Hmm?

377
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:49,600
That's what I've been hearing
your men whispering about?

378
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,735
- Six union regiments

379
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,271
are getting their pay
in deliverance...

380
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,241
Coming by stagecoach

381
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,209
filled with solid gold.

382
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,444
- When?

383
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,012
- I'm still working on that.

384
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,781
- Hell, jasper, now,
that is the most important part!

385
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,116
- Well, it's coming, and when
it does, I'm robbing it.

386
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,819
- Well, not while
you're staying here you're not.

387
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,121
No.
- Come on, belle.

388
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,657
I can see you're struggling.

389
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,427
And from the looks of it,

390
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,462
you've been struggling
for quite some time now.

391
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:20,831
- Bank trying
to take your ranch?

392
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,801
- Where'd you get that?

393
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,469
It's just crawfords
thinking they can take

394
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:28,105
with one little piece of paper
what's rightfully mine.

395
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,808
- So then why don't you
help us rob 'em blind?

396
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,843
What I don't understand
is why you

397
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,611
have to work so hard
to keep this here ranch.

398
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,280
With the money from the bank,

399
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:39,750
you can take your kids,
start fresh somewhere.

400
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,723
- Maybe I want to start
my life over here...

401
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,092
In deliverance.

402
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,900
- You got yourself
a fella, belle?

403
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,237
Is that what changed you?

404
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,243
We're robbing that bank...

405
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,947
With or without you.

406
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,958
- Whoa, whoa.

407
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,352
- Come on.

408
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:15,679
Wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

409
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,153
That shipment needs
to go out tonight, duke.

410
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:27,491
- I wish I could help you.
Really, I do, but it's--

411
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,026
it's jimmy's night off.

412
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,494
- Isn't there something
you can do to persuade him?

413
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,597
- You're very persuasive.
Ask him yourself.

414
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,066
He's in the bar.

415
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,569
- You just tell me
when you want me to stop, okay?

416
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,238
- Then again, you might not
want a drunken ferryman

417
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,074
in charge
of your precious cargo.

418
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,146
- Can they stay the night,
somewhere in the saloon maybe?

419
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,248
- All my guests
are the paying kind.

420
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,219
The only reason I agreed
to our arrangement tomorrow

421
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,020
is I think...

422
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:01,692
I think you may be the one
truly good person I know.

423
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:07,397
Myself, well,
I'm bound to burn in hades.

424
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:12,436
But the way I see it,
sometimes you can beat the odds.

425
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,640
- Hey, hey, hey.

426
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:19,076
Hey, what is it?

427
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,044
- Oh, god.

428
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,681
They hung levi spencer
and his wife--

429
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,149
slave bounty hunters.

430
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,418
I said that I would come back
for their father,

431
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,289
but they're just children.
- Shh, shh, shh.

432
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,031
They're in my wagon now.

433
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,168
- You got to stop this, hattie.

434
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,404
It's not a game.

435
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,418
How many are there?

436
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,454
- Four.

437
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,356
Two are just children.

438
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,892
- They can stay.

439
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,261
I'll dump whatever whiskey
we have left,

440
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,397
hide them in the barrels
in the morning

441
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,465
and get them across as planned.

442
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,135
But then that's the end.

443
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,771
You hear me?

444
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,915
- What are you doing up?

445
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,019
- I had a bad dream.

446
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,189
- Well, you know what?
You're still dreaming.

447
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,360
You know you can fly
when you're dreaming.

448
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,828
Okay?

449
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,204
- Are you and the kids
all right?

450
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,473
- Yes, we're fine. Hattie really
shouldn't have said anything.

451
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:47,511
- I never saw hattie.
And you never showed--

452
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,179
who are those men, belle?

453
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:51,515
- That's my brother jasper
and some men he served with.

454
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,650
- So that was your brother
I saw you with in there?

455
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,786
He's been shot.
- Yes.

456
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,422
That's not jasper.
That's a friend...

457
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,358
From when we was kids.

458
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,426
- Come on, get the kids up.
I'm taking you with me.

459
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,895
- I'm not leaving my ranch.

460
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:06,396
- Well, I'm not just
riding off and leaving

461
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,833
you and the kids alone
with a bunch of killers, belle.

462
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,436
- I know this is hard
for you to understand,

463
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,638
not being from deliverance.

464
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,139
- This ain't got nothing to do

465
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,874
with which side of the war
I'm on here, belle.

466
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,576
I've known all about jasper
and his gatlin gang

467
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,311
long before
this war ever started.

468
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,412
You're not staying.

469
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,848
- Well, see,
that's not your say.

470
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,716
- Can you imagine
how it would look?

471
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,985
You out here alone with them?

472
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,922
It's a small town, belle.

473
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:35,192
There's no secrets here.

474
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,094
- Go on, nate.

475
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,597
You want to share
any of those secrets with me?

476
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,600
- I know who you are, belle.

477
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:46,536
- Then you know I don't need you
to protect me.

478
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:53,310
- Fine.

479
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,213
If that's what you want.

480
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,064
- All right.

481
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,168
Keep 'em moving.

482
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,803
Serve 'em up when they're done.

483
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:24,007
I'm going to town.
I'll be back in a tick.

484
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,989
- I don't bite...

485
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:42,993
Unless it's breakfast.

486
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,467
I got those spurs from my pa.

487
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:28,738
If you like 'em, try 'em on.
Go ahead.

488
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,645
Come here.

489
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,317
Boy, look at that.

490
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,653
You got sausage fingers
just like me.

491
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:47,657
Give me your foot.

492
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,228
- So, uh...

493
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,730
Uh...

494
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,899
What was my mom like as a kid?

495
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:59,269
She was hotheaded.

496
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:02,305
She was brave.

497
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,207
Hell...

498
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,077
This here at least is the third
time she's saved my life.

499
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,246
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

500
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,750
Time before this,
I was right about your age.

501
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,952
It was before duke cleaned up
the whorehouse.

502
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,321
I was living there with my mama.
- What was it then?

503
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,590
- It was a dirty,
run-down whorehouse.

504
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:24,861
Anyway, this old cowboy--
he comes in after the roundup,

505
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,530
and he's all flush with cash
and liquored up,

506
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,899
and, well, he liked
this one whore named sadie

507
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,668
because she had this reputation

508
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,105
for having this
famously powerful cooch.

509
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,775
You know what?
I got a better story for ya.

510
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:40,176
- Come on.

511
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,078
- No, no, I couldn't
tell you that one.

512
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,384
Oh.
- I should let you rest up.

513
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:50,854
If you need me, just holler.

514
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:53,223
- What do I holler?

515
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,025
- Caleb. Caleb, sir.

516
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,133
- Nice to meet you, caleb.

517
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:07,070
How old are you, boy?
- 12.

518
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,707
12, sir.

519
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,380
I should take these off.

520
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:20,216
- No, no, no,
I want you to keep those.

521
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,719
- Nah. I couldn't.

522
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,587
- Yeah, you can.
I'll make you a deal.

523
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:29,826
Iffen ever I have a boy,
I know where to find 'em.

524
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,977
- Excuse me, ma'am.

525
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:52,115
Have you seen either
of these two men around town?

526
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,351
- No. I'm sorry.
I haven't.

527
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,087
- Thank you.

528
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,652
- You need to leave now,
jasper.

529
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,322
Union soldiers everywhere
looking for you.

530
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,990
Is toby able to ride?
- No way he can stay on a horse.

531
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,725
- Let's put him
in the root cellar.

532
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:36,993
The rest of you
need to ride on.

533
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,728
- Let's go, fellas.
- All right.

534
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,797
- Mount up.
- Mount up.

535
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,835
- Yah!

536
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,340
- Yah!

537
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,745
- What's going on, ma?
- Go. Go, go, go.

538
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,848
- What's going on?
- Up you go.

539
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,630
It's just like hide-and-seek.

540
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:15,431
You just got
to be quiet to win.

541
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:18,434
Okay? Okay.

542
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,878
What can I help
you gentlemen with?

543
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,813
- We'd like to search
your property, ma'am.

544
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,282
- What ever for?

545
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:33,983
- We're searching
for bushwhackers, ma'am.

546
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:36,886
They're not here.

547
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,423
- Well, we've been told
that they are.

548
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:42,759
- May I ask what brought on
this accusation?

549
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:46,896
- Why would you be burning
union regimental papers

550
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,766
and union officer insignia?

551
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,504
- Why do you think
I burned them?

552
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:56,205
Because I'm ashamed.

553
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,741
It's no secret my husband
fights for the confederates,

554
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,410
as do many men
from deliverance.

555
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:04,414
In the letters he sends home,
he includes little mementos

556
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,049
for his sons.

557
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,217
I won't even
let the children see them.

558
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,619
It's shameful.

559
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:13,022
- She's a bald-faced liar.

560
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:17,026
Everyone knows her husband
hasn't written in years.

561
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,336
- Let's go, men.

562
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,539
- Please.

563
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:33,643
Please.

564
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:36,346
Oh.

565
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:39,682
Can't you see
there's nobody in here?

566
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,919
Please stop this.

567
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,189
- Stop, ma'am.

568
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,824
- You're scaring my children.
- Stay down.

569
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:50,293
Stay down.

570
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:53,463
- One's coming down now!

571
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:56,032
- No! That's my son!

572
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,742
Oh!

573
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,616
Caleb. Caleb.

574
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:16,719
Ca--caleb, baby, caleb.

575
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,155
Caleb. Oh...

576
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,296
No.

577
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:32,301
Caleb. Caleb. Cal--

578
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,141
What have you done?

579
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:07,303
- The lord as my shepherd,
I shall not want.

580
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:10,306
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

581
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:14,010
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

582
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:15,545
He restores my soul.

583
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,014
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness

584
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:20,349
for his name's sake.

585
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:23,720
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

586
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:26,389
I will fear no evil...

587
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,648
I'm leaving.

588
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,517
But first I'm gonna
ride over there,

589
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,285
and I'm gonna kill
jeb crawford.

590
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,921
- You ride over there
all shot up,

591
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,190
barely able to sit in a saddle,

592
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:03,493
we may as well dig
another hole next to caleb,

593
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:04,961
'cause you won't be
coming back alive.

594
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:06,429
- I want to kill
all those crawfords

595
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,198
for what they took
from you, belle.

596
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,535
- What they took from us, toby.

597
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,674
He was your son.

598
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:22,345
Caleb was your boy.

599
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:26,582
I think
you must've known that.

600
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:31,654
Think you knew it the moment
my daddy made me marry harlan.

601
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,857
I think you knew it
when you took up

602
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,160
with that girl from carthage.

603
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:41,864
But I know you knew it
when you saw him.

604
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:45,535
He looked just like you, toby.

605
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,207
He was your son.

606
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:54,177
Harlan didn't know it.

607
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:57,413
I think you did.

608
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,068
- I love you.
You hear me?

609
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,242
Nate brought that for you.

610
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:39,248
- Is he still here?

611
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,385
- He left hours ago.

612
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,590
- I don't understand.
They came together.

613
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:25,761
How'd moses get separated
from our boys?

614
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,096
- This is my sister's ranch,

615
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,398
and her root cellar
only holds a few people.

616
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,368
- Moses insisted
hattie take your boys

617
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,603
along with an elderly couple
who'd been waiting.

618
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,473
We don't think
they killed moses.

619
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:42,011
But we are fairly certain they
took him back to the plantation.

620
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,318
- What's a crawford doing
on my property?

621
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,188
- I'll wait outside.

622
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,161
- He's nothing like the rest of
the crawfords, and you know it.

623
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,663
- Blood is blood.

624
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,765
- Put the gun down, belle.

625
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,636
This is the mother of those
two boys that were here.

626
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:08,871
This is kessie.

627
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:12,441
Kessie,
this is my sister, belle.

628
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,676
- She don't look
like a runaway.

629
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,845
Kessie forged
her own freedom papers.

630
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:17,713
She came by stagecoach.
- Negro can't read or write.

631
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:19,715
- She can, belle,
and she can talk, too,

632
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,250
so please address her directly.

633
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,719
- How'd she get the money
to come by stagecoach?

634
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,654
She forge that too?

635
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:31,627
- Master kept his papers and
money in a safe in his office.

636
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:35,097
I made a copy of that key and
broke in while he was sleeping.

637
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:40,770
You best watch yourself,
hattie,

638
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:43,472
'cause that is a tall tale
if I have ever heard one.

639
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:44,707
- Belle--

640
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,275
- if she can do all that,
now, why is she here

641
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,977
instead of across the river
with her boys?

642
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:50,179
- Because those bounty hunters
that hung the spencers

643
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,714
are out looking for her now.

644
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,687
I'm sorry about all this,
truly I am,

645
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,290
but I can't put franny and abner
in this kind of danger.

646
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:04,427
You're just gonna have
to hide her someplace else.

647
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,328
- I'm not asking you
to hide her.

648
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,999
We--ben and I think that
in order to keep her truly safe,

649
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,802
it's not to hide her--
you at all.

650
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:14,937
The safest thing for kessie

651
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:16,605
is to pretend to be
someone's slave.

652
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,375
- Why would I
be needing to do that?

653
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:22,545
I've got freedom papers.
It worked down south.

654
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:26,348
- We got no free slaves
here in deliverance.

655
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,051
- So who's gonna be
my new master--

656
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:32,421
you or mr. Crawford?

657
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,856
- Well, no one's gonna believe

658
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:37,593
that a schoolteacher
or a banker needs a slave.

659
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:41,764
But a rancher who used to own
slaves, on the other hand...

660
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,406
- We came back to murder
jeb and cordelia.

661
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:26,408
- Robbing that bank
first thing in the morning.

662
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,711
- Is that when
the gold is coming in?

663
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:32,848
- We're gonna take 'em
for everything they got, belle.

664
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,552
- I want revenge too.

665
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:38,687
But a bullet for each of them
while they sleep

666
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,490
is little comfort.

667
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,659
I want them to suffer
as I have suffered.

668
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,462
I want them to feel
what it's like to have

669
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:50,166
everything they love stripped
away from them piece by piece.

670
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:55,337
Caleb was my boy.

671
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,607
So, if you want my help,
you do it my way.

672
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,322
- So when do we figure
the gold comes in?

673
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:17,326
- When every deputy
in five counties is on duty.

674
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,931
I know how to get
that information.

675
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:30,105
- Belle.

676
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,647
- Thank you
for the piano, nate.

677
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:41,784
It's...
- I could come by later...

678
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:44,853
Move it wherever you like.

679
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:46,589
- Oh...

680
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:47,790
I would.

681
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:50,693
I would like that very much.

682
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,297
I'm so terribly thirsty.

683
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,533
I'm sorry.
- Come on, sit down.

684
00:53:57,535 --> 00:54:01,570
I'll get you a glass of water.

685
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:36,338
- Are you all right?

686
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,796
- I'm sorry
for your loss, belle.

687
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,065
- Thank you.

688
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,033
- Thank you, sir.
- Next.

689
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,812
- I came to set up
a payment plan

690
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:54,116
for that lien y'all sent over,
mr. Crawford.

691
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,517
- I'm sure we don't have

692
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,886
to take care of all that now,
mrs. Barlowe.

693
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,922
- If she can afford a slave,

694
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:02,257
she can afford
to pay back her debts.

695
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:03,525
Take her money, benjamin.

696
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:06,128
- Perhaps we can let
mrs. Barlowe

697
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,964
get back on her feet first.

698
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:12,167
- The tragedy
that befell mrs. Barlowe

699
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:15,404
was of her own doing.

700
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,274
- Your husband
led those union soldiers

701
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:21,310
directly to our front door.

702
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:26,148
- As the good book says,
"as ye sow, so shall ye reap."

703
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:33,889
- "I have sinned, for I have
betrayed innocent blood."

704
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:37,292
Matthew, chapter 27, verse 3.

705
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:42,064
Even judas felt guilt
for what he'd done, cordelia.

706
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,445
Mm...

707
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:49,031
- Mmm. Kessie makes
really good food.

708
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:51,233
- Yeah.

709
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:54,303
- Beets and corn on the cob
is really good.

710
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,604
- What did you do
at school today?

711
00:57:55,606 --> 00:58:00,075
- I learned about bugs,
like flies...

712
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,877
- You best sit down.
- That sounds good.

713
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,045
- It's still hot.

714
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:05,681
Hi, mama.

715
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,486
- So guess what.
- What?

716
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:14,690
- There--there was
a chicken, and it...

717
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:25,734
I learned about flowers.
- Were they roses?

718
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:09,311
- So what are you
gonna do next?

719
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:12,080
- I'll get my boys,

720
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:14,616
head north and try
and get some work,

721
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:19,121
earn enough money
to buy moses out of slavery.

722
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,290
- How long is that gonna take?

723
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:27,796
I could arrange for a white man
to buy moses back.

724
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,432
- Why are you saying all this?

725
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:35,537
- You really broke
into your master's safe?

726
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,275
You show me how you did it,

727
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,377
you have your whole family
back together in a week.

728
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:46,448
- White folks
always promise things.

729
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,951
But all they deliver is pain.

730
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:51,987
- Maybe it'll be
different this time.

731
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,805
Look, here's one
she made earlier.

732
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,109
- So all we got to do
is steal two keys,

733
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,811
which are probably
in the bank.

734
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,512
So what are we gonna do,
rob the goddamn bank twice?

735
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:18,847
- They're not gonna keep

736
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,949
the keys to the bank
in the bank, jasper.

737
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,684
- Look, I say we forget
all that, okay?

738
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:24,219
When the gold gets here,
we just hold 'em up

739
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:25,988
as they're loading it
in the back of the vault.

740
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,689
- How many soldiers
you think they're gonna have

741
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:29,491
protecting that gold, toby--

742
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:30,993
40, 50?

743
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,694
What, you think
the gatlin gang is gonna be able

744
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:34,363
to fight off
an entire union regiment?

745
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:36,698
- Belle's right, all right?
This is the only way to do this.

746
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,001
- And if done right,
no one gets hurt--

747
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:41,236
not us, not anyone
in deliverance.

748
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:44,106
Only people gonna feel
any pain is crawfords...

749
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:47,509
When they open that vault,
find it as empty as my pantry.

750
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:49,211
- And what's
she doing here, belle?

751
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:50,545
I mean, why are we trusting

752
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:51,947
a negro we don't even
damn well know?

753
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,849
- Because she's quick as a wink,
and without her,

754
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,751
we don't have a clue
how to break into a safe.

755
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,986
- Oh, yeah, and she can also
turn on us just like that.

756
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,688
Take all the reward money

757
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,523
and leave us hanging out
dry in the town square.

758
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:02,858
- I'll be long gone by then.

759
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,893
- You see what I mean?
She's uppity.

760
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:09,164
- I'm a runaway slave.
Who am I gonna go running to?

761
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,365
Who am I gonna tell?

762
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,067
I'm here for one reason--

763
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:14,136
that's to get my share
and collect my family,

764
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:15,504
then I'm gone.

765
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,412
- Cordelia's gonna have
one key.

766
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:25,080
- It's probably hanging
around her neck.

767
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,782
- Good, 'cause I'm gonna
strangle her with it.

768
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,117
- Ben crawford
probably has the other one.

769
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,658
- Mrs. Miller.
- Hello, ben.

770
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,060
- Why don't you let me
help you today?

771
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:40,228
- That's mighty
nice of you, ben.

772
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,530
- Here we go.

773
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:43,999
Oh. Pardon me.

774
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:46,001
Now, let me...

775
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,943
- Garret,
head on over to fontaine.

776
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,446
Pick me up a load
of pine planks.

777
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:05,881
Use belle's wagon.

778
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:07,182
Runt, I want you to find me

779
01:03:07,184 --> 01:03:09,417
four dead possum,
muskrat, whatever.

780
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:10,919
The deader, the better.

781
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,723
- Dutch, you're about my size.

782
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:16,892
So take finn here
over to lafayette

783
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:18,693
and pick toby and I up
a couple black wool suits.

784
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,229
And how about a couple
top hats and ties?

785
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,230
- Top hats?

786
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,299
Ties?

787
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,768
I thought we was
robbing a bank.

788
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:29,838
- Who the hell says we ain't?

789
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,742
- What are we doing?
What is all this?

790
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,145
- Y'all got a job to do.
Get.

791
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,381
- Come on, then.

792
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:40,949
- Hey, cyril.

793
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,821
Cyril...

794
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:49,991
You ever question my authority
again in front of my men,

795
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,060
I will kill you.

796
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,805
- I must say,
it's a point of pride

797
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:06,508
that you've chosen our bank,
major mccallister.

798
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,644
My family is loyal
union supporters.

799
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,346
The walls are solid brick,

800
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:15,550
and the vault is solid steel.
- The vault's not ready.

801
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:17,085
- Oh, they're just
finishing now.

802
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:18,386
Is it ready?

803
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:19,888
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.

804
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,723
- I don't think many banks,

805
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:24,860
even in new york city,
have one.

806
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,995
It was just invented
last year.

807
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:29,030
- Still, I'd like
to have one of my men

808
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,166
posted inside your bank.

809
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:36,404
- Well, that won't be necessary.

810
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,940
We have our own security
inside the bank.

811
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:01,663
Oh, god, no!
No, not me, oh!

812
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,737
Look how easy that would be,

813
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:12,274
like picking fat ticks off
a sleeping dog.

814
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:15,377
Instead, here we sit, idle.

815
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:18,546
Seems queer, don't it?

816
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:19,948
If toby and jasper
don't come out

817
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,716
that bank tonight
with bags of gold,

818
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:23,585
we're going in
and do what we should've done

819
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:26,154
in the first place.

820
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:29,190
As long as jasper's taking
orders from his little sister,

821
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:31,226
you're all taking orders
from me, you hear?

822
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:32,761
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

823
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,703
- Oh, ben.

824
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:43,471
- I got your note.
Everything all right?

825
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:45,040
- It is.

826
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:46,975
It's just, I went out
to see kessie this morning,

827
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:49,177
and she's anxious
to see her boys.

828
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,246
She wants to head out tomorrow,
first thing.

829
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:54,049
- That's when we're doing
the union payroll.

830
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:56,418
We could set out the next day,
when things settle.

831
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,819
- I mean, I can take her,

832
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,454
I just need to know where
the boys are, ben.

833
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,589
- I-I don't--
I don't want you to go alone.

834
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,124
- It doesn't take
two of us, ben.

835
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,327
If we feel like it's safe,
I can take her.

836
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:07,796
I just need to know where.

837
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:09,164
So you don't think
I can handle it?

838
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,032
- Now, hattie gatlin,
that is not what I said.

839
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,801
- You don't have to--
it's written all over your face,

840
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:14,336
which is incredibly insulting,

841
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:16,504
since I've already done
a few runs on my own.

842
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,106
What?

843
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:20,508
- That's not what's written
on my face here...

844
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,843
That's all.

845
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:24,245
- Ben crawford,
if you want to say something.

846
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:26,247
Then just tell me what you--

847
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:39,561
- now, I'm working
all night tonight...

848
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:43,198
And probably half
the day tomorrow.

849
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,570
Then you and I will take kessie
to see her boys...

850
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:50,772
Together.

851
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:13,628
- You've got your lantern,
a pot of coffee, and a bucket.

852
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,663
- How generous, aunt cordelia.

853
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:17,499
- I'll be back at 6:00
in the morning.

854
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,934
I got you this shotgun.

855
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,937
You won't even have to use it.

856
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:26,174
- You asked me to do this,
so I'm here.

857
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,713
- I raised you like a son.

858
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,883
You're the only one I trust.

859
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:15,223
Hattie knows the kids
are staying with mom, but...

860
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,225
In case anything goes wrong...

861
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:19,494
- I've been thinking about--
- don't.

862
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:21,463
That works for some,
but not for you.

863
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:24,532
- Come on, belle.

864
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:26,468
I'm sorry, okay?

865
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:29,904
I'm--I'm sorry that I never saw
what was right in front

866
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,940
of my own damn face,
and if I could go back

867
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,875
and do it over again, I would--
I want to.

868
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:36,611
- It don't work that way, toby.
You know that.

869
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:40,115
- After this robbery,
let's just leave, okay?

870
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,317
Just you and me,
and we'll start a new family,

871
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,620
and I'll--I'll raise your kids
as my own,

872
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,823
and we'll have more kids.

873
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:51,726
Belle, we can have
a little boy.

874
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,952
- We're closed.

875
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:20,054
But it ain't even 5:00 yet.

876
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:22,657
- Don't you see all
the commotion around here, boy?

877
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,058
- Please, sir.

878
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,861
My ma, my pa,
my two brothers--

879
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:30,365
they all got took
by the smallpox.

880
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:35,503
- The smell of "putrefication"
is a sure sign of the smallpox.

881
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,006
I ain't touching
them bodies, boy.

882
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,607
- You don't need to do nothing.

883
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,076
I just need a place
to put 'em for tonight.

884
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,515
- On three.
- Yes, sir.

885
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,951
Three.

886
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:54,522
- All right.

887
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,325
Don't just stand there, boy.

888
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:58,526
Go.
- Uh, yes, sir.

889
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,362
- Go.
Get the hell out of here.

890
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,031
Damn.

891
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:28,056
- Ah.

892
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:30,391
Ugh.

893
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,392
Yeah.

894
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,328
- Ah!

895
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:43,371

896
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,803

- You got to know the numbers
to open it.

949
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,310
- How many numbers?

950
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:38,513
- I don't know.

951
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,996
- It's over.

952
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,937
- Can you hear it...

953
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,639
When you get the right number?

954
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:05,907
- It's got leather.

955
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:08,109
You should be able
to hear something.

956
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,582
Can't hear a goddamn thing.

957
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:15,817
♪ advance the flag of dixie ♪

958
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:17,318
♪ hurrah! Hurrah! ♪

959
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,354

like this to be thirsty?

960
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:24,559
If you put your ear on it,
you can hear better.

961

963
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,238
- Hear anything?

964
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,640
- Too many muskets went off
by my ear.

965
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,843
You do it.

966
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,614
- You do it.

967
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,377
- You heard anything yet?

968
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:18,045
- No, it's too loud.

969
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:28,789
I hear something.
- Yeah?

970
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:31,759
No.

971
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,228
- Well, keep going.

972
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:48,843
- That's two.

973
01:15:57,086 --> 01:16:00,454
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

974
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:03,024
Fight! Fight! Fight!

975
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:08,162
Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Get 'em.

976
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,498
Fight! Fight! Fight!

977
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,800
- Draw, come on.

978
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:18,506
- That's enough!

979
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:04,218
- Come on, belle, we got
to get the gold out of here.

980
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,220
- We can't just leave him here
to die, jasper.

981
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:11,225
- He's a crawford, belle.
Let him bleed.

982
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,134
- Help me!

983
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,141
- Belle, quit this,
or we're all gonna be killed.

984
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,245
- What have we done, jasper?
- What we planned, belle.

985
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:33,514
We ain't never getting
caleb back,

986
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:36,584
but we are gonna take
our revenge.

987
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:40,421
And that is what this
is all about.

988
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:43,124
Let's go.

989
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:45,126
- Kessie, come on.

990
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,430
- We done everything we can.
Kessie.

991
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:52,266
Kessie!

992
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,243
You got it.

993
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,779
- Hold up!

994
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:42,083
- Whoa.

995
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,357
- Kind of late
for a funeral, ain't it?

996
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:53,327
- You never can be too careful
with the smallpox.

997
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:56,864
It's best to get 'em
in the ground quick.

998
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:59,533
- Haven't heard of any cases
of the pox in this town.

999
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:02,670
- Yeah, this poor bastard--
he died three counties over.

1000
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,972
No one would take him in.

1001
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,479
Be my guest, take a look.

1002
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,032
- This is the last one, boys!

1003
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,270
- Every lawman in the country

1004
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:39,974
is gonna be looking for men like
us spending double eagles...

1005
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:41,408
So we're not.

1006
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,244
- Each one of you'll get a stack
here of these greenbacks.

1007
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:45,179
This should keep you
more than comfortable

1008
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:46,614
until the heat dies down.

1009
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,616
- Meet up again in a month
outside of bismarck.

1010
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:50,518
Everyone will get their cut.

1011
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,819
All right, boys,
get out of here.

1012
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:53,888
We'll see you later.

1013
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,795
Let's ride out, toby.

1014
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,402
- Easy, easy.
Slow.

1015
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:09,470
All right.
- You got it?

1016
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:11,005
- I got it.

1017
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,178
- I don't want to leave you
behind again, belle.

1018
01:20:19,782 --> 01:20:22,550
You better go, toby.

1019
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,933
- I'll be back in a month.

1020
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:29,984
- I'm going back to jasper's
little sister's place

1021
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:33,354
and get that gold
for myself.

1022
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:38,058
I felt like telling someone
about it, but, uh...

1023
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,095
Didn't want to worry
about it later.

- What's all this?

1039
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:51,165
- Someone robbed
the bank last night.

1040
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:53,500
They shot ben crawford.

1041
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:56,503
Don't know
if he's gonna make it.

1042
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:03,143
Hattie.

1043
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,819
- You can't go
in there now, ma'am.

1044
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:14,021
- What are you talking about?
- Excuse me?

1045
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:15,656
This is my bank.

1046
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,325
- This is the scene
of a crime now.

1047
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,127
You're not allowed in.

1048
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:22,596
- The hell you say.
- Then tell me, major,

1049
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:26,633
how you and your men allowed
this to happen.

1050
01:23:26,635 --> 01:23:29,103
You were right outside
the door.

1051
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:31,705
We will not
be held responsible.

1052
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,074
- Ma'am,
with all due respect,

1053
01:23:34,076 --> 01:23:37,845
you refused to allow my men
in your bank.

1054
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:39,747
When we finish counting up
what's missing,

1055
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:42,483
you're on the line
for every cent of it.

1056
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:02,936
- When ben crawford
pulls through,

1057
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,272
he could probably tell us
a whole lot of things.

1058
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:07,274
- Sure could.

1059
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,586
- Go get the undertaker
down here for me, will you?

1060
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,789
- Mm-hmm.
