loves you.

155

No, he loves
Dave and Lloyd.

156
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,591
He understands them.

<i>He loves
all of you.</i>

158
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,930
Sometimes I just wish
I was more like them.

159
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,977
I don't belong here.

big plans
for you.</i>

great things one day.

After high school,</i>

164

<i>I wasn't sure what
I was going to do.</i>

165
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,843
<i>Home had became a place</i>

166
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,472
<i>where you had to learn
the language of silence.</i>

167
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:28,809
<i>My dad and I grew apart.</i>

168
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,816
<i>Uh, you know, he grew inward
and I grew bitter.</i>

169
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,569
<i>At' that time,
my rebellion
was in full swing.</i>

170
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,155
<i>Uh, let's just say
that surrender</i>

171
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:45,242
<i>doesn't exactly
come naturally to me.</i>

172
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,327
<i>But I quickly learned
that God</i>

173
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,663
<i>can speak to us
in some pretty
unexpected ways.</i>

to these accusations
from your father?</i>

<i>How can you stand there
in defiance of your father?</i>

177

<i>You're bestowed
with riches
beyond your worth</i>

<i>and now
you rebuke their value?</i>

179
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:14,145
<i>By what authority
do you do such things?</i>

180
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,442
<i>I want to live
a life of freedom.</i>

181

<i>I want to be as free</i>

<i>as the animals
that roam this earth,</i>

183

<i>as free as the moon
in the night sky.</i>

<i>These earthly possessions,</i>

<i>this noble stature,</i>

186
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:39,212
<i>the adoration

<i>(Rich, off)
Saint Francis was wild.
I mean,</i>

00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,722
<i>he fell
madly in love
with Jesus.</i>

191
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,725
<i>As a result of that,
he gave up everything
he had.</i>

192

<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

193

<i>God calls
to every man.</i>

194

<i>But not every man responds.</i>

195

<i>(Rich, off)
I connected to the story
of Saint Francis</i>

196
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,321
<i>in a lot of ways.</i>

197

<i>You know, he just had
this radical trust in Christ.</i>

198
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,994
<i>It was a trust
that I didn't have.</i>

199
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,330
<i>But I wanted it.</i>

200

that kind of faith,</i>

<i>You know, it's interesting.</i>

204

a point in my life</i>

Let me ask you
a question.

216
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,035
You ever stare danger
straight in the eye

217

to tell about it?

Yeah, nice
to meet you, man.

You scared me there
for a second.

224

I've got kind
of a weird sense
of humor.

You should know
that up front.

is that Jesus would

Because it's
really not that.

571
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,470
I mean, holiness
is really about

at the things I
found out.

579
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,657
And the thing
I know about it,

580
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,659
is that God loves you
no matter what
you choose.

And he's
going to be there.

588
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,347

that works
is because

589
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,475
she says, "Go get milk"
and I go get milk.

Would Christ

00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,085
how do you feel
close to God.

771
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,463
And I kind of go

772
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,090
"You know what?
I don't really know that."

773
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:02,927
When I think
about the lives
of--of the great saints

774
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:08,767
I don't necessarily think
that they always felt
close to God.

775
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:11,102
See, closest to God,
it isn't about feelings.

776
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:15,106
Closest to God
is about obedience.

777
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:18,818
But if we don't obey,
we don't even have
a chance.

It's just that I struggle
a lot with loneliness.

795
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,366
I'm going to fill you

Loneliness and all of it.

801

It's just that some
of us aren't afraid
to admit it.

I want to talk to you

You know I think
you're an amazing writer,

823
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,357

you're ready to be
a recording artist.

Then everything's

<i>and I don't mind that.</i>

933
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:49,954
I think
maybe God wanted me
to be celibate.

that was to break
my heart.

So the song
you wrote for your wedding,

936
00:54:56,585 --> 00:55:02,008
<i>Doubly Good,</i>
you gave to Amy Grant. Why?

937
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:04,552

to walk away from,

00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,848
And some things
you don't have
a choice.

940
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:12,643
The woman I love
is married to somebody else.
That's the way it goes.

941
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,480
Well, if that's the case,
then it seems to me

942
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:19,150
that song
is exceptionally cruel.

943
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,068
<i>Why is that?</i>

944
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:24,155
Well, because it implies
that if God hasn't given you

945
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,240
a love
that's tender
and someone who's true

946
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:29,827
<i>then he hasn't been
doubly good to you.</i>

947
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:32,830
Well, God
doesn't have to be

Hey, just
so you know it,
you hurt me.

1230
01:12:43,902 --> 01:12:46,029
Why don't you
just man up?

1231

<i>B Our God 'vs an awesome God DD</i>

1248
01:13:56,891 --> 01:14:00,103
You know,
I've come to think

1249
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:03,606
that to identify
fully with Christ,

1250
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,193
who I claim to be
my Saviour and my Lord,

1251
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:13,283
that to fully identify with Him
is to identify with the poor.

1252
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:16,870
Christianity is not about
finding an absolutely secure
niche in the world

1253
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,038
where you can live
with your perfect little wife

1254
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,374
and your perfect little kids
in your beautiful little house

1255
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:26,004
where there are no gays
or minority groups around.

1256
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:31,634
Christianity is
about learning
how to love like Jesus

1257
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,887
and Jesus loved the poor
and Jesus loved the broken.

<i>(Rich, off)
I knew that not everyone
appreciated what I had to say.</i>

1259
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:43,146
<i>But I didn't really care.</i>

1260
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,231
Awesome <i>God

1261

1263
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:52,405
<i>So the concert
venues got bigger,</i>

1264
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:54,741
<i>the crowds got louder,</i>

1265

mean much to me.</i>

1274

Man of the hour!

come, huh?

1276
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,637

No more little church gigs

an opening act, Rich.

1281
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,897
From now on, this town's
going to be begging
to open for you.

1282
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:10,233
Not only that.
You can finally afford
a proper tour bus.

1283
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,859
Yeah, you're
ready, Rich.

1284

Everything is changed.
Yeah.

1285
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:17,907
I'm moving to Wichita.

[loud laughter]

1287
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,078
Yeah, okay, Rich.

1288
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,997
No, I'm serious.
I'm moving to Wichita.

1289
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:30,378
But you're finally on top.

1290
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,089
If you leave now,
you risk losing everything.

1291
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:37,677
I don't know
if I'm concerned
about it either way.

1292
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,180
Look, I've seen you.
I know you like
those new toys.

1293
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:44,434
I just saw you
on that new
motorcycle, right? Huh?

1294
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,520
Rich, come on.

1295
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:49,272
You know
what the problem is?

1296
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,859
I hadn't seen myself
on that new motorcycle.

1297
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,777
Here, you guys
can have it.

1298
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,070
I don't even want it.

1299
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,073
Rich!

1300
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:09,125
You know what a person is
that doesn't want anything

1301
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,961
and doesn't fear anybody?

1302
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:15,131
What?

1303
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:16,966
Dangerous.

1304
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,644
Rich?

1305
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:28,645
Can I help you?

1306
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:31,189
Um, I'm Justin.

1307
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:34,150
Holy cow!
Good to see
you, man!

1308
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,652
It's been a while.

1309
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:37,528
You remember me?
Yeah, absolutely.

1310
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:39,405
I hope you don't mind
I got--
No, not at all.

1311
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,115
You kind of picked
the worst possible time.

1312
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,659
I'm literally
just getting
ready to leave

1313
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:44,160
but if you need
a place to crash

1314
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:45,870
you know, it's yours.

1315

Where are you going?

1316
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,666
I'm moving
to Wichita, actually.

1317
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,417
Oh.

1318
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,378
What are you doing
in Nashville anyway?

1319
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:56,547
Looking for a job.

1320
01:17:56,631 --> 01:18:00,218
I'll tell you what,
if you want a crappy job,
you can come join the band.
Really?

1321
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,095
Yeah. Sure,
why not?

1322
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,013
You're just going
to let me join
the band?
Yeah!

1323
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:05,765
Awesome.
Come in.

1324
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,350
Let's get
this crappy job started.

1325
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,768
Here, take that
to the jeep, will you?

1337
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,296
So what?
You want to be
like Saint Frank?

1338
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:41,926
It's not about being
like Saint Francis
necessarily,

1339
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,386
it's about following Jesus,

1340
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,804
it's about being
like Christ.

1341
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,390
I mean,
how do you do that?

1342
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:48,891
I'm not good
at being perfect.

1343
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,894
But it's
not about being perfect.

1344
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:53,980
Look at Saint Francis.

1345
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,815
He took vows.
He took a vow of chastity,

1346
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,109
he took a vow of poverty,

1347
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,736
a vow of obedience.

1348
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,738
I think that's what
we're really missing.

1349
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:05,825
That's what I want to do.

1350
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,493
I think
I want to start living

1351
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:09,412
on whatever
the average American salary is.

1352
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:12,248
Whatever the average
American worker makes.

making millions.

1354

Who cares?

1355
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:18,963
Money destroys
people, man.

1356
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,965
Money doesn't have
to destroy people.

1357
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,344
Well, it's destroying me.

01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,379
This is James
Bryan Smith's class, right?

1377
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,506
Yeah. What,
you weren't
here last week?

1378
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:45,341
No, no,
I was bummed.
I had to miss it.

1379
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:47,718
I was
actually in Ireland.

1380
01:20:47,802 --> 01:20:51,180
And Ireland's incredible so
I wasn't really that bummed
to be honest but--

1381
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:54,559
<i>Yeah. You're seeing
friends, family?</i>

1382
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,854
Actually I was shooting
a music video.

1383
01:20:57,937 --> 01:20:59,981
It's not as cool
as it seems.

1384
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,691
Hey, everyone.

1385
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:05,444
Glad to see
you all made
it back to class.

1386
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,113
Can I help you?

1387
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,366
This is Intro
to Religion, right?
Yes.

1388
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:12,410
What's your name?
Do you have
a student ID?

1389
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,036
Uh, my name
is Rich Mullins.

1390
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,873
I'm not sure
about the student ID.

1391
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,374
The Rich Mullins?

1392
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,959
<i>Awesome God guy.</i>

1393
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,961
I do have
other songs.

1394
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:24,463
All right, and you're
taking this class?

1395
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,215
<i>(Rich)
Yeah.</i>

1396
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:28,134
Why?

1397
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,844
I was hoping
you would tell me
that part.

1398
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:31,721
Yeah, okay, sorry.

1399
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,056
Glad to have you, Rich.

1400
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:38,269
Everyone, take out
your copies of G.K.
Chesterton's Orthodoxy.

1401
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,413
(Rich)
Good morning.

1402
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,916
Yes, it is.
Barely.

1403
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,834
[chuckling]

1404
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:03,753
I think this
is the earliest
I've seen you, man.

1405
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,338
Good job.

1406
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,007
That's funny.
Justin up?

1407
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,926
<i>Well, I haven't seen him
down by the coffee pot</i>

1408
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,137
<i>so chances are
he's not up yet.</i>

1409
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,931
Sam called.
Oh, yeah?

1410
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,974
<i>Said hi, yeah.</i>

1411
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:19,602
Does he, uh,
got the beard
going these days?

1412
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:21,270
Uh, no.
He's on a diet.

1413
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:26,859
[chuckles]

1414
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,402
So you call
your dad yet?

1415
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:37,536
Why should I, Morris?

1416
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:42,124
I don't know
the history
between you guys--

1417
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:45,127
but if you're blessed
enough to have a dad
to call,

1418
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,505
<i>you should call him.</i>

1419
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:51,634
You've been
more of a father to me
these last three months.

1420
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:53,386
Yeah, but I'm
not your dad.

1421
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,222
I am your friend.

1422
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,724
And as your friend,
I'm telling you...

1423
01:22:58,808 --> 01:22:59,809
<i>Call your dad.</i>

Shhh.
I don't want

Everyone knows.

Can I talk to you outside?

you got to understand.
People in my family

Sam, I'm sorry.

1456
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:42,054
He was like
a father to me.

[weeping]

1458

<i>(Sam)
He wasn't your dad.</i>

He was mine.

01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:38,194
You're not going
to hit me, are you?

1461
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:43,199
No.

01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:44,283
<i>Well--</i>

01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,619
probably not.

1464

But if I would,
you would deserve it.

1465
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:52,708
Yeah, I would.
I do.

1466

[sigh]

1467
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,714
Now what?

1468
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,300
I was thinking
the same thing.

1469
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:06,889
You sticking
around Wichita?

1470
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:12,645
You know
I left Nashville
to be with your dad.

1471
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,314
Okay, Richard.

1472
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:17,066
<i>So now what are
you going to do?</i>

1473
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:20,903
I don't know.

1474
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,446
[Sigh]
What would you
tell somebody

1475
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:24,073
in your exact situation?

1476
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:25,908
And I know you know
the answer to this.

1477
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,534
If I was talking
to somebody else,

1478
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:29,203
I'd give them
the Sunday School answer.

1479
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,663
And what
is wrong with that?

1480
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:33,666
My dad was a--

1481
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:36,460
My dad was
a Sunday School teacher

1482
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:38,254
for 20 years.

1483
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,756
If there's one thing
that I learned from him,

1484
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:43,008
I learned that sometimes
the Sunday School answers

1485
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:45,844
are exactly
the right ones.

1486
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:46,971
<i>So what is it?</i>

1487
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:54,311
That God loves you
even when you don't
feel it but--
Exactly.

1488
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:55,771
Exactly.

1489
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,856
But the truth is
I don't get it.

1490
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,442
Even when I'm supposed
to know it, I just don't
feel it.

1491
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:04,363
So, what do you know?
What do you feel?

1492
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:05,948
[sigh]

1493
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,201
I feel broken.

1494
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:12,496
The only thing
that makes me
feel...good

1495
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,999
is not
pretending otherwise.

1496
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:18,711
Well, I think
that's a good place to start.

1497
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:27,219
You know we're going
to be okay, right?

1498
01:28:27,303 --> 01:28:28,804
We're going to be okay.

1499
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:34,560
I hope so.

<i>(Rich, off)

There's this preacher.

You should know better
than to even ask me
to listen to a preacher.

1520
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:06,777

01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:56,034
<i>"That I waited
for you day after day?</i>

1532
01:30:56,118 --> 01:31:00,956
"That I longed to hear
the sound of your voice?"

1533
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:03,959
The real believers
will respond and say,

1534
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,295
"I believed in your love,

1535
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:10,632
"and I tried
to shape my life
as a response to it."

1536
01:31:10,716 --> 01:31:14,094
<i>But many of us
who are so faithful
in our ministry,</i>

1537
01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:17,723
<i>our practice,
church going,</i>

1538

"Well, frankly, no sir.

1540
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:25,856
"I never really believed it."

1541
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:29,234
And there's the difference
between the real believers

1542
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:32,988
<i>and the nominal Christians
that abound in our churches
across the land.</i>

1543
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:36,033
<i>No one can measure
like a believer</i>

1544
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:39,244
<i>the depth and intensity
of God's love.</i>

1545
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:41,038
<i>But' then again,
no one can measure
like a believer</i>

1546
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:43,582
the effectiveness
of our gloom,
our pessimism,

1547
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:47,252
our low self-esteem,
our self-hatred and despair

1548
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:50,339
that block God's way to us.

1549
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,216
<i>Do you see now
why it's so important</i>

1550
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:55,761
<i>to lay hold of this basic
truth of our faith?</i>

1551
01:31:55,844 --> 01:32:00,766
<i>Because you're only going
to be as big as your own
concept of God.</i>

1552
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,351
We make God in our own image

1553
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:05,354
and he winds up being
as fussy and rude

1554
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:08,023
and narrow-minded
and judgmental
andlegahsfic

1555
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:11,401
and unloving
and unforgiving as we are.

1556
01:32:11,485 --> 01:32:15,197
<i>I've been in churches
in Bangor, Maine,
Miami, Seattle,</i>

1557
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,283
<i>San Diego, and Saint Louis,
and honest to God</i>

1558
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:22,746
if so many Christians
I meet is too small for me.

1559
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:24,915
Because he is
not the God of the Word.

1560
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:28,418
He is not the God
who is revealed
in and by Jesus Christ,

1561
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:31,964

comes to your seat

[weeping]

1578
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,462
You know, Brennan,
I've been going to church

1579
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:57,382
since I was less
than a week old.

1580
01:33:57,466 --> 01:34:01,511
I can count on one hand
how many times I've heard
the simple proclamation

1581
01:34:01,595 --> 01:34:04,973
of what the Gospel
is really about.

1582
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:08,310
There are very few things
I love more than beer.

1583
01:34:08,352 --> 01:34:11,355
Hot fudge sundae
is one of them.

1584
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:14,149
<i>Beer, huh'?
Mm-hm.</i>

1585
01:34:14,191 --> 01:34:16,818
Yeah, I'm a recovering
alcoholic.

1586
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:20,405
<i>That's my six-month
sobriety chip from AA.</i>

1587
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:24,576
I've been on the wagon
and off the wagon more
times than I can remember.

1588
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:28,121
Definitely more times
than my whiskey-loving
brain can remember.

1589
01:34:30,207 --> 01:34:33,669
It's honest.
You should try it some time.
It's refreshing.

1590
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:38,090
Brennan, I don't know
if I have any friends left.

1591
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:40,509
Right now
do you think
you're free?

1592
01:34:41,927 --> 01:34:44,096
What do you mean "free"?

1593
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:46,682
A free man
wouldn't need
to ask.

1594
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:50,769
<i>Mm.</i>

1595
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,691
I'm not free.

1596
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:03,115
I feel like a failure.

1597
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:07,494
I'm on stage
all the time,

1598
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,747
expected to be
this voice of hope.

1599
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:13,458
People want me
to be perfect,
but I'm not.

1600
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,210
Brennan,

1601
01:35:16,712 --> 01:35:18,296
I'm always

1602
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:23,885
carrying around
this darkness.

1603
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:26,304
We're all fighting
the same battle.

1604
01:35:26,388 --> 01:35:28,432
You know,
I love what you said.

1605
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,892
You said that...
you said that God
loves us for who we are,

1606
01:35:30,976 --> 01:35:33,770
not for who we should be
because none of us are
who we should be.

1607
01:35:33,854 --> 01:35:36,898
Yeah, that's the heart
of the ragamuffin gospel
right there.

1608
01:35:38,692 --> 01:35:40,569
What's that?

1609
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:44,322
Ragamuffins
are the unsung assembly
of saved sinners.

1610
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:46,908
They're little
in their own sight,

1611
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,578
and aware
of their brokenness

1612
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:52,122
and powerlessness
before God.

1613
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:59,379
A ragamuffin knows
he's only a beggar
at the door of God's mercy.

1614
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:02,716
Brennan,

1615
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,099
I'm a ragamuffin.

1616
01:36:11,141 --> 01:36:13,185
Oh, I know.

1617
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,604
Me, too.

1618
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:19,483
And, uh, as one
ragamuffin to another,

1619
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:22,778
would you judge me
if I had another
hot fudge sundae?

1620
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:30,827
This next song
is my contribution

1621
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:34,956
to the...ragamuffin
collection.

Thank you.

1644
01:38:40,874 --> 01:38:45,170
You know, you guys
are all into that
born-again thing,

1645
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,422
which is fine.

1646
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,176
We do need
to be born again.

1647
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:53,845
Jesus said that
to a guy named
Nicodemus.

1648
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:58,683
But you tell me I need
to be born again

1649
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:02,771
to enter
the kingdom of God,
I can tell you

1650
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:06,316
that you need to sell
everything you have
and give it to the poor.

1651
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:08,944
'Cause Jesus said that
to one guy, too.

1652
01:39:10,654 --> 01:39:13,365
Maybe that's why God
invented highlighters.

1653
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:20,121
So we can highlight
what we like in the Bible
and just ignore the rest.

1654
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:25,460
I think that
when we do things to--

1655
01:39:26,962 --> 01:39:29,339
that corrupt our lives,

1656
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:36,096
we're really just trying
to comfort some ache
that we have.

<i>And I think that

1828
01:55:51,028 --> 01:55:52,988
I'm getting married.

1829
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:58,827
Well, that's--
that's not bad news.
That's good news, man.

1830
01:56:00,245 --> 01:56:01,455
Gosh, I'm-I'm relieved.

<i>Um--</i>

1832
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:07,711
No, that's awesome.
We could use another
girl in the tour.

1833
01:56:07,795 --> 01:56:10,130
No, Rich.

1834
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:12,716
I'm leaving the tour.

1835

Why would you--

1836
01:56:21,141 --> 01:56:22,851
Of course you are.

<i>Okay, ragamuffin.</i>

1842
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:48,043
On a scale
of one to ten,
how hung over are you?

1843
01:56:51,672 --> 01:56:53,590
Eleven.

1844
01:56:56,218 --> 01:57:00,055
What do you say
that you and I go away
on a retreat of sorts?

1845
01:57:02,016 --> 01:57:04,351
Is today too soon?

1846
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:10,274
In Jesus' language,

1847
01:57:10,357 --> 01:57:13,610
the word that he taught
the disciples to pray with
was <i>Abba.</i>

1848
01:57:13,694 --> 01:57:17,072
It means "daddy."

1849
01:57:17,156 --> 01:57:19,867
It doesn't really work
for me to think of God
as a father, Brennan.

1850
01:57:21,035 --> 01:57:23,454
Me, either.

1851
01:57:23,537 --> 01:57:27,041
But it's the essence
of the disciples'
identity.

1852
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:29,752
And praying <i>Abba,</i>
I belong to you.

1853
01:57:29,835 --> 01:57:31,837
It's like breathing.

1854
01:57:33,797 --> 01:57:37,259
I'll be
in the cabin behind us.
You'll be in this one.

1855
01:57:37,342 --> 01:57:39,720
The first night's going
to be the hardest.

1856
01:57:39,762 --> 01:57:42,473
What exactly
are you going
to have me do?

1857
01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:46,643
I want you to write
a letter from John
to you.

1858
01:57:46,727 --> 01:57:49,772
Brennan, my dad wasn't exactly
the kind of guy that showed
a lot of emotion.

1859
01:57:49,855 --> 01:57:52,900
I'm not sure
I can do that.

1860
01:57:52,983 --> 01:57:56,153
I think you told me
that you knew you
father loved you.

1861
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,322
But he never told you.

1862

I know what
that one would say.

02:04:11,486 --> 02:04:13,488
It always
cracks me up and--

1935
02:04:15,615 --> 02:04:17,200
When people try
to impress God

1936
02:04:17,284 --> 02:04:19,828
because you don't have
to impress God.

1937
02:04:21,788 --> 02:04:24,374
He's already
knocked out by you.

[playing piano]

1939
02:04:28,295 --> 02:04:30,630
And Picasso said
something once that
I really liked.

1940
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:32,674
He said,

1941
02:04:32,757 --> 02:04:36,303
he said that
good taste is
the enemy of great art.

1942
02:04:38,388 --> 02:04:41,391
And I think that's
really true because

1943
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:45,479
good taste has everything
to do with being cultured
and being refined and...

1944
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:50,066
if art has to do
with anything, it has
to do with being human.

1945
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:55,238
I remember, when I was a kid,
I was a typical depressed
adolescent.

1946
02:04:55,322 --> 02:04:58,158
People would always
come up to me and say,

1947
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,327
say, "Cheer up.
God loves you."

1948
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:05,707
And I'd say, "Big deal.
God loves everybody.

1949
02:05:08,001 --> 02:05:10,253
"It don't make me special.

1950
02:05:12,172 --> 02:05:14,925
<i>"It just proves that God
ain't got no taste."</i>

1951
02:05:17,677 --> 02:05:19,846
And I don't think
that he does.

1952
02:05:22,015 --> 02:05:23,892
And thank God.

1953
02:05:28,939 --> 02:05:32,776
So, I think that
God takes the--

1954
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:35,529
He takes the messiness
and the ugliness
in our lives,

1955
02:05:35,612 --> 02:05:41,034
and he makes
the most beautiful art
in the world out of it.

1956
02:05:41,076 --> 02:05:45,205
If you're half as cultured
and refined as most Christians
wish you were,

1957
02:05:48,250 --> 02:05:50,794
He would be useless
to Christianity.

1958
02:05:57,133 --> 02:05:59,803
But God
is a wild man.

1959
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:08,103
And I hope that someday
you have the chance
to encounter Him.

1960
02:06:13,567 --> 02:06:16,403
But if you do,

1961
02:06:16,486 --> 02:06:19,864
let me warn you,
because you'd better
hold on for dear life.

1962
02:06:24,995 --> 02:06:27,914
Or let go for dear life
maybe is better.

And the Irish
have always

2027
02:13:18,783 --> 02:13:21,536
sort of traditionally
have been afraid of going
out to sea.

2028
02:13:21,619 --> 02:13:23,746
People go to Ireland
and they come back

2029
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:26,666
and they have these really
beautiful big sweaters,
real big bulky,

2030
02:13:26,708 --> 02:13:29,085
and they've got
all kinds of stitches
and stuff in them.

2031
02:13:29,168 --> 02:13:32,088
Well, they started
doing that because each
of those different stitches

2032
02:13:32,171 --> 02:13:34,424
it's different charms
and prayers and stuff

2033
02:13:34,507 --> 02:13:37,010
that they would weave
into their husband's
sweaters.

2034
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:41,264
And, uh, so, you know,
if it worked, then their
husbands would come back alive.

2035
02:13:41,347 --> 02:13:43,933
And if it didn't,
because fish don't
eat wool,

2036
02:13:44,017 --> 02:13:47,854
they could tell
who was who by what
sweater was on them.

so highly of Christian music,

2041

I know a lot of us

But you should come
for entertainment.

2048
02:14:26,392 --> 02:14:29,812
If you really want
spiritual nourishment,
you should go to church.

We're good
because we're saved.

2054
02:14:57,381 --> 02:15:00,093
And never forget
what Jesus did for you.

2055
02:15:00,176 --> 02:15:04,222
Never take lightly
what it cost him.

2056
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:10,103
And never assume
that if it cost him
his very life,

2057
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:14,232
that it will
cost you yours.

And when you wash up
on that other shore,

even though
you've been disfigured
beyond any recognition,

2060

the angels are going

"We're not even sure
if he's human."

2063
02:15:44,637 --> 02:15:48,349
But Jesus will say,
"No, that's human.

2064
02:15:48,432 --> 02:15:50,309
"I know that one."

2065
02:15:50,393 --> 02:15:53,229
And they'll say,
"Jesus, how do you
know that one?"

2066
02:15:55,273 --> 02:15:57,650
And he will say,
"Well, you see that
