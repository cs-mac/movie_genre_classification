00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:20,674
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

2
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:30,269
Shall we begin?

3
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,155
I guess everything ends today.

4
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:06,217
We go until the first one dies.

5
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:09,961
No way. No one dies.

6
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:13,346
Today is the day that
I bring you into the station.

7
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:44,900
My friend JJ...
Is this because you want to kill him?

8
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:03,886
If I get you...
I'm sure I can get JJ too.

9
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:47,551
I'm sure that everything is okay,
right Detective Im?

10
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:51,511
We should trust Shi Yoon.

11
00:02:57,674 --> 00:02:59,254
Wait, what's this?

12
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,824
This watch...
I gave this to my daughter as a gift.

13
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:07,536
Who sent me this?

14
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:12,931
Hello?

15
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:16,198
Yes... That's my Soo Bin's watch.

16
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:18,737
What?

17
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,448
That's... my Soo Bin's hand?

18
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:25,867
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

19
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:27,417
Where's my Soo Bin?

20
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:30,747
We have Im Soo Bin.

21
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:35,418
Kid, let your father hear your voice.
Loud and clear.

22
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,569
<i>Soo Bin... Soo Bin!</i>

23
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,818
Come on! Say something!

24
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,907
You must...
So that your father doesn't worry...

25
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,618
Dad...

26
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:50,017
- Louder!
- Dad!

27
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,618
<i>Yes, Soo Bin!
Soo Bin, are you okay?</i>

28
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:56,537
You... who are you?
What are you doing with my Soo Bin?

29
00:03:57,518 --> 00:03:59,217
<i>Quiet down and listen to me.</i>

30
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:02,623
We need the original memoir that
Baek Shi Yoon has.

31
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:04,642
If you give us that memoir...

32
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:08,318
We'll let Im Soo Bin go.
That is our only request.

33
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,918
<i>Get that memoir, as soon as possible,
and wait at the Neighborhood Bar.</i>

34
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,118
<i>We'll call you back.</i>

35
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:17,210
Hello? Hello... Hey!

36
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,503
Those bastards...

37
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:23,131
Detective Im!

38
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:34,118
What?
I understand! Okay!

39
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:38,217
Tae Ho, try to calm down! Okay!

40
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:41,289
Hey, Tae Ho's daughter was kidnapped.
It's an emergency!

41
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,767
Get the details from Tae Ho.
Then check all local security cameras!

42
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,679
- Move!
- Yes, sir.

43
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:15,771
If you didn't interfere
with our business...

44
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:19,368
Nothing would have happened...

45
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:21,960
The culture district
would have stayed quiet.

46
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:27,017
And your friend wouldn't have
died in Macau, three years ago.

47
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:29,467
I should have caught you then.

48
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:32,818
Your friends, who took a trillions of won
from Korean Commerce Bank...

49
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,222
Do you know how many people worked
themselves to the bone for that money?

50
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:40,318
These same bastards...
They show up in the culture district...

51
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,191
And they dare to step over the lives
of powerless, laboring citizens?

52
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,668
<i>Shi Yoon! Shi Yoon!</i>

53
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,769
Shi Yoon! Shi Yoon!
Shi Yoon... Shi Yoon...

54
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,118
- The memoir! Where is that memoir?
- What's going on, Detective Im?

55
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,217
What's wrong?

56
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:21,957
My daughter, Soo Bin has been kidnapped.
They told me to bring the memoir!

57
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,700
Negotiation, cancelled.

58
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:25,618
And...

59
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:30,467
Since you refused my act of kindness,
things will get harder for you...

60
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,902
As well as for the people around you.

61
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:35,467
Who will be targeted first?

62
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:37,749
Out of the people around you?

63
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,618
- Yoon Sang Min! You son of a...
- No!

64
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:46,222
This isn't the time, okay?
Please...

65
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,524
You and your friends...

66
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:56,287
You're all going down together.

67
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,182
I can't wait.

68
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,593
Hello.

69
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,918
Did you have to come
when there were kids here?

70
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,356
A classified document
that could pose a real security threat.

71
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:47,207
- We had no choice, Mother.
- Don't call me Mother.

72
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,695
My son never had a friend like you.

73
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,425
Hey... Shi Yoon.
What is there to think about?

74
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:03,518
We give them the memoir,
get Soo Bin back, and then catch them!

75
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,718
We need to be cautious, Detective Im.

76
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,367
Even if they get their ransom, kidnappers
don't return subjects, just like that.

77
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,668
But saving the person should be
the first priority, should it not?

78
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,069
For Soo Bin's sake, let's make a plan,
rather than just succumbing to them.

79
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,518
Stop bullshitting me.
What plan do we need for this?

80
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,072
We need to get Soo Bin back,
first and foremost!

81
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:25,117
Shi Yoon... I'm begging you...

82
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,768
I know... that this item
is very important to you...

83
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:31,991
But the priority is saving
my daughter... please?

84
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,574
I'm begging you... Please!

85
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,020
I'll bring the memoir.

86
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:44,318
Please wait.

87
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:45,947
What's going on?

88
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,918
What's going on?
Honey, what happened to Soo Bin?

89
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,117
The kidnappers must've gotten
in touch with Sun Young too.

90
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,117
Why did this happen to Soo Bin?
Because of something he has?

91
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,276
Who does he think he is?

92
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:02,918
Why did you get involved
with that man? Why?

93
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,198
Try to calm down.

94
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:18,963
Chief, it's not here.

95
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,395
It's not here.

96
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:26,795
Shi Yoon!

97
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,217
Did you have to go this far?

98
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:33,318
When I looked at the footage
on the security cameras

99
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:37,018
the box holding the memoir
was delivered here, from your bar.

100
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,068
This is a justifiable,
legal action on our part.

101
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:44,617
If you gave it to me from the start,
this wouldn't have happened!

102
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:49,048
The memoir...
Will be given to Yoon Sang Min.

103
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,789
What are you talking about?

104
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,568
Don't you know that it's safer
to give it to the agency?

105
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,010
A child was kidnapped
because of that memoir!

106
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,049
Kidnapped?

107
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,717
Thank you.
I'll tell you if I need any more help.

108
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:11,367
Of course!
I would do anything for you.

109
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:15,036
You're running a free pre-school for us!
You're our neighborhood hero.

110
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,723
- I'm sorry, Mom, but I have to go.
- Okay.

111
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,890
The memoir... is at the Neighborhood Bar.

112
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,545
Bring Soo Bin here, now.

113
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,192
<i>The plan has changed.</i>

114
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:51,418
<i>We will accept the memoir
at Central Park, in one hour.</i>

115
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,818
<i>Baek Shi Yoon and the police
may not be in the area.</i>

116
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:55,819
What about Soo Bin?

117
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,048
<i>Once we get the memoir, we'll let her go.</i>

118
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,818
Where will you release her?

119
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:05,898
Then bring Soo Bin...
to Central Park, okay?

120
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,717
Please let me hear Soo Bin's voice.
Soo Bin, Soo Bin!

121
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,438
<i>We'll see you in one hour.</i>

122
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:16,935
<i>We'll say this again. Baek Shi Yoon
and the police, better not be with you.</i>

123
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,567
It's a tracking chip.

124
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,542
Then... I'll go with Detective Im.

125
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:41,117
If Shi Yoon or the police can't be there,
I should go instead.

126
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,602
Me too.

127
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,979
Us too.

128
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,745
Please help us get Soo Bin back.

129
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:52,107
After that, the police and I
will find whoever took her.

130
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:15,617
Don't make any mistakes.

131
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,668
You'll get the rest
when you bring me the memoir.

132
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,681
I will take care of it flawlessly.

133
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,056
Can you hear me?

134
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:55,774
Yes.

135
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,799
Yes, I can hear you.

136
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,482
In a space this big, they'll have to
be in a car when they pick it up.

137
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,737
Okay, don't worry.

138
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:17,101
I'll keep a lookout.

139
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,141
The police detective has arrived,
with one man and one woman.

140
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:52,562
Yes, Shi Yoon?
One second.

141
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,418
Have they contacted you yet?

142
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,732
No, not yet.

143
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,367
What if they take the memoir
and don't release Soo Bin?

144
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:04,475
They just want the memoir,.
They won't do anything crazy.

145
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,011
Put on your headsets.

146
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,818
<i>When I said that
the police are not to come</i>

147
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:19,746
that included you, Detective Im.

148
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:21,218
What?

149
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:23,467
<i>Send the girl.</i>

150
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:26,395
<i>She can wait in front
of the whale statue.</i>

151
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,217
I'll go.

152
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:38,277
- I'm coming with you.
- Wait a second.

153
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:42,918
I think they're watching us.

154
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,309
I think Writer Bae
should go alone for now.

155
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,068
- But still...
- Let her go alone, for now.

156
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:51,550
Writer Bae, be careful.

157
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,918
But still...
How can we...

158
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,169
Let's go.

159
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,467
<i>Chan Gyu, can you go by yourself?</i>

160
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:30,328
What? Right now?

161
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,438
I'll try.

162
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,813
Sorry about that!

163
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,765
Shi Yoon, I'm going in now. Okay.

164
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,369
I'm sorry.

165
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,018
<i>One of us will keep watching you.</i>

166
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,854
So don't worry, Writer Bae.

167
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,636
Ri Soo, please make your way to area B.

168
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:50,151
Okay.

169
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:16,665
They're starting to communicate,
so keep your guard up.

170
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:22,367
<i>Get on the boat,
with the ticket inside your pocket.</i>

171
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:23,769
Yes.

172
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,928
I've got my eyes on Writer Bae right now.

173
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:51,417
Bae Jung Yeon. You can do this.

174
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:54,994
We'll win, no matter what.

175
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:32,876
Soo Bin, I'm coming for you.

176
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,903
They're out of my view now.

177
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,242
Okay, I'm watching.

178
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:48,433
I got a report about a strange item.

179
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:52,008
- Can I take a look at your bag?
- It's nothing.

180
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:57,376
I'll let Soo Bin go...
after I check your bag.

181
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:05,667
It has begun.

182
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:08,253
Wait until we see Soo Bin.

183
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,011
Okay.

184
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,441
That man...

185
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,873
- I think I found him.
- Okay!

186
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,676
What are you doing? Hurry up!

187
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,249
Where's Soo Bin?

188
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:47,106
Do you want to die too?

189
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,117
I want to see Soo Bin, first.

190
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,380
Wow... Seriously...

191
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,568
- Let go.
- I can't just let you have it.

192
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:57,117
- Where's Soo Bin?
- Oh, my... Seriously?

193
00:22:57,118 --> 00:22:58,581
Where is Soo Bin?

194
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:01,579
<i>Where's Soo Bin? Where is she?</i>

195
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,030
Soo Bin?

196
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:30,238
Okay, Soo Bin. It's okay now.

197
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,026
Wait a little longer,
I'll open it for you.

198
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:36,617
I found Soo Bin.

199
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,367
Writer Bae, we found Soo Bin.
It's okay, just let it go.

200
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,239
<i>We can catch him later.</i>

201
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:53,075
- Give it to me!
- What are you doing?

202
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:19,818
<i>We've secured the memoir.</i>

203
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:21,446
Okay...

204
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:37,601
Who are you?

205
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,511
You bastard! This little...

206
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,228
Okay, okay.

207
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,229
You son of a bitch.

208
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,350
- Are you okay?
- Soo Bin!

209
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,037
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

210
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:18,713
Are you really okay?

211
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,867
I'm sorry...

212
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,834
Your dad is so sorry....

213
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:27,663
It's all your dad's fault.

214
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:31,794
It's all your dad's fault...

215
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:24,518
It's a little late...
But I have something to tell you.

216
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,829
<i>I insisted on doing everything alone,
and solving everything on my own...</i>

217
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,218
<i>But I think I was wrong.</i>

218
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:35,703
The truth is, these are things
we were meant to do together.

219
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,182
I wouldn't have been able
to do any of these things by myself.

220
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,498
Thank you, all of you...

221
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,786
for being by my side.

222
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,417
We're all friends.

223
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:51,101
With a little difference in age.

224
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:56,318
Thank you, Chan Gyu,
for catching the bad guys.

225
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,577
Isn't that what the shadow does?

226
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:51,820
Wait... Isn't he from
the intelligence agency?

227
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,823
Um, yeah...

228
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,683
I think you're right.

229
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,354
What's the meaning of this?

230
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:03,619
Are you on your way
to get the memoir?

231
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:07,804
Don't you know what will happen
if you act so carelessly?

232
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:12,174
You want to be arrested for kidnapping,
as soon as you pick up the memoir?

233
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:17,812
There are Gangjoong police officers,
right behind us.

234
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,645
Tell me where it is.

235
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:24,703
It'll be safer... for my team to go.

236
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,654
I'll give it to you the next time
we meet with our friends.

237
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:30,995
Since when are you
concerned about my well-being?

238
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:34,868
I got word that one of your men
was arrested for kidnapping.

239
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:38,804
I can't stand to watch you
fall into a bottomless pit.

240
00:28:38,805 --> 00:28:41,281
So I thought I'd help you out.

241
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:53,565
<i>Yes, after he met with the man
from the agency, he turned around.</i>

242
00:28:55,504 --> 00:28:59,154
The location could have been changed.
Please keep following him.

243
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,907
I'll keep following the kidnapper.

244
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:07,273
Did they see us?

245
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:10,155
Yoon Sang Min
is going back to his office.

246
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:13,404
Jung Soo Hyuk must
have put this together.

247
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:15,681
At the very least,
we have to catch the kidnapper.

248
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:04,453
The patient keeps
leaving the hospital.

249
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:07,354
He needs to retain his stability.
But if he keeps straining his body...

250
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:11,193
His muscles and nerves
could become paralyzed, as a result.

251
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,562
If you were in the hospital...

252
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:29,501
You should have told your mother
that you were...

253
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:36,841
Who did this to my son...

254
00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:42,548
Who is doing this to you?

255
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:47,003
Who...

256
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:50,415
is putting my kind son
through all of this?

257
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,469
Shi Yoon...

258
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,915
Yoon Sang Min asked you
to do this, didn't he?

259
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:15,318
Then... did you need
the memoir, personally?

260
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,054
What were you going to do with it?

261
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:20,335
And, how did you know it existed?

262
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,104
I would like to exercise
my right to remain silent.

263
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:25,686
The right to remain silent...

264
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:28,811
The right to remain silent?

265
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:33,045
After you kidnapped my daughter...

266
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:36,547
After you put her through that...
What? The right to remain silent?

267
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:41,116
Hey, hey, hey, calm down, Tae Ho.
Hey, sit down, sit down.

268
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:49,003
Okay. You should say hello,
since you know each other.

269
00:32:49,004 --> 00:32:54,054
Last time, you were here together,
claiming that Shi Yoon beat you up.

270
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:58,543
Since you're two guys in the same boat,
let's get everything off of your chests.

271
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:04,104
You have no relation to Baek Shi Yoon,
so why did you try to kill him?

272
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:06,887
I resented him for hitting me,
so I went to get my revenge!

273
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:08,804
So, what you mean is,
you had to go kill him?

274
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:12,651
It's for the money. The money!
What other reason could there be?

275
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:16,635
And, the only person who can give you
that much money, is Yoon Sang Min!

276
00:33:16,636 --> 00:33:19,185
Admit that Yoon Sang Min
is behind all of this!

277
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:20,966
I'll exercise my right to remain silent!

278
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:21,967
Geez...

279
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:30,093
How could these former
subcontracting labor union workers...

280
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:35,223
Fall into committing crimes
of this nature, one by one?

281
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,550
Huh?

282
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:43,508
"Yoon Sang Min gave me the orders."
That's all they need to say.

283
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:45,375
Is it that difficult?

284
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,285
I'm sure that he promised to give them
a staggering amount of money!

285
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:50,582
It's obvious who gave the orders...

286
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,996
But the fact that no one
is willing to bring him down...

287
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:57,448
You've worked with them before.

288
00:33:57,449 --> 00:34:00,352
Can't you try to convince them?

289
00:34:00,353 --> 00:34:01,528
No way, no way.

290
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:04,782
They don't treat us well.
They wouldn't listen to us either.

291
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:09,957
If anyone could do it, it's Bong Chul.

292
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,236
Bong Chul?

293
00:34:11,237 --> 00:34:13,578
Yeah, our president.

294
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:27,636
We've arrived.

295
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,421
Oh, yes...

296
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:31,792
- How much is it?
- It's 16,000 won.

297
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,886
- Here.
- Thank you, and your change...

298
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:38,103
- Oh, I don't need the change.
- Oh, thank you! Thank you.

299
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:45,035
Oh, yeah... I made an extra 4,000 won.

300
00:34:45,036 --> 00:34:49,636
Let's see here...
Who will be my next caller...

301
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,786
Huh? Why is he calling me?

302
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:58,636
Yes... It's me.

303
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:00,032
Huh?

304
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,035
- Hey! You guys!
- Oh, sir!

305
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:17,785
- How have you been?
- You're here.

306
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:19,525
Wow... It's nice to see you.

307
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:27,156
So...

308
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:30,836
I heard that you have
a strong sense of responsibility.

309
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,156
That you're very good to your family...

310
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:35,994
And that outside of your home,
you take care of your younger friends.

311
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,988
That's because I'm generous.

312
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:43,630
But while you were away,
look what happened to your juniors!

313
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:46,236
What did they do wrong?

314
00:35:46,237 --> 00:35:48,412
Attempted murder and kidnapping.

315
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:50,836
A murder and kidnapping...
Oh, geez...

316
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:53,843
They're being sold off
to Yoon Sang Min, one by one!

317
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:56,118
Your juniors!

318
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,781
We're sold off for money...
And then thrown away.

319
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,937
And then we're sold off again...
And thrown away.

320
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:06,960
Geez... It's not like we're slaves
from the ancient times...

321
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,206
Thank you.

322
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:18,770
Aren't you guys eating?

323
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:20,636
- I already ate.
- I ate before coming here.

324
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,136
You must have gathered up
a lot of courage to come here.

325
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:25,249
Ma'am.

326
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,736
From now on,
I'll only come when I'm hungry.

327
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:32,823
I'll pay for my food, and will honorably
order one dish for any person I'm with.

328
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,935
I won't do anything bad...

329
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:38,179
When I'm here,
I will only eat. I promise.

330
00:36:39,137 --> 00:36:42,715
I'll take that as an apology
for things you've done in the past, okay?

331
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:48,836
Oh! And please give me some of that
spicy pork! That delicious spicy pork...

332
00:36:48,837 --> 00:36:50,642
Okay.

333
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:55,293
When you're not causing problems,
you're quite the cool guy.

334
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:59,114
I guess I'm pretty cool.

335
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:10,063
For Min Sik...

336
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:14,725
His mother is only 65...

337
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:16,817
But she already has dementia.

338
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,654
And Jang Jin...

339
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:26,336
With his newborn baby,
and that baby's mother...

340
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:31,001
He lives in a dark half-basement.

341
00:37:32,036 --> 00:37:37,016
So I know... why they turned into this.

342
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,507
Wow, this kimchi stew...

343
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:45,732
This is really good.

344
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,285
- Chan Gyu.
- Yes?

345
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:56,086
- Our president's mother.
- Shi Yoon's mother?

346
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,529
Yes, this is her specialty.

347
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:15,435
Yes, it's this man. Please go ahead.

348
00:38:15,436 --> 00:38:17,074
Hello.

349
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:21,915
How old is your baby?

350
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,986
I'm sure... that this is what
Yoon Sang Min told you.

351
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:31,836
He told you, don't rat him out,
even if you get caught.

352
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:36,535
And that if you don't, he'll give
your family a huge reward. Right?

353
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:40,827
But... do you really think that
Yoon Sang Min will keep his promise?

354
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:44,285
This is a guy who uses people, and then
throws them away when he's done.

355
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:47,306
Hey, you're a witness to that right now!

356
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:54,935
So your baby has asthma now,
because you live in a half-basement.

357
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:56,482
Has she been discharged
from the hospital?

358
00:38:56,483 --> 00:38:57,621
Yes.

359
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,647
Tell her to bring the baby.

360
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:02,736
What?

361
00:39:02,737 --> 00:39:06,906
Bring the baby to my pre-school.
We have a spare bedroom upstairs.

362
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:09,489
The room gets a lot of sunlight. Okay?

363
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:14,187
But still... The most important thing is
that you leave here as soon as possible.

364
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,537
If I leave this place,
what's going to change?

365
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,039
Don't speak to me informally...

366
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,482
My mother is 65 years old right now.

367
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:24,789
So if I need one million won every month,
for the next 20 to 30 years...

368
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,584
Do you know how much that is?

369
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:30,640
If a long-term nursing home charges
one million won every month...

370
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,486
That means you're a level four.

371
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,564
Your Long-Term Care Insurance level.

372
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:37,986
You're not getting government
assistance because of your level.

373
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:39,976
Hey, do you know that woman?

374
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:45,189
And, tell your wife
to come with your baby.

375
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,836
It's called "The Shared Study Room"
and everybody knows about it.

376
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:50,717
So it's a safe place.

377
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:57,082
About what you just said to me...
Do you really mean it?

378
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,067
Of course!

379
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:03,687
And... Does your mother
take any medicine?

380
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:05,187
Who do you think you are?

381
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:09,339
Well, senior care hospitals are better
than nursing homes, if she's sick.

382
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,787
After she gets treated, she can save
90 percent on her medical fees!

383
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:15,785
Wow! Did you say 90 percent?

384
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:17,526
Hey, it's 90 percent!

385
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:21,057
Medical benefits! You don't know
about these, do you? Look it up.

386
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:22,522
And you two...

387
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:26,258
Let's testify, and leave this place soon.
Even if it means you'll get less money!

388
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:30,345
If we put our heads together and work
them out, we can solve our money issues!

389
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:34,666
But, the little time we have left...
There's nothing we can do about that.

390
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:40,183
- Um, Ma'am.
- Yes?

391
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:44,070
I'll testify.

392
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:50,034
He says he'll testify.

393
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:05,353
Finally, after all of this time...
It looks like we'll catch Yoon Sang Min.

394
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:10,402
Jung Yeon.

395
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:12,645
Yes?

396
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:15,220
I've been thinking...

397
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:19,465
I don't think there is any one person
who doesn't have some shadow in them.

398
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:22,636
You're right.

399
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:27,266
People just forget about
the shadow inside of them...

400
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:43,747
Why does it hurt so bad?

401
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,512
Maybe I ran too much today...

402
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:49,306
Hey, hold my hand for a second.

403
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:54,537
Hurry! I'm telling the truth!
Hold my hand.

404
00:41:54,538 --> 00:41:58,687
- Hey, get up.
- I'm telling the truth... Hurry.

405
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:00,687
Before it's too late.

406
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:01,936
Just once.

407
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:06,721
Hold tight.

408
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:21,255
It doesn't hurt anymore...
all of a sudden.

409
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,677
Hey.

410
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,523
Don't do that.

411
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:40,523
Hey, you didn't wash your feet...

412
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:43,988
- I'm home.
- Dad!

413
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:45,291
Hello!

414
00:42:47,704 --> 00:42:52,141
We're doing that again? We did that
when Soo Bin was in elementary school.

415
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:04,879
Honey...

416
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,061
Yes?

417
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:09,364
Am I a good father to our family?

418
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:14,102
I put Soo Bin in danger...

419
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:17,771
And I make you worry about money...

420
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:21,806
Am I... doing a good job?

421
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:26,918
There's no such thing as good or bad.
You're doing your best for your family.

422
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:31,006
If I just continue to live like this...

423
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:33,491
Things will get better, right?

424
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:38,295
I'm sure they will get better...
We have to believe in that.

425
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:44,099
In my life...

426
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,997
I've made many wrong choices.

427
00:43:47,998 --> 00:43:52,184
But I did... one thing right.

428
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:53,826
What?

429
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,675
Having this family.

430
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:03,159
Us. The five of us.

431
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,515
I heard that you got the memoir!

432
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:44,719
Wow... Is this how Representative Yoon
lives his life? Huh?

433
00:44:45,998 --> 00:44:47,250
Let's see it.

434
00:44:54,172 --> 00:44:57,074
I have one thing I want to say.

435
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,393
Chief Jung Soo Hyuk.

436
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:05,788
Don't trust him, from here on out.

437
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:24,448
Explain this, Chief Jung.

438
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:28,046
The kid that Representative Yoon hired,
had a tracking chip on him...

439
00:45:28,047 --> 00:45:31,345
So we could have had
the memoir taken from us...

440
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:35,197
And Baek Shi Yoon and the police
could have come here.

441
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,309
I read some of it already.

442
00:45:39,648 --> 00:45:41,870
It includes me...

443
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:46,348
And it includes... your fathers...

444
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:49,649
There are quite a few dangerous
things written here about us.

445
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,481
But... As long as
we have the original copy...

446
00:45:53,482 --> 00:45:56,587
Everything that this memoir contains...

447
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,948
becomes a fictional story
that someone made up.

448
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:04,647
Then... does that mean you can secure
your post for prime minister?

449
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:07,381
Yes, that seems likely.

450
00:46:07,382 --> 00:46:09,217
Okay, then...

451
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:12,381
What about our Representative Yoon?

452
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:14,642
You made three promises to us.

453
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:18,473
But you're a cruel human being,
who killed his own best friend.

454
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:21,848
So the fact that this person
left Baek Shi Yoon alive...

455
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:24,206
No one understands that anymore.

456
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:30,221
How much time will you give me?

457
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:34,795
Did we ever... tell you to kill anyone?

458
00:46:35,449 --> 00:46:37,997
You are the one who came out
and said that you would do it.

459
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:40,326
And you couldn't follow
through with your promise.

460
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:56,198
We are handing over all rights to the
Hallyu Core Mall to The Channington Fund.

461
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,662
You worked very hard until now.

462
00:46:58,663 --> 00:47:03,509
For us... and for our fathers.

463
00:47:22,648 --> 00:47:24,434
Hallyu Core Mall...

464
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:29,247
I'm sure that I've told you already.
I put my life on the line for this.

465
00:47:29,248 --> 00:47:31,697
I guess you didn't take it seriously.

466
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:40,132
Chief Jung. Enough.

467
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:55,783
The man you hired to kill
Baek Shi Yoon in the hospital

468
00:47:55,784 --> 00:47:59,337
and the man who kidnapped the detective's
daughter, were both arrested.

469
00:47:59,806 --> 00:48:03,581
Now... It's all over for you.

470
00:48:05,025 --> 00:48:09,505
Before they restrict your passport,
it will be best if you leave the country.

471
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:19,647
20 years ago...

472
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:24,568
Since I first met you,
and entertained you, and protected you...

473
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,940
I've always thought the same thing.

474
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,997
You guys can't win over me.

475
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:34,804
There's only one thing you can win with.

476
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:38,750
Fathers.

477
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,848
But as time passed, that's all it was.

478
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:44,116
Powerful fathers...

479
00:48:49,049 --> 00:48:51,612
I didn't lose to you.

480
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,712
Except for that one thing.

481
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:31,242
I'm sorry, JJ.

482
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:37,284
The tallest and brightest building...

483
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:49,018
I don't think I can build it yet.

484
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,052
I'm sorry.

485
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,309
But...

486
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:09,355
I can't end it like this.

487
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,637
Right, JJ?

488
00:50:14,148 --> 00:50:16,764
I can't end it like this.

489
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,255
Yoon Sang Min!

490
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,499
I was waiting for you.

491
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,121
Joon Hee.

492
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:04,548
The two men confessed.

493
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:08,906
You're under arrest for
attempted murder and kidnapping.

494
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:12,956
You have the right to remain silent,
and the right to speak with an attorney.

495
00:51:14,248 --> 00:51:19,375
And, there are economic crimes and
other murders in which I was involved.

496
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:26,048
If there were accomplices,
to whom are you referring?

497
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,109
You know who they are...

498
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,991
The strong men behind me.

499
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:47,147
First, take these handcuffs off of me.

500
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:51,147
I'd like to be interrogated
somewhere else, in a private room.

501
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:52,598
Then I will cooperate.

502
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,394
This isn't a hotel!

503
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:57,882
And you're a suspect
for murder and kidnapping!

504
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:06,649
Pass on this message to the president.

505
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,151
He won't be able to refuse.

506
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:11,751
Since we fought a lot, back in the day.

507
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,116
I'll go meet him right now.

508
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:21,627
I don't think
he's planning on leaving the country.

509
00:52:21,628 --> 00:52:26,429
I think he's about to...
start a counterattack.

510
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:31,747
There will be many people here to see me.

511
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,081
But...

512
00:52:34,248 --> 00:52:37,458
There is someone I want to meet first.

513
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,873
Baek Shi Yoon.

514
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:46,248
Bring me Baek Shi Yoon.

515
00:52:53,648 --> 00:52:57,997
Hey, Shi Yoon...
Will you really be okay, like this?

516
00:52:57,998 --> 00:52:59,636
I'm all better now.

517
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:02,171
Now we have to begin...

518
00:53:02,172 --> 00:53:03,808
The last fight.

519
00:53:29,317 --> 00:53:32,708
You... Who told you to come in here?

520
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:37,099
Yes?

521
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,911
I'm here,
at the Gangjoong Police Station.

522
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:44,310
Why don't we have a talk,
Representative Yoon?

523
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:48,448
<i>Chief Jung... I don't have
any intentions to talk, just yet.</i>

524
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:51,067
But do you know what I figured out?

525
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:56,997
I realized that while I'm in here,
I'm the stronger one.

526
00:53:56,998 --> 00:54:00,219
<i>If I start to talk...</i>

527
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:04,369
You'll be dragged in here,
one by one...

528
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,948
<i>Chief Jung.</i>

529
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:11,247
I'm understanding
the situation correctly, aren't I?

530
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,681
Huh?

531
00:54:57,449 --> 00:54:59,312
You were right.

532
00:54:59,313 --> 00:55:03,147
I ended up at the police station,
after living the way I did.

533
00:55:03,148 --> 00:55:04,348
Voluntarily.

534
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:08,997
Since you called me here, I assume you're
willing to answer any of my questions.

535
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:11,519
If you help me.

536
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,598
Why do I have to help you?

537
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,652
Isn't the shadow...
someone who protects others?

538
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:21,698
You... want to be protected?

539
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:22,970
You're strong.

540
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:26,852
And you're not afraid of my connections.

541
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:30,048
And you fight for the weak citizens
of the culture district.

542
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:31,997
Do you want to be protected...

543
00:55:31,998 --> 00:55:34,830
Or do you want to take revenge
on the ones who abandoned you?

544
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,798
I'm fighting to stay alive.

545
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:40,240
That's my natural instinct.

546
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:42,793
From the dark alleys
of New York, to here...

547
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:45,577
That's how I made it here.

548
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:47,798
If you want my help...

549
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:51,052
You have to tell me everything you know.

550
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:57,048
Everything you say will be recorded.

551
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:59,820
And it will be used as evidence in court.

552
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,110
But that's okay, isn't it?

553
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:11,281
But I still can't tell you
everything so easily.

554
00:56:11,282 --> 00:56:14,388
I'll decide after seeing how you respond.

555
00:56:14,389 --> 00:56:17,147
I'll have to see how much
you can help me...

556
00:56:17,148 --> 00:56:20,567
And how you'll help me survive.

557
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:31,114
How about it?

558
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:39,470
Is he expecting to get out of this?
After he committed these crimes...

559
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:43,460
There's no way that will happen...
Not while I'm here.

560
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,521
Oh... While we're here.

561
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:04,247
Let's talk about three years ago.

562
00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:07,531
JJ killed my junior colleague,
Jang Jin Woo.

563
00:57:07,532 --> 00:57:11,239
- Did you give the orders?
- Yes I did.

564
00:57:11,998 --> 00:57:13,315
Why?

565
00:57:14,248 --> 00:57:16,558
Do want to come and choke me?

566
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:20,075
Should we stop?

567
00:57:20,076 --> 00:57:22,861
I'm sure there's someone...

568
00:57:22,862 --> 00:57:25,828
Who gives you orders from above.

569
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:30,734
The strong Koreans,
hiding behind Bay Star Hong Kong.

570
00:57:30,735 --> 00:57:33,032
The New York Study Group.

571
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:42,348
Okay, let's get things sorted,
one by one.

572
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:43,848
Where is JJ?

573
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:45,997
Shouldn't you catch
the guys above me first?

574
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,848
Answer me...

575
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:49,548
Where is JJ?

576
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,334
There's something you should know,
Baek Shi Yoon.

577
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,307
The New York Study Group...

578
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:57,948
They are dirtier, and much crueler,
than you can imagine.

579
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:59,615
I asked you where JJ is!

580
00:57:59,616 --> 00:58:01,948
Do you want to know their phone numbers?

581
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:05,838
Or which method the New York Study Group
members use to contact each other.

582
00:58:06,998 --> 00:58:08,505
The password.

583
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:14,205
Since the murderer hasn't been caught...

584
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:18,247
If the instigator denies it,
there's nothing we can do.

585
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:23,098
He wants to provoke New York Study Group,
and he wants to bring those guys in here.

586
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,139
He wants to find a way
to stay alive after that.

587
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:30,291
<i>I'd like a cup of coffee.</i>

588
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:38,375
We need to check
if he's telling the truth.

589
00:58:47,898 --> 00:58:48,948
Hello.

590
00:58:48,949 --> 00:58:51,147
We thought the dog would
run away when we let it go...

591
00:58:51,148 --> 00:58:53,048
But he came back to bite his owner.

592
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:56,747
If Yoon Sang Min says something
to the police, it won't be just us.

593
00:58:56,748 --> 00:58:59,698
But it will affect our fathers, you know?

594
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:03,348
Do you... have a safety net prepared?

595
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:06,829
- Was I supposed to have one prepared?
- What?

596
00:59:07,574 --> 00:59:09,357
Oh, oh...

597
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,872
You said that you wanted
to talk about that...

598
00:59:12,873 --> 00:59:14,729
- I did?
- Yes.

599
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:19,808
You sent us a message...
That today's meeting was about that.

600
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:47,601
It's nice to see you, gentlemen.

601
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:06,799
<i>[Neighborhood Hero]</i>

602
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:09,448
<i>Protect me, from now on.</i>

603
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:11,647
<i>I'm not protecting a criminal like you.</i>

604
01:00:11,648 --> 01:00:14,455
<i>Help us establish a closer bond,
using a guaranteed method.</i>

605
01:00:14,456 --> 01:00:19,098
<i>- I'll make sure that I save your life.
- Under what condition?</i>

606
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:20,548
<i>You must testify in court.</i>

607
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:24,198
<i>Remember the order,
I told Jung Soo Hyuk to call.</i>

608
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:28,448
<i>Overthrowing a giant could be a very
difficult fight, so please be prepared.</i>

609
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:32,929
<i>If something happens to me, Chan Gyu,
can you take my place as the shadow?</i>
