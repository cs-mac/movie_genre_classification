1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,457
I said "You are gods,
sons of the Most High

2
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,624
"But you shall die like men
and fall like princes."

3
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:40,790
OF GODS AND MEN

4
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,540
Lord, open my lips

5
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:57,999
And my mouth will proclaim your praise

6
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,707
Aspirin...

7
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,290
And cough syrup.

8
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,790
There's hot tea.

9
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,790
Help me, Papa.

10
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,290
- Brother Luc.
- Nouredine, labesse?

11
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,832
And you?

12
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,165
Saturday is Jamel's khtana.

13
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,499
Will there be a party?

14
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,332
You're all invited.

15
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,124
- Will you come?
- I'd love to.

16
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,957
See you later. Take care.

17
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,624
Yes, you too.

18
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,624
Little brat! You're here?

19
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,582
Not at school today?

20
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,415
Good.

21
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,207
It's almost dry.

22
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,124
Stop with the bandages.

23
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,915
Be sure to keep her out of the sun.

24
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,749
That would be dangerous. Forbidden.

25
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,874
Otherwise, all's well.

26
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,832
Little kiss.

27
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,957
What else?

28
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,040
I see.

29
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,499
It's serious.

30
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,874
Be right back.

31
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,457
Asleep, brother?

32
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,624
Here.

33
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,582
Guide us in the straight path,

34
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,665
the path of those
whom Thou hast blessed,

35
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,165
not those against
whom Thou art wrathful,

36
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,540
nor those who are astray.

37
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,207
Amen.

38
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:17,165
The Messenger believes
in what was sent down to him

39
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,665
from his Lord, and the believers:

40
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:29,040
each one believes in God, His angels,
His Books and His Messengers.

41
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,624
We make no division
between any one of His Messengers.

42
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,957
They say: "We hear and obey.

43
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,790
"Lord, grant us Thy forgiveness.

44
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,832
"Unto Thee is the homecoming."

45
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,749
God charges
no soul save to its capacity.

46
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,374
It will be rewarded for good it has done

47
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,040
and punished for evil it has done.

48
00:12:54,208 --> 00:13:01,790
Lord, take us not to task
if we forget or make mistake.

49
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:06,207
Lord, charge us not with a load

50
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:10,332
such as Thou didst lay
upon those before us.

51
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:16,665
Lord, do not burden us beyond what
we have the strength to bear.

52
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,415
And pardon us, and forgive us

53
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,790
and have mercy on us.

54
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,540
Thou art our Protector.

55
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,665
And help us against the people
of the unbelievers.

56
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,957
How do you know
when you're in love?

57
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,249
There's...

58
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,915
something inside you that comes alive.

59
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,249
The presence of someone.

60
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,540
It's irrepressible and makes your heart
beat faster, usually.

61
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,207
It's an attraction, a desire...

62
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,082
It's very beautiful.

63
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,290
No use asking too many questions.

64
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,082
It just happens.

65
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,665
Things are as usual, then suddenly...

66
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,957
happiness arrives, or the hope of it.
It's lots of things.

67
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,874
But you're in turmoil.

68
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,415
Great turmoil.

69
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,707
Especially the first time.

70
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,374
Your father spoke to me about Khaled.

71
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,332
My father speaks too much.

72
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,832
I don't want that.

73
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,832
I feel none of the things you mentioned
when I see Khaled.

74
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,415
That means it's not very serious.

75
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,624
My father wants it, not me.

76
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,040
That's another problem.

77
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,290
Ever been in love?

78
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,874
Several times, yes.

79
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:29,332
And then I encountered another love,
even greater.

80
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,832
And I answered that love.

81
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,665
It's been a while now.

82
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,165
Over 60 years.

83
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,499
Here,
you have to put your son's address.

84
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,832
He's no longer at home?

85
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,207
He lives far away now.

86
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,165
Abdallah...

87
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,582
Taroudi.

88
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,749
13 rue...

89
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,499
d'Etretat.

90
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,707
Le Havre.

91
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,499
And here they ask for two photos.

92
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,165
Do you have photos?

93
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,207
Listen, Tuesday
we're going to the market.

94
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,957
We can take you along.

95
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,790
And have photos taken.

96
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,874
Okay?

97
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,415
My cousin from Mostaganem...

98
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,790
They killed her granddaughter.

99
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,040
This afternoon.

100
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,499
She's 18. Samira.

101
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,165
They stabbed her on the bus.

102
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,540
Right in the heart.

103
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,457
Those dogs.

104
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,790
They threw her out like a dog.

105
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,749
And for a veil!

106
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,249
She didn't wear the hijab.

107
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,415
What's the problem with these people?
It's beyond me.

108
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,999
Is that normal?

109
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,582
God says in the Koran:

110
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,165
You kill your brother, you go to hell.

111
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:42,165
They say they're religious.
They've never read the Koran.

112
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,749
In the Koran, it's written down.

113
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,582
Does it make sense to you?

114
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,582
Look at France.

115
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,707
Schoolgirls make an uproar

116
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,415
about wearing a veil.

117
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,874
The world's gone mad, Christian.

118
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,124
True.

119
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,374
They're killing imams too.

120
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,249
Yesterday they killed an imam
in the street.

121
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,749
Where are we going?

122
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,624
I don't know who these people are.
Only God knows.

123
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,332
This is new. No one understands.

124
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,124
Who's killing who?

125
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,290
We'll pray for Samira and her family.

126
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,915
May she go to Heaven.

127
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,332
It's not mine.

128
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,832
Whose then?

129
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,207
The haji's.

130
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,499
Get lost!

131
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,665
Kill him!

132
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:43,915
Beat it!

133
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,957
Are you stupid?

134
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,082
Christian!

135
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,999
They killed the Croatians!

136
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,624
Our friends, the workers.

137
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,040
Throats slashed, all of them.

138
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,832
You need military protection.

139
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,124
That is not an option.

140
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,874
How can you say that?
Those men were killed nearby!

141
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,790
The atrocities will continue.

142
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,999
The Wali's offer deserves
to be discussed.

143
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:26,207
There are families here.
Think of them.

144
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,332
I made my decision. I refuse.

145
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,124
Let's speak inside.

146
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:45,124
We'll lock the gate at 7:30
and take no night calls.

147
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,124
Do you think that's enough?

148
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,874
You don't know them.

149
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,415
Try to make him see reason.

150
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,707
Is your phone working?

151
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,332
We can't complain.

152
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,999
Call us before it's too late.

153
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,915
Because he is with us
in this time of violence,

154
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:48,249
let us not dream
that he is everywhere,

155
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,707
other than where we die

156
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,749
Let us make haste

157
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:57,415
Let us draw patience from him

158
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:02,874
Let us turn to the Man of Sorrows

159
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:07,957
who beckons us from the cross

160
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:16,040
Because he is with us
as on Easter morn,

161
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:20,707
let us not forgo

162
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,790
the blood he shed

163
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,040
Let us break the bread

164
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:30,290
Let us drink
from the chalice of passage

165
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:35,499
Let us greet the one
who sacrificed himself

166
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:40,707
by loving us until the end

167
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,874
Through him, with him and in him,

168
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,832
you shall receive, Almighty Father,

169
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,415
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

170
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:29,290
all glory and honor,
forever and ever.

171
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,290
How could you decide this
without consulting us?

172
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,749
All our lives are at stake.

173
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,499
What would you have done?

174
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,957
I'd have let everyone speak
and listened to each position.

175
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,332
To answer what, in the end?

176
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,040
The answer doesn't matter.

177
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:53,457
The very principle of community
is compromised by your attitude.

178
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:59,665
Who wants the army
present in the monastery?

179
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,915
You refuse to understand
what we're saying.

180
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,207
I do understand!

181
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,249
None of us chose to live here,

182
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,290
to be protected by a corrupt government.

183
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:20,999
Christian,

184
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,540
we didn't elect you
to decide on your own.

185
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,499
And if they come here?

186
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,999
We lie down and die?

187
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,374
It's a risk.

188
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,540
We were called to live here.

189
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,082
In this country, with these people,

190
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,707
who are also afraid.

191
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,249
We'll live with this unknown, yes.

192
00:29:56,791 --> 00:30:00,249
I didn't come here
to commit collective suicide.

193
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:05,624
Maybe we can try to figure out

194
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:08,915
what each of us could do,
if they came here.

195
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,624
What's there to do?

196
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,790
Look at the Croatians.

197
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,999
Play hide-and-seek.

198
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,874
Cough.

199
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,249
Once more.

200
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,957
You'll outlive us all.

201
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,582
Hello, haji.

202
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,040
Still got your head?

203
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,915
I don't care. They can have my head.

204
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:42,957
May I?

205
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,582
Sure. Be my guest.

206
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,082
The roads are blocked.

207
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,915
I won't go to Meznir today.

208
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,040
Not after what happened.

209
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,582
We don't need anything.
I'll let you know.

210
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,165
Christmas is in a week.

211
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:25,165
You know it's important
for us to be here together.

212
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,665
Thanks again.

213
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,082
Talk to you soon.

214
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:43,915
Accepting our powerlessness
and our extreme poverty

215
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:48,332
is an invitation,
an urgent appeal to create with others

216
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,415
relationships not based on power.

217
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,790
Recognizing my weaknesses,
I accept those of others.

218
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:57,790
I can bear them, make them mine

219
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,665
in imitation of Christ.

220
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:03,207
Such an attitude transforms us
for our mission.

221
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,207
Weakness in itself is not a virtue,

222
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,999
but the expression
of a fundamental reality

223
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:14,832
which must constantly
be refashioned by faith,

224
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,665
hope and love.

225
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,624
The apostle's weakness is like Christ's,

226
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,957
rooted in the mystery of Easter

227
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,874
and the strength of the spirit.

228
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,832
It is neither passivity

229
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,332
nor resignation.

230
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,457
It requires great courage

231
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,207
and incites one
to defend justice and truth

232
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,874
and to denounce the temptation

233
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,499
of force and power.

234
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,540
End of article.

235
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,957
New article.

236
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,790
By Carlo Carretto,

237
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,374
"The God Who is Coming".

238
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,665
Often throughout my life

239
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:55,624
I've wondered
how God could act so strangely.

240
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,457
Why does he stay silent so long?

241
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,540
Why is faith so bitter?

242
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:07,165
And nothing exists except love,

243
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:11,207
except love which now begins

244
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:16,415
By separating sand from water

245
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:20,957
God has prepared earth like a cradle

246
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:26,249
For his coming from above

247
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,749
This is the night,

248
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,290
happy night in Palestine

249
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:38,290
And nothing exists except the Child,

250
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:42,665
except the Child of life divine

251
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,582
What do you want?

252
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,957
Are you the Pope?

253
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,249
Where's the Pope?

254
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,582
There's no Pope here.

255
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,457
Your leader.

256
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,499
His name!

257
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,957
Brother Christian.

258
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,749
Who are you?

259
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:05,582
Ali.

260
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,832
Here he is.

261
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,624
This is Christian.

262
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,415
What do you want?

263
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,165
This is a house of peace.

264
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,290
Are you Christian?

265
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,165
No weapons allowed here.

266
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,624
If you wish to speak,
you must leave them outside.

267
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:34,332
Please.

268
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,165
I never part with mine.

269
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,999
Follow me. We'll talk outside.

270
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,749
I need the doc.

271
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,124
He has to come with us.

272
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:10,999
Impossible.

273
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,457
I have 3 men wounded an hour away.

274
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:20,790
He can't leave here. He's sick.
He's old and asthmatic.

275
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:24,499
Brother Luc sees patients at the clinic.

276
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,832
He tends to everyone who needs his help.

277
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,249
Their identity is not an issue
and never will be.

278
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:33,832
That's all.

279
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,707
So you can give us medicine.

280
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,957
We're short on supplies.

281
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,165
We see 100 villagers a day.

282
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,332
Enough!

283
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,499
You have no choice!

284
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,665
Yes.

285
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,582
I do.

286
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,957
We can't give what we don't have.

287
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,624
Ask your brothers in the village.
We live modestly.

288
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,332
With products we grow.

289
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,957
You know the Koran?

290
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:12,249
"Those nearest in love to the believers

291
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:15,082
"are those who say 'We are Christians'

292
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,332
"Among them are priests and monks."

293
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,165
Priest and monks

294
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,165
and they wax not proud.

295
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:30,415
That's why
we're close to our neighbors.

296
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,790
Come on, let's go.

297
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,790
Tonight is different from other nights.

298
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:09,707
Why?

299
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,624
It's Christmas.

300
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:15,290
We celebrate the birth
of the Prince of peace.

301
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,624
The Prince of peace?

302
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,957
Sidna Aïssa.

303
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,165
Jesus.

304
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,624
I'm sorry, then.

305
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:44,999
I didn't know.

306
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:28,749
Christophe?

307
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:30,582
Michel?

308
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:39,915
Come out now.

309
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:42,832
They're gone.

310
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,457
We're fine.

311
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,832
We made it.

312
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,999
Hold this down gently.

313
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,957
You can let go.

314
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,707
You'll be fine. Don't worry.

315
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:44,624
This is the night,

316
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:49,749
the immense night of origins,

317
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,040
and nothing exists except love,

318
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,915
except love which now begins

319
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,082
By separating sand from water

320
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:10,624
God has prepared the earth like a cradle

321
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:16,749
For his coming from above

322
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:21,999
This is the night,

323
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:26,915
the happy night of Palestine,

324
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:32,874
and nothing exists except the Child,

325
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:39,040
except the Child of life divine

326
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,165
By taking flesh of our flesh,

327
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:49,665
God our desert did refresh

328
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:55,415
and made a land of boundless spring

329
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,124
This is the night,

330
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:07,040
the long night in which we grope,

331
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:12,499
and nothing exists except this place,

332
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:18,624
except this place of ruined hope

333
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:23,582
By stopping in our abode

334
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,874
God, as with the bush, did forebode

335
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,749
the world on which fire would fall

336
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:19,499
Why...

337
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:22,665
why not give them medicine?

338
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:24,665
We have enough.

339
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:29,707
If you have medicine,
I'd like to know about it.

340
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:33,540
We can't start negotiating.

341
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:36,374
Every day they'll ask for more.

342
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:39,665
I agree with Luc.

343
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,999
Don't forget, I was held at gunpoint.

344
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:48,874
If we stay,
our lives would be at risk every day.

345
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,332
I became a monk to live.

346
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,874
Not to sit back
and have my throat slit.

347
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,082
You're right, Celestin.

348
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,790
We shouldn't be seeking martyrdom.

349
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,957
Maybe we should leave.

350
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,540
Or at least
take refuge in a safer place.

351
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:12,874
I think that Celestin

352
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:15,790
is asking a good question.

353
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:21,332
They've come once.
They'll be back sooner than we think.

354
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,790
The fact that
you refused all their demands

355
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:30,082
could be taken as a declaration of war.

356
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,749
Look what they did to the Croatians.

357
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:38,332
If they'd wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

358
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,790
Maybe Fayattia
isn't the only one who decides.

359
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:46,124
Maybe others will come back tomorrow.

360
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,915
There's another solution.

361
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,540
Leave for good.

362
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:02,332
We should each decide
according to his own conscience.

363
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,290
Go back to France

364
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:09,624
or to another,
safer monastery in Africa.

365
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,165
To leave is to run away.

366
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:17,165
And to leave the village
to the terrorists.

367
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,499
We'd do it gradually,

368
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,832
so the villagers won't worry.

369
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,832
That won't change a thing.

370
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,707
The Good Shepherd doesn't
abandon his flock to the wolves.

371
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:36,540
We should each express our opinion
about leaving.

372
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:49,999
Jean-Pierre?

373
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:52,124
We stay.

374
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,957
Since when do we yield to arms?

375
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:58,499
Paul?

376
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,874
I think we should leave.

377
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,374
Gradually.

378
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:06,790
Celestin?

379
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,790
I'm ill. I want to leave.

380
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,915
Luc?

381
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:16,457
To leave is to die.

382
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,249
I'm staying.

383
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:22,040
Michel?

384
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,165
I have no one else, anywhere.

385
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,290
I'll stay.

386
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,290
Amédée?

387
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,040
I don't know yet.

388
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,582
We need to think...

389
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,915
and pray together.

390
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,790
I think we should leave.

391
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,374
And you, Christian?

392
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,915
I agree with Amédée.
It's too early to decide.

393
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,165
Help will come from the Lord.

394
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:23,790
Who made heaven and earth.

395
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,749
We do not know your mystery,

396
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:31,207
Infinite Love,

397
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:35,040
but you do have a heart,

398
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:42,374
for you seek the prodigal son

399
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:47,124
and hold against your breast

400
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:51,624
this troublesome child

401
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:58,290
which is the world of mortals

402
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:10,415
We do not see your face,

403
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,124
Infinite Love,

404
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:19,749
but you do have eyes

405
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:26,832
for you weep through the oppressed

406
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:31,832
and look upon us

407
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:36,915
with a shining gaze

408
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:44,124
that reveals your forgiveness

409
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:23,707
I fear for the fate of this country.

410
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,082
Yesterday two women teachers
were found murdered.

411
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:31,457
For telling teenagers
falling in love is normal,

412
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,374
that they're allowed to.

413
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:37,707
It's a 15-year-old girl
who tipped off the extremists.

414
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:40,040
We're as sad as you are.

415
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,957
What do you know?

416
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,499
This is my country.

417
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:49,832
Besides being sad,
I'm tired of not seeing it grow up.

418
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:54,040
And despite what you think,
I blame French colonization.

419
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,957
That organized plundering.

420
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:03,665
For you.

421
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,540
Ministry of the Interior

422
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:18,999
They mean business.

423
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:23,749
They're giving you orders.

424
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:29,499
No one other than ourselves

425
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,707
can decide that we must leave.

426
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:33,749
I'd have been surprised.

427
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:35,749
Really surprised.

428
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,582
Your stubbornness is getting dangerous.

429
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,165
Look at all these people.

430
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,040
They're at home here.

431
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:53,457
They're terrorized.
They all wish they could leave.

432
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,624
They have no choice, no money.

433
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:02,165
It's not cowardly to want to leave.

434
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,124
It's about being free.

435
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,624
Terror strikes Djelfa

436
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,624
Sooner or later, it'll be you.

437
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:14,290
No one can control
what's going on these days.

438
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:17,415
You'll end up
becoming just another pawn.

439
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:20,499
Your sacrifice
will eventually be exploited.

440
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:27,290
I've known you for years.

441
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,165
I have respect for you.

442
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,415
And for what your community has done.

443
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,165
Please, go back to France.

444
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,207
Did your car break down?

445
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,249
Is any of you a mechanic?

446
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:07,207
If you know how to fix it, be my guest.

447
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:11,082
Should I try?

448
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,499
- Should I try?
- Is it in neutral?

449
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,999
You're in neutral? Go on, try.

450
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:11,915
Will the village
need the army to protect it?

451
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,957
Because...
they'll be back someday.

452
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:16,999
Forget the army!

453
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,665
It's a disaster.

454
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:20,540
The army won't come.

455
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,874
The protection is you.

456
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,332
This village grew up with the monastery.

457
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,499
Who was that priest, before?

458
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,207
A while back, before the war.

459
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:35,915
Brother Bernard?

460
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,582
Another one. Old.

461
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,249
Brother Daniel.

462
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,957
That's him.

463
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,290
Brother Daniel.

464
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:46,207
He told my mother not to stay here.

465
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:49,832
Move to a city.
There was no more work here.

466
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:54,290
She made him swear
to say nothing to my father.

467
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:58,582
Because my mother,
she feels good living here.

468
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,749
Comfortable.

469
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:07,832
We may be leaving.

470
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,290
Why are you leaving?

471
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:19,040
We're like birds on a branch.

472
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:21,374
We don't know if we'll leave.

473
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,624
We're the birds.

474
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,457
You're the branch.

475
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:30,082
If you go, we lose our footing.

476
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,457
Forgive us our trespasses

477
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,790
as we forgive those

478
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,165
who trespass against us,

479
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,540
and lead us not into temptation

480
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,540
but deliver us from evil.

481
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,582
Let us bless the Lord

482
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,540
We render thanks unto Him

483
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:15,457
So you want to leave?

484
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,832
I was thinking that.

485
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:28,790
I wonder what my life would be.

486
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,832
Your family, in France?

487
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:40,874
They're worried?

488
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:44,290
I'm not sure they realize
what's going on here.

489
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,540
I haven't said anything.

490
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,624
The last time I saw them,
it was strange.

491
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:56,540
What do you mean?

492
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:07,832
We celebrated my mom's 80th birthday
at a restaurant.

493
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,582
I saw everyone.

494
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,124
My sisters were there...

495
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:17,999
nephews, nieces, my goddaughter.

496
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,915
Everyone was talking, telling stories.

497
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,499
Taking pictures.

498
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:25,082
They know that's not my thing.

499
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:29,999
I was there, listening. I was happy.

500
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:34,999
They put me next to my mom.

501
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,915
And at the same time,

502
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,374
I was totally out of it.

503
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,707
I was thinking...

504
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:50,082
if I stopped everything, if...

505
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,915
I could move back home.

506
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:57,499
Get back to work, plumbing.

507
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,207
Town council,

508
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:03,124
fire department, chorus.

509
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,499
Then I thought: no, that's not possible.

510
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:11,082
My life's over there.

511
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:16,374
Here. With you.

512
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:25,040
Christian's teaching today
was interesting.

513
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,499
Don't you think?

514
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:33,040
Did you understand anything?

515
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:36,915
Fuck off!

516
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,332
Okay.

517
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,207
Just tired. Not his fault.

518
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:52,082
"There was a time
when a French toe-punt was crummy

519
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,415
"and its Irish equivalent
a mere display of folklore.

520
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:05,249
"When these damned men didn't know
what to do with their ten digits,

521
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:09,915
"but were great at bending the rules
to piss everyone off."

522
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,999
Is that all?

523
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,790
"Even though we agree
with Mr. Break-Neck

524
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:21,207
"that our amiable guests

525
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:24,457
"never closed the game out,

526
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:28,207
"we still wonder whether they prefer,
deep down,

527
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:30,290
"the dervish-like scrums

528
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:33,290
"and bleak brawls of yesteryear.

529
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:39,915
"Back when players
still cared about not being

530
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,124
naughty old men."

531
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:46,582
A little more.

532
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,124
Help me, help me.

533
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,790
Don't abandon me.

534
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:03,332
Don't abandon me. Please.

535
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,415
Help me.

536
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:34,957
Not very pretty. It got infected.

537
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:42,707
Tell him I'll be giving him two shots.

538
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:48,290
An antibiotic and a tetanus shot.

539
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,249
He's in pain. He needs medicine.

540
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:58,415
I'll give him a tranquilizer.

541
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,582
Let's clean this up.

542
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:15,749
You'll be fine.

543
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:25,582
Glory be to the Father,
and the Son and the Holy Spirit

544
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:29,415
World without end

545
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:39,207
Save us, Lord,

546
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:42,374
whilst we watch

547
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:46,624
Keep us, Lord,

548
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,540
whilst we sleep

549
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:57,915
And we shall watch with Christ

550
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:03,915
And we shall rest in peace

551
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,124
I'm worn out.

552
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,707
Does Amédée help out?

553
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:14,249
Fortunately. I don't know
how I'd manage otherwise.

554
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:20,165
I've never had so many visits.

555
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:23,749
I'm up to 150 a day. Can you imagine?

556
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:27,290
People come from everywhere around.

557
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,915
I'm dealing with new pathologies.

558
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,957
Lots of hypertension. They're stressed.

559
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:36,624
Some are in a state of shock.

560
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:39,457
Not to mention the effect on the kids.

561
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:47,249
The villagers may talk
about these men we help.

562
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:48,665
Be careful.

563
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:54,207
Throughout my career I've met
all sorts of different people.

564
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,415
Including Nazis.

565
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,249
And even...

566
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,790
the devil.

567
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,415
I'm not scared of terrorists,
even less of the army.

568
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:18,415
And I'm not scared of death.
I'm a free man.

569
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:31,749
Let the free man through!

570
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,874
My men tied him to a truck,

571
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,582
dragged him through the city.

572
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,582
People jumped for joy.

573
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,249
Lucky for him he was dead.

574
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,707
Why didn't you stop them?

575
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:12,457
Stop them?

576
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:17,415
Lots of people in the crowd
were victims of his atrocities.

577
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,499
Family.

578
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,124
Friends who died.

579
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:21,665
Many innocent people.

580
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:25,040
Disgraceful.
No one should be treated this way.

581
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:27,707
Want to know his favorite torture?

582
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:31,832
Fayattia and others like him
deserve no compassion.

583
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:35,332
You're very indulgent
with the terrorists.

584
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:37,790
Overindulgent.

585
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:42,665
Rumor has it
he was shielding the monastery.

586
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,832
Did you ever treat them?

587
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:48,540
Where did you find him?

588
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:54,499
Two days ago,
the Wali's car was ambushed.

589
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,040
Near Tikrit.

590
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,832
The terrorists got away.

591
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,457
We found a wounded man on the ground.

592
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:04,249
His friends ditched him.

593
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:06,165
He talked about his mother.

594
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:08,290
Said his name was Fayattia.

595
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,374
My men let him suffer.

596
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:13,499
He died
before we could make him our trophy.

597
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:17,374
How can you be sure it's him?

598
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,957
Why do you think I asked you here?

599
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:41,957
So?

600
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,082
It's him.

601
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,874
Get out. Go on.

602
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,415
Outside.

603
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,415
I sleep badly.

604
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:41,165
The slightest noise wakes me.

605
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:44,040
I think over my life.

606
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,374
My choices.

607
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:55,582
As a kid I wanted to be a missionary.

608
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:02,040
Dying for my faith
shouldn't keep me up nights.

609
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,540
Dying here,

610
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:13,999
here and now,

611
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:16,082
does it serve a purpose?

612
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:21,665
I don't know.

613
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:25,124
I feel like I'm going mad.

614
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:29,499
It's true that staying here

615
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,374
is as mad as becoming a monk.

616
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,582
Remember.

617
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:44,332
You've already given your life.

618
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,582
You gave it by following Christ.

619
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:51,165
When you decided to leave everything.

620
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:52,707
Your life,

621
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:54,499
your family, your country.

622
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,582
The family you could have raised.

623
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,540
I don't know if it's true anymore.

624
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:04,999
I pray.

625
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:09,415
And I hear nothing.

626
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:15,999
I don't get it.

627
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,582
Why be martyrs?

628
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,499
For God?

629
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:23,874
To be heroes?

630
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,749
To prove we're the best?

631
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:29,874
We're martyrs out of love,
out of fidelity.

632
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,124
If death...

633
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,332
overtakes us, despite ourselves,

634
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,082
because up to the end,

635
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:42,665
up to the end we'll try to avoid it,

636
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:46,665
our mission here
is to be brothers to all.

637
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,915
Remember that love...

638
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:53,457
is eternal hope.

639
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,624
Love endures everything.

640
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,332
I'm sorry.

641
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:20,582
Like parched earth,

642
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:25,249
I stand before you, Lord

643
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:39,707
O Lord, hear my prayer,

644
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:43,290
listen to my cry for mercy

645
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,332
In your faithfulness, answer me

646
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,040
Enter not into judgment
with your servant

647
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:53,707
For no man living
is righteous before you

648
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:58,207
The enemy persecutes my soul

649
01:22:58,375 --> 01:23:01,582
He has smitten my life to the ground

650
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:05,874
He has made me dwell in darkness

651
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:09,582
with those long dead

652
01:23:10,041 --> 01:23:13,499
My spirit grows faint within me

653
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:18,207
My heart within me, dismayed

654
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:21,582
Answer me quickly, O Lord

655
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,749
My spirit fails

656
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:28,082
Do not hide your face from me,

657
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:32,040
lest I be like them
who fall into the pit

658
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,415
We've received so many letters recently.

659
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,207
People are worried.

660
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:40,332
I can't answer them all.

661
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:46,499
There's that French journalist
who wants to meet us.

662
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:49,290
I don't know what to tell her.

663
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:54,915
We shouldn't expose ourselves further
by doing publicity.

664
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:57,499
Of course, but...

665
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,665
it's a way of making
people understand our choices.

666
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,207
To show that

667
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:09,999
amid all this drama, for people here,
there's reason for hope.

668
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:14,540
You know,
hope is not what interests journalists.

669
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,249
It doesn't mobilize them.

670
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:17,540
Exactly.

671
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:19,999
Maybe we should mobilize them.

672
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,915
I suggest we take a vote.

673
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:32,207
To see if we're all of one mind.

674
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:36,707
Who wants to leave?

675
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:43,249
I've already told you
my position on this matter

676
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:47,957
and my calling is to be here,
with everyone.

677
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,207
I don't see myself leaving.

678
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,082
Leaving would lead nowhere.

679
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,582
I'm not ready to leave myself.

680
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,749
Last night I thought about leaving.

681
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:16,790
I'm not comfortable with it.

682
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:19,749
Not at peace.

683
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:24,665
Deciding to run off like that
makes no sense.

684
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:29,124
We didn't come here
for our own personal interest.

685
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:35,707
I still think that our mission here
is not finished.

686
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:37,957
I'm staying.

687
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,374
I prayed all morning
while I was cooking.

688
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:46,499
The disciple

689
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,832
is not above his master.

690
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:55,374
This is no time for me to stray.

691
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:59,540
Let God set the table here.

692
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:01,790
For everyone.

693
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,749
Friends and enemies.

694
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:12,040
And you, Christian?

695
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:20,915
Wildflowers don't move
to find the sun's rays.

696
01:26:22,458 --> 01:26:25,290
God makes them fecund

697
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:27,249
wherever they are.

698
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:31,790
Who

699
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:33,290
prefers to stay?

700
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:13,624
You.

701
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,832
You envelop me, hold me, surround me.

702
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:23,207
You embrace me.

703
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:25,999
And I love you.

704
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:17,832
- Where do you live?
- In town.

705
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:20,124
- ID.
- I don't have it on me.

706
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:22,665
- Where do you live?
- Just nearby.

707
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:24,499
- ID.
- I don't have them.

708
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:26,582
- Where do you live?
- The village.

709
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:30,457
Stop this nonsense!

710
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:33,749
These women and children
are here to be treated.

711
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:36,040
This is not a police station!

712
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,124
Enough!

713
01:29:42,291 --> 01:29:43,874
Unbelievable.

714
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,374
Sit down.

715
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:49,457
Follow me.

716
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:52,249
I recently read
this pensée of Pascal's:

717
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:56,207
"Men never do evil
so completely and cheerfully

718
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,874
"as when they do it
from religious conviction."

719
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,957
Here it is mayhem

720
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,540
and violence.

721
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:11,957
We are in a high-risk situation,

722
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:16,415
but we persist in our faith
and our confidence in God.

723
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:20,290
It is through poverty, failure and death

724
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,290
that we advance towards him.

725
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:28,874
Heavy devastating downpours

726
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:32,040
have put no damper
on the spread of violence.

727
01:31:33,958 --> 01:31:36,457
Two opponents,
one clutching onto power,

728
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,374
the other out to seize it.

729
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:40,832
They'll fight to the bitter end.

730
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:43,540
I don't know when or how it will end.

731
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:46,332
In the meantime, I do my duty...

732
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,915
Caring for the poor and the sick,

733
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:53,374
awaiting the day I close my eyes.
Dear friend,

734
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:57,957
pray for me, that my leaving this world

735
01:31:58,125 --> 01:32:01,790
will in the peace and joy of Jesus.

736
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:12,457
O Father

737
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:15,874
of light,

738
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:23,290
eternal light

739
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:29,624
and source of all light,

740
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:37,707
you illuminate us,
at the threshold of night,

741
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:44,124
with the radiance of your face

742
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:50,999
The shadows, for you,

743
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:55,790
are not shadows

744
01:33:56,875 --> 01:34:00,290
For you, night

745
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:06,124
is as clear as day

746
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:15,999
May our prayers before you

747
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:21,749
rise like incense

748
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:30,749
and our hands like the evening offering

749
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:05,624
Welcome, Bruno.

750
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,832
Celestin.

751
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:18,790
Christophe.

752
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:27,790
Hello, Luc.

753
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:31,499
Jean-Pierre.

754
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,040
Amédée.

755
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,624
- Hosts.
- For me.

756
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:14,790
For us.

757
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:16,207
For us all.

758
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:19,165
Medicine.

759
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:21,040
For Luc.

760
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:25,249
Lots of medicine.

761
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:29,624
- You found it?
- I found your book.

762
01:36:29,791 --> 01:36:31,040
Is it the right one?

763
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:32,499
"The Chosen".

764
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,290
Cheese!

765
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:41,207
Any news of Brother Didier?

766
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:44,832
Of course he said to say hello.

767
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:47,665
And I have a letter for you.

768
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:51,249
So how was your trip?

769
01:36:51,416 --> 01:36:52,540
How long was it?

770
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:56,082
It took a while
to come from the diocese.

771
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:59,624
At least 3 hours.
There were 3 checkpoints!

772
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,707
Between the last two checkpoints

773
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:06,582
there was a bus burning on the roadside.

774
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,290
Smoke coming out of it.

775
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:12,415
And we didn't know
if the checkpoints were real or fake.

776
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:15,165
On the way here,

777
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:19,249
as we got closer,
there were fewer vehicles.

778
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:20,999
Many soldiers?

779
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:23,874
Yes, near the checkpoints.

780
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:30,124
They were all very tense.

781
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:33,332
Out of the question
to speak to them.

782
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:36,290
- How do we stand?
- However we want.

783
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,124
Short ones up front.

784
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,874
Squeeze in closer.

785
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:48,499
Ready?

786
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:51,957
Set...

787
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:54,749
Let's take another.

788
01:37:56,875 --> 01:37:58,415
Smile a little.

789
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:32,832
I've often thought of that time.

790
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:36,915
That time

791
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:40,582
when Ali Fayattia and his men left.

792
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:47,124
Once they were gone,

793
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:51,874
all we had left to do was to live.

794
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,540
And the first thing we did

795
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:56,832
was...

796
01:38:58,875 --> 01:39:00,415
two hours later.

797
01:39:01,166 --> 01:39:04,749
We celebrated
the Christmas Vigil and Mass.

798
01:39:05,916 --> 01:39:07,499
It's what we had to do.

799
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,165
It's what we did.

800
01:39:11,458 --> 01:39:13,415
And we sang the Mass.

801
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:19,207
We welcomed that child
who was born for us

802
01:39:20,708 --> 01:39:23,082
absolutely helpless and...

803
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:26,790
and already so threatened.

804
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,290
Afterwards,

805
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:37,290
we found salvation
in undertaking our daily tasks.

806
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,332
The kitchen,

807
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:41,707
the garden,

808
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,874
the prayers, the bells.

809
01:39:44,458 --> 01:39:46,332
Day after day.

810
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:53,249
We had to resist the violence.

811
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,124
And day after day, I...

812
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:01,832
I think each of us

813
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:03,749
discovered

814
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,874
that to which Jesus Christ

815
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:08,790
beckons us.

816
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:11,457
It's...

817
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:13,874
to be born.

818
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:17,249
Our identities as men

819
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:19,707
go from one birth to another.

820
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:24,290
And from birth to birth,
we'll each end up

821
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:28,249
bringing to the world
the child of God that we are.

822
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:30,540
The Incarnation, for us,

823
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:33,707
is to allow the filial reality of Jesus

824
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:36,457
to embody itself in our humanity.

825
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,540
The mystery of Incarnation remains

826
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:46,165
what we are going to live.

827
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:52,457
In this way
what we've already lived here takes root

828
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:53,749
as well as...

829
01:40:54,291 --> 01:40:56,082
what we're going to live

830
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:57,707
in the future.

831
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:03,040
Whoever tries to save his life
shall lose it,

832
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:07,332
and whoever shall lose it,
preserves it.

833
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,832
I tell you,

834
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:14,582
on that night,
two people shall be in one bed.

835
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:18,707
One shall be taken, the other left.

836
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:22,290
Two women shall
be grinding grain together.

837
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:24,374
One shall be taken,

838
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:26,332
the other left.

839
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,207
The disciples asked him:

840
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,999
"Where, Lord?"

841
01:41:31,916 --> 01:41:33,499
He answered:

842
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,915
"Where there is a body,

843
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:39,249
"there too the vultures shall gather."

844
01:41:48,041 --> 01:41:50,332
The Gospel of the Lord.

845
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:53,832
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

846
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:12,582
The body of Christ.

847
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:47,999
Lord, blessed art thou for this meal
which unites us as brothers

848
01:42:48,666 --> 01:42:50,665
now and...

849
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,707
World without end.

850
01:47:47,666 --> 01:47:48,749
Hurry up!

851
01:48:07,875 --> 01:48:08,499
Move!

852
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:13,790
Hurry, faster!

853
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:21,207
Hurry, get dressed.

854
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:22,332
I just got here.

855
01:48:23,916 --> 01:48:24,707
I can't.

856
01:48:44,166 --> 01:48:45,832
I said don't push!

857
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:51,040
Careful with that medicine.
It's for the children, not you.

858
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:52,665
It's very precious.

859
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:56,207
Stop pushing me! That's enough!

860
01:48:56,375 --> 01:48:57,665
Calm down!

861
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:26,665
I am Brother Paul.

862
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:29,832
A monk at the Monastère de l'Atlas.

863
01:51:30,208 --> 01:51:32,499
And I'm in good health.

864
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,332
I am Brother Celestin.

865
01:51:42,083 --> 01:51:44,165
I'm 63.

866
01:51:47,875 --> 01:51:50,582
A monk at the Monastère de l'Atlas.

867
01:51:53,291 --> 01:51:54,832
I'm in good health.

868
01:51:57,958 --> 01:51:59,124
Your turn, Luc.

869
01:52:06,625 --> 01:52:10,332
My name is Brother Luc.

870
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:13,124
From the Monastère de l'Atlas.

871
01:52:15,208 --> 01:52:19,249
I heard what they're saying on the news.

872
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:23,457
I've been taken hostage

873
01:52:23,625 --> 01:52:27,124
with my colleagues by the Jama...

874
01:52:27,916 --> 01:52:29,082
What's it called?

875
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,332
Islamiyya.

876
01:52:31,125 --> 01:52:33,540
Jama Islamiyya, that's it.

877
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,249
Your turn, Christian.

878
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:47,624
In the early hours of Friday morning,

879
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:53,332
the Mujahideen read us the bayan
of the Jama Islamiyya Moussalaha...

880
01:52:54,916 --> 01:52:56,040
Signed by?

881
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,624
Signed by Abu Abderrahamane Amine.

882
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:03,707
It says we're being held hostage

883
01:53:03,875 --> 01:53:06,665
and demands that the French government

884
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:11,082
free hostages belonging to their group

885
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:13,499
in exchange for our liberation.

886
01:53:14,666 --> 01:53:17,165
This exchange is non-negotiable.

887
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:22,040
Did you hear?

888
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,290
Should it ever befall me,

889
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:48,290
and it could happen today,

890
01:53:48,625 --> 01:53:53,540
to be a victim of the terrorism
swallowing up all foreigners here,

891
01:53:54,458 --> 01:53:56,707
I would like my community,

892
01:53:56,958 --> 01:53:58,249
my church,

893
01:53:58,541 --> 01:53:59,624
my family,

894
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:03,999
to remember that my life was given
to God and to this country.

895
01:54:05,375 --> 01:54:08,040
That the Unique Master of all life

896
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:11,082
was no stranger
to this brutal departure.

897
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:15,915
And that my death is the same as
so many other violent ones,

898
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:18,999
consigned to the apathy of oblivion.

899
01:54:19,916 --> 01:54:24,874
I've lived enough to know
I am complicit in the evil that, alas,

900
01:54:25,208 --> 01:54:26,790
prevails over the world

901
01:54:27,333 --> 01:54:30,082
and the evil that will smite me blindly.

902
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:32,915
I could never desire such a death.

903
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:37,624
I could never feel gladdened
that these people I love

904
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:40,665
be accused randomly of my murder.

905
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:45,124
I know the contempt
felt for the people here,

906
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:46,957
indiscriminately.

907
01:54:47,125 --> 01:54:50,540
And I know how Islam is distorted
by a certain Islamism.

908
01:54:52,416 --> 01:54:55,457
This country, and Islam, for me

909
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:57,124
are something different.

910
01:54:57,291 --> 01:54:59,999
They're a body and a soul.

911
01:55:00,875 --> 01:55:02,999
My death, of course,

912
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:06,624
will quickly vindicate
those who called me naïve

913
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:08,124
or idealistic,

914
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:13,415
but they must know that I will be freed
of a burning curiosity

915
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:17,957
and, God willing,
will immerse my gaze in the Father's

916
01:55:18,791 --> 01:55:21,832
and contemplate with him
his children of Islam

917
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,332
as he sees them.

918
01:55:24,583 --> 01:55:28,499
This thank-you
which encompasses my entire life

919
01:55:29,583 --> 01:55:31,290
includes you, of course,

920
01:55:31,458 --> 01:55:34,082
friends of yesterday and today,

921
01:55:34,583 --> 01:55:37,374
and you too,
friend of the last minute,

922
01:55:37,916 --> 01:55:40,040
who knew not what you were doing.

923
01:55:40,291 --> 01:55:42,457
Yes, to you as well

924
01:55:42,625 --> 01:55:44,499
I address this thank-you

925
01:55:44,666 --> 01:55:46,499
and this farewell

926
01:55:46,666 --> 01:55:48,374
which you envisaged.

927
01:55:48,666 --> 01:55:51,374
May we meet again,

928
01:55:51,583 --> 01:55:54,624
happy thieves in Paradise,

929
01:55:54,791 --> 01:55:56,165
if it pleases God,

930
01:55:56,333 --> 01:55:58,540
the Father of us both.

931
01:55:58,833 --> 01:55:59,874
Amen.

932
01:56:00,416 --> 01:56:01,124
Inchallah.

933
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:57,499
Christian, Luc, Christophe,
Celestin, Paul, Michel and Bruno

934
01:58:57,666 --> 01:58:59,082
were killed on May 21, 1996.

935
01:59:00,208 --> 01:59:04,207
The identity of their murderers
and the circumstances of their deaths

936
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:05,999
remain a mystery.

937
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:08,957
Amédée died on July 27, 2008.

938
01:59:09,125 --> 01:59:11,457
Jean-Pierre is still alive.
He is now 86.
