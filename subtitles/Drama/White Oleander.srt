1
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,960
Everybody asks why I started at the end
and worked back to the beginning.

2
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:23,326
The reason is simple.

3
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,766
I couldn't understand the beginning
until I had reached the end.

4
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:33,003
There were too many pieces
of the puzzle missing.

5
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,111
Too much she would never tell.

6
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,276
I could sell these things.
People want to buy them.

7
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:44,920
But I'd set all this on fire first.

8
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:48,319
She'd like that.
That's what she would do.

9
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:51,289
She'd make it just to burn it.

10
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:58,260
I couldn't afford this one, but the
beginning deserved something special.

11
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:02,029
But how do I show that nothing,
not a taste...

12
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,902
...not a smell, not even
the color of the sky...

13
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:11,513
...has ever been as clear and sharp
as it was when I belonged to her.

14
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:16,084
I don't know how to express that being
with someone so dangerous...

15
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:18,914
...was the last time that I felt safe.

16
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:59,255
The Santa Anas blew in hot
from the desert that fall.

17
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,762
Only the oleanders thrived.

18
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,833
Maybe the wind was the reason
my mother did what she did.

19
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:15,911
If it was, I wouldn't have known.
I lived in her shadow then.

20
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,144
She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen.

21
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:24,115
Everybody thinks that
when they're small...

22
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:29,020
...but she was the most beautiful woman
most people had ever seen.

23
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:34,163
He came into our lives without warning.

24
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,822
She ignored him at first.
He wasn't her type.

25
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:41,232
We laughed about him, his persistence.

26
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:47,866
"Never let a man spend the night, "
she said. Never apologize, never explain.

27
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:55,076
She was breaking all her rules.
And it would change everything.

28
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,753
What are you doing up here?

29
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,160
Come sit next to me.

30
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,259
It's the best place to feel the wind.

31
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,500
I can feel it from here.

32
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,898
No, you can't.

33
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,473
It's okay.

34
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,980
You should get some sleep.

35
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:32,485
I never sleep.
I've been up here for hours.

36
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:38,287
I had the most amazing idea for how to
use my Polaroids in the Newport show.

37
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:42,921
I'm gonna skip work today.
Keep going until I finish.

38
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,997
You're still coming to parents' night,
aren't you?

39
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,567
Oh, God, I forgot.

40
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:55,335
I made plans to go to Greta's opening.

41
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,270
All the other parents go.

42
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:02,918
What can they tell me about you
that I don't already know?

43
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,490
Time's up! Pencils down.
Papers, please. Thank you.

44
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:13,921
Thank you. Time, Astrid.

45
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,592
Thank you.

46
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,802
Is your mother coming tonight?

47
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,137
No. She has other plans.

48
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,741
More important than parents' night?

49
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:32,171
She's an artist. She doesn't care
about things like parents' night.

50
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:38,048
Right. And don't forget, you guys,
chapters 17 and 18 for tomorrow.

51
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,814
Finished my mug shots.

52
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,651
What do you think?

53
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:44,985
They're great.

54
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:48,756
No. You're not looking.

55
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:53,698
You can't be an artist if you don't see.
Why do you think they're great?

56
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,570
I don't know.

57
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,882
They're Ionely.

58
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,788
It's me in the center.

59
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,983
It's our secret.
You can't tell anybody.

60
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:22,723
I won't. I never tell our secrets.

61
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:29,830
It's the deer-in-the-headlights look.
Hilarious.

62
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:33,305
-How long has this been going on?
-Couple months.

63
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,378
-His wife's gonna figure it out.
-She's an idiot.

64
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,343
Cinema Scene.

65
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,312
It's Barry Kolker again.

66
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:52,824
Tell him I was killed
in a climbing accident in the Himalayas.

67
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:56,288
Barry, she's still out of town.

68
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,509
We don't have any eggs.

69
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,208
We never have any eggs.

70
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,222
Barry can take us out to breakfast.

71
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,291
Barry spent the night?

72
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,226
Yeah.

73
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,865
Excuse me.

74
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,145
I bet he's still out of town.

75
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,112
I called the magazine.
He got back three days ago.

76
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:25,385
He's probably working.
He doesn't call then.

77
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:29,992
He doesn't call when he's getting
what he wants from somebody else.

78
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,113
I don't think you should do this.

79
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,612
He'll get mad.

80
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,846
-I'll just say we were in the neighborhood.
-He won't believe us.

81
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,065
You're not my type.

82
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:32,042
You're not my type.

83
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,292
What happened?

84
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,388
He has a date.

85
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,931
He made love to me
and then said I had to leave...

86
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,594
...because he has a date.

87
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,245
-No! Get away from me.
-Get her out!

88
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,580
-You have no right!
-You're under arrest...

89
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,246
-...for the murder of Barry Kolker.
-They can't keep me!

90
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,654
I'll be back in an hour!

91
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,920
You must be Astrid? I'm Miss Martinez
from Children's Services to pick you up.

92
00:11:56,098 --> 00:12:00,467
If you need more time, I can
give you 15 minutes, but that's it.

93
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:04,436
I'm not going. I'm waiting
for my mother to come home.

94
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:10,273
Your mother won't be coming home.
At least not for a while.

95
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:31,088
...any legal cause why sentence of
judgment should not now be imposed?

96
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:35,328
Therefore, in accordance
with the laws of California...

97
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:40,100
...I sentence you to the term
prescribed by law for murder.

98
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:45,145
Not less than 35 years to life
in a maximum-security prison.

99
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:38,562
-Hey!
-Hello, Starr. How are you?

100
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,464
Well, I'm fine! How are you?

101
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,539
-Good to see you.
-You too.

102
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:48,643
Y'all must be starving.
I hope you like olive loaf.

103
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,473
-I made enough to feed an army.
-Astrid?

104
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,512
-How was traffic?
-Bad downtown...

105
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:56,583
-...but it cleared up pretty fast.
-Oh, good.

106
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,849
There you go. Astrid Magnussen,
this is Starr Thomas.

107
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,322
It is so nice to meet you, Astrid.

108
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,759
Come on in! Here, let me help you
with that. Was it a long drive?

109
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,125
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

110
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:15,362
I hope you didn't bring a ton of stuff.
You'll share a room with my daughter.

111
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:18,701
This is our home.
This is where we have company.

112
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:21,775
Then in here is the kitchen
and whatnot.

113
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,038
The boys sleep here.
We don't have enough bedrooms.

114
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,774
That's Davey in the glasses, and Owen.

115
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,646
This is Astrid.
Boys, you say hi?

116
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:34,949
Carolee? I said, get out here right now.

117
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,388
Let's just go in there.

118
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,426
This is Carolee, my daughter.

119
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,290
Make some room, okay?

120
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,131
This is where you'll sleep.
She'll clean up. Don't worry.

121
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:55,869
Just don't mind her. She's hormonal.
The problem is she hasn't been saved.

122
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,137
What about you?

123
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,302
What?

124
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,075
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

125
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,513
I don't know.

126
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:06,086
When you do, he'll be waiting. Okay?

127
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,850
This is where Ray and I sleep,
and the bathroom's here.

128
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:12,152
Let's go back in here.

129
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:18,325
Ray's home late tonight. It's poker night.
Don't talk to him about Jesus.

130
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,130
He acts like he's the repo man or
something, not a carpenter like him.

131
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:41,318
You must be the new addition.

132
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,588
I'm Ray.

133
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:50,022
Or Uncle Ray, but that's Starr's idea.

134
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,167
Not mine.

135
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:56,362
I'm Astrid.

136
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,098
It's nice to meet you, Astrid.

137
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,139
You coming in?

138
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,116
Well, how come?

139
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:11,246
I'm thinking.

140
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,780
Oh, what about?

141
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:21,153
My mother.

142
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,996
Starr was telling me about her. She's
doing time for killing her boyfriend, right?

143
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,934
Yeah, well, those things happen.

144
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,648
You come in when you're ready, okay?

145
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:54,719
That slut said I was grounded, like
she's the mother in The Brady Bunch.

146
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,699
Listen to that.

147
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:03,528
Saved by Jesus.
She's such a hypocrite.

148
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:07,198
They shouldn't be doing it.
They're not even married.

149
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:11,005
Reverend Daniels always blah-blahing
about Jesus.

150
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,149
All he really wants to do
is look at her ass.

151
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:19,214
Don't forget to leave the window open.

152
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:22,180
Don't look at me like that.

153
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:26,589
You're no different than I am.
You just don't know it yet.

154
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,879
I'm gonna kill you, Ingrid!

155
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,847
I'm gonna strangle you, bitch!

156
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:00,389
You bloody bitch!

157
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:08,467
Sin is a virus.
That's what Reverend Thomas says.

158
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:12,368
It's infecting the whole country
like the clap.

159
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,003
We've got every excuse.

160
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:21,138
What's wrong if I shovel coke up my nose
or want to feel good? Who does it hurt?

161
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:26,948
Well, it hurts us.
And it hurts Jesus. Because it's wrong.

162
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,180
I don't know how you swallow that.

163
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,696
"He who believeth in me, though he was
dead, yet will he live." Don't forget it.

164
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:38,629
Here we are.

165
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:44,535
It's a miracle I'm not dead. They took
my kids away. I was an alcoholic...

166
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,836
-...a cokehead. I was dancing topless.
-People are staring.

167
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,275
Oh, Astrid, look!

168
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,817
Look at that. That is gonna go
perfect with your new shoes.

169
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,612
I mean, I thought:

170
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:03,724
"Who cares if I hang my tits in a
stranger's face? It's nobody's business."

171
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,861
You know what?
This is gonna be good on you.

172
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,966
Astrid, those are ugly shoes.

173
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,568
Snakes don't bite above the ankle.

174
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:19,571
You're better off being bitten
by snakes than dressing for them.

175
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:26,239
We need to get her a bra. Carolee
had her first bra when she was 9.

176
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:31,114
You don't want them hanging
to your knees when you're 30. Try it on.

177
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:38,420
Carolee, will Ray love that?
Look at that. That is so nice!

178
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,291
Hurry, Astrid, it's here!

179
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,988
I told you you were gonna miss it.

180
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,932
Astrid. This one's for you.

181
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,103
Who's it from?

182
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,174
My mother.

183
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,408
I didn't think she knew where I was.

184
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,912
Dear Astrid, have you been getting
my letters?

185
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:07,112
It's been six months.
Why don't you write?

186
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,055
It's only a few minutes
before they turn out the lights.

187
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,992
I can hear the women screaming
in their cells.

188
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:20,994
We're both in prison, you and l, punished
for our strength and our independence.

189
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,364
Don't forget who you are.

190
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:27,975
The best part of me is well-hidden
and you have to do the same.

191
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,840
Remember it all,
every insult, every tear.

192
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,290
What are you doing?

193
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:49,196
I'm writing a letter to my mother.

194
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,392
You ever write your dad?

195
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,797
I don't know where he is.

196
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:56,900
I never met him.

197
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,269
He left when I was 2.

198
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:03,241
-Your mother tell you much about him?
-No.

199
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:08,149
-Well, aren't you curious?
-I think about what he would think of me.

200
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:13,118
He probably thinks you're still 2.
That's how I remember my son, Seth.

201
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,882
-You have a son?
-Yeah.

202
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:20,017
-Hey, Ray.
-Hey, Patty.

203
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,498
So you're going to the Jesus show?

204
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:29,933
-Aren't you coming?
-To Bible study? No.

205
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:34,838
In my opinion, if there's a God,
he sure as hell ain't worth praying to.

206
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:39,209
That sounds like
something my mother would say.

207
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,350
She wouldn't take me
to the Christmas pageant.

208
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:46,180
She made me beg a ride
off another kid.

209
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:49,214
Hey, Ray.

210
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,291
Leanne, hi!

211
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,124
How you doing, Reverend?
I don't think he likes me very much.

212
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,033
Why don't you and Starr
get married?

213
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,365
'Cause I'm already married.

214
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:08,407
-Astrid, come on in. We're starting.
-Okay, I'm coming.

215
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,606
Where's your wife?

216
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,039
Who knows?

217
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,982
I haven't seen her or my son
in over five years.

218
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:37,830
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

219
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:40,531
Amen.

220
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:53,852
Do you believe in God now?

221
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:59,316
Maybe it's not such a bad thing
to believe in something.

222
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,398
-It's better to know things.
-Why?

223
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:10,129
What does it get you? Does it tell you
the difference between right or wrong?

224
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:16,276
She didn't kill that guy alone.

225
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,744
I knew what my mother
was doing, you know?

226
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,613
I could've saved his life,
but I didn't.

227
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,943
Come on.

228
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:12,192
I'm gonna kill you, Ingrid! Open the door!

229
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,825
Think there was something
valuable on that hard disk?

230
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:21,306
Maybe a collection of essays
due at the publisher's this fall.

231
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:26,046
You bloody bitch!
You can't do this to me!

232
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,546
You don't know what I can do.

233
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:36,520
Fill out your registration slips.
Know your inmate's number.

234
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,226
No number, no visit.

235
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,296
Hey, baby.

236
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,943
Astrid Magnussen?

237
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:07,819
Astrid?

238
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:10,119
Follow me.

239
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,502
Mama!

240
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,520
No, no, no, no, no.

241
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:41,656
Don't cry.

242
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:45,122
We're not like that.
We're the Vikings. Remember?

243
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,857
You're so beautiful.

244
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,469
Prison agrees with me.

245
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,538
There's no hypocrisy here.

246
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:02,837
Kill or be killed,
and everybody knows it.

247
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,077
Do they hurt you?

248
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:09,479
Not as much as I hurt them.

249
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:16,584
I won't be in here forever.
I promise you that.

250
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:20,558
One day you'll look out your window
and I'll be there.

251
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:25,764
Your hair smells like clover.

252
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:33,964
I wanna remember you just like this,
in that sadly hopeful pink dress.

253
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:39,143
-Starr picked it out.
-Of course she did.

254
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,375
What's that?

255
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,384
Nothing. It's just a cross.

256
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:51,923
I know it's a cross.

257
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,887
Why are you wearing it?

258
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,526
It's a present from Starr.

259
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:03,861
She force you to go to church?

260
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,032
They're really nice people.
It's called the Assembly of God.

261
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:13,909
To join you have to accept Christ as your
personal savior. And you're baptized.

262
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:19,611
They call it being washed in the blood
of the Lamb. But really, it's just water.

263
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:25,148
Have you accepted Christ
as your personal savior?

264
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:30,162
-There's nothing wrong with Christians.
-Are you out of your mind?

265
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:36,535
How did this happen? I raised you,
not Bible-thumping trailer trash.

266
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:39,333
I raised you to think for yourself.

267
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:41,771
No, you didn't.

268
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:47,781
You raised me to think like you.

269
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:53,910
Maybe thinking for yourself isn't so
great. Reverend Daniels says it's evil.

270
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:59,925
Evil? If thinking for yourself is evil,
then every artist is evil.

271
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:05,533
Is that what you believe, now that
you're washed in the blood of the Lamb?

272
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,160
-Man's ability to reason is evil? Am I evil?
-No.

273
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:13,871
No.

274
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:18,778
But killing people who
don't want you is evil.

275
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,915
We pray for your redemption.

276
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:25,018
Fuck my redemption. I don't want it.
I regret nothing.

277
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:30,988
Attention. Visiting hours are over.
Visitors, return to the holding area.

278
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:34,988
It's good that you're trying
to identify evil, Astrid.

279
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:37,823
But evil is tricky.

280
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:42,959
Just when you think you know
what it is, it changes its form.

281
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,699
Learning its nature takes
a lifetime of study.

282
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:51,938
I will not lose you.
Not to them.

283
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,745
Those people are the enemy, Astrid.

284
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,852
-Visiting hours are over.
-Write to me.

285
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,749
-Time's up.
-Write to me...

286
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:03,618
-...at least once a week.
-I love you.

287
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:08,991
I'm the only person you know
who can keep you honest.

288
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,689
-Okay?
-Okay.

289
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:18,432
Don't forget who you are, Astrid.

290
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,034
You're my daughter
and you're perfect, remember?

291
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,477
How far away is it?

292
00:29:57,645 --> 00:30:00,978
About a mile. Maybe two.

293
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,414
Shouldn't we pack up and go?

294
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:07,521
No, not yet. The wind's still in our favor.

295
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,817
My mother used to love fire season.

296
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,564
She made me decide what I'd take
if we had to go.

297
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,693
She said if I was brave,
I wouldn't take anything.

298
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,368
Your mother sounds tough.

299
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:28,770
Not like you.

300
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:32,837
What am I like?

301
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,982
You? You're a sweetheart.

302
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:46,984
Astrid, honey?

303
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,559
Astrid?

304
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,159
You come on in here a minute?

305
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,042
Well, sit down. I won't bite.

306
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:13,681
You having fun here, aren't you? Making
yourself at home, getting comfortable?

307
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,717
Little too comfortable, I'd say.

308
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:24,755
I might not be a genius, but I get your
game. And it takes one to know one.

309
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,834
-One what?
-Always hanging around...

310
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:32,166
...handling his tools.
"What's this for, Ray? Can I help you?"

311
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,774
We're not doing anything.

312
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:37,640
I'm calling Children's Services.

313
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,609
-It's all over.
-But...

314
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,772
Don't "but" me.

315
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:47,647
He is a man. And he sees what he sees,
and he does what he can.

316
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,052
I've got a nice thing going here.

317
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:52,249
Ray's the best man I ever had.

318
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:56,124
And I've lived too long
and come too far to blow it now.

319
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:00,466
I never had a father...

320
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:02,296
Don't.

321
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:08,102
I've got myself and my kids to worry
about. We hardly know each other.

322
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:10,608
I don't owe you a thing.

323
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:18,817
-Jesus would give me a chance.
-Well, I'm not Jesus. Not even close.

324
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,225
He might be mad...

325
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:30,397
...if he knew you sent me away
because you were jealous.

326
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:35,699
You're trying to make him a prisoner.
He's gonna hate you.

327
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,601
What do you know?

328
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:43,266
I know that men don't like women
who try to own them.

329
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:49,677
I like you. I like the kids. I would
never do anything to screw it up.

330
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:55,247
You swear you're not
interested in him?

331
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:57,550
I swear to God.

332
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:06,795
-There. Did you see it?
-I'm not sure.

333
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:09,893
-See anything yet?
-It's just starting.

334
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,767
But we should be getting
40 an hour soon.

335
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,899
The Quadrantid is the shortest
meteorite shower, but the densest.

336
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,239
Except for the Perseids.

337
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:31,317
You and Starr, you having a beef?

338
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:35,519
No.

339
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,189
Why?

340
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:42,725
Just something she said.

341
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,469
I guess it's hard getting older...

342
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,507
...pretty girl coming up in the house.

343
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:59,582
Ray, honey? What are
you doing out here?

344
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,746
Nothing, baby.
Just having a smoke.

345
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:13,093
Looking at the stars.

346
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:23,543
And this is $40,
not even $40 a month.

347
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:27,078
-Forty dollars is $40.
-You waste $200 in one night.

348
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:30,376
-You've been doing it weekly.
-I won last week.

349
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:33,418
What else are you doing
with the money, Ray?

350
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:36,853
-You can't even look at me.
-I'm looking right at you.

351
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:40,619
You weren't. And you've got
your car out there.

352
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:43,286
God knows what you spend on that.

353
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:45,329
That comes out of my pocket.

354
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,066
-Don't ruin this.
-Ruin what?

355
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:50,136
You didn't come in till 3:00
in the morning.

356
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:53,967
-I was with John.
-She's drinking again.

357
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,667
And who else?
I saw you eyeing her.

358
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:16,862
Thought you all were
going to a movie.

359
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,124
I had a lot of homework.

360
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:25,996
-How come you aren't playing poker?
-The game got cancelled.

361
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:33,003
-They coming home soon?
-Not too long.

362
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,183
Well, there's plenty
of food if you want.

363
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:41,852
Thanks.

364
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:24,290
This isn't right.

365
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,816
Is everyone gone?

366
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:24,513
-It is my business! This is my house!
-It is not!

367
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:28,287
-Get out of my room!
-You abide by the laws I put down!

368
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:33,559
I am not gonna get out! I waited up for
you. I want to know who you were with!

369
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:36,828
Don't give me your shit.
You stayed up to drink.

370
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,770
-I stayed up to catch you, you whore!
-You should know.

371
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:46,480
Try it again,
I'll take you out, bitch.

372
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:52,648
Carolee! You walk out that door,
don't you bother coming back.

373
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,224
Why the hell would I want to? I've been
down this road with you before, Mom.

374
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,752
Sorry, Davey.
I can't go through this again.

375
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,528
Carolee.

376
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:22,147
You used to like it before you started
doing that bitch. Admit it, bastard!

377
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:24,541
-You're screwing her!
-You need to call your sponsor.

378
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,654
-Screw my sponsor!
-Go back to bed.

379
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:31,314
I should've gotten rid of her.
Know what I'm gonna do?

380
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,158
I'm gonna go in there
and cash her check.

381
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:39,163
Hey, Starr. Starr. Hey! Starr!
Give me that gun.

382
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,965
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Get off!

383
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:48,269
Starr! Starr!

384
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:53,438
Get off of me, goddamn it!
Get off of me!

385
00:38:53,614 --> 00:38:58,347
No, Ray! Goddamn it, Ray.
Get off of me!

386
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:20,699
No, don't cry. We're not like that.
We're the Vikings, remember?

387
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:25,777
Astrid? Can you talk to me? Astrid?

388
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:31,475
Astrid? Can you talk to me? Astrid.
Talk to me. Can you talk to me?

389
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:36,453
She's coming around. This boy saved
your life. If he hadn't called 911 ...

390
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,718
-...you'd be dead.
-Who did this to you, Astrid?

391
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:42,556
-Who shot you?
-I don't know.

392
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,499
Hey, watch your feet.

393
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,395
-Okay, rug.
-Got it.

394
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:55,339
-Where's Ray, Davey?
-He's gone. They're both gone.

395
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:01,243
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I ruined it.

396
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,509
Doesn't matter.
Something would have.

397
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,878
Bye, Astrid.

398
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:08,112
Okay. One step.

399
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,757
-Davey.
-We got you, Astrid.

400
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,593
Okay, step.

401
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:20,428
We got her.

402
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,803
It's okay. We got you.

403
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,277
We'd prefer to find a permanent place,
but we have so many children right now.

404
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:11,043
You need special attention,
which you'll get at McKinney Hall.

405
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,914
They have all sorts
of activities for kids.

406
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,261
You're dead, bitch!
You hear me? You're dead.

407
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:31,331
Don't ever look at my boyfriend
again. You hear me?

408
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:33,769
You look at my boyfriend,
you're dead!

409
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:53,611
Next time you and your friends jump me,
I'll cut your throats when you're sleeping.

410
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:15,165
-What do you want?
-I was looking at your picture.

411
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:18,109
It's good.

412
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,780
Who is it?

413
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:32,385
-How come you chopped off your hair?
-None of your business.

414
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:39,462
-You're still beautiful.
-Looks don't interest me.

415
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:44,028
That's easy for you to say.
You've never been ugly.

416
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:15,493
Look. It's the puta.
She's so ugly now.

417
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,507
You're not ugly.

418
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:08,317
You write as if you're surprised
to find me still beautiful even here.

419
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:11,754
Our beauty is our power, our strength.

420
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:15,793
We can't allow them
to change us, to lessen us.

421
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:22,266
I will never grant them that
satisfaction and neither should you.

422
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:34,402
So is this your first time in Mac?

423
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:39,284
Figured. You're so unfriendly.

424
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,821
-Life's easier without friends.
-Maybe. I like it here.

425
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:50,658
It's better than being in a foster home.
It's the floor you can't fall below.

426
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,829
-What's that?
-A letter.

427
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,738
-From who?
-My mother.

428
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:08,373
-And where is she?
-In prison. For murder.

429
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:12,814
-And your father?
-Don't know the guy.

430
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:17,821
How about you?

431
00:46:18,258 --> 00:46:19,850
They were junkies.

432
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,554
She OD'd when I was 6.
He disappeared a couple years later.

433
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,291
-I was born addicted to heroin.
-Really? What was that like?

434
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:31,302
I don't know. I was out of rehab
by the time I was six months old.

435
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:36,199
So...

436
00:46:38,612 --> 00:46:41,581
-What's the deal? Are you gay?
-What?

437
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:47,846
I don't know. I get this feeling from you,
like you're not interested in guys.

438
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,916
You're right. I'm not.

439
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:56,891
You think that's funny? I'm sick of this.
I'm not gonna let you do this again.

440
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,124
Why don't you shut up?
You're not even in this.

441
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,632
-Cut it out.
-She does this shit.

442
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,601
I'll beat your ass.
Wait until we get off the van.

443
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:09,298
-Back off.
-I'm gonna push you farther.

444
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,209
-What if they catch us?
-They'd put us in McKinney Hall.

445
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:19,511
-Hurry.
-Come on.

446
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,983
Come on, come on.

447
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:26,417
The guy's a genius.

448
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,226
I started out copying his stuff,
but no...

449
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:33,559
I could never touch him.

450
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,638
He's great. But you're better.

451
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,374
You're insane.

452
00:47:48,148 --> 00:47:53,279
No, I'm not. I mean, he's a great
cartoonist, but you're an artist.

453
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,712
What's the difference?

454
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:01,486
Well, that's like asking
why a joke is funny.

455
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:06,326
Either it's funny or it's not.
You're either an artist or you're not.

456
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,127
You are.

457
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:37,025
It's hard because they keep moving.
That's good.

458
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:40,132
Don't look. I'm not done.

459
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:50,729
-There's another one. Do you see it?
-Yeah.

460
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,410
The Lyrids shower is visible
most of the night.

461
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,176
The brightest star is Vega.

462
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:09,715
But you can't look right at it
or you'll miss the fainter meteors.

463
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,324
You can trace them back to Lyra.

464
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:17,060
How do you know all that?

465
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,564
A kid I used to know.

466
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:37,808
I used to have a foster home
right over there.

467
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:45,889
It's nice living on the beach.

468
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:55,595
Do you ever think about your father?

469
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,232
Not really. He was an asshole.

470
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:08,543
I think about mine sometimes.

471
00:51:10,383 --> 00:51:12,749
That when I'm an artist...

472
00:51:12,919 --> 00:51:17,356
...he'll read about me in the papers
and he'll want to meet me.

473
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:27,833
I'm not gay.

474
00:51:30,737 --> 00:51:32,170
I know that.

475
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,232
I'll show you the one
that he did of me.

476
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,739
It's right here.

477
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:15,146
They're not bad, for what they are.

478
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:19,911
For what they are?
What are they?

479
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,747
Cartoons.

480
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,780
No, they're not.

481
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:29,224
They're so much more than that.
I mean, he's really talented.

482
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:32,293
-Don't do it again, Astrid.
-Do what?

483
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:37,393
Attach yourself to anyone who
shows you the least bit of attention...

484
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,471
...because you're Ionely.

485
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,237
Loneliness is the human condition.
No one is ever going to fill that space.

486
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:50,941
The best you can do is know yourself.
Know what you want.

487
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:54,177
And don't let the cattle
get in the way.

488
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,854
You're not talking about me.
You're talking about yourself.

489
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,457
Sometimes I get the feeling you
don't even want me to be happy.

490
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,324
Why wouldn't I want you to be happy?

491
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:21,236
-Where are they sending you?
-I don't know.

492
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:26,375
Look.

493
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:33,292
The comic book store
will hold letters for me.

494
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,918
Wherever they take you,
keep checking there.

495
00:54:38,758 --> 00:54:42,057
Why do we have to go
to Mexico to buy this stuff?

496
00:54:42,228 --> 00:54:44,662
It isn't FDA approved.

497
00:54:46,633 --> 00:54:50,535
-What's it called?
-DMSO.

498
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:57,334
-What's it for?
-All sorts of things.

499
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:07,947
You'll like these people. She's an actress
and he does something with television.

500
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:14,052
-Do they have any kids?
-No. They're looking to adopt.

501
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:08,439
She's had an incredibly hard time.

502
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,847
She's very smart.
She's just missed a lot of school.

503
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:17,349
-You don't have to decide immediately.
-Okay.

504
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:19,992
Just talk to her.

505
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,618
If you're uncomfortable
in any way, just let me know.

506
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:40,034
There you are.

507
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,080
I'm really sorry Mark couldn't be here
to meet you. He's filming in Nova Scotia.

508
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,321
Well, this is it.
I left it plain on purpose...

509
00:56:52,491 --> 00:56:57,326
...because I thought that way, you know,
you could put your own things up.

510
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:02,723
-I like the Dürer watercolor.
-You know who Dürer is?

511
00:57:03,235 --> 00:57:07,194
-My mother's an artist.
-Oh, that's right. Of course.

512
00:57:07,372 --> 00:57:13,174
Of course. They said that. Hey, listen.
Do you want some tea or something?

513
00:57:13,345 --> 00:57:18,942
Or Pepsi. I bought Pepsi. I didn't know
what you'd drink. We have juice.

514
00:57:19,117 --> 00:57:23,417
I could make you a smoothie, if you like.
Would you like a smoothie?

515
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:24,953
Tea is fine.

516
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:34,755
Okay. I look, I look. Stop. Look...

517
00:57:37,569 --> 00:57:39,298
And now I die.

518
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:48,778
-You were really good.
-Do you know what a nightmare it is?

519
00:57:48,947 --> 00:57:53,384
I mean, you spend all this time
getting ready, ages getting ready...

520
00:57:53,552 --> 00:57:57,488
...drag yourself to this audition.
They look at you for two seconds...

521
00:57:57,689 --> 00:58:03,389
...and tell you that you're too ethnic,
or too classic, too something.

522
00:58:03,595 --> 00:58:05,495
Too ethnic?

523
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:11,000
It means brunette.
And too classic means old.

524
00:58:11,169 --> 00:58:15,697
And too small, breasts.

525
00:58:17,342 --> 00:58:22,006
-Why do you do it, then?
-What? Give up show business?

526
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:40,027
Come on!

527
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:55,772
-Well, here. To your first run at the beach.
-Never again.

528
00:58:56,481 --> 00:59:00,212
-How's your shoulder? You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

529
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:04,321
No, you did really well.
You did really, really well.

530
00:59:18,637 --> 00:59:20,332
What was...

531
00:59:20,605 --> 00:59:24,302
...the best day of your life?

532
00:59:29,881 --> 00:59:31,473
Today.

533
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:38,716
-What should we do later?
-I don't know. What do you want to do?

534
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,824
Swim?

535
00:59:41,259 --> 00:59:42,817
Okay.

536
00:59:44,729 --> 00:59:46,560
Oh, my God!

537
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:49,530
He's back early.

538
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,439
Mark.

539
00:59:57,142 --> 00:59:58,200
Hey.

540
01:00:00,445 --> 01:00:02,140
Hi.

541
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:14,322
You must be Astrid.

542
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,920
It took us three hours to get him back.

543
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:22,590
The whole film crew's in there.
He still almost chickens out.

544
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:26,965
I think he thought it was gonna
come back and finish him off.

545
01:00:27,138 --> 01:00:30,107
-What would you have done if it had?
-Ducked.

546
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:31,970
Come on.

547
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:36,139
Okay, here we go.

548
01:00:36,314 --> 01:00:40,045
Perfect. Just, just right there.
Thanks.

549
01:00:48,093 --> 01:00:50,084
-Well, cheers.
-Cheers.

550
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:52,286
Cheers, Astrid.

551
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:56,594
So we've got some catching up to do.

552
01:00:56,768 --> 01:00:59,328
Claire tells me you're quite an artist.

553
01:00:59,904 --> 01:01:02,498
-Not really...
-She's wonderful.

554
01:01:02,674 --> 01:01:07,168
In fact, Tricia Day accepted Astrid
for one of her watercolor classes.

555
01:01:07,345 --> 01:01:10,143
-At the museum?
-She loves Astrid's work.

556
01:01:10,315 --> 01:01:13,011
You should show him.

557
01:01:19,591 --> 01:01:21,957
They're really, really beautiful.

558
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:24,994
She's never even studied.
She's self-taught.

559
01:01:25,163 --> 01:01:27,063
Is that right?

560
01:01:34,439 --> 01:01:35,599
Is she all right?

561
01:01:41,946 --> 01:01:44,676
-I know you're perfect.
-I'm not perfect.

562
01:01:44,849 --> 01:01:47,215
Of course you are.
You're my daughter.

563
01:01:47,385 --> 01:01:48,943
Hey.

564
01:01:49,954 --> 01:01:53,720
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Just thinking.

565
01:01:58,263 --> 01:02:01,926
-Are you getting my letters?
-Yes.

566
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,228
-I can never be sure.
-I get them.

567
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,066
Why doesn't she have any children?

568
01:02:12,243 --> 01:02:14,711
She can't have them.

569
01:02:15,747 --> 01:02:17,305
You dress like her now.

570
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:23,553
She takes me shopping.

571
01:02:26,224 --> 01:02:28,624
What's her husband like?

572
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:32,529
He's nice.

573
01:02:32,697 --> 01:02:35,165
He's gone a lot.

574
01:02:36,801 --> 01:02:40,168
So you spend most
of your time with Claire?

575
01:02:41,773 --> 01:02:43,263
Yeah.

576
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:46,100
I'd like to meet her.

577
01:02:47,045 --> 01:02:48,342
Why?

578
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:52,108
Because you don't want me to.

579
01:02:57,689 --> 01:03:00,283
Who did this belong to?

580
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:05,161
That was my great aunt's
on my father's side.

581
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:09,460
She was a field nurse at Ypres.
Very, very brave woman.

582
01:03:09,968 --> 01:03:12,436
It's pretty, isn't it?

583
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,205
-And whose was this?
-It was my mother's.

584
01:03:19,377 --> 01:03:24,872
My father gave it to her.
My parents were completely inseparable.

585
01:03:25,316 --> 01:03:27,546
Not at all like Mark and I.

586
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:33,579
I hate it when he has
to go away for so long.

587
01:03:35,493 --> 01:03:39,429
-Why don't you go with him?
-He says it slows him down.

588
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:49,439
-I think it's because he's having an affair.
-He wouldn't have an affair.

589
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:51,905
He loves you.

590
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:57,275
Yeah, I know. If he did,
I would never know about it.

591
01:03:57,448 --> 01:03:59,439
You're just being paranoid.

592
01:03:59,617 --> 01:04:05,317
Yeah, that's what he says.
That can be very negative.

593
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,864
-Should I put this here?
-Yeah, perfect.

594
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,406
Everything ready inside?

595
01:04:30,949 --> 01:04:34,783
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-In the morning.

596
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,419
I bet Claire would
love to go with you.

597
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:44,085
Coordinating our schedules is difficult.

598
01:04:44,262 --> 01:04:47,720
She's not working.
I mean, she could fit into yours.

599
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:52,336
What about you?
Doesn't she need to be here for you?

600
01:04:53,137 --> 01:04:54,399
Yeah.

601
01:04:56,207 --> 01:05:01,304
How is she these days, when I'm gone?
She okay?

602
01:05:01,479 --> 01:05:03,071
She's fine.

603
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:05,738
-Why do you ask?
-No reason.

604
01:05:27,372 --> 01:05:29,840
You're back early.

605
01:05:31,943 --> 01:05:35,003
How long has my mother
been writing you?

606
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:40,242
Not long. We've only written
to each other a couple of times.

607
01:05:40,418 --> 01:05:43,683
-Why didn't you tell me?
-She asked me not to.

608
01:05:45,056 --> 01:05:48,651
Well, she thought
that you wouldn't like it.

609
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:56,357
Her letter was so powerful.

610
01:05:56,534 --> 01:05:58,502
She's so strong.

611
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:02,902
And God, she's talented.

612
01:06:05,843 --> 01:06:07,435
We'd like to meet.

613
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:12,542
Whose idea was that?

614
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,212
Mine.

615
01:06:15,953 --> 01:06:18,148
I bet.

616
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:23,918
-You know, I really love your work.
-What have you seen?

617
01:06:24,262 --> 01:06:26,594
Astrid showed me the collages...

618
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:29,995
...and some of your earlier work
in the catalogues.

619
01:06:30,168 --> 01:06:33,262
Oh, I love the Polaroid installation.

620
01:06:33,438 --> 01:06:35,303
Really? Why?

621
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:39,273
I don't know.

622
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:42,111
Well, because...

623
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,578
Well, because it's great.

624
01:06:46,451 --> 01:06:52,287
-I'm actually very visual myself.
-A kindred spirit.

625
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:57,257
It must be difficult
for you to work here.

626
01:06:58,429 --> 01:07:02,490
It is. I spend so much time
fighting off sexual advances...

627
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:04,794
...I hardly have time to think.

628
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:09,265
That was a joke.

629
01:07:13,077 --> 01:07:17,741
-Jailbird humor is hard to get sometimes.
-Sorry.

630
01:07:18,483 --> 01:07:21,145
So, you're an actress.

631
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:26,354
-So glamorous.
-No, my career is a disaster.

632
01:07:26,924 --> 01:07:31,327
I think it's the process.
It, you know, may be too painful for me.

633
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:34,090
You're such a sensitive person, it's...

634
01:07:34,265 --> 01:07:38,099
All that rejection has gotta be hard
on your self-esteem.

635
01:07:38,269 --> 01:07:43,400
I'm a typical Pisces, but that's
why Astrid and I get on so well.

636
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:47,200
Scorpio and Pisces
understand each other.

637
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:49,312
You're into astrology?

638
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:54,281
She's not into astrology
just because she knows our signs.

639
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:59,519
Astrid and I
used to understand each other.

640
01:07:59,857 --> 01:08:02,621
But she's become so secretive.

641
01:08:02,794 --> 01:08:08,494
Astrid isn't secretive at all.
We talk about everything, all the time.

642
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:12,433
We just love her.

643
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:14,969
She's doing so well.

644
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:17,004
She's on the honor roll...

645
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:21,839
...and we're just working to keep
that old grade point average up.

646
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:25,210
Put a pyramid over her desk.
It improves memory.

647
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:29,615
-My memory's fine.
-A pyramid? I hadn't thought of that.

648
01:08:29,787 --> 01:08:32,585
I do practice feng shui, though.

649
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:35,686
You never mentioned that
in your letters.

650
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,990
How about your husband?
Is he into feng shui as well?

651
01:08:41,132 --> 01:08:44,158
No, he's into frequent flier miles.

652
01:08:44,335 --> 01:08:47,270
He's gone half the time.

653
01:08:47,605 --> 01:08:52,133
That's not so bad, you know?
And now that I have Astrid...

654
01:08:54,045 --> 01:08:56,878
She must be a great comfort to you...

655
01:08:57,048 --> 01:09:00,575
...not being able to have children
of your own.

656
01:09:01,986 --> 01:09:05,251
Yeah. Yeah. She is.

657
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:15,556
Would you mind letting us
talk alone, sweetie?

658
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,491
Grown-up things.

659
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:23,568
-Don't we have to go?
-No, it's okay.

660
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:25,475
We have time.

661
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:47,163
Love humiliates you.

662
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:49,697
Hatred cradles you.

663
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:52,264
It's soothing.

664
01:09:54,372 --> 01:09:56,272
What did you say to her?

665
01:09:57,174 --> 01:10:00,439
She's having trouble
with her husband.

666
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:04,911
It's not you, is it? I know you
have an attraction for older men.

667
01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:07,676
No, it's not me.

668
01:10:07,852 --> 01:10:10,480
-You leave her alone.
-But it's such fun.

669
01:10:11,055 --> 01:10:12,784
Easy, but fun.

670
01:10:12,957 --> 01:10:16,393
In my present situation
I have to get fun where I can.

671
01:10:18,029 --> 01:10:21,123
God, how can you stand
to live with poor Claire?

672
01:10:21,299 --> 01:10:25,429
Did you know there's an entire order
called the Poor Clares?

673
01:10:25,603 --> 01:10:28,333
She is a genuinely nice person.

674
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:34,008
You don't know what it's been like.

675
01:10:34,178 --> 01:10:37,306
-lf you love me, you'll help me.
-Help you?

676
01:10:41,152 --> 01:10:46,920
I would rather see you in the worst kind
of foster hell than living with that woman.

677
01:10:47,491 --> 01:10:50,051
What can you possibly learn from her?

678
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:52,428
How to pine artistically?

679
01:10:53,764 --> 01:10:57,530
Twenty-seven names for tears?

680
01:10:59,904 --> 01:11:02,805
All I can say is...

681
01:11:04,442 --> 01:11:07,411
...keep your bags packed.

682
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:12,472
I don't feel like it.
I'm a stranger in my own house.

683
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,676
You live here
and I stay here once in a while.

684
01:11:15,853 --> 01:11:18,583
-Maybe if you gave a little bit.
-I give.

685
01:11:18,756 --> 01:11:22,192
Why can't I give to her,
why can't I be here?

686
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,592
-Because I work! Because I have a job.
-That's not fair.

687
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:30,096
I give you everything you ask for
and it's not enough.

688
01:11:30,267 --> 01:11:33,759
No, not everything.
Not everything.

689
01:11:33,938 --> 01:11:36,600
You promised things would change.

690
01:11:36,774 --> 01:11:41,734
-Mark, I'm trying, you know I'm trying.
-Trying's not good enough.

691
01:11:41,912 --> 01:11:45,143
You're falling apart.
We are back to where we started.

692
01:11:45,316 --> 01:11:50,413
It is not working out
and I think we should send her back.

693
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:52,849
You can't just send her back.

694
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:55,993
-Where's she gonna go?
-They'll find someplace.

695
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:00,392
You're gonna send her away?
You take everything away, don't you?

696
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:05,365
-You just leave me with nothing.
-Jesus Christ, you are such a bad actress.

697
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:08,266
I really almost forgot.

698
01:12:09,373 --> 01:12:12,308
Okay, okay.

699
01:12:12,676 --> 01:12:16,271
All right, I'll send her back, okay?
We can try that.

700
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:19,610
Just don't go, okay?
Just don't leave me.

701
01:12:20,184 --> 01:12:23,745
Unlike you, Claire, I work.
Remember?

702
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:27,851
And she going with you,
your girlfriend?

703
01:12:28,759 --> 01:12:31,284
I've had it with this, Claire.

704
01:12:32,096 --> 01:12:34,189
I've really had it.

705
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:40,636
Astrid?

706
01:13:00,357 --> 01:13:01,483
Astrid.

707
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:09,493
Astrid, please.

708
01:13:44,902 --> 01:13:46,597
Claire?

709
01:13:48,739 --> 01:13:51,037
Are you awake?

710
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:06,447
I'm sorry.

711
01:14:08,058 --> 01:14:09,525
Are you all right?

712
01:14:11,595 --> 01:14:13,153
Yeah.

713
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:20,062
Take my advice.
Stay away from broken people.

714
01:14:22,206 --> 01:14:23,867
You can't send me back.

715
01:14:25,176 --> 01:14:27,371
He's not coming back, Astrid.

716
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,547
He's gonna divorce me.

717
01:14:32,716 --> 01:14:37,085
You know, Claire,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

718
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:46,855
I'm cold.

719
01:14:48,499 --> 01:14:50,763
Real cold.

720
01:14:52,503 --> 01:14:54,903
Here. Get in here with me.

721
01:14:55,072 --> 01:14:57,370
Come on.

722
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:06,046
Okay.

723
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:10,286
Stay with me, okay?

724
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:17,723
Stay with me, please.

725
01:15:31,642 --> 01:15:33,109
Claire.

726
01:15:36,847 --> 01:15:38,542
Claire.

727
01:15:59,603 --> 01:16:01,901
Claire, wake up! Claire!

728
01:16:04,808 --> 01:16:06,400
God!

729
01:16:13,884 --> 01:16:16,512
Claire, please.

730
01:16:19,523 --> 01:16:21,855
No!

731
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:45,039
Astrid.

732
01:17:10,441 --> 01:17:12,102
What is it?

733
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:13,799
I'm back in Mac.

734
01:17:13,977 --> 01:17:16,537
-Didn't they tell you?
-No.

735
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:18,981
Claire's dead.

736
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:21,743
She killed herself.

737
01:17:22,186 --> 01:17:24,814
-I'm sorry.
-No, you're not.

738
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:31,821
-You poisoned her too, but with words.
-I told her what she already knew.

739
01:17:32,162 --> 01:17:34,221
You were just jealous.

740
01:17:34,398 --> 01:17:38,926
Of course I was jealous.
I live in a cell with a woman...

741
01:17:39,103 --> 01:17:43,472
...who has a vocabulary of 25 words.

742
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:46,066
Why do you think they got you?

743
01:17:46,477 --> 01:17:50,072
To create a perfect family?
People get babies for that.

744
01:17:50,247 --> 01:17:52,738
Not teenagers recovering
from bullet wounds.

745
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:56,647
You were on suicide watch. Don't think
it's the first time she tried it.

746
01:17:57,054 --> 01:18:00,023
It's just the first time
she pulled it off.

747
01:18:01,392 --> 01:18:04,293
I'm not coming back.

748
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:07,123
I wanted to tell you that in person.

749
01:18:07,297 --> 01:18:09,527
I'm gonna leave you here, alone.

750
01:18:13,804 --> 01:18:15,863
I know you think I'm cruel.

751
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:18,769
I'm trying to protect you
from those people.

752
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:23,436
Those people are not the enemy,
Mother. We are. You and me.

753
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:27,107
They don't hurt us.
We hurt them.

754
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:46,795
You still ignoring me?

755
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:55,973
I turn 18 Saturday.
I'm going to New York.

756
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:58,780
I want you to come with me.

757
01:18:58,949 --> 01:19:00,814
I can't.

758
01:19:00,984 --> 01:19:05,045
Sure you can. Just leave.

759
01:19:18,302 --> 01:19:20,702
Is it your mother?

760
01:19:28,946 --> 01:19:30,607
Come on.

761
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:35,184
I'll get a job. We'll find a place to live.
We'll be like we always talked about.

762
01:19:35,352 --> 01:19:40,790
I don't wanna go to New York.
I don't wanna be with you.

763
01:20:13,557 --> 01:20:17,493
She was with us for three years.
Her parents took her back.

764
01:20:17,995 --> 01:20:20,520
We think you'd really like it with us.

765
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:24,133
There are lots of kids your age
in our neighborhood.

766
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:30,602
Excuse me.

767
01:20:34,678 --> 01:20:39,843
Look. Don't worry about it.
She's had a very hard time recently.

768
01:20:40,017 --> 01:20:43,612
Let me just go talk to her, okay?
You're doing fine.

769
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:50,989
So, what's wrong this time?

770
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:53,755
I'm too old for them.

771
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,666
Look, the Greenways are great.

772
01:21:01,605 --> 01:21:05,837
They've got a nice house
with an extra bedroom for you.

773
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:08,744
They go to church.

774
01:21:08,912 --> 01:21:10,470
Schools are good.

775
01:21:10,647 --> 01:21:15,141
They don't smoke.
He makes his own beer.

776
01:21:17,054 --> 01:21:18,385
I want her.

777
01:21:29,466 --> 01:21:32,902
Workers of the world, arise.

778
01:21:35,072 --> 01:21:41,500
You've got nothing to lose but Visa card,
Happy Meal, and Kotex with wings.

779
01:21:44,348 --> 01:21:46,248
Christ, Thursday.

780
01:21:54,825 --> 01:21:59,558
-Hey, lazy cows, you want smoke?
-I quit for the baby, Rena.

781
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:03,029
Why? You don't keep it, thank God.

782
01:22:04,768 --> 01:22:07,566
Hey, you, cheerleader.
You want smoke?

783
01:22:07,738 --> 01:22:10,571
Russian cigarettes. No cancer.

784
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:32,523
Clothes.

785
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:39,726
-That really is a nice color.
-It's gorgeous.

786
01:22:42,406 --> 01:22:46,206
-What's it made of?
-I don't know.

787
01:22:46,376 --> 01:22:49,607
Why don't you just try it on
and see how you look?

788
01:22:50,013 --> 01:22:52,982
-It's really nice.
-Okay, thank you.

789
01:22:53,517 --> 01:22:57,476
Hey, that's my dress.
These are all mine.

790
01:22:57,654 --> 01:23:02,785
So? You get good price for them.
What do you need expensive clothes for?

791
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:06,827
-Melrose Place call you to be a star?
-Someone gave them to me.

792
01:23:06,997 --> 01:23:10,455
Even better. All profit.
That's why I love this country.

793
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:13,597
Because it loves money
like I love money.

794
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:17,763
-Hey. You make a price, I take 25%%.
-No.

795
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:22,667
What, you think you're gonna sell it
all by yourself?

796
01:23:22,846 --> 01:23:29,251
I pay for stall, storage, gas. They pay you,
you pay me. You still make profit.

797
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,544
Hey.

798
01:23:32,189 --> 01:23:36,523
Dead person who give you thing
don't care. The past is gone.

799
01:23:36,693 --> 01:23:40,686
Sentimental is stupid.
It's smart to make money.

800
01:23:41,998 --> 01:23:45,490
There's no price. How about $20?

801
01:23:45,669 --> 01:23:48,866
It's a Marc Jacobs dress.
It's been worn once.

802
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,502
-Fifty?
-A hundred.

803
01:23:56,613 --> 01:24:00,049
Thank you. Let's go.

804
01:24:02,753 --> 01:24:04,744
-How was last night?
-It was fun.

805
01:24:04,921 --> 01:24:06,411
-Yeah?
-What'd you do?

806
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:09,923
-Watched TV.
-Who were you with last night?

807
01:24:10,093 --> 01:24:11,754
-You know who I saw?
-Who?

808
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:13,896
I saw Danny.

809
01:24:14,064 --> 01:24:17,090
-Don't you think Astrid would like him?
-No.

810
01:24:17,267 --> 01:24:19,064
Astrid?

811
01:24:21,271 --> 01:24:24,672
-I'm Hannah. This is Julie.
-Hi.

812
01:24:24,841 --> 01:24:28,641
We went to your house.
The lady said you'd be here, so...

813
01:24:28,812 --> 01:24:30,837
We visit your mother.

814
01:24:31,014 --> 01:24:34,381
She's our project
in Women's Studies.

815
01:24:35,585 --> 01:24:38,577
-What does she want?
-She didn't send us.

816
01:24:38,755 --> 01:24:40,188
We came on our own.

817
01:24:40,357 --> 01:24:44,589
She asked us to mail you
the interview, her show at Bergamot.

818
01:24:45,128 --> 01:24:48,188
We thought we could deliver it
and see if maybe...

819
01:24:48,365 --> 01:24:51,391
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

820
01:24:54,437 --> 01:24:56,302
Excuse me.

821
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:02,872
-What do you talk about?
-All kinds of things. Art, music...

822
01:25:03,513 --> 01:25:05,481
She talks about you.

823
01:25:05,649 --> 01:25:07,048
Really?

824
01:25:08,852 --> 01:25:10,581
What does she say?

825
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:13,381
Well, that you're in a...

826
01:25:13,557 --> 01:25:16,526
You know, fostered.

827
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:21,353
Look, she feels really terrible
about what's happened.

828
01:25:21,531 --> 01:25:24,932
So you thought you'd come out
and what? Adopt me?

829
01:25:27,838 --> 01:25:30,932
You don't think she killed him,
do you?

830
01:25:32,142 --> 01:25:34,372
Something you should know.

831
01:25:34,544 --> 01:25:37,274
She did. I was there.

832
01:25:40,483 --> 01:25:43,975
Oleander's poisonous.
I don't know why people grow it.

833
01:25:44,354 --> 01:25:47,585
-Open the door!
-How dare you? You have no right!

834
01:25:47,757 --> 01:25:51,784
They can't keep me.
Don't worry, I'll be back in an hour!

835
01:26:38,275 --> 01:26:40,334
Who is that?

836
01:26:41,945 --> 01:26:43,606
I don't know.

837
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:47,409
-You draw her all the time.
-I think her name was Annie.

838
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:51,918
She's someone I remember.
I don't know who she was.

839
01:26:55,392 --> 01:26:57,917
Check it out, you guys.

840
01:26:58,094 --> 01:27:00,619
Rodeo Drive refugee.

841
01:27:00,897 --> 01:27:03,263
Excuse me, are you Rena Gruschenko?

842
01:27:03,433 --> 01:27:06,891
Gruschenka. If you come from INS,
I have a green card.

843
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:10,597
I have been all over this junkyard
looking for you.

844
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:17,369
You must be Astrid. I'm Susan Valeris,
your mother's lawyer.

845
01:27:21,051 --> 01:27:22,575
Cigarette?

846
01:27:25,822 --> 01:27:28,382
-Don't know why I never quit.
-I do.

847
01:27:28,692 --> 01:27:32,025
All the prisoners smoke.
You can offer them one.

848
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:35,221
Your mother's proud of you
for not quitting school.

849
01:27:35,398 --> 01:27:39,835
You graduate soon. Are you making
any plans for your future?

850
01:27:40,003 --> 01:27:43,700
Yeah. I thought I'd be
a criminal lawyer.

851
01:27:44,174 --> 01:27:45,198
Really?

852
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:49,539
Either that or a hooker
or garbage collector.

853
01:27:50,413 --> 01:27:52,938
Your mother said you'd be difficult.

854
01:27:53,116 --> 01:27:57,678
-Mother knows best.
-You've been through a terrible ordeal.

855
01:27:57,854 --> 01:28:02,621
Three foster homes, the shooting,
the suicide of a foster mother.

856
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:04,783
I understand you were close.

857
01:28:04,961 --> 01:28:08,658
Did you ask your client
about her involvement with that?

858
01:28:08,832 --> 01:28:12,893
You can't blame her for the death
of a woman she met once.

859
01:28:13,069 --> 01:28:15,503
But I do blame her, Susan.

860
01:28:15,672 --> 01:28:18,505
That's pretty cynical, Astrid.

861
01:28:18,942 --> 01:28:22,309
You want me to lie for her
in court, is that it?

862
01:28:23,313 --> 01:28:26,146
Why do you hate her, Astrid?

863
01:28:27,484 --> 01:28:30,009
Because you think
she committed murder?

864
01:28:30,186 --> 01:28:32,177
Or because you feel abandoned?

865
01:28:32,822 --> 01:28:35,290
Talk to her. People do change.

866
01:28:37,227 --> 01:28:42,392
You should hear the way she talks
about you. She worries about you.

867
01:28:43,133 --> 01:28:45,897
She asked me to find out
if there's anything you need.

868
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:48,867
Money for college? Car?

869
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:53,066
There's money behind her.
Just tell me what you want.

870
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:28,340
You are stupid girl.

871
01:29:29,779 --> 01:29:33,715
You walk away from money
to punish mother.

872
01:29:34,184 --> 01:29:35,481
You want car?

873
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,887
You want art college?
All costs money.

874
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:46,993
You don't know anything about this,
Rena, so just stay out of it.

875
01:29:51,434 --> 01:29:55,871
-I have plan for you, anyway.
-Yeah? What's that?

876
01:29:56,039 --> 01:29:58,371
Niki leave soon.

877
01:29:59,175 --> 01:30:01,609
And Yvonne is stupid girl.

878
01:30:01,778 --> 01:30:03,905
Making third baby.

879
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,414
Every time she look at the window
to see baby's face, baby gone.

880
01:30:08,585 --> 01:30:12,146
Then she cries
like it's a big surprise.

881
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:16,516
But you, you're a special girl.

882
01:30:19,696 --> 01:30:22,927
You stay, I make you partner.

883
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,630
Stay here?

884
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:30,403
What, you got better place to go?

885
01:30:36,446 --> 01:30:38,209
Then go see mother.

886
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:41,680
She need something from you,
you need something from her.

887
01:30:41,851 --> 01:30:43,580
Go get it.

888
01:30:48,992 --> 01:30:50,960
Here she comes.

889
01:30:59,636 --> 01:31:01,467
Astrid, my God!

890
01:31:01,638 --> 01:31:05,404
What's wrong, Mom?
You don't like my outfit?

891
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:09,979
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

892
01:31:22,759 --> 01:31:28,095
So, what's the story?
We didn't go to Mexico to buy DMSO?

893
01:31:28,264 --> 01:31:30,425
Barry beat you? He raped me?

894
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,502
How bad does he have to be
to get you out of jail?

895
01:31:34,671 --> 01:31:39,472
I can't believe what's happened to you.
When I get out, I'll make it up.

896
01:31:39,642 --> 01:31:42,406
Who said you're getting out?

897
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:46,777
I said I'd talk to you.
I didn't say I'd do it.

898
01:31:47,483 --> 01:31:49,542
Then what do you want?

899
01:31:49,719 --> 01:31:53,655
I have a deal to make. A trade.

900
01:31:55,124 --> 01:31:59,254
You tell me the truth,
I'll lie for you in court.

901
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:05,329
-The truth about what?
-Everything you kept from me.

902
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:09,699
-And if I don't?
-Then you can rot in here.

903
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:13,168
I hate this look, by the way.

904
01:32:13,343 --> 01:32:18,872
You're a Sunset Boulevard motel,
a $20 hooker in the back of a car.

905
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:25,610
Why did you murder Barry?

906
01:32:27,523 --> 01:32:30,549
If I submit to this, you'll testify?

907
01:32:30,727 --> 01:32:32,524
Yes.

908
01:32:35,431 --> 01:32:38,559
Self-defense. He was killing me.

909
01:32:40,303 --> 01:32:43,864
Claire did nothing to you.
Why'd you go after her?

910
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:48,306
Claire went after herself.
I just showed her how to do it.

911
01:32:51,014 --> 01:32:52,743
Who was my father?

912
01:32:54,851 --> 01:32:58,252
Why do you always ask that?
It's ancient history.

913
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:01,254
It's my ancient history.
Who was he?

914
01:33:02,425 --> 01:33:04,893
His name was Klaus Anders.

915
01:33:05,061 --> 01:33:07,996
-What'd he do?
-He was an artist.

916
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:12,532
How did you meet?

917
01:33:12,702 --> 01:33:16,661
At Venice Beach, at a party.
He had the drugs.

918
01:33:18,508 --> 01:33:20,669
Did you love him?

919
01:33:21,311 --> 01:33:24,576
It was a long time ago.
I'm not the same person.

920
01:33:24,747 --> 01:33:29,241
Liar. You're exactly the same.
Answer the question.

921
01:33:29,419 --> 01:33:32,911
You're such a child,
taking my propaganda for truth.

922
01:33:33,089 --> 01:33:35,956
So set me straight.
Did you love him?

923
01:33:38,995 --> 01:33:43,329
We had a very sexual relationship.
One overlooks many things.

924
01:33:43,499 --> 01:33:46,468
You worshipped him.
I read it in your journal.

925
01:33:46,636 --> 01:33:51,403
"Worship" isn't exactly the word
we're looking for here.

926
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:54,100
Who is Annie?

927
01:33:55,545 --> 01:33:56,569
What?

928
01:33:56,746 --> 01:33:59,374
Who is Annie, Mother?

929
01:34:04,487 --> 01:34:08,548
She was a neighbor who took in kids,
did people's laundry.

930
01:34:08,858 --> 01:34:15,161
-What did she look like?
-Dark, curly hair, freckles.

931
01:34:16,566 --> 01:34:19,160
Did she take care of me?

932
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:28,940
How can you possibly
have remembered this?

933
01:34:35,885 --> 01:34:38,615
It will only hurt you.

934
01:34:43,559 --> 01:34:46,790
Imagine my life for a moment.

935
01:34:46,963 --> 01:34:53,027
How unprepared I was to be
the mother of a small child.

936
01:34:53,469 --> 01:34:59,169
I was used to having time to think
and you just wanted, wanted, wanted.

937
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:03,238
I felt like a hostage.

938
01:35:03,413 --> 01:35:06,644
Can you understand
how desperate I was?

939
01:35:20,496 --> 01:35:24,125
I dropped you off
at her house one afternoon...

940
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,963
...to go to the beach
with some friends.

941
01:35:28,905 --> 01:35:31,874
And one thing led to another.

942
01:35:33,509 --> 01:35:36,273
They had a place in Ensenada.

943
01:35:37,213 --> 01:35:39,408
It was wonderful.

944
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:41,611
You can't imagine.

945
01:35:41,784 --> 01:35:44,150
To take a nap in the afternoon...

946
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:48,723
...to make love all day if I wanted
and not have to think:

947
01:35:48,891 --> 01:35:52,657
What's Astrid doing? Where's Astrid?
Mommy, Mommy...

948
01:35:52,829 --> 01:35:55,127
...clinging to me like a spider.

949
01:35:55,298 --> 01:36:00,031
At the end, I just wanted
to throw you against a wall.

950
01:36:05,575 --> 01:36:07,941
How long were you gone?

951
01:36:10,613 --> 01:36:12,843
About a year.

952
01:36:13,649 --> 01:36:16,277
Give or take a few months.

953
01:36:17,487 --> 01:36:21,082
-My God.
-You're not asking the right question.

954
01:36:21,257 --> 01:36:25,921
Don't ask me why I left.
Ask me why I came back.

955
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:28,086
You should've been sterilized.

956
01:36:28,264 --> 01:36:31,256
I could've left you there
but I didn't.

957
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:35,564
Don't you understand?
For once, I did the right thing.

958
01:36:36,806 --> 01:36:39,468
When I came back, you knew me.

959
01:36:39,642 --> 01:36:44,944
You were sitting by the door.
You looked up and you reached for me.

960
01:36:45,114 --> 01:36:48,345
It was as if you'd been waiting
for me all along.

961
01:36:48,518 --> 01:36:52,511
I was always waiting for you.
That's the constant in my life.

962
01:36:52,688 --> 01:36:55,156
Waiting for you.
Will you come back?

963
01:36:55,324 --> 01:37:00,489
Will you forget that you tied me up in
front of a store or left me on a bus?

964
01:37:00,663 --> 01:37:03,427
-Are you still waiting?
-No.

965
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:08,833
I stopped when Claire showed me
what it felt like to be loved.

966
01:37:09,539 --> 01:37:12,770
What did you think?
That I would amuse you?

967
01:37:12,942 --> 01:37:15,342
That's what babies are like, Mother.

968
01:37:15,511 --> 01:37:18,503
Did you think we'd talk
about Joseph Brodsky?

969
01:37:18,681 --> 01:37:22,242
I thought Klaus and I would
live happily ever after.

970
01:37:22,418 --> 01:37:25,751
Adam and Eve in a
vine-covered shack. I was crazy.

971
01:37:25,922 --> 01:37:28,914
-You were in love with him.
-I was, all right?

972
01:37:29,091 --> 01:37:32,424
I was in love with him,
baby makes three and all that crap.

973
01:37:32,595 --> 01:37:34,927
Then why did you leave him?

974
01:37:35,097 --> 01:37:39,932
-Why did you leave him?
-I didn't leave him. He left me.

975
01:37:42,672 --> 01:37:45,232
You wanna know about your father?

976
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:48,844
He left us when you were
six months old for another woman.

977
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:53,812
I never saw him again until he came
looking for you when you were 8.

978
01:37:53,983 --> 01:37:56,247
-He came to see me?
-Yes, he did.

979
01:37:56,419 --> 01:38:01,880
But it was too late. Why should I let
him see you after what he did to me?

980
01:38:02,058 --> 01:38:06,654
It wasn't about you! It was about me
and I wanted to see him!

981
01:38:06,829 --> 01:38:12,062
My whole life I've wanted to see him.
That decision was mine, not yours!

982
01:38:12,234 --> 01:38:16,364
Everything's always been about you,
never about me.

983
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:22,176
I knew you were gonna kill Barry,
but you didn't even care.

984
01:38:22,345 --> 01:38:26,145
You didn't give a damn
about what that would do to me.

985
01:38:27,149 --> 01:38:30,141
I'll say whatever Susan wants,
but I gotta go.

986
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:35,154
You don't just walk away from me.
I made you. I'm in your blood.

987
01:38:35,324 --> 01:38:39,090
You don't go anywhere
until I let you go.

988
01:38:39,261 --> 01:38:41,661
Then let me go.

989
01:38:46,268 --> 01:38:51,262
You look at me
and you don't like what you see.

990
01:38:52,108 --> 01:38:57,273
But this is the price, Mother.
The price of belonging to you.

991
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,772
If I could, I'd take it all back.

992
01:39:02,318 --> 01:39:04,252
I would.

993
01:39:06,222 --> 01:39:09,885
Then tell me you don't
want me to testify.

994
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,252
Tell me you don't want me like this.

995
01:39:18,768 --> 01:39:22,204
Tell me you would sacrifice
the rest of your life...

996
01:39:22,371 --> 01:39:25,431
...to have me back the way I was.

997
01:39:37,253 --> 01:39:40,279
Listen, forget it. A deal's a deal.

998
01:39:42,391 --> 01:39:44,484
Let's just leave it at that.

999
01:40:06,315 --> 01:40:09,773
Excuse me.
It's probably a waste of time...

1000
01:40:09,952 --> 01:40:15,083
...but I'm looking for someone who used
to come here. His name's Paul Trout.

1001
01:40:15,257 --> 01:40:17,623
-You Astrid?
-Yeah.

1002
01:40:26,936 --> 01:40:29,200
He said you'd turn up.

1003
01:40:33,509 --> 01:40:35,477
Thanks.

1004
01:42:05,067 --> 01:42:08,036
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

1005
01:42:13,909 --> 01:42:18,278
-Excuse me. Is it a recess?
-No. Jury's out.

1006
01:42:33,395 --> 01:42:36,330
Don't you need me to testify?

1007
01:42:37,399 --> 01:42:40,334
Your mother told me
to leave you alone.

1008
01:43:30,853 --> 01:43:32,718
What happened?

1009
01:43:35,891 --> 01:43:38,359
She let me go.

1010
01:43:56,045 --> 01:43:58,878
Two years after Paul and I
moved to New York...

1011
01:43:59,048 --> 01:44:01,812
...I received a letter
from my mother.

1012
01:44:01,984 --> 01:44:08,355
In it was the Los Angeles Times
Magazine, my mother on the cover.

1013
01:44:08,524 --> 01:44:12,290
A Santa Monica gallery had mounted
a showing of her work.

1014
01:44:12,461 --> 01:44:14,622
The Times included seven pages...

1015
01:44:14,797 --> 01:44:18,631
...of her hauntingly
distant prison collages.

1016
01:44:19,969 --> 01:44:26,340
She stares out from the cover,
the bars of her cell behind her.

1017
01:44:26,842 --> 01:44:28,605
Beautiful.

1018
01:44:28,777 --> 01:44:30,870
Dangerous.

1019
01:44:31,113 --> 01:44:33,047
Proud.

1020
01:44:34,216 --> 01:44:39,711
The Times said she was close to winning
a retrial after a first failed appeal.

1021
01:44:39,888 --> 01:44:43,153
They called her show a triumph.

1022
01:44:46,628 --> 01:44:52,089
It's too much to imagine her tempering
her joy with a moment of grief...

1023
01:44:52,267 --> 01:44:55,862
...a moment for what
that triumph had cost.

1024
01:44:56,705 --> 01:45:01,074
These suitcases are
a map of that country...

1025
01:45:01,243 --> 01:45:05,111
...a terrible country
I will never revisit.

1026
01:45:09,351 --> 01:45:11,319
Even so...

1027
01:45:12,521 --> 01:45:15,684
...I find myself thinking of her...

1028
01:45:16,358 --> 01:45:19,794
...wanting to feel that wind.

1029
01:45:21,296 --> 01:45:23,856
It's a secret wanting...

1030
01:45:24,133 --> 01:45:27,034
...like a song I can't stop humming...

1031
01:45:27,202 --> 01:45:30,660
...or loving someone
you can never have.

1032
01:45:34,843 --> 01:45:38,609
No matter how much
she's damaged me...

1033
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:42,741
...no matter how flawed she is...

1034
01:45:43,619 --> 01:45:46,952
...I know my mother loves me.

1035
01:49:22,437 --> 01:49:23,426
