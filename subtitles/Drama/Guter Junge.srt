2
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:32,556
A young man enters a taxi,

3
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:35,127
and starts the tour.

4
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:41,059
Then he sees a youngster behind the taxi,
speeding up to 130 km per hour.

5
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,102
The man states: Don't say
immediately 'pussy'.

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,802
But I have four kids at home.

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,702
So could you please be more careful?

8
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,934
You've four kids driving on a taxi at home?

9
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:52,009
And you are telling me to be more careful?

10
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:56,136
That's enough, Dieter, okay?

11
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,448
Is this okay?

12
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,406
Clear first the rubbish
from the rear seats.

13
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,095
Understood Chef.

14
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:29,356
How did the shift go?

15
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,055
How is your son doing?

16
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,976
Have you made a decision?

17
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,239
Yes!

18
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,742
Guter Junge (Aka: Good Boy)

19
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:14,582
This stuff was still in her car.

20
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,845
Not a lot has changed.

21
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,633
It's almost ten years since I
was here for the last time.

22
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:52,137
It was not because of Rita.

23
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,781
Where is he?

24
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:32,560
You still have your cave here?

25
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,593
Thanks.

26
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,612
Enjoy your meal.

27
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:34,589
I'm sorry about your mum.

28
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:57,699
How about a Hamburger like
those boys over there?

29
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,055
Yes?

30
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,514
Sorry. That's not going.
Ain't got the time now.

31
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,271
Can't you manage it on your own?

32
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:17,649
Damned... Yeah, okay. See you soon. Bye.

33
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:23,439
I have to go. Have to drive another tour.

34
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:24,943
These are yours now.

35
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:26,943
You know the way.

36
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,288
Oh. That light!

37
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,288
I am always getting ten years older.

38
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,058
The boy is sleeping.

39
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,826
I will have a look.

40
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,816
Locked.

41
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,036
Hey, Sven.

42
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,036
Let's toast to our new life.

43
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Hey, come!

44
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:49,470
Sven!

45
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,284
He's not talking with me any more.

46
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:57,273
Nah. What did you expect
after all these years?

47
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,205
That he immediately hugs you?

48
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,930
That would be the least, wouldn't it?

49
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,079
Achim. I did not cook.

50
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,079
But look how I am laying down.

51
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,553
You. Tell me honestly.

52
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,553
What do you think?

53
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:15,141
Can you imagine me as 'father'?

54
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:16,163
Yes.

55
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,163
I think you would be a wonderful father.

56
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,246
I'm afraid I'm a little out of experience.

57
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,518
You were never...

58
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:30,217
You know. We need first a
bigger apartment. Big.

59
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:30,955
Us?

60
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,097
Yes!

61
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:34,770
Eva is moving out her super apartment.
Really great.

62
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,874
We are now with the three of us.

63
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,551
You always had style.

64
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,470
I even can count till four.

65
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,198
Hallo.

66
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,898
Where is he?

67
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:07,549
He?

68
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,938
Do you mean your father?

69
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:13,458
He's just gone, already driving.

70
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,542
Are you also living here?

71
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,925
Would it be so bad?

72
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,651
Chronic lack of sleep?

73
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:34,249
Mmmm.

74
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,171
Should the little one not sleep through?

75
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:38,353
Come on, Dieter. Let it be.

76
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,488
Two taxi drivers are talking to each other.

77
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:42,900
Says the one to the other.

78
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,525
I'm at the bottom.

79
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:47,640
Are you lucky. With me,
water has reached my neck.

80
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,744
I think it is a good one.

81
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,962
Okay. Here comes the freight.

82
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:07,178
Where do you want to go?

83
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:08,836
Us?

84
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,836
Are there others?

85
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:13,889
We're going to the cinema.

86
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,539
Come on. I take you along for a while.

87
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,283
Come. Hurry up.

88
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,776
I've asthma.

89
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,152
Ah. I understand.

90
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,785
Sven says I could
nevertheless become an actor.

91
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:46,286
I got talent, isn't it, Sven?

92
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:50,426
So. Don't tell me that
Sven is your manager.

93
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,305
I have tutored him a little.

94
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,764
Why can't I come any longer?

95
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,615
I don't object.

96
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,980
You have to talk with Sven.

97
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,327
And with your parents of course.

98
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:07,087
Well. My mother doesn't care anyway.

99
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:09,377
She likes it when I am not around.

100
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,762
He also have no father.

101
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:40,208
Don't you have friends?

102
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:42,461
I mean. Of your own age?

103
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,750
What are you doing all day long?

104
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,750
Except going to the movies
or hanging in front of your computer?

105
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,219
I had friends, but I forced to move.

106
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:44,698
At first, I had jobs during studying.

107
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:48,648
And then you came and had suddenly
to feed a family.

108
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:52,205
In those days, I bought my first own taxi.

109
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,296
There stood 630.000 km. on the meter.

110
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:57,840
Sven. Inspecting your inheritance?

111
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:00,714
If your dad continues making debts,
there will be nothing left to inherit.

112
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:02,861
Na, Na, Na. We're not arrived there.

113
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,611
But it is close.

114
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,666
Do you want to overtake the shop?

115
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:09,282
Hey! The boy is great at school.
No need for become a taxi driver.

116
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:11,948
A good job for a student who quits.

117
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:26,438
So, start the engine on 'D'.

118
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,004
Release the brakes.

119
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:46,543
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

120
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,803
Almost!

121
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:52,897
I said, just a little bit.

122
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:57,660
And now reverse. Release slowly
the brakes, with feeling.

123
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,323
Excellent.

124
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:06,943
But your father is obvious right.

125
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,593
One never learns enough.

126
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,883
Dads are always right.

127
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,366
Did you know that?

128
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,677
Yeah.

129
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:21,541
Before I forget it.
At Saturday we have a party at our home.

130
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,541
I would be glad if you come also.

131
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,143
Don't let yourself holding back.

132
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,868
No. Never.

133
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:32,389
My son is just eleven,
but I got a daughter of your age.

134
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,750
Excuse me.

135
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:30,069
Won't be long.

136
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,463
As she leaned over the reeling, comma...

137
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:49,869
Yes?

138
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,068
She became dizzy

139
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:55,367
One comes home, expects no trouble,

140
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,685
and detects a real housewife

141
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:01,838
Must be a shock for you...

142
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,716
Could you also put my slippers here?

143
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:07,713
Of course. Did Rita do this all the time?

144
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,390
What are you looking?

145
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,184
How is it that I am looking then?

146
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,239
So comical...

147
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:17,228
You're nuts.

148
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:22,401
Stop.

149
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,002
Stop.

150
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,524
Don't let me disturb yo...

151
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,103
Where were we?

152
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:39,389
'Dizzy'.

153
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,982
In fact, his name is Rolf,
but I call him Rollmops.

154
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,001
Just for myself of course.

155
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,789
I don't like him very much.

156
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,290
Sometimes, he arrives at weekends.

157
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,905
Help yourself..

158
00:19:51,906 --> 00:19:53,147
Thanks.

159
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:59,763
If he is present, they
mostly lying in bed to fuck.

160
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:01,529
If you know what I mean.

161
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,961
Do we know?

162
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:05,031
No. I got no idea.

163
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:10,213
Sven. Doesn't it taste?

164
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:13,636
Could you not put off once
that horrible headset?

165
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:15,925
At least during meals?

166
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:23,079
Sven! Hello. I am talking to you...

167
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:27,154
Damned!

168
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:39,570
Anyway. 'Rollmops' wants her
to move in at his place.

169
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:42,862
But I ain't going to such a
place, bet my ass for it.

170
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:46,489
When is your mother picking you up?

171
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:50,559
But could I not sleep over at Sven?

172
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,775
Yeah. But I don't know if your mother...

173
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:55,642
She is fine with it.

174
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:58,051
Well, I am not.

175
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,966
I don't want that he stays here.

176
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,133
Why not?

177
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,142
Because!

178
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,902
New perfume?

179
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,921
It was a gift of you...

180
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,873
I thought you did not like it?

181
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:56,423
The moon looked down over his
deck of clouds at the flagrance.

182
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:58,253
Dumb ass.

183
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:03,848
How lucky to be loved and lucky love...
or something like that.

184
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,476
Or something like that.

185
00:22:05,477 --> 00:22:07,185
Yeah.

186
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,117
Tell me.

187
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:14,480
Do you know that your
son is shaving himself?

188
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:16,635
It's obvious. He will be eighteen soon.

189
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:23,545
- I mean everywhere. The legs.
- The arm pits, the pubic hair.

190
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,258
All are doing that nowadays.

191
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:30,259
How do you know anyway?

192
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,382
He forgot to lock the door.

193
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,328
Sure.

194
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:37,368
We will getting along with each other.

195
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:41,337
The same like we two are getting along.

196
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:43,221
We are making progress.

197
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:48,185
The way you are screaming at him.
That's almost normal.

198
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:51,000
He is a young lad. The
juices are streaming.

199
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,200
He is jacking off too. Really.

200
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,900
'If you know what I mean.'

201
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,000
He's jacking off like a world champion.

202
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:01,895
We got a dramatic rise in
the use of paper tissues.

203
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:06,256
I got the feeling there is
something wrong with him.

204
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,220
Julia. Cut it out.

205
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,220
Maybe he is gay.

206
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,800
The boy has recently lost his mother.
That's his trouble.

207
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:26,857
White man steps into a taxi and wants to have
a gorgeous mansion with a swimming pool.

208
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:33,152
Then he says 'super' and leads the pastor to a
hut, with a straw bed and things like that.

209
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,027
Man, Dieter. Think about the kids.

210
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:36,846
Come on. It's a normal joke.

211
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:37,661
I already knew this joke.

212
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:38,900
Really?

213
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:41,900
But the pastor complains:
'You are mixing things up.

214
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,900
All my life I preached and
worked in the house of God...

215
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
'Yeah', he said.

216
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:50,457
'But they all feel asleep
during your service,

217
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and prayed then in the taxi.'

218
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,161
I already knew this joke.

219
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:00,037
Oh, mum!

220
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:04,702
Your daughter is really cute.

221
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:06,662
What did you do to get such two cute kids?

222
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,662
I just followed my image.

223
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,837
Steak? Sausage?

224
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,935
Sausage. But small, and
a large one for Achim.

225
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,771
Jennifer has acquired an
apprenticeship at a solicitor.

226
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,170
Really? Super!

227
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:23,766
We are all so proud? Are
we not, my 'chicken'?

228
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,750
Leave the kid alone.

229
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,903
I have just told about the apprenticeship.

230
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,318
By the way. Where is Sven?

231
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:34,345
Leaving you there rotting.

232
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:35,892
I don't mind.

233
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:42,285
Oh no. This is a boys choir and
I don't like it. Such a shit.

234
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:43,564
Have you ever sung in a choir?

235
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,178
Everything okay?

236
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:46,514
Yeah.

237
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:49,926
Man. Will someone turn on some good music.

238
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,586
Careful Roland. It's my favourite disc.

239
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,998
Achim. Your boy has taste.

240
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:06,358
Sven, Lukas. Turn it somewhat down.

241
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:28,816
If Doris would not work too...

242
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:30,994
and only with my salary...

243
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,294
We could not even afford the house.

244
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,503
But at least you get paid every month.

245
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,961
Listen to the big entrepreneur.

246
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:38,440
Have you ever been at my house?

247
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:40,162
You had to support all of them ..

248
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,802
It will never be cheaper.

249
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:45,463
A temporary residence.
Nacked bulbs at the ceiling.

250
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:51,740
Everybody should be blessed
according his personality.

251
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:53,632
Hey Kordula.

252
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,026
You got nothing to drink.
Do you want another beer?

253
00:25:56,027 --> 00:25:58,521
No thanks. I'm not allowed.

254
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:02,884
Jennifer. Look if there is any
juice left in the cellar.

255
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:05,336
Sven. Come and help her.

256
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:08,189
Where did you left your 'prince', Kordula?

257
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,970
'Prince'?

258
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:13,662
Have you ever met an African
who isn't a 'prince'?

259
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:16,360
Gaston had to work.

260
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,837
So. When is the time?

261
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:23,021
If everything goes well,
the end of November.

262
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:25,974
And how about you two. Do you want it too?

263
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,922
Aaah... We are working on it.

264
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,420
Old man can't rush.

265
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:34,934
Man, Dieter. You are such a pain the ass.

266
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:37,533
Leave my colleague. He is absolutely right.

267
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:40,691
Yeah. You're really a terrible old man.

268
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:47,203
Just think. When the kid finishes school,
I will be sixty, over sixty.

269
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:49,752
As if kids always has to finish school.

270
00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:51,919
What would a kid with such an old father?

271
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,403
But there is nothing sadder
than childless couples.

272
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:59,855
You don't have to tell me
about the joy of father ship.

273
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:02,696
I am currently fully enjoying to be a
father. Sorry. WE are enjoying it.

274
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,422
No problem.

275
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:08,389
You can't ask for more.

276
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:14,389
One may dancing.

277
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,223
Okay, okay.

278
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,900
I plead guilty.

279
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,223
What's the charge?

280
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,223
I have tonight extremely enjoyed myself.

281
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:46,215
Sven?

282
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:50,225
Did not you notice how much shit
you are talking, as the night progress?

283
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:52,100
Why. I did not miscounted.

284
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:57,386
Forty-four plus eighteen, nineteen.
Such a child has to be made first.

285
00:27:58,568 --> 00:27:59,568
My God.

286
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,552
The paranoia you develop when
somebody comes close to you.

287
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:04,838
When you should take some responsibility.

288
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,403
You have never taken responsibility
in your entire life, never.

289
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:09,867
I am working on it just now.

290
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:12,897
Did you ever loved somebody?

291
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:16,049
I don't think you are capable to.

292
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here it comes.

293
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,675
My inability to love.

294
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,235
I had to endure this for many years,

295
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,235
but still I am sought.

296
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:28,915
I can't hear it anymore.
Stop the car. I want to get out.

297
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,420
You are completely drunk.

298
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,362
Shut up!

299
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:47,592
Julia!

300
00:28:49,293 --> 00:28:51,592
Julia!

301
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:57,100
Julia.

302
00:28:57,674 --> 00:29:01,566
Don't make such a drama
and come to your senses.

303
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,811
I am sorry. Yeah. I am excusing myself.

304
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:06,018
Take your hands of me. You asshole.

305
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:33,610
Also a beer?

306
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,809
Okay.

307
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:43,809
Did you know that drunk people

308
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,809
only knows one sentence.

309
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:48,645
No.

310
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:49,913
That's a fact. All evening long

311
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:55,894
Only one sentence.

312
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:00,000
Maybe life is only one sentence.

313
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:02,461
Cheers!!

314
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:05,898
You know.

315
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:09,898
There exist long and short sentences.

316
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:14,432
But with those long sentences.
One got such a feeling of freedom.

317
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,709
Do you understand what I mean?

318
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:25,284
I have in the meantime studied philosophy.

319
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:28,409
Enough of reconciling the character.

320
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:38,390
Why don't you search another one?

321
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:39,516
Julia?

322
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:52,791
This Jennifer...

323
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:57,448
This little blond. She falls for you.

324
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,130
Did not you notice it?

325
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,712
Just like me, isn't it?

326
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:13,590
When the women like you,
they have already lost.

327
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:15,760
Am I not right?

328
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,533
Here, here and here. Dirt everywhere.

329
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,533
Don't you notice? You must see it.

330
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,721
Finish it. I want today on the road.

331
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,812
I don't understand why Kordula
lured himself in with him.

332
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,542
There's a system behind it.

333
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,542
These men are glued to the bible.

334
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:42,446
They just follow the bible.

335
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:44,263
Work, reproduce and make
earth your kingdom.

336
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:46,685
Becomes time that we are going today.

337
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,361
Shall I greet Doris. It was
a nice evening, isn't it?

338
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,429
Yeah. We have amused ourselves.

339
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:56,206
This is from my wife. Julia have it.

340
00:31:58,945 --> 00:31:59,945
Blouses?

341
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:01,500
Dress.

342
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:03,914
Heilwater. She wants another child.

343
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:05,910
Something sensible.

344
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,914
Leave me alone with that shit.

345
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If it was so easy. Passion is waiting.

346
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,646
Yeah?

347
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:24,131
I have to talk with you.

348
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,453
I hear you.

349
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,017
When I was in your shoes,
I would shut the door.

350
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,474
Tell him what he had done with you.

351
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:41,568
Open your mouth.

352
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:44,849
Tell what he has done with you.

353
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:52,460
Come and sit down.

354
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,206
Sven.

355
00:33:22,257 --> 00:33:24,143
Come back to home.

356
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:25,710
Why? I am doing homework.

357
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:27,391
You are coming home, right now!

358
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:38,188
Open it.

359
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,948
Where is it?

360
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:51,177
I want see that fucking
video tape, right now.

361
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:53,852
Good!

362
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:39,408
Open it!

363
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:22,063
A casting agency is looking for actors.

364
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:23,921
Do you want to join?

365
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,006
I guess so. What have I to do?

366
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:28,823
Introduce yourself first. What's your name?

367
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:33,615
My name is... uuhh... Patrick and... yeah..

368
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,119
Can you make a happy face?

369
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Okay.

370
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,576
Can you make a sad face.

371
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:43,576
Just imagine that somebody has died.

372
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:46,309
If my father had died?

373
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,157
Yes. For example.

374
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:49,827
Okay.

375
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:56,641
So?

376
00:35:56,884 --> 00:35:57,884
Super.

377
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:00,889
Cold, cold, cold, cold.

378
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:05,924
Warmer.

379
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:10,836
You getting warmer. Rather hot.

380
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:14,015
I have seen you.

381
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:16,812
Do you open the door?

382
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:18,093
In a moment.

383
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,050
Maybe you know a magic word.

384
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:24,456
Breaking.

385
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:26,093
Cool, isn't it.

386
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:27,093
Completely.

387
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,265
And that is your office?

388
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:32,224
Yeah. That's my agency desk.

389
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:33,471
Cool.

390
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,459
To be safe.

391
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,401
Oohh.

392
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,862
Do you want to see my ass?

393
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:50,418
But not showing to anybody, he?

394
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:52,624
Can you kiss?

395
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,643
You disgusting asshole.

396
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:52,228
Sven! Sven. Wake up! Wake up!

397
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:00,367
Sven! Spit it out!

398
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:05,443
Yeah. Again.

399
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:10,894
Everything will be alright.

400
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:34,071
You are familiar with fairy tales?

401
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:40,114
Then you know what the dumb-ass,
the donkey, told the other

402
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:45,967
Everything is better than Death.
Darkness is everywhere.

403
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,492
'For rent'

404
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,573
Is this everything?

405
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,766
It is extinguishing.

406
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:16,261
It's not so fast extinguishing.

407
00:42:27,616 --> 00:42:30,428
I have never done something
he did not like.

408
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:34,236
Are you serious?

409
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:41,023
When you love someone...

410
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:47,074
you can't hurt him.

411
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:50,920
Who love who here?

412
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:56,588
You don't have a clue about love.

413
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,643
It got nothing to do with love.
It is disabuse.

414
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:05,342
Sexual disabuse.

415
00:43:06,062 --> 00:43:08,342
They could lock you up for it.

416
00:43:09,062 --> 00:43:11,342
At some closed institution or jail.

417
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:15,342
Maybe it is better this way.

418
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:18,273
Sven!

419
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:24,406
Would you throw away your entire
life for such as stupid thing?

420
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,177
Hey....Son.

421
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:31,367
We will get it right.

422
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,900
Promise me that you will not
meet that Patrick anymore.

423
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,773
Do you promise me that?

424
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:53,624
His mother will report you if she
sees the two of you together.

425
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:56,773
Fortunately, he did not
tell her everything.

426
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,180
So... no playing grounds anymore.

427
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:02,295
And no place where little
boys are wandering.

428
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,119
No more school?

429
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:04,519
You would like that, isn't it?

430
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:08,418
Internet is also taboo.

431
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:19,207
Ta ta ta ta.

432
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,207
Nah? How do I look?

433
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:29,675
Julia. You look marvelous.
It fits you very well.

434
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:33,110
Am I interrupting?

435
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,050
What's happened?

436
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,978
Did he have a fight?

437
00:44:47,074 --> 00:44:49,062
Did you beat him?

438
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,902
What's going on?

439
00:44:56,942 --> 00:45:01,545
I think it's better if we don't see
each other for a while.

440
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:08,573
Are you kidding me?

441
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:11,763
I have these cloths...

442
00:45:11,764 --> 00:45:14,667
It is too many for me.

443
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:16,490
I need a little distance.

444
00:45:20,232 --> 00:45:21,931
You need distance?

445
00:45:22,781 --> 00:45:24,473
Well...

446
00:45:24,497 --> 00:45:27,014
I am unbeatable in that.

447
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:30,122
Is the boy the reason?

448
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:33,900
Am I an obstacle for you as a father?

449
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:37,244
There is something wrong with him.

450
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:39,219
I am not blind.

451
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,232
What's wrong with Sven?

452
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:43,136
I have seen the notebooks.

453
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:46,843
Achim. That's sick.

454
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:49,446
I want you to leave now.

455
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:09,067
Have you noticed how he is looking at kids?

456
00:46:41,314 --> 00:46:42,648
Everything okay?

457
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,977
They think my father is a millionaire.

458
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:59,790
Everyday picking me up
from school with a taxi.

459
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,732
Your father... The unknown being.

460
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:18,012
Mama also had such Christoph medal.

461
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:19,410
Is that so?

462
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:36,015
This is presumed to be 'Venetian Red'?

463
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:37,800
It's on the label.

464
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:39,910
To me it looks like pink.

465
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:41,922
Pig pink I would say.

466
00:47:43,824 --> 00:47:45,579
Hey. I did not mean it that way.

467
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:52,346
You got no idea how many houses
I already have renovated.

468
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:54,914
And none of them really completed.

469
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,792
Who said that?

470
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,355
Mum.

471
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,444
Your mother.

472
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:04,017
With her.. Everything had to be perfect.

473
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:08,000
Every pillow and blanket had
to be at his its own place.

474
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,523
Papa!

475
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,138
Papa?

476
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:25,985
That has to be a slip of the tongue.

477
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,956
Yeah. It just popped out.

478
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:32,534
Sure it was some nice?

479
00:48:32,558 --> 00:48:34,529
Yes. That's right.

480
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,203
Don't push to much on the same place
or you will peel it away.

481
00:48:41,204 --> 00:48:42,890
Oh. It's already happened.

482
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,865
What do you want for your birthday?

483
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,217
Nothing.

484
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,552
You're becoming eighteen.
One has to celebrate it.

485
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,960
Yeah... That I becoming eighteen.

486
00:49:01,754 --> 00:49:03,725
I wish also that you becomes eighteen.

487
00:49:05,754 --> 00:49:07,394
I, your dad, wants you becoming eighteen.

488
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:11,424
And I got the better arguments at my side.

489
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:33,878
What is this about?

490
00:49:33,879 --> 00:49:36,668
It stinks in my room of paint.

491
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,712
But not fuzzing in bed, okay?

492
00:49:43,156 --> 00:49:45,748
But I have to inhale your smoke.

493
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:53,905
You...

494
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:02,717
When I was a little boy.

495
00:50:02,718 --> 00:50:05,098
I had a friend.

496
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:06,855
He was of my age.

497
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:10,072
Nine or ten years.

498
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,893
I admired him.

499
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:15,140
And always when I was thinking of him

500
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:18,403
my heart made another beat.

501
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,405
I often had to think of him.

502
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:24,555
Not what you are thinking now.

503
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:28,367
It was platonic.
I thought he was great.

504
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,952
I even remember the name of
the street where he lived.

505
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,552
Brabanter Strasze.

506
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,364
Admit. You had felt in love with him.

507
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,843
Ah. Bullshit.

508
00:50:39,844 --> 00:50:41,318
It was just something between kids.

509
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:45,000
Afterward. We just went
like normal kids our way.

510
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:48,439
You consider yourself 'normal'?

511
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:52,871
It's not funny.

512
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,871
Have you ever been involved with girls?

513
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,630
Why are you saying now?

514
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Outside.

515
00:51:05,218 --> 00:51:07,138
Beautiful girls are wandering
around everywhere.

516
00:51:07,618 --> 00:51:09,779
Everywhere I look.

517
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,517
Yeah.. Shortly you are
drooling out of your mouth.

518
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,894
Did you have already with that Timmy...?

519
00:51:14,895 --> 00:51:16,418
What do I do with her?

520
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:23,427
Going to the cinema. Holding hands.
Show her your brief mark collection.

521
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:25,530
Come on. You know what I mean.

522
00:51:31,306 --> 00:51:32,521
Did you brush your teeth?

523
00:51:33,436 --> 00:51:34,690
Yeah.

524
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:36,286
Fingernails cut?

525
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:37,413
Yeah.

526
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,239
Washed your dick?

527
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:43,372
Who is the adult here?

528
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:47,853
There she is.

529
00:51:55,326 --> 00:51:58,872
She must be home at twelve o'clock.
Can you drive her?

530
00:51:58,873 --> 00:52:01,691
I'll see what I can do. Go now.

531
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:41,843
In Holland, there exists now
a party for child molesters.

532
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:43,235
They participate in the elections.

533
00:52:44,844 --> 00:52:47,000
At us. Our children are better protected.

534
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,279
Am I right?

535
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,545
Of course.

536
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:50,431
What's the topic?

537
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:53,314
About the defend of the
Christian worldview.

538
00:52:53,315 --> 00:52:56,020
You think it is funny? Hey Dieter?

539
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:00,020
For you, everything is a joke.

540
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,240
I've ever informed myself.

541
00:53:02,604 --> 00:53:04,704
Although nobody at this
table wants to hear it.

542
00:53:04,705 --> 00:53:08,967
Sexuality got something to
do with transfer of life.

543
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:12,842
It only happens between man and woman.
On behalf of progress.

544
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,580
Like a nice boy at the lap.

545
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:23,604
I tell you: If such a person
only looks at my son...

546
00:53:23,605 --> 00:53:26,648
I would personally rip off his balls.

547
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,897
Yeah?

548
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,448
Julia. You must not call me anymore.

549
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,830
I' m going outside.

550
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,830
What with those church phrases?

551
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,718
No. I don't write down anything.

552
00:53:46,843 --> 00:53:50,322
Maybe you need a therapist.
In any case we don't.

553
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:55,051
Damn it, Julia. I don't want it now.

554
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,263
'This man seduces little boys.'

555
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:30,379
As I see you the two of you has
amused yourselves wonderful.

556
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,657
Is everything okay?

557
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,746
Did he something to you?

558
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:01,911
Come. I bring you home.

559
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:50,170
Everything is... disgusting.

560
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:54,648
You must fall in love with her...
then... it does not matter anymore.

561
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:56,833
I am already in love.

562
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:59,216
Do you think I'm not
capable falling in love?

563
00:55:59,217 --> 00:56:00,406
That's nonsense.

564
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:02,052
Yeah. That's exactly what you think.

565
00:56:02,053 --> 00:56:05,266
According to you I am not capable to feel.

566
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:07,168
No...

567
00:56:07,169 --> 00:56:11,444
I only wanted to say that sex without
love... one must not be able to.

568
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:12,713
For nobody.

569
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:16,375
I think you just don't
want to understand me.

570
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:20,918
Good.

571
00:56:21,005 --> 00:56:23,335
Then explain it to me.

572
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,270
This is my most beloved one.

573
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:59,290
I loved to take him into my arms.

574
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:01,900
Sven. That's enough.

575
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:04,349
I love kids like Patrick.

576
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:07,349
Sometimes I imagine how I caress him.

577
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:11,349
And kissing him.

578
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,349
Stop with it.

579
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,349
How I kiss his entire body.

580
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,349
Damned. You have to stop with it.
I can't hear that shit anymore.

581
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,349
I have much love in my heart.

582
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:17,495
'This man seduces little boys'

583
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:39,119
Why don't you ask me?

584
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:47,320
When I had the feeling, I
had you to ask something.

585
00:58:48,464 --> 00:58:51,320
I could not live a day longer with you.

586
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:57,416
Yes. I have understood.

587
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:06,416
This child molester. They think
all children are the same.

588
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:47,595
I'm hearing you.

589
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,367
I know you are here.

590
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:14,419
I can't take care of everything.

591
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,660
But who else? Who else would do it?

592
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,660
Who is the chef here?

593
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:26,999
I have accidentally met Julia.

594
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,200
Accidentally?

595
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:32,676
You can't treat her like that, man!

596
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:36,001
If the boy has problems...

597
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:39,000
Listen. The boy is my son.

598
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,111
And when he has problems, it is my problem.

599
01:01:41,391 --> 01:01:42,000
Do you understand?

600
01:01:42,391 --> 01:01:44,000
Evidently 'No'.

601
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:46,215
Oh. Shit.

602
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:49,470
Man! Achim! We know each
other for such a long time.

603
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:51,191
We can talk about everything.

604
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:52,900
About what you wanna talk with me?

605
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:56,068
You regard me like an idiot.

606
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:58,000
You regard us all for idiots.

607
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,000
Alfe. Please. I got an
appointment at the bank.

608
01:02:01,169 --> 01:02:02,000
I have to concentrate.

609
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:05,000
Why do you think I wear this shit suit?

610
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,496
That you have to attend a funeral.

611
01:02:14,788 --> 01:02:17,052
Yeah. Could be.

612
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:04,214
Probably spreading. Don't come to near.

613
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,371
What does this mean?

614
01:03:26,175 --> 01:03:28,477
The best is that you lock me up.

615
01:03:31,258 --> 01:03:33,241
Did something happen?

616
01:03:33,694 --> 01:03:35,876
Sven?

617
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:37,406
Nothing.

618
01:03:39,127 --> 01:03:41,116
For what reason this shit?

619
01:03:44,393 --> 01:03:46,417
It's better so.

620
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:50,721
What does it mean:'It's better so?'

621
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:54,078
Can't I let you walk around freely?
Is that what you mean?

622
01:03:54,983 --> 01:03:57,328
That something is not happening again.

623
01:03:57,329 --> 01:04:01,020
Only you decide if something happens.

624
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:04,732
Sven. I can't lock you up
life-time in this house.

625
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:06,018
That's not a life.

626
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:09,793
It's my life.Anyway. What
do you know about it?

627
01:04:12,814 --> 01:04:15,530
In any case, I will not lock you up.

628
01:04:20,437 --> 01:04:23,200
Here. Let others do it, when
it does not work anymore.

629
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:25,732
I will not lock up my son!

630
01:04:25,733 --> 01:04:27,182
Understood?

631
01:04:45,797 --> 01:04:47,720
Taxi arrives at some petrol station.

632
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:50,753
Four penguins are sitting in the
rear in their safety belts.

633
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:53,068
The owner of the petrol station
sees them, wonders and ask:

634
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:56,242
'What do you want to do
with those pinquins?'

635
01:04:56,243 --> 01:04:58,626
The driver says: 'I don't know exactly.'

636
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,946
'Just take them to the zoo',
the petrol servant says.

637
01:05:00,947 --> 01:05:04,222
'Good idea', the taxi driver responds.

638
01:05:04,223 --> 01:05:06,631
The next day, he again arrives
at the petrol station.

639
01:05:06,632 --> 01:05:11,786
Again at the backs seat pinquins, wearing
sunglasses... and the servant...

640
01:05:18,254 --> 01:05:21,586
Everybody is laughing.
Here comes the freight.

641
01:05:26,312 --> 01:05:29,101
I want to the hotel, please.

642
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:41,863
How are you doing?

643
01:05:43,175 --> 01:05:45,084
And Sven?

644
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:49,460
Have you talked to this therapist?

645
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:50,149
No.

646
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:53,013
Why don't you let yourself at least
be advised? There are possibilities.

647
01:05:53,173 --> 01:05:55,000
So that he will be marked?

648
01:05:55,173 --> 01:05:57,400
Beware. A pedophile. Parents,
put your children away?

649
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:02,500
No. That not something is
happening like with Patrick.

650
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,436
What has happened with Patrick?

651
01:06:04,437 --> 01:06:07,000
There are possibilities. I have informed.
They say...

652
01:06:07,108 --> 01:06:09,667
I know exactly what they are saying.

653
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,596
They say: 'Once a pedophile,
always a pedophile.'

654
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:13,887
So. Want do they want?

655
01:06:15,108 --> 01:06:17,934
What if they really could help him?

656
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:20,184
So that he did not impose
harm on those kids.

657
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,900
That when a kid smiles to him.

658
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:24,847
He not immediately thinks
that he wants sex from him.

659
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,650
Man, Achim.

660
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:29,280
He can learn to deal with
his sexual fantasies.

661
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:31,818
What do you think I am doing?

662
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:34,001
Day and night I help him to deal with it.

663
01:06:34,002 --> 01:06:35,990
That's a full time job.

664
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:41,308
I don't understand you.

665
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,308
Really, you don't?

666
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:48,242
I will not let take away the boy for a
second time from me.

667
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:50,242
Is that so hard to understand?

668
01:06:58,918 --> 01:07:00,972
And.. how much do I have to pay?

669
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:05,101
A gift.

670
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,940
Can I come in?

671
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,401
Wait.

672
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yet?

673
01:07:30,451 --> 01:07:31,857
Still one moment.

674
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,857
You can come in now.

675
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:44,857
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday
to you. Happy Birthday sweet Sven.

676
01:07:47,451 --> 01:07:50,857
Congratulations with your
fourteenth birthday.

677
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,457
Is something wrong?

678
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,507
Fourteen, sixteen, seventeen...
Seventeenth anniversary.

679
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:00,607
Wrong too.

680
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:04,000
With you, one can get confused.

681
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:06,311
You have drunk?

682
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:09,511
I have cheered with the numerous guests.

683
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,700
Hey!

684
01:08:20,854 --> 01:08:23,400
Don't you know anymore how this is done?

685
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,300
I make you a gift.

686
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,420
You are standing in front of me.

687
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:32,751
And you say with glimmering
childish eyes: 'For me?'

688
01:08:36,831 --> 01:08:39,751
Your eyes has shined more in former days.

689
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,831
Nah. Unwrap it.

690
01:08:57,394 --> 01:09:01,453
Digital. With everything included.

691
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,415
Unwrap it.

692
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:07,728
You have to try it out. It does not bite.

693
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:14,689
What do you wish to prove with it?

694
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:20,459
You want to make a statement with it.

695
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:29,930
You... wants to proves something to me.

696
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,116
Understood?

697
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:30,530
'How does he looks like?'

698
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:36,963
'Red Shirt. Just like a
child abuser looks.'

699
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:42,256
'Are you at the location Roter Strasze?'

700
01:11:55,447 --> 01:11:58,697
'He goes to Juha's Park,
just in front of me.'

701
01:12:00,856 --> 01:12:04,515
'Now he is at Heidelberger. Hurry up.'

702
01:12:31,653 --> 01:12:32,772
Where is he?

703
01:12:32,773 --> 01:12:34,741
He can't get out from here.

704
01:12:43,114 --> 01:12:45,007
Achim!

705
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:27,605
Get up.

706
01:13:28,324 --> 01:13:29,821
Turn around.

707
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,573
You will turn around.

708
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,927
Achim!

709
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:56,642
Stop it!

710
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:59,253
Now you acting completely foolish.

711
01:14:55,354 --> 01:14:57,539
You are like a junkie.

712
01:15:00,294 --> 01:15:02,614
Quite so false and lost.

713
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:06,898
Never trust a junkie.

714
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,360
We celebrated our farewell.

715
01:15:20,825 --> 01:15:24,153
Patrick is moving away. We
celebrated our farewell.

716
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:00,696
The chambermaid with arrive soon.

717
01:17:02,854 --> 01:17:04,711
Cleaning.

718
01:17:13,869 --> 01:17:16,076
I have sold the business.

719
01:17:16,907 --> 01:17:19,640
Otherwise it would be torn at the end.

720
01:17:21,123 --> 01:17:23,587
Becker has taken over the load.

721
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:31,022
Did not he tell you anything?

722
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:36,518
Me as entrepreneur...

723
01:17:38,343 --> 01:17:39,824
Probably, I'm not the right guy for it.

724
01:17:39,825 --> 01:17:41,784
I love you.

725
01:17:46,975 --> 01:17:49,699
We need our freedom.

726
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,720
Do you understand?

727
01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:57,452
Now I'm back...

728
01:17:57,453 --> 01:18:01,089
where I started fifteen years ago.

729
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:04,659
A newcomer.

730
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:20,665
I'm almost forty.

731
01:18:22,174 --> 01:18:24,156
You have to made a decision.

732
01:18:24,174 --> 01:18:25,174
Achim...

733
01:19:57,491 --> 01:19:59,481
Sven?

734
01:21:03,086 --> 01:21:05,056
Tell me your name again.

735
01:21:05,248 --> 01:21:07,628
Leon... Dering

736
01:21:08,582 --> 01:21:10,273
And how old are you?

737
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:12,069
In September I'm becoming eleven.

738
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,912
Can you make a happy face?

739
01:21:20,845 --> 01:21:22,667
Uuuhh...

740
01:21:22,691 --> 01:21:24,720
Can you already kiss?

741
01:21:29,257 --> 01:21:31,253
Like in real?

742
01:21:33,795 --> 01:21:35,645
Show me.

743
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:38,717
Kiss the hand.

744
01:22:17,273 --> 01:22:19,268
What has happened?

745
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:23,762
You were here with a boy, isn't it?

746
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,525
Where is he?

747
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,187
Sven. I asked you something.

748
01:22:30,188 --> 01:22:32,235
Where is the boy?

749
01:22:33,578 --> 01:22:35,554
Ran away.

750
01:22:44,386 --> 01:22:46,360
Come. Let's go home.

751
01:22:54,576 --> 01:22:59,468
What are you doing Sven.
What are you doing?

752
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:22,373
What do you think of a journey?

753
01:23:28,354 --> 01:23:30,423
A long travel.

754
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:33,165
Just the two of us.

755
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:35,818
With a taxi.

756
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:38,269
With a taxi...

757
01:23:39,261 --> 01:23:41,266
to India.

758
01:23:46,186 --> 01:23:48,094
Shortly after I finished high school...

759
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:50,885
I hit the road.

760
01:23:51,828 --> 01:23:55,787
With comrades we bought an old VW-bus.

761
01:23:56,114 --> 01:24:00,254
But it was rather quick over.

762
01:24:01,073 --> 01:24:03,069
The engine failed.

763
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:06,433
But of course, that's not happening to us.

764
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:09,176
From Greece, over the Bosporus..

765
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:15,557
Via Turkey, Iran...

766
01:24:15,558 --> 01:24:18,129
Afghanistan...

767
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,488
Pakistan...

768
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:22,505
to India.

769
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:25,364
To .....?

770
01:24:26,517 --> 01:24:29,267
That's where the last wild tigers live?

771
01:25:06,164 --> 01:25:08,266
Good Evening. Criminal Investigation,
police-officer Hartmann.

772
01:25:08,267 --> 01:25:10,803
Does Mr. Sven Maas live here?

773
01:25:12,219 --> 01:25:13,219
One moment please.

774
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,481
Sven?

775
01:25:45,116 --> 01:25:47,049
Sven!

776
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:39,277
I call you when I'm done.

777
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:42,159
Is alright.

778
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,962
'Visitor 1151'

779
01:27:50,714 --> 01:27:52,252
Thanks.
