1
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,495
You majored in Pharmacy?

2
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:31,842
Only for two years

3
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:34,885
Then I studied medicine for four more

4
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:37,384
Why did you switch faculties?

5
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:42,722
I found life in the pharmacy boring

6
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:45,178
You don't get to meet many people

7
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:47,639
But it's comfortable work

8
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:51,310
Yes, but it's always the same old faces

9
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:54,197
I like meeting a wide variety of people

10
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:57,906
To gather new experiences?

11
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:00,989
Yes, to see faces come and go

12
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,613
How would you describe yourself?

13
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,872
I'd say I'm a cheerful person

14
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,124
Why do you think you're cheerful?

15
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:13,461
I'm gauging from my friend's reactions
when they're with me

16
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,217
They seem to enjoy themselves

17
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,337
Do you play any sports?

18
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,131
- Sports...
- Can you draw?

19
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,545
I can play basketball

20
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,177
What position do you play?

21
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,101
Centre

22
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:28,143
Do you prefer drawing with paint,
pencils or pastels?

23
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,397
Drawing? Pencils, mostly

24
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,151
- You prefer pencils?
- Yes

25
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,769
Do you prefer triangles,
squares or circles?

26
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:36,316
Circles

27
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,699
A circle? What colour would it be?

28
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:42,864
I'd like it to be clear

29
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:44,954
Clear? And what size?

30
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,665
- About the size of the bottom of a glass
- The bottom of a glass

31
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,330
Do you keep any pets?

32
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,163
I used to have a cat

33
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,544
You had a cat...

34
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:57,167
Can you sit up straight, please?

35
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,212
Turn to the left

36
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:03,016
OK. What hand do you use
for surgery?

37
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,930
- My right hand
- Can I see it?

38
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,138
Stretch out your arm

39
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,645
Spread out your hand

40
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,186
Clench your fist

41
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,319
Clench it harder. Hold it steady

42
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,455
That's fine

43
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,787
- What was that for?
- What does DDT stand for?

44
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,870
- Pardon?
- What does DDT stand for?

45
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,545
DDT...?

46
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:37,668
Do we have to know that here?

47
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,046
What does it stand for?

48
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,677
Is it the pesticide?

49
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:52,939
'Destroy Dirty Things'

50
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:07,119
Or is it 'Deep Down To You'?

51
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:19,333
Take this note to Dr Prasarn
in the emergency ward

52
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:25,969
- Don't peek at it, Doctor
- OK

53
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,810
- Is there...?
- I'll be off, then

54
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:44,410
See you

55
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,336
Sorry I kept you waiting

56
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:58,339
A cup of tea?

57
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:11,220
Doctor... I brought you a small gift

58
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,680
You shouldn't have

59
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,065
Thank you very much

60
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,285
Is it beef or pork?

61
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:30,739
It's crispy pork

62
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,623
Keep it in the freezer
so it stays crispy longer

63
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,707
Thank you again

64
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,634
Excuse me...

65
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,684
...this is my first day here...

66
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:59,228
Are you sure you want me
in the emergency ward?

67
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,687
Aren't you used to it
from the army camp?

68
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:06,903
Not really. We rarely saw
serious cases there

69
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:11,737
And when I see blood I get...

70
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,666
You get what?

71
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:15,073
Excuse me

72
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,999
Pardon me,
Dr Prasarn asked me to fetch you

73
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,590
Koh, this is Dr Nohng

74
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:22,425
- Hello
- Hello

75
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,758
To fetch me or Dr Nohng?

76
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:28,339
- I'm not sure
- Then please take Dr Nohng there

77
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:32,342
- Aren't you coming, too?
- Of course. Just give me a second

78
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,179
- How's Nook? I haven't seen her lately
- Busy selling T-shirts. I want a new girl

79
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:38,641
She might find a new guy first

80
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:42,857
Imet a cute girl while I was
out drinking with Dr Prasarn

81
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:46,572
- Whereabouts?
- A place right behind the hospital

82
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,860
There are pubs behind the hospital?

83
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:50,787
Didn't you know?

84
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:53,202
I pass by everyday
and haven't seen any

85
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,788
What time do you pass?
They open after 9:00pm

86
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,042
No one's around that late

87
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:00,211
Everyone's gone home by then

88
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:09,014
So he got her number and called her up

89
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,967
How did it go?

90
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:17,855
Well, she also gave me her number,
and it turns out she liked me more

91
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:19,560
Really?

92
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:22,231
When I called her,
we talked for over two hours

93
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:24,485
Who's prettier, her or Nook?

94
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:32,371
Dr Nohng, aren't you sore...

95
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,204
...from walking so stiffly?

96
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,247
I'm used to it

97
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:41,837
This way, Doctor

98
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:48,968
Dr Prasarn, this is Dr Nohng
whom I recommended

99
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:53,381
Did you see a lot of patients yesterday?

100
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,219
Not really. It feels busier today

101
00:08:57,356 --> 00:09:00,143
Are they construction workers?

102
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:03,644
- Yes, a couple of brothers
- Really?

103
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:07,443
- They're cute, huh?
- They're OK

104
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,744
- Our hospital's giving away glasses?
- Like the ones in star Wars

105
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,366
You're right!

106
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:16,372
The same style

107
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:23,339
- I forgot I've left someone in my room
- Who?

108
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:25,956
It's OK, I'll go back to them
after my rounds

109
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:30,967
They're going to plant a lot more trees

110
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:35,427
This is where they'll set up the stage

111
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,432
For the Buddhist holiday?

112
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:41,316
There is alms-giving in the morning

113
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,019
In the morning

114
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:47,648
Hey! I forgot to turn it off. Hey!

115
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:49,276
Turn off what?

116
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:51,567
This thing clipped to my pants

117
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,324
What are you talking about?

118
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:57,951
We're done

119
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,997
It's kind of like...

120
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:03,702
- Like what?
- ... playing the same scene over

121
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,720
Damn it

122
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:13,801
At first it wasn't so bad

123
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:18,728
- You wanted to be an actor, right?
- It's only been five takes

124
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:20,432
All together

125
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:24,432
What's wrong with my eyes?

126
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:30,607
I'm checking if your brain's
response is normal

127
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,699
My brain?

128
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:34,405
Yes

129
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:37,110
Do you have dreams often?

130
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:39,786
Well, Idon't really know

131
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,409
Since I fell out of bed the other night...

132
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:45,036
...I've been like this

133
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:47,000
Your leg is sore?

134
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,375
My leg is sore and my joints ache

135
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,542
I see

136
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,754
The other night...

137
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,759
...I dreamt about a flock of chickens

138
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:58,893
When I was a boy, a young boy...

139
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,690
...I was naughty and mean-spirited,
I used to break their legs for fun

140
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,021
I'd go visit my friend's farm...

141
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,610
...and break the legs of his chickens...

142
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,738
...because their clucking sound
really bothered me

143
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:17,491
In my dream...

144
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:22,913
...they told me that
they wanted me to suffer

145
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:28,631
Despite the fact that I've offered
prayers for them for many years

146
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,834
You can communicate with chickens?

147
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:35,049
Their spirits came and possessed me

148
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:39,131
I guess they wanted revenge

149
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,136
I ran away,
but they chased after me

150
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:47,769
They kept chasing me. I was so scared

151
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:51,402
I grew wings and turned into a chicken

152
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:56,906
I always sleep on my side
and hug a bolster pillow

153
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:00,788
In my dream, I was woken up...

154
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,415
...and they kicked me out of bed

155
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:10,913
I landed on the floor
and all my joints were aching

156
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,008
Do your joints still ache?

157
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:17,964
Now and then.
That's why I came to see you

158
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,770
- Do you eat a lot of chicken?
- I guess so

159
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:28,275
I really should try to eat less
to reduce my bad karma

160
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:33,064
But when I collect alms,
I must accept what's offered

161
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:35,820
Can you excuse me for a minute?

162
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,445
Where are you going?

163
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:40,283
- I'm going...
- You haven't finished my check-up

164
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:42,323
I'm going to quickly pop next door

165
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,916
Excuse me

166
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:48,539
Wait for me here. Don't go anywhere

167
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,713
Mr Chai. Mr Chai

168
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,090
Mr Chai

169
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:59,011
I need to speak with you

170
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,351
Over here, please

171
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,399
It's about the money I lent you

172
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,816
It's been a while

173
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:15,983
The new school term has just started...

174
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:19,034
...and my son's school fees
are expensive

175
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:22,365
Why won't you look me in the eye?

176
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:26,417
Something doesn't sound right

177
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:30,755
Would you swear to it?
There's a monk waiting in my office

178
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:32,625
Let's go see him

179
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,253
Swear to what?

180
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:39,094
Swear to keep your promise, Mr Chai

181
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,050
How could you forget?

182
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,184
Don't make me swear.
I'm afraid of monks

183
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,100
Don't be so silly

184
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:53,070
We're not talking
ghosts and goblins here!

185
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:56,280
You didn't seem afraid
when you borrowed my money

186
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,203
Sorry about that

187
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:05,910
Please excuse me

188
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,533
- Everything in order?
- Yes

189
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,672
There's a lot of uric acid in poultry

190
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:19,048
It collects in your joints,
if you eat too much

191
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,754
Let me run some more blood tests

192
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:24,263
- I hope you don't mind...
- Yes?

193
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:27,845
I sense confusion inside your heart

194
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:30,472
Confusion? About what?

195
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:34,987
About money matters, you know?

196
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:43,485
Boil these roots and drink them
to help you forget

197
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:46,489
What is it?

198
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:53,921
It's an herbal potion
handed down from my ancestors

199
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:58,177
It helps regulate menstrual flow...

200
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,304
...cures fainting and dizzy spells

201
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:03,922
But it can't treat everything

202
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,388
I have this itchy rash

203
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:09,897
Can you treat it?

204
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:11,601
You have a rash?

205
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,441
On my body and my arms

206
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,810
Excuse me. Let me see

207
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:17,357
This arm?

208
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,980
- Doctor?
- Yes?

209
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:23,822
Can I also have some sleeping pills?

210
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,531
You have trouble sleeping?

211
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,782
My dreams keep waking me up

212
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:34,125
Dreaming is normal. Everyone dreams

213
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:38,585
I need some medicine
for the other monks...

214
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:42,847
...and for the villagers
who live near the temple

215
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:46,556
I can't do that. They have to come
and see me themselves

216
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:49,141
Why? Just write the prescription

217
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,762
You know, when to take the pills...

218
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,943
...kids or adults,
before or after meals

219
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,774
Just write it on the packet

220
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:01,195
I really can't do that

221
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,199
It's against the rules

222
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,159
If someone found out,
I'd be held liable

223
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:10,741
Right now, I can only
prescribe medicine for you

224
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:12,418
How about this?

225
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:17,041
At least give me vitamins
for the temple boys, OK?

226
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,083
I really can't

227
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:20,629
Why not?

228
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:22,801
Well, they need to see me in person

229
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,679
I know you can, but you won't, right?

230
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:33,142
I can only treat patients that visit me,
otherwise I can't prescribe anything

231
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,892
Hey, Sakda...

232
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,696
...tell the doctor about your condition...

233
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:43,361
...your asthma condition

234
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,948
That's not me. That's my mother

235
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,871
His mother has had asthma for a while

236
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:55,331
Sakda, describe your mother's condition

237
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,454
Nine...

238
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,206
Slowly

239
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,622
One more time. Ten...

240
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:20,084
Very good

241
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:22,291
And lower your arms

242
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:27,301
Now the third position.
Stand at ease, hands on your hips

243
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:30,135
We're going to slowly squat down

244
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:35,348
Squat down until your thighs feel taut

245
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,849
Now, slowly stand up. Good

246
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,858
Squat down

247
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:44,189
Stand up

248
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,778
We'll do this fifteen times...

249
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,281
...to strengthen our knees

250
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:58,914
Rinse your mouth

251
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:06,718
Oh, use that cup and spit in the bowl

252
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,308
You've never been to the dentist, right?

253
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,061
Yes, this is my first time

254
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,682
I can tell

255
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,227
Just a little more

256
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:31,402
I'm gaining merit by giving a monk
a free dental check-up

257
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,912
What merit?

258
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,078
I'm just like anyone else

259
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:40,368
I'd like to be normal, but some
mysterious force has a hold on me

260
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:44,087
It keeps me cloaked in saffron robes
that I can't seem to shake off

261
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:48,010
I used to dream of being a DJ...

262
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:50,130
...of owning a comic book store

263
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:53,887
Being a DJ sounded fun

264
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:59,937
I turned on a radio show from the city,
and it was playing pop music

265
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,517
- You listen to American music?
- Yes, I listen to modern music

266
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:07,104
I wanted to request a song,
but I didn't have a phone...

267
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:12,316
...so I sent a letter instead
and introduced myself

268
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,952
The DJ replied and invited me to dinner

269
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,617
Over dinner, he asked me to be a DJ,
but I turned him down

270
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,421
I don't know why. I always wanted to...

271
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,249
You know, I'm a singer

272
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:27,422
A singer? Really?

273
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:33,720
- What kind of songs?
- Mostly Thai country music. It's a hobby

274
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,138
I don't listen to much of that

275
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:38,389
Open up

276
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:49,812
You're the one on the bulletin board?

277
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,443
On the board? Yes

278
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,284
You won some kind of prize, right?

279
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,653
- Yes
- Dentist of the Year

280
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:06,380
Let me cover your eyes

281
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:17,434
Ouch!

282
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,723
Sorry

283
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,702
Is this a check-up or a concert?

284
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,009
I'm still waiting

285
00:21:58,226 --> 00:21:59,389
What?

286
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:57,239
Let me play. Just for a bit

287
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:15,003
Excuse me, Doctor

288
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:23,507
Would you like to have lunch?

289
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:30,179
No, thanks, I'm not hungry yet

290
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,271
Is there something
you wanted to see me about?

291
00:25:42,786 --> 00:25:44,695
Doctor...

292
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,787
...can we get engaged?

293
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:03,089
Is everything all right?

294
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:09,096
No, it's not

295
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:09,539
Doctor...

296
00:27:48,955 --> 00:27:51,031
My stomach is rumbling

297
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:57,118
Are you trying to torment me?

298
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,508
Have you ever been in love?

299
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:11,474
Well... not exactly

300
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:17,397
Then you won't understand how I feel

301
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:23,729
I feel as if my heart's on fire

302
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:27,950
I can't eat, I can't sleep

303
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:29,952
- It's like...
- I understand

304
00:28:52,102 --> 00:28:54,225
I once knew a man...

305
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,807
I once met a man
at the Farmer's Market

306
00:29:23,092 --> 00:29:26,128
- Are you interested in that orchid?
- Yes

307
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:30,473
It's an auspicious plant
that will bring you luck

308
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,802
It also glows in the dark

309
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:35,893
- Glows in the dark?
- Yes

310
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:39,721
I have a picture I can show you

311
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,021
Can I help you?

312
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:44,603
- How much?
- It's a wild orchid. 25,000 baht

313
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,905
I bred it myself.
Its form is very distinct

314
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:53,618
25,000? I'm sure to kill it in a month

315
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:58,825
It's not hard to grow.
It doesn't like direct sunlight

316
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:00,753
It prefers to be in the shade

317
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:07,135
You saw I liked it
so you jacked up the price, right?

318
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:11,722
But it also glows in the dark

319
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,806
I have pictures I can show you

320
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,646
Here you go

321
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,480
It costs too much

322
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:23,391
Look at the picture. Can you see?

323
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:25,686
Excuse me, how much is this?

324
00:30:25,822 --> 00:30:27,150
Which one?

325
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:28,989
That one is 250 baht

326
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:30,397
- 25,000?
- Yes

327
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,611
It must be an electric orchid!

328
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:38,121
I'm not feeling so good, Doctor

329
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:42,459
But if it makes you happy...

330
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:44,795
...please continue with your story

331
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,919
I'd like to...

332
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:50,128
...but I'm afraid it will upset you

333
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:53,470
It's too late for that, Doctor

334
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:59,098
I thought it might make you feel better

335
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,638
It's not as if I'm going to marry him

336
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,567
You're not?

337
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:11,191
Why are you laughing at me?

338
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,950
This is why I love you so much

339
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:20,830
From the very first time I met you.
Do you remember?

340
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,286
- That day...
- Then he came to the hospital...

341
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:27,633
Please, Doctor, listen to me first

342
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,377
- That day you wore...
- He came to look at a wild orchid

343
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:35,259
Wow, how amazing

344
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:39,472
It's the rarest wild orchid in Thailand

345
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:42,056
We have several orchids here...

346
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,148
There are many types,
but this one is priceless

347
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:50,818
- Are you tricking me?
- No, I'm serious

348
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:53,238
- It's a sin to lie
- I'm serious

349
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:56,535
I'd like to buy it to breed at my farm

350
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:00,037
I thought you said it was priceless

351
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:04,537
Look at the roots, Director

352
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:07,589
They're not so pretty. Twining all over

353
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:10,005
People don't like it so much

354
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:14,263
It seems to lack form and order

355
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,344
Can you see?

356
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:21,309
Perhaps my wife might like it

357
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:22,980
Right, Doctor?

358
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:34,615
These are photos taken at my farm

359
00:32:34,743 --> 00:32:36,819
Feel free to visit anytime

360
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:46,831
Well, I wish I knew more about orchids

361
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,388
Who's there?

362
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,599
Are you Dr Toey?

363
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,353
Yes

364
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,024
Noom talks a lot about you

365
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,773
What has he said?

366
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,903
Come down here

367
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,955
What are you doing?

368
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,955
Careful, it's slippery

369
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,244
I'm making a mud pack...

370
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,337
...to take care of my legs

371
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,960
What's wrong with them?

372
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,550
I fell off a motorbike and broke one

373
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,926
Now one leg is longer than the other

374
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,385
Really? Let me take a look

375
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,938
Right here

376
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,899
Look at the fish nibbling at my feet

377
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,855
They're tickling me

378
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,614
Try it and see

379
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,526
Here, bite on this

380
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,152
Be careful nothing pulls you down

381
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,997
It's hard to access

382
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,675
Can you drive in?

383
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,668
The waterfall has seven levels.
We have to go on foot

384
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,426
- We park at the base and walk in
- There's parking there

385
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:46,970
- But we'll leave Pa Jane behind
- No way! You'll have to carry me up

386
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,681
Or send her back to Nong Kai

387
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,768
You have two choices, wait
at the base or go home to Nong Kai

388
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,976
- I'll stay with you
- Send her to Nong Kai

389
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,187
You've been with me
for so many years

390
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:01,315
Here, Doctor, this is the waterfall
he's talking about

391
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,693
- What are you doing?
- What?

392
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,240
Put it away

393
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,412
- Let her look at it first
- Don't look at it

394
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:11,076
- Is there something I should know?
- It's a trick she uses to sell her bags

395
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:14,082
Buy one and I'll throw in one for free

396
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,495
Deal?

397
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:22,845
A few miles past the temple
there's a sign and a statue of a cow

398
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,093
- Doctor, look at this old photo
- Pass an intersection...

399
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,389
What?

400
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,395
Where did you get that?

401
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,684
Just keep driving

402
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,854
Who's the girl with long hair?

403
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,025
It must be Pa Jane

404
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,644
Keep your eyes on the road

405
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:41,616
Is that a tattoo on your arm, Noom?

406
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:45,657
He doesn't like to talk about it.
It's too painful

407
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:47,864
My father asked me to get it

408
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,409
A tattoo of what?

409
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,700
You got a rose tattoo for your dad?

410
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:56,961
No, I just got a tattoo as he asked

411
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,301
Just a small one

412
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,918
Don't lie and act embarrassed

413
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,261
You're always on my case

414
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,846
A red rose, too, Pa Jane

415
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,440
They don't scrimp on the topping

416
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,775
It smells good

417
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,817
It's really sweet

418
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:32,449
You're so attentive.
How come you don't have a boyfriend?

419
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,827
Who says I don't?

420
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,708
Really?

421
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,790
The fortune teller said so

422
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:42,177
One or many?

423
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,213
It depends on which one you ask

424
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,134
Many boyfriends from all races

425
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,814
A long time ago, Doctor...

426
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:01,356
...two farmers came across
a young monk

427
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,364
The monk asked them...

428
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:08,986
..."Would you like to be rich?
You've suffered for so long"

429
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:11,411
The farmers told him they did...

430
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:15,586
...so he told them
to go down to the lake

431
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:20,588
All this from here to there
used to be a lake

432
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,802
When the farmers got there... By golly!

433
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,049
It was full of gold and silver

434
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:31,137
They rushed to stuff their bags full

435
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:34,436
Suddenly, a solar eclipse occurred...

436
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:37,020
...and the sky went dark

437
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,899
They kept gathering gold in the dark.
They got so rich

438
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:45,072
But one farmer was greedy...

439
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,027
...and he came back for more

440
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,245
- They say thieves robbed his house
- Then what?

441
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,281
They shot him dead

442
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,449
That's the result of being greedy

443
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:56,996
How cruel

444
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:59,834
This is a powerful place

445
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:04,045
No matter what people do,
no matter what we do...

446
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,550
...something always watches us

447
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,756
Like you coming here...

448
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:13,102
...it knows all about you.
I know as well

449
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,138
Know about what?

450
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,181
Come on

451
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:22,149
Just let him know your true feelings...

452
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,904
...or you might miss out

453
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,990
But he does smell nice

454
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,150
What?

455
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,949
But sometimes, I just want to be alone

456
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:38,540
No way. Then it won't be exciting

457
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:44,749
Otherwise why did you
give him the orchid?

458
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,127
I'll open it for you

459
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:51,174
Have you looked
in his bedroom yet?

460
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:53,100
Do I have to?

461
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,732
Of course! You judge a man
from his bedroom and his desk

462
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:02,101
I'd have to wait for him
to fall asleep first...

463
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:04,312
...before I could look inside

464
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:55,700
This way. You have to slide it open

465
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:15,602
Sorry. My room is a bit of a mess

466
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:17,554
It's not that messy

467
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:22,183
I wasn't expecting company today.
It's not often I get visitors

468
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:25,310
It's always a mess

469
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:28,066
- Please sit down
- Thank you

470
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:34,279
Have an orange

471
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:42,418
You think it looks OK hanging there?

472
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:47,756
Will this one glow in the dark as well?

473
00:41:51,096 --> 00:41:52,471
After you

474
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,774
Are you tired?

475
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:06,479
A little bit

476
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:07,987
Better?

477
00:42:09,656 --> 00:42:11,981
Where's Pa Jane going?

478
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:14,655
She can't stay out under the hot sun

479
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:16,744
Come on, Mom Mam!

480
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:20,533
What are you thinking about?

481
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:22,912
Come here, Mom Mam!

482
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:29,091
If you secretly liked someone,
what would you do?

483
00:42:29,885 --> 00:42:33,503
I'd hide behind a pillar
and peek out at them

484
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:36,308
But then how would they know
that you like them?

485
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:37,548
I don't know

486
00:42:37,684 --> 00:42:41,054
But that person isn't you,
I just need your advice

487
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:46,684
I can't decide what to do

488
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:48,099
Why? What's wrong?

489
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,779
I don't know what to say

490
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:51,399
Is it a man or a woman?

491
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:56,402
- I'm just joking
- That's a strange question

492
00:42:56,537 --> 00:42:59,704
It was a joke. Don't take it to heart

493
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,583
I'm not accusing you of anything!

494
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,913
- That was mean
- I'm only kidding

495
00:43:06,046 --> 00:43:07,873
Is the orange peeled?

496
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:17,134
It's all crushed

497
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:21,180
- It's completely squashed
- Have another

498
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:24,182
So, go on.
You secretly like her...?

499
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:26,604
But I don't dare to confess my love

500
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:29,142
Could I do anything to help?

501
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:49,705
smile, your smile makes me happy

502
00:43:51,134 --> 00:43:55,961
smile just once more

503
00:43:56,097 --> 00:44:01,138
Just a glance, I'm standing here

504
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:05,313
Waiting for your smile

505
00:44:06,316 --> 00:44:11,191
Just a simple smile from you

506
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:16,196
Teeth, so clean and white

507
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:21,201
lickering in the shadows,
shining in my heart

508
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:25,660
To you no one compares

509
00:44:25,794 --> 00:44:31,417
Please brighten me with your smile

510
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:35,879
smile and it will be mine

511
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:41,599
Please brighten me with your smile

512
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:46,472
Can you feel me smiling back?

513
00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:51,731
Love is the answer

514
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:56,737
Love and concern

515
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:59,358
The tenderness of your smile

516
00:44:59,494 --> 00:45:04,405
Inspires me as always

517
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:24,679
My guitarist

518
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:31,311
smile, your smile makes me happy

519
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,314
smile just once more

520
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:50,919
Thank you very much

521
00:45:51,046 --> 00:45:52,291
Thank you very much

522
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:55,714
A round of applause for Ant

523
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,133
Let's bring him upfront

524
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:05,179
He wrote the music on all my albums

525
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,102
Give him a big hand

526
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:06,866
I wanted to watch you sing,
but I couldn't go, it's not proper

527
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:10,078
Why not? The fair was at the temple

528
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:12,328
There are too many people

529
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:18,250
When I saw you walking up,
I almost didn't recognise you

530
00:49:19,715 --> 00:49:24,792
My green jacket must blend in!
The nurses didn't remember me either

531
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,304
Really?

532
00:49:26,972 --> 00:49:29,048
You've never worn this outfit here?

533
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:31,934
No, I'm afraid I'll run into patients

534
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:37,349
Brother, do you feel that...

535
00:49:37,483 --> 00:49:40,733
...maybe we knew each other
in a past life?

536
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,737
I don't think so

537
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:49,077
You remind me of my dead brother

538
00:49:50,746 --> 00:49:53,416
When I was 8 years old...

539
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:56,495
...I was naughty, as boys are

540
00:49:56,627 --> 00:50:00,577
Climbing trees to pick mangoes
and such

541
00:50:00,715 --> 00:50:05,293
One day, my brother was
too scared to climb the trees...

542
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:07,301
...but I forced him...

543
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,633
...and he fell and died

544
00:50:11,684 --> 00:50:14,389
I feel wrong to this very day

545
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:19,398
Are you my brother reincarnated?

546
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,111
It can't be

547
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:26,153
I wasn't human in my past life

548
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:33,620
I just want the chance to apologise

549
00:50:33,748 --> 00:50:35,159
To your brother?

550
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,580
- Yes
- I'm not your brother

551
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:41,338
Because in my last life I was...

552
00:50:41,964 --> 00:50:43,624
It was my brother's

553
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:46,000
- A horse?
- Yes

554
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,546
I'd like you to have it

555
00:50:49,097 --> 00:50:50,674
I can't accept it

556
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:53,677
It's not mine.
Save it for your real brother...

557
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,221
...when you see him

558
00:50:56,104 --> 00:50:58,310
My brother is already dead

559
00:51:00,483 --> 00:51:05,644
Well, then...
will you accept this instead?

560
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,895
What is it?

561
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,360
My new album

562
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:10,199
For me?

563
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:15,121
It doesn't look like you

564
00:51:16,624 --> 00:51:19,115
It hasn't gone on sale yet

565
00:51:22,088 --> 00:51:23,832
'I Could Only Look'

566
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:25,839
This is your real name?

567
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:27,592
Yes

568
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,966
Normally, I sing about teeth and gums...

569
00:51:32,098 --> 00:51:36,013
...but this album is all love songs

570
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:41,311
But I don't own a CD player

571
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:44,768
I'll present one as an offering

572
00:51:44,903 --> 00:51:48,106
That's OK. I'll borrow the abbot's,
he has one

573
00:51:48,615 --> 00:51:50,275
Tohng!

574
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:51,784
Dr Ple, follow me

575
00:51:55,038 --> 00:51:56,782
Where are you going?

576
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:39,015
You also majored in Pharmacy?

577
00:53:39,143 --> 00:53:40,602
Only for two years

578
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:43,136
Then I studied medicine for four more

579
00:53:43,272 --> 00:53:45,431
Did you find the army base boring?

580
00:53:45,566 --> 00:53:50,442
Not exactly, but I felt
I'd be more useful here

581
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:52,979
Why did you decide to study medicine?

582
00:53:54,242 --> 00:53:59,449
A pharmacist is stuck
in the pharmacy all day

583
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,036
- Did you follow your friends?
- No

584
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:04,657
- Did you consult your parents?
- No

585
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:07,830
- So you wanted to switch majors?
- Yes

586
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:12,255
How would you describe yourself?

587
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:15,421
I'd say I'm a cheerful person

588
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:17,962
Why do you think you're cheerful?

589
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:22,891
My friends seem to have fun
when they're around me

590
00:54:23,021 --> 00:54:25,393
How many friends do you have?

591
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:28,061
I'm friends with everyone in my class

592
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:29,817
And you still meet regularly?

593
00:54:29,944 --> 00:54:31,189
Yes

594
00:54:32,155 --> 00:54:34,776
Do you play any sports?

595
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:36,947
- I can play basketball
- Can you draw?

596
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:38,654
What position do you play?

597
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:40,495
Centre

598
00:54:40,622 --> 00:54:43,113
Why did you choose to play centre?

599
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:47,995
A centre doesn't need to be tall

600
00:54:49,714 --> 00:54:52,466
Do you prefer triangles,
squares or circles?

601
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:54,336
Circles

602
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:56,627
What colour would you like it to be?

603
00:54:56,763 --> 00:54:58,471
A clear colour

604
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:01,635
What colour is your clear colour?

605
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:03,844
Clear like a glass

606
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:06,102
What would you like it to be made from?

607
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:07,511
From glass

608
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:09,689
What if there isn't any glass?

609
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:11,312
Plastic, I guess

610
00:55:13,196 --> 00:55:15,272
Can you sit up straight, please?

611
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,696
- Are you right or left-handed?
- Right-handed

612
00:55:17,826 --> 00:55:21,906
Can I see your right hand?
Stretch your arm out

613
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:27,044
Clench your fist. Clench it tight

614
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:29,292
Tighter. Just a bit

615
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,724
Thank you

616
00:55:48,732 --> 00:55:52,066
- Do you have any pets?
- I used have to have a cat

617
00:55:52,194 --> 00:55:53,772
And now?

618
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:55,482
It's dead

619
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,027
What does DDT stand for?

620
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,240
Pardon?

621
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:04,122
What does DDT stand for?

622
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,458
Is it...

623
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:21,930
...'Destroy Dirty Things'?

624
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:38,980
Take this note to Dr Natreprakai
on the 8th Floor

625
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:43,944
Don't peek at it, Doctor

626
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:49,702
- Is there anything else?
- I'll be off, then

627
00:56:59,345 --> 00:57:01,753
Sorry to keep you waiting

628
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,681
Do you want some tea?

629
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:17,898
Doctor...

630
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,522
...I brought you a little present

631
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:26,826
It's too much. You shouldn't have

632
00:57:27,623 --> 00:57:29,663
Please take it

633
00:57:31,002 --> 00:57:32,662
Thank you

634
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:44,174
I'm a stubborn person. Wherever I go,
I have to take my bolster pillow

635
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:46,763
I need to hug it or I can't sleep

636
00:57:46,893 --> 00:57:50,938
I wrap my legs around it
and rest my head on it

637
00:57:51,064 --> 00:57:54,184
- You're very attached to it
- You could say so

638
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:57,152
That night...

639
00:57:57,278 --> 00:58:00,445
...I dreamt a chicken flock
came to tell me...

640
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:04,992
...that they wanted me to suffer

641
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:11,290
But I forgive them. I've offered prayers
for them for many years

642
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:16,127
But they won't forgive me.
I guess they want revenge

643
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:19,956
I was scared
and ran away from them...

644
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:23,628
...but they came flying after me

645
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:25,922
I kept on running

646
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:31,728
Suddenly I felt like I'd grown wings
and become a chicken

647
00:58:32,606 --> 00:58:34,931
But it was only a dream

648
00:58:35,066 --> 00:58:36,976
When I woke up in a fright...

649
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,648
...I found myself on the floor...

650
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,650
...my arms and legs
pinned beneath me

651
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:46,033
My whole body was aching

652
00:58:46,161 --> 00:58:48,201
Is it from eating chicken?

653
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:50,821
Or do you think it's bad karma?

654
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:52,665
Do you eat a lot of chicken?

655
00:58:53,669 --> 00:58:55,994
Come to think of it, quite a bit

656
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:58,288
I've been meaning to quit

657
00:58:58,423 --> 00:59:01,792
- I agree. You should stop
- Or I'll have double karma

658
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:03,884
Or reduce the amount you eat

659
00:59:04,012 --> 00:59:09,802
Poultry is very high in cholesterol

660
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:13,019
It contains a lot of fat and uric acid...

661
00:59:13,147 --> 00:59:17,939
...that collect in your joints
if you eat too much...

662
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:20,820
...and it makes them ache

663
00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:26,023
Therefore, you must try
to cut down if you can

664
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,288
Eat more fruit and vegetables instead

665
00:59:30,414 --> 00:59:32,323
They have more nutritional value

666
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:37,748
They're high in fibre, calcium
and can ward off disease

667
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,964
They also help ease constipation

668
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:47,011
Being regular can help clear your mind

669
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:49,677
You won't feel dizzy or confused

670
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:52,644
Then I should stop eating chicken

671
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,557
Yes, that's right

672
00:59:55,689 --> 01:00:02,855
My aches and pains...
Can you stop them?

673
01:00:02,988 --> 01:00:07,200
Of course. You could have
what's called Panic Disorder

674
01:00:07,326 --> 01:00:09,651
That stems from your own imagination...

675
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:12,622
...from your inner fears,
from your mind

676
01:00:12,748 --> 01:00:15,239
Or it could also be genetic

677
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,288
When you fell out of bed
onto the floor...

678
01:00:20,423 --> 01:00:26,212
...it might have triggered
some latent diseases to resurface

679
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,430
Will you give me some pills?

680
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:33,056
Yes, but let me take
some more blood tests...

681
01:00:33,186 --> 01:00:36,970
...to determine the exact cause

682
01:00:37,106 --> 01:00:39,811
Hold on a second, Doctor

683
01:00:39,942 --> 01:00:41,401
What is it?

684
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:52,702
Boil these roots and drink them

685
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,701
They'll give you a kinder heart

686
01:00:56,834 --> 01:01:00,618
But I'm already kind to all my patients

687
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:04,883
These roots also help to reduce...

688
01:01:06,135 --> 01:01:09,884
...inconsequential thoughts

689
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:14,261
Bad, inconsequential thoughts
gather in our brain

690
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:16,517
Drink this and you'll feel better

691
01:01:16,646 --> 01:01:19,433
I see...

692
01:01:19,566 --> 01:01:21,605
It also reduces your memory

693
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:23,858
Reduces my memory?

694
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:25,446
If I drink it...

695
01:01:25,572 --> 01:01:27,814
...then I won't remember who you are?

696
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:31,318
That's OK. We each have our calling

697
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:33,362
We have to follow our own paths

698
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:36,034
Take him, for example

699
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:41,243
Sakda, tell the doctor...

700
01:01:41,379 --> 01:01:44,713
...about the asthma... asthma

701
01:01:45,342 --> 01:01:50,965
His mother has had asthma
for some time

702
01:01:51,097 --> 01:01:54,846
Sakda, tell us about her condition

703
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:58,016
Tell me about your mother's asthma...

704
01:01:58,146 --> 01:02:00,554
...so I can make her better

705
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:08,895
How long has your mother had asthma?

706
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:18,930
Rinse your mouth

707
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:53,756
I prefer it off

708
01:03:55,973 --> 01:03:57,302
Open your mouth

709
01:04:03,064 --> 01:04:05,222
I'd like to rinse my mouth

710
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:16,490
Just a second, Doctor

711
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:20,677
Open your mouth

712
01:05:56,178 --> 01:05:58,301
Would you like some tea?

713
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:34,379
Where are you two going?

714
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,633
To have lunch

715
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:57,174
Good. Keep walking.
Maintain your distance

716
01:08:50,312 --> 01:08:52,637
It's OK. I'll catch up

717
01:09:49,747 --> 01:09:50,992
OK, I've dialled

718
01:09:55,044 --> 01:09:57,831
What a trendy ring tone

719
01:09:57,963 --> 01:09:59,873
My girlfriend set it for me

720
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:01,252
Pretty, young Joy?

721
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:05,006
Hello

722
01:10:12,061 --> 01:10:14,054
Be careful. These steps are old

723
01:10:16,357 --> 01:10:19,940
Army doctors have to do their rounds
down here every Friday

724
01:10:22,154 --> 01:10:25,488
Just make sure it doesn't affect
your other cases

725
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,451
The basement is resered
for military patients...

726
01:10:37,587 --> 01:10:40,541
...war veterans and their relatives

727
01:10:40,673 --> 01:10:42,582
Everyone is a relative

728
01:10:43,092 --> 01:10:45,049
I know. Small country, huh?

729
01:10:49,682 --> 01:10:53,466
Oh, there's another way down.
At the fork just now, take a right

730
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:47,776
Where's your father, Off?

731
01:11:51,077 --> 01:11:53,070
He went to get the X-ray results

732
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:56,283
You're looking better

733
01:12:00,128 --> 01:12:01,457
Lower

734
01:12:03,924 --> 01:12:06,462
Try it

735
01:12:06,593 --> 01:12:09,214
Lower. More. More

736
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,231
Be patient

737
01:12:28,198 --> 01:12:29,527
Very good

738
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:44,036
How's everyone back home
these days?

739
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:49,049
Your old neighbours
sold their house and moved away

740
01:12:49,178 --> 01:12:50,802
They sold it?

741
01:12:50,929 --> 01:12:54,215
- Where did they move?
- To Cha-am

742
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,389
I see. What about your sister?

743
01:12:56,518 --> 01:12:58,641
She's living with her boyfriend

744
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:01,262
I see. And how about you?

745
01:13:01,398 --> 01:13:03,225
I'm living with her as well

746
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:06,692
I see. What rank are you now?

747
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,065
First Lieutenant

748
01:13:08,197 --> 01:13:11,862
- Lieutenant already? That's pretty fast
- Yes

749
01:13:11,992 --> 01:13:15,990
You used to be such a naughty boy.
Very naughty

750
01:13:16,122 --> 01:13:18,613
You used to sling mud at my house

751
01:13:18,749 --> 01:13:20,125
I'm really sorry

752
01:13:20,251 --> 01:13:21,662
It's Dr Nant

753
01:13:24,463 --> 01:13:26,670
- This is Dr Nant
- Hello

754
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:29,716
This is Dr Nohng, the haematologist

755
01:13:30,803 --> 01:13:35,346
We were just saying it's rare
to meet a male haematologist

756
01:13:35,474 --> 01:13:38,890
That's right. Why did you
decide to specialise?

757
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,855
My sister has alpha thalassaemia

758
01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:45,640
So I had an interest in this field

759
01:13:45,776 --> 01:13:48,398
And you can take care of her?

760
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:50,688
Then you must carry the gene as well

761
01:13:50,823 --> 01:13:55,319
That's not always the case,
you have to do a blood test

762
01:13:55,453 --> 01:13:56,864
I've checked. I carry the gene

763
01:13:56,996 --> 01:13:58,277
- Oh...
- Really?

764
01:13:58,414 --> 01:13:59,612
Would you allow me?

765
01:13:59,749 --> 01:14:01,208
Sure

766
01:14:04,379 --> 01:14:05,956
Is he pale?

767
01:14:06,089 --> 01:14:07,713
- Not really, Doctor
- Really?

768
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,667
- Do you feel fatigued?
- No

769
01:14:09,801 --> 01:14:11,461
- But you can't be sure
- Right

770
01:14:11,594 --> 01:14:14,263
There are active and passive carriers

771
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:16,512
That's why I always say...

772
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:19,214
...obstetricians live with birth...

773
01:14:19,352 --> 01:14:22,555
...oncologists live with death...

774
01:14:22,689 --> 01:14:27,185
- ... but haematologists live with suffering
- Most are women

775
01:14:27,318 --> 01:14:32,027
- Because blood diseases can't be cured
- They can't be cured

776
01:14:32,157 --> 01:14:34,066
The patient suffers a lot

777
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,608
What are you doing, Doctor?

778
01:14:38,121 --> 01:14:40,742
Isn't it a bit early for that?

779
01:14:40,874 --> 01:14:44,408
She knows what to do. See?

780
01:14:45,086 --> 01:14:46,878
What's this, Doctor?

781
01:14:47,005 --> 01:14:48,582
There are three of us

782
01:14:48,715 --> 01:14:50,542
- I'll get it
- You don't have to help her

783
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:52,834
- Did you go to the Red Cross Fair?
- Not yet

784
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:56,884
It's quite extravagant this year
with lots of bands performing

785
01:14:57,015 --> 01:14:58,889
He won't go

786
01:14:59,017 --> 01:15:01,888
- There's no Karaoke
- That's not true

787
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:04,393
Don't call me an alcoholic

788
01:15:04,523 --> 01:15:08,354
I have to go on TV this evening

789
01:15:08,485 --> 01:15:11,770
She's a guest speaker
on public TV every week

790
01:15:11,905 --> 01:15:14,574
It's always like this

791
01:15:14,699 --> 01:15:16,692
I've gone on TV a lot...

792
01:15:16,827 --> 01:15:19,863
...but I'm still not used to the cameras

793
01:15:19,996 --> 01:15:25,038
I don't drink much,
just enough to get me tipsy

794
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:27,624
- As always
- That's why you look so nice today

795
01:15:27,754 --> 01:15:29,747
I have to prepare my own wardrobe...

796
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:34,709
...because public TV
doesn't have enough money

797
01:15:34,845 --> 01:15:39,092
I try to help, but their sets
are so old-fashioned

798
01:15:39,224 --> 01:15:43,601
I asked them to use a blue screen
and matte in flowers...

799
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:46,054
...but they wouldn't take my advice

800
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:49,309
Oh, Dr Neng, come on in

801
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:52,776
There are staff outside
waiting to use this room

802
01:15:52,905 --> 01:15:55,146
Really? Tell them to come in then

803
01:15:55,282 --> 01:15:57,322
We're just chatting

804
01:15:57,451 --> 01:15:58,993
They've already left, Doctor

805
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:03,615
Really? Then why don't you join us?

806
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:07,454
You, too, young man

807
01:16:07,586 --> 01:16:10,160
- Come inside
- Off, come here

808
01:16:10,297 --> 01:16:12,539
- Come in
- Are you appearing on TV again today?

809
01:16:12,675 --> 01:16:14,169
Yes, in the evening

810
01:16:14,301 --> 01:16:17,006
- Is this Sant's son?
- Yes

811
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,177
- He's good looking, huh?
- He's my patient

812
01:16:19,306 --> 01:16:20,635
I see

813
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:24,515
- What's wrong with him?
- Carbon monoxide poisoning

814
01:16:25,604 --> 01:16:27,396
Isn't he better yet?

815
01:16:27,523 --> 01:16:30,228
Not yet. I've been treating him
for several months

816
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:32,233
That's strange

817
01:16:33,237 --> 01:16:36,024
Do you mind if I take a look?

818
01:16:44,457 --> 01:16:48,537
- What are you doing, Doctor?
- Chakra healing

819
01:16:48,669 --> 01:16:51,587
I channel energy from the sun

820
01:16:51,714 --> 01:16:54,419
The top of his head is a Chakra centre

821
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:58,133
I'm going to transfer my energy to him

822
01:16:59,847 --> 01:17:01,674
I've seen this done before

823
01:17:01,807 --> 01:17:05,508
Close your eyes

824
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:10,138
I want you to imagine a picture...

825
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:14,568
...of yourself walking through a forest

826
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:17,365
There is a large waterfall...

827
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:21,155
...and a crystal-clear stream

828
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:24,322
The water is very cool

829
01:17:24,455 --> 01:17:27,990
Try raising both your arms

830
01:17:28,126 --> 01:17:31,459
Slowly. Slowly raise them

831
01:17:31,587 --> 01:17:37,293
Take both hands
and dip them into the stream

832
01:17:37,427 --> 01:17:39,336
Dip them in

833
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,044
Now both your hands...

834
01:17:42,181 --> 01:17:44,388
...will suck up the water...

835
01:17:44,517 --> 01:17:47,055
...the water from the stream...

836
01:17:47,187 --> 01:17:49,594
...up into your head

837
01:17:50,356 --> 01:17:51,767
Into your head...

838
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,307
...and all around

839
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:58,355
The water inside your head...

840
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:01,407
...will wash away everything...

841
01:18:01,534 --> 01:18:04,156
...and vaporise into the sky

842
01:18:04,871 --> 01:18:08,738
Right, now, you have a fresh mind

843
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:11,448
It's clear...

844
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,958
...as clear as crystal

845
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,662
Your mind is refreshed

846
01:18:17,217 --> 01:18:19,886
You have a fresh mind now

847
01:18:21,304 --> 01:18:23,712
OK. Now lower your arms

848
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:27,090
Let's see. Open your eyes

849
01:18:28,061 --> 01:18:29,769
How do you feel?

850
01:18:31,231 --> 01:18:33,188
- Better?
- I didn't feel anything

851
01:18:35,735 --> 01:18:40,148
For chakra, don't your hands go here?

852
01:18:40,907 --> 01:18:43,908
Only if you get a massage
and a hand job!

853
01:18:44,036 --> 01:18:48,247
But isn't this what they showed us
in the seminar?

854
01:18:48,373 --> 01:18:51,327
I think you must be confused

855
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,626
- What?
- Here, have a drink of this

856
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:57,839
- Can I be excused?
- It's OK

857
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:00,876
Let him go, Doctor

858
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:03,882
I've tried this waterfall trick before

859
01:19:04,014 --> 01:19:07,050
Really? Why didn't you tell me?

860
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,220
Are you selling Red Cross T-shirts?

861
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:14,138
Yes, this year we have two styles

862
01:19:14,274 --> 01:19:17,228
- Very nice. How much are they?
- 200 baht

863
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:35,542
Can I see your racquet?

864
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:44,054
You could join the national team with this

865
01:20:10,122 --> 01:20:12,696
Good thing she didn't scold you

866
01:20:15,586 --> 01:20:17,994
Who brought you to the hospital?

867
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,043
My dad

868
01:20:24,595 --> 01:20:26,303
Does your girlfriend visit you?

869
01:20:46,701 --> 01:20:48,528
Is that a tattoo on your neck?

870
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:53,950
Can I see it?

871
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:56,744
Open it more

872
01:20:59,213 --> 01:21:01,290
Pan...

873
01:21:01,424 --> 01:21:03,215
Panda?

874
01:21:07,555 --> 01:21:09,180
Pandara?

875
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:11,548
Pandora

876
01:21:11,684 --> 01:21:13,642
I see. Pandora

877
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:16,763
Is it the name of a band?

878
01:21:21,319 --> 01:21:23,228
Still studying?

879
01:21:24,781 --> 01:21:26,441
Not right now

880
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:31,161
I was working in a car factory

881
01:21:33,206 --> 01:21:34,369
Japanese cars?

882
01:21:42,173 --> 01:21:44,332
But I've stopped working

883
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:46,756
I've planned out my life

884
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:50,631
But it'll take longer than for most people

885
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:52,850
A year longer

886
01:21:55,729 --> 01:21:57,271
What do you mean?

887
01:22:01,902 --> 01:22:03,775
Well, my brain is...

888
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,837
Maybe in my next life

889
01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:27,259
What will you be in your next life?

890
01:22:30,389 --> 01:22:31,931
Human, I guess

891
01:22:37,354 --> 01:22:39,228
A man or a woman?

892
01:22:42,151 --> 01:22:43,645
A man

893
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:46,607
How come?

894
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:51,983
In my last life, I was also a man

895
01:23:11,847 --> 01:23:13,472
How are you feeling, Off?

896
01:23:17,436 --> 01:23:18,765
- Hello, Doctor
- Hello

897
01:23:18,896 --> 01:23:21,304
- Where is Dr Neng?
- Inside the room

898
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:49,713
Hey, when did you get here?

899
01:24:49,839 --> 01:24:52,875
A while ago.
I've been watching you

900
01:24:53,009 --> 01:24:55,630
Been following me?

901
01:25:03,519 --> 01:25:04,895
What is it?

902
01:25:05,897 --> 01:25:07,391
Who did you buy this for?

903
01:25:09,358 --> 01:25:11,066
Is it for me?

904
01:25:11,986 --> 01:25:13,943
But it's too big for me

905
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:33,919
Do you want it?

906
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:10,373
Look, my palms are sweaty again

907
01:26:13,632 --> 01:26:15,007
Are you tired?

908
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:17,837
From what?

909
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:19,463
From kissing

910
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,979
Wow, you can see
my house from here

911
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:34,231
- Really?
- Yeah, it's over there

912
01:26:34,861 --> 01:26:37,566
Next to the tree by the round building

913
01:26:37,697 --> 01:26:39,405
I see

914
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:47,656
Remember my company trip last week?

915
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,623
We toured the new plant in Cholburi

916
01:26:50,752 --> 01:26:53,160
- It's very large
- What's that picture?

917
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:55,548
It's nothing

918
01:26:57,384 --> 01:27:00,005
I'd like to move there. It's so modern

919
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:04,264
It looks good

920
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:07,594
It's so hi-tech, like a brand new city

921
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:10,803
They're also building a hospital

922
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:14,139
You want me to apply for a transfer?

923
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,902
Would you?

924
01:27:20,115 --> 01:27:22,689
When does your company move?

925
01:27:24,662 --> 01:27:26,535
Probably sometime next year

926
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:31,750
Your entire department?

927
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:41,379
Won't you go?

928
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:49,012
Nohng...

929
01:27:55,985 --> 01:27:58,357
Don't you have English lessons today?

930
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,657
It's close by the sea, too

931
01:28:06,287 --> 01:28:08,992
Don't try to tempt me with nature

932
01:28:27,683 --> 01:28:29,308
What?

933
01:28:30,308 --> 01:28:40,308
