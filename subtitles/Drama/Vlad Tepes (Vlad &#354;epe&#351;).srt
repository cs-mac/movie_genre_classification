1
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,023
The army of the Ottoman Empire was defeated 
by Iancu of Hunedoara in Belgrade.

2
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:32,266
Three days later the hero died of the plague
in front of the freed citadel.

3
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:37,008
Taking advantage of this opportunity,
Mehmed II, the Conqueror of Constantinople,

4
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:39,714
prepared to give Europe a deadly strike.

5
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:44,184
Weakened by fights for the throne
among the successors of Mircea the Old

6
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:49,599
and by the feudal anarchy of the great boyars,
Wallachia seemed an easy prey for the Conqueror.

7
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:49,882
Who are you?

8
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:51,382
We are free countrymen
from near Targoviste.

9
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:54,826
We are going to Iancu de Hunedoara.
We want him to take us into his army.

10
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:58,061
I will lead you to Iancu's Captain.
He should decide.

11
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:00,094
Iancu de Hundoara is dead.

12
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:02,883
And with him died the promise of help.

13
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:06,440
I don't wait for anything from anyone.

14
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,865
The circumstances are favorable though

15
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,593
the king and the sultan
don't have time for Wallachia now.

16
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:17,619
I have been following you faithfully,
since you were a child. Command me.

17
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:18,779
Go into villages.

18
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:23,805
Tell them the time has come for them
to gather near the border of Wallachia.

19
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:27,254
Only those should come for whom liberty
is more precious than life.

20
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:29,911
Judging by the riots
of last winter,

21
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,976
I could gather
the whole of Transylvania.

22
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:35,567
3000 Romanians are enough.

23
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,153
Death to Draculea!

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,672
Long live Your Highness!

25
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,239
- Who killed him?
- Me, Your Highness.

26
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,671
Did you have an arrangement?

27
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,340
I did it by myself.

28
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,852
I smoothed your way
to the throne.

29
00:04:56,972 --> 00:05:00,113
Bury him with the honors
due to a lord.

30
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:04,419
And he... should perish
by the spear he has killed with.

31
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,853
Why, Your Highness?
If I hadn't done it, you would.

32
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:13,836
I haven't sworn
to be faithful to him.

33
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:26,265
Untie them.

34
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,176
Have you any news?

35
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,711
Yes, I have news.

36
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:40,222
Various factions are fighting for 
the throne and the country is in chaos.

37
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:44,891
As a successor of Mircea the Great
you should know that.

38
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:47,103
Give him his sword.

39
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:49,808
You have carried it with honor.

40
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:00,855
Let us swear to be faithful
to His Highness.

41
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:49,168
Tell me boyars

42
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:53,522
How many lords have sat on this throne
since my grandfather Mircea died?

43
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:54,400
Six.

44
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:57,552
Seven, eight.

45
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:58,952
More, Your Highness.

46
00:06:59,072 --> 00:06:59,777
Ten.

47
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,420
Not even you know how many.

48
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,232
You have urged the ones
against the others.

49
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:11,211
You have impelled them
to look abroad for help.

50
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:19,503
Us, Mircea Voievod lord of
the whole Ungro-Wallachia country

51
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:24,390
of the territories over the mountains
of the Tartar territories

52
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:27,400
and Prince of Amlas and Fagaras

53
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,978
lord of Banat in Severin

54
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:34,310
and on both sides of the Danube
up to the big sea

55
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,350
and sole lord of Dirstor Citadel...

56
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:43,005
what happened to his inheritance?

57
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:47,371
Where are the territories?
Over the mountains?
Where are Amlas and Fagaras?

58
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:49,342
Where is the big sea?

59
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:56,787
Not even 50 years have passed since the lords 
were vassals to the King of Hungary,

60
00:07:56,907 --> 00:08:00,041
and tributaries to Mehmed.
Servants of two masters.

61
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,656
This is what this country has become
as a consequence of your reckless actions.

62
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:06,980
Your Highness came to the country
to kill the Lord and replace him,

63
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,490
The country is a shadow
of what it used to be.

64
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,771
When I crossed the mountains I did not come
against a country but against a shadow.

65
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:17,271
I came not to kill a Lord
but the shadow of a shadow.

66
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:18,671
The Lords were helpless.

67
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:22,468
You have ruled after Mircea's death.
You have changed the Lords.

68
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:26,251
They did not know
to hew you in time.

69
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,156
Do it Your Highness.

70
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:32,947
No.

71
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,730
I won't judge you now.

72
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,839
Too many heads would fall.

73
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,191
I am asking you one thing.

74
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,053
You have brought the country to
where it is now, you take it 
to where it should be.

75
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:58,544
Let us take it, Your Highness.

76
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:04,184
- What is your command?
- Open the prison gates.

77
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:09,602
Those who were sentenced to death
shall regain their lives.

78
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:12,583
Those who were imprisoned
shall regain their freedom.

79
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,791
Everybody's mistakes
will be forgiven,

80
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,870
whatever they are.

81
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,618
From now on,
all robberies, rapes,

82
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:25,439
lies, treachery,

83
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,481
will be punished by beheading.

84
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:33,273
Forgive me, Your Highness,
this is good when taking the throne

85
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,364
But afterwards wouldn't it
seem be too harsh?

86
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:38,374
Harsh?

87
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,703
Why harsh?

88
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,835
All souls should know what I am asking.
And what is waiting for them.

89
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,585
Each man should be his own judge.

90
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:54,895
To decide for himself if he stays
or leaves this world.

91
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,967
And as he decides, so be it.

92
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:02,432
What could be more right than this?

93
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,064
<i>He's right. This is fair.</i>

94
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:09,198
And what else do you command,
Your Highness?

95
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,678
A new administration,

96
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:16,096
"Armashia".
To ensure the fulfillment of the royal orders.

97
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:17,876
Anything else?

98
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:20,700
That's enough for today.

99
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,731
Very good, Your Highness.

100
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,929
Let it be as you wish.

101
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:28,103
If this is your will...

102
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:32,871
Who will have the honor
to be the armash?

103
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,148
You.

104
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,688
What should he oversee?

105
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,071
The princes and 
the country's council

106
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:11,552
oversee everything.

107
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,561
It's not they who are
in Your Highness's hands,

108
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:13,286
but Your Highness who
is in their hands.

109
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,098
Nobody should be watching over them?

110
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:19,385
Over the princes?
The council?

111
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:26,288
I don't want to see the country through
their eyes, but to know it as it is.

112
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:30,083
I only have two hands and two eyes,
and I would need a thousand.

113
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:33,534
A thousand good eyes
are hard to gather.

114
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,634
Take 300 of the horsemen I came with.

115
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:39,378
Gather all the reliable men you know.

116
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,341
Spread them over the fairs,
villages and roads.

117
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:46,134
Nothing should happen in the country
without me knowing about it.

118
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:48,877
The boyars won't want them on their estates.

119
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:52,381
They can raise their flags and stand against me.

120
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,026
Who would I face them with?
With the princely army.

121
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,811
The princely army
is made up of boyar's men.

122
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:59,107
There is no other princely army.

123
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:07,853
Haven't you seen it
with your own eyes?

124
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:10,631
Haven't you had a rope
around your neck?

125
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,662
Do you think I came here
to play the prince?

126
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:16,260
I gave you a sword.
Handle it.

127
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,877
But be aware, it has 2 blades.

128
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:25,831
If you are a good man, don't be afraid.
If you're not, your head will fall first.

129
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,486
Too many strange things in one day.

130
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:32,271
But one has put an end to everything.

131
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:35,471
We have gone into battle with a prince
and returned with another

132
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:36,958
whom nobody wanted.

133
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,195
He had hardly been on the throne
when he started to make bad decisions.

134
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,971
He is like a foal
harnessed for the first time

135
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,421
kicking and neighing.

136
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,093
This will last for a little while...

137
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:57,739
but he will get used to the harness,
the carriage and the coachmen.

138
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,958
Highway robbery.

139
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,993
They have stolen a few bales.

140
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:24,494
What did the guards do?
Exactly what they are doing right now.

141
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,254
We should have doubled the guards.

142
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:28,232
Here all the roads are insecure.

143
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:29,818
Bloody country!

144
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:43,093
We have been looking 
for you for an hour.

145
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:48,059
You taught me when I was a child
to get out at dawn,

146
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,902
and see how life and the country awake.

147
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:55,997
So early? Alone and without guards?
Without telling anyone?

148
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:58,475
Knowing full well 
how dangerous this is?

149
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,430
What shall I do if this 
is the lord's order?

150
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,721
Am I not supposed to obey?

151
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:40,057
Where are the councillors?

152
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,944
They come at noon, Your Highness.
This is the custom.

153
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,383
The custom?

154
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:49,204
Take the palace guards
and go get them.

155
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:58,106
Three German merchants from Brasov
want to see Your Highness.

156
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:00,750
They are waiting in the Chancellery.

157
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:21,362
- Are you a merchant or a captain?
- The roads are insecure, Your Highness,

158
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:26,282
haunted by all kinds of dawdlers.
They beg during the day and steal at night.

159
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:31,054
Last night they killed a servant and stole
some Turkish fabric and expensive cloths.

160
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:33,352
Four packs, Your Highness.

161
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:40,730
Ransack Targoviste and its surroundings.
Get the robbers.

162
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,514
You will get back all that
has been taken from you.

163
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:48,169
Take the merchants of Brasov a letter
to strengthen their privileges,

164
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:51,559
so that you can pass through 
Wallachia without problems,

165
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,502
towards the villages along the Danube.

166
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:57,928
The same for our merchants
towards Brasov or other places.

167
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:10,325
This country has to grow very fast
in order to be like other countries.

168
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,321
And you come at noon?

169
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:16,261
First your head and then the rest?

170
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,381
It is not your country, boyars.
You belong to this country.

171
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:30,377
And me as well,
I belong to this country.

172
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:33,626
One says Ladislau of Hungary,
not Hungary of Ladislau,

173
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:36,243
Kazimir of Poland,
not Poland of Kazimir.

174
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:41,158
If it weren't this way, the countries
would perish with their lords,

175
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:43,741
and with their boyars.

176
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,996
What happened, Your Highness?

177
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,251
Nothing happened.

178
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,140
This is a normal working day.

179
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:54,201
I want us to discuss
the country's business,

180
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:56,634
see what is to be done and do it.

181
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:06,016
The Turks rob near Giurgiu.

182
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:09,725
There was no agreement about
the borders of Turkish counties.

183
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:13,531
In this way began all robberies
in past years, from Giurgiu.

184
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,149
After that, they spread
across the Danube, to Braila.

185
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:17,868
We must stop them.

186
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:22,535
Gather two thousand horsemen
between Buzau and Braila.

187
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:24,619
We don't need war.

188
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,907
<i>Let there be peace.</i>

189
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:28,805
When you pay tribute to the sultan,
tell him about this.

190
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,898
That's how Ottoman and Hungarian law
was decided back in 1453,

191
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:34,804
when the peace treaty was signed.

192
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,136
Silence boyars!

193
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,254
Who is in command here?

194
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,089
Me or you?

195
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:52,056
Let the Hungarians make war with 
the Turks if this is their wish,

196
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,396
but not at our loss.

197
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:00,254
Who were the  boyars from 
the country's council of 1453?

198
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,147
We, and others...

199
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:11,352
Those of you who made the treaty
should pay for this, not me,

200
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,283
not the whole country.

201
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,135
Don't ask me to bring you tribute.

202
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:28,372
I'm King of Walachia,
not some weak messenger.

203
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:34,196
If peace is broken because of Your Highness,
both king and sultan will come for us.

204
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:37,977
The country hasn't enough power
to stay against them.

205
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:44,403
How can a country be powerful,
if it is divided into hundreds pieces?

206
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,656
Each of you considers himself
a king on his own estate.

207
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:50,203
Each of you does what he wants.

208
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,607
In a country like this,
you blow as a flame on a candle.

209
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,653
Free the army
which you came with.

210
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:00,970
The horsemen are wandering about
and disturbing the people.

211
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:02,220
No.

212
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:06,662
The horsemen will remain
on Throne's Citadel, always ready.

213
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,007
They will be an army of mercenaries.

214
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:11,628
Why do we need an army like this?

215
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,492
The boyars army aren't enough?

216
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:16,859
Not anymore.

217
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,654
The Turkish soldiers are mercenaries.

218
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:23,371
That's why Turkey is so strong.

219
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:26,268
The Hungarians have this kind of army, too.

220
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:30,136
In our times, the mercenaries form
the iron-strong core of the army.

221
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:33,016
They decide a war's fate.

222
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,009
-The country is poor.
-But you are wealthy!

223
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,874
Give the army all the men needed.

224
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:42,523
By free will.

225
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:46,100
Otherwise I'll send
the army to your estates,

226
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,804
to take for itself.

227
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,788
The country is poor?

228
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,774
Under Mircea the country wasn't like this.

229
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:56,890
How has it become poor since then?

230
00:20:58,496 --> 00:21:01,646
I don't want there to be poor people
in my country anymore.

231
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:05,788
Let's begin...
to promote artisanry and commerce,

232
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:08,966
because this is a country's
source of wealth.

233
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,918
Both our craftsmen and commerce
are weakened.

234
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,404
No strength at all.

235
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,662
Why?

236
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,505
How?

237
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:19,145
You don't know?

238
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,788
From today on,

239
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,663
the merchants and craftsmen
will obey only the king.

240
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:30,105
Those from the boyar's estates
will respond in front of boyars.

241
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:33,343
Don't the boyar lands
belong to Wallachia?

242
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:39,131
-There is the law of the land, Your Highness.
-Land is the same for everybody.

243
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:40,918
It feeds us...

244
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:43,330
is patient with us,

245
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:45,300
and protects us.

246
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:48,856
It's the only law known by the land.

247
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:53,687
Your Highness, what you're doing isn't good.
Boyars are the country's base.

248
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:57,348
If the foundation is weakened,
the country is too.

249
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:02,048
All that I have decided today,
is for the well-being of country.

250
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,075
If the country's well-being
isn't yours too... tell me now.

251
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:10,517
I know what I have to do.

252
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,457
Enough for today.

253
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:16,093
You should be there again early tomorrow.

254
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,200
Don't play with fire you boyars!

255
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:25,212
Please, I beg you, with all my soul.

256
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:27,516
Don't do it.

257
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:32,965
He's a wild horse, not a foal as you said.

258
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:38,309
If we let him, he will ruin
the harness and destroy the carriage.

259
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:42,814
When you arrive in Transylvania,
go to him and do what I have told you.

260
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:44,916
In secret. Yes, Your Highness.

261
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:50,002
The robberies have escalated in 
Targoviste and the neighboring villages.

262
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,902
We have caught some robbers
and we cut off their heads.

263
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,502
Others were hanged.

264
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:56,501
But many remain free,
Your Highness.

265
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:02,600
After today's punishment, they will lose
their appetite. They are frightened.

266
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,141
No trace of fear.

267
00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:08,366
Since this morning
all beggars, all dawdlers are merry.

268
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,406
They toast to you and... 
sing obscene songs.

269
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:16,957
The carrying out of justice
looks like a carnival.

270
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:22,911
- Let's choose only a few punishments.
- Which ones, and how?

271
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,465
They all have the same flaw.

272
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,846
They awaken the cruelty in people,
not the honesty.

273
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:32,575
Fina a punishment that does not 
personalize the victory of the good

274
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:36,156
which nobody finds out about,
and from which they don't learn.

275
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:37,672
What there is to learn - is in vain.

276
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,356
What do you command,
Your Highness?

277
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:41,269
Get me all the robbers in the country.

278
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:44,306
I don't think this is possible,
Your Highness.

279
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:48,430
Many of them withdraw to the boyar's 
estates when they are cornered.

280
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:52,443
We have no power there, yet.

281
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:58,182
Hm... The boyars again.

282
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,574
It would have been better 
to cut them off, Your Highness.

283
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:06,519
We are going through Bran Pass.
Back up the convoy.

284
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,432
How is it? All four
are untouched.

285
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:11,518
I didn't believe
we'd ever see them again.

286
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:15,329
We are starting!

287
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:20,630
Start!

288
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:22,951
Come on!

289
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:40,360
Don't do anything else
but what I told you.

290
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,114
Let there be everything
in abundance!

291
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,552
Nothing should be missing
from this princely feast.

292
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:49,108
And... Invite them all.

293
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:53,179
Come in, gentlemen!
Come in!

294
00:25:14,694 --> 00:25:16,246
.

295
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:33,410
.

296
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:39,703
.

297
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,229
.

298
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:56,377
Let's drink to His Highness!

299
00:25:56,497 --> 00:26:00,945
Long live Draculea. Long live
the ringleader of the beggars!

300
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:08,537
<i>Hey!</i>

301
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:10,269
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

302
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,143
Come, quickly!

303
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:15,962
<i>You have something against me?
Why are you throwing me out?</i>

304
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:18,310
<i>I don't want to go.
Leave me there to dance.</i>

305
00:27:19,452 --> 00:27:21,553
<i>Come, let's go outside.</i>

306
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:24,154
.

307
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,710
Don't hit me, leave me alone!

308
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,854
Help! Help!

309
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:34,713
<i>I want to remain.</i>

310
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,747
.

311
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:56,400
- Are there any courageous men left inside?
- None. As you ordered, Your Highness.

312
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,530
Then finish the work.

313
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,539
Understood, Your Highness.

314
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:31,497
All 2000 horsemen are between Buzau
and Braila and waiting for your orders.

315
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:39,975
<i>Long life to you.</i>

316
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:44,027
<i>God help Your Highness!
We pray for Your health.</i>

317
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:03,111
Are the roads to Targoviste
properly guarded?

318
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,973
Yes, as you commanded.

319
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:10,402
But Targoviste was left undefended.

320
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:15,664
Maybe you shouldn't go to Braila 
and leave Targoviste in the boyars' hands.

321
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:19,603
- Don't you trust boyars?
- No.

322
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,263
God help us.

323
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:39,075
Or the Devil...

324
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:54,254
Stay in peace.

325
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:57,066
It is boiling...
What are you making here?

326
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:59,153
Meat soup, Your Highness.

327
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:03,064
Throw out the foam, otherwise 
the food will lose its taste.

328
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,353
There are times when even a
nation's garbage wants to rise.

329
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,436
If it isn't thrown out,

330
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:14,168
it weakens the nation's strength
and deforms it.

331
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:16,871
For these kinds of things
a spoon is not enough.

332
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:18,837
I'll allow it to rise.

333
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:20,750
I'll even help it.

334
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:23,569
But I'll not let it go where it wants,

335
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:25,540
but where it deserves, instead.

336
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,084
He's on the way.
Stephen?

337
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:47,310
I'm glad you called me.

338
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,207
With whom do we fight?

339
00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:50,968
With Petru Aron.

340
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:52,663
But only you.

341
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:55,188
You should be at Suceva before he knows.

342
00:31:55,308 --> 00:31:57,099
On the Moldavian throne.

343
00:31:57,706 --> 00:32:00,467
Take the army.
I gathered it just for you.

344
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:03,969
- The Lower Country wants me as lord.
- I know.

345
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,181
First try to make peace 
and order in the country.

346
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:09,298
to secure peace
at the borders.

347
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:12,269
Something has changed
since Constantinople's fall.

348
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:16,172
We are trapped between 
the sultan and Hungary's king.

349
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:21,196
When they want to conquer, to oppress,
to take what is not theirs,

350
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:25,041
there is no difference between
Christians and Pagans.

351
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:29,321
Soon each of them will 
try to subdue us, smiling

352
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:32,899
and telling us... they want 
to protect us the other one.

353
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,948
There will be a bitter struggle.

354
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:38,820
Maybe it will last hundreds of years.

355
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:42,669
There's no wall that can protect us.

356
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:46,963
The walls of our resistance
should be inner ones.

357
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:49,797
In each of us.

358
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:51,710
- With this I've finished.
- I have not!

359
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:56,266
You spoke to me as to a lord,
I'll answer you as a lord.

360
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,290
Mountains protect me
from the king of Hungary.

361
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,886
I have a chain of citadels.

362
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,827
The Hotin, The Orhei,

363
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:05,711
Tighina, Soroca,
Alba Citadel

364
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:09,223
all protect me from
Tatar invasions.

365
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,399
Moldavia is safe, like in armor,
but one piece is still missing.

366
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,927
Chilia.

367
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:22,213
Now it's yours.
I want it back.

368
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:26,937
Without Chilia the heart of country
is exposed to Mohamed.

369
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:29,349
The citadel is mine just theoretically.

370
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:34,917
After Iancu's death the King of Hungary
replaced his soldiers with a garrison.

371
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:36,426
If I give it back to you,

372
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:39,246
it will give the king
a motive to start a war,

373
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,805
and I'm not prepared for this.

374
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:44,855
I will take it by sword.

375
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:47,138
You are not ready too.

376
00:33:52,016 --> 00:33:53,657
Let's wait...

377
00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:57,893
a while, make it seem
like a fight between us.

378
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,743
In this way nobody will be upset.

379
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:05,094
On the other hand,

380
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:22,014
there are the boyars.

381
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:25,242
They want to crown their own king.

382
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:29,858
They promise the sultan double 
tribute if he supports their choice.

383
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:34,288
I asked for those horsemen
to weaken their army,

384
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,124
not for starting a war with the Turks.

385
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:39,365
Now do you understand why?

386
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:44,841
I wanted nobody to perish.

387
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,671
God is my witness.

388
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:50,604
It's their choice.

389
00:34:51,137 --> 00:34:53,406
I'm going to scour my land.

390
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,602
- What is going on here?
- What you see.

391
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:30,121
Govora is a princely monastery.

392
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:32,154
-Who dared to touch it?
-Me!

393
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:35,198
And with me the entire
country's great princes.

394
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:38,317
I took out the sword to defend
the boyar's privileges.

395
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,325
We want Albu as our prince.

396
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:42,485
You'll pay with your head.

397
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:51,778
Draculea can't get here
sooner than three days.

398
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:54,429
In three days we'll be
ten times as many.

399
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:57,845
There are also the 2000 
horsemen who are on his side.

400
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:00,258
When they see what is going on,

401
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:03,421
they will raise their swords against
him and will be ready to fight.

402
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,382
Do you understand now
why I gave them to him?

403
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:10,145
To be the one who kills him.

404
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:14,454
Draculea! Draculea is coming!

405
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,023
Get out of my way!

406
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,108
.

407
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,743
Protect us, Your Holiness!

408
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,644
We are inside the holy church, Your Highness.

409
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:42,162
They should have come to the holy church
before, not after!

410
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:09,521
You shall not murder!

411
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:14,010
Love thy neighbor as you love yourself,

412
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,684
lead his soul towards righteousness.

413
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:19,738
I have to lead the country
towards righteousness.

414
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:25,126
Your Holiness should take care of the souls.

415
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:27,396
They are the business of every shepherd.

416
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,375
Each shepherd with his pipe.

417
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:32,641
From Your Highness's pipe
comes a pagan sound.

418
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:36,209
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not murder.

419
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:38,935
Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor.

420
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:42,361
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house
or anything that belongs to him.

421
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,673
For all to go well with you.

422
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,574
Do the holy commandments
sound like this or not?

423
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:51,182
You have learned them, Your Highness,
but you didn't understand them.

424
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:53,674
Have I ever done otherwise than being said?

425
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:56,176
Have I ever punished for a different flaw?

426
00:38:56,183 --> 00:38:58,182
From your holiness's pipe
comes pagan sounds,

427
00:38:58,183 --> 00:38:59,924
when you want to protect the lawless.

428
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:02,188
God does not wish for the sinner's death.

429
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:04,470
But for his righteousness, I know.

430
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,473
But if they are commandments,
let them be commandments.

431
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:09,719
In order to convert ten sinners
into righteous men, one man should die.

432
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,532
In order to convert 100, ten must perish.
Serving as an example.

433
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:17,744
In vain you ask the thief not to steal,
the killer not to kill.

434
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:20,211
Asking does not accomplish anything.

435
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,540
It is not the love of God
brings people to the church,

436
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,640
but fear of the hell's throes.

437
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:28,168
And Your Highness wants to embody them?

438
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:31,683
If you heed my orders
five of you will kill 100

439
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:36,632
A hundred will banish 10,000 and enemies
will die by the sword in front of you.

440
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:39,051
If you don't heed my orders...

441
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:43,072
I will come with rage and
punish you seven times for your sins.

442
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:47,883
You will perish, the land of your enemies 
will swallow you

443
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:52,183
Do you want me to wait cross-handed for this
punishment which means the country's death?

444
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:57,840
Mehmed is close. The country should confront
him like an invincible steel sword.

445
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:01,885
Swords are hardened through fire,
not words, your holiness.

446
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:05,542
-But not in hell's fire.
-I haven't another handy.

447
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:25,185
Impale them! For the whole country
to see and learn!

448
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:28,584
From now on,
this will be the only punishment.

449
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:34,348
The stake is for the lowest scum.
There are also boyars here, Your Highness.

450
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:39,733
Are there? Then mark my words:
don't put the prince near the craftsman,

451
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:43,827
the robber near the monk,
and the boyar near the common people.

452
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:48,364
Give each the stake 
appropriate to his class.

453
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:52,172
I want to be seen from afar
that my justice is the same for all!

454
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,569
Beg him to cut off my head.

455
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:44,930
He is my brother.

456
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:47,295
Do you want him by your side?

457
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:55,049
It is possible in one way: 
with you by his side.

458
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,365
I didn't want it,

459
00:42:20,062 --> 00:42:21,360
I don't want.

460
00:42:22,795 --> 00:42:24,504
But it is needed.

461
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:46,537
How else to separate
the wheat from the chaff?

462
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:49,816
I made everybody his own judge.

463
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:52,624
I've put the scales of justice
in their hands.

464
00:42:52,744 --> 00:42:56,249
But for some of them,
the scale has just one pan.

465
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:59,948
To swing impaled, if they want.

466
00:42:59,922 --> 00:43:02,045
The sooner, the better.

467
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:05,224
A rotten apple will spoil all the others.

468
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:10,122
I must not hesitate.
I must not blink.

469
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:14,205
If I don't do this,
everything will be lost.

470
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,187
My God...

471
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:22,500
Why me?

472
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:35,202
Your duty is to watch my sleep,
not disturb it.

473
00:43:47,663 --> 00:43:53,887
It is a miracle we escaped.
You said you wanted to trap him
and we all fell into his trap.

474
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,509
Look what has become of us:
no fortunes and no estates.

475
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:59,474
All we have left are our clothes.

476
00:43:59,594 --> 00:44:01,664
I lost more than you did.

477
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:07,505
- It is good that my head is on my shoulders.
- What use can you make of it?

478
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:15,263
Yes, one of Mircea the Old's men is here
in Transylvania, watching the throne.

479
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:21,359
We'll go to him, gather an army, 
and return to Targoviste led by him.

480
00:44:21,663 --> 00:44:25,377
Everything we lost
will be ours again and even more.

481
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,373
On your horses!

482
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:30,643
We need to appoint new prince.

483
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,935
According to the custom I should name them.

484
00:44:35,362 --> 00:44:37,866
I could also let you choose them.

485
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:42,848
I won't do either.

486
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:50,929
Each of you should ponder on a choice
and take the office he feels worthy for.

487
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,029
Think about it very well, thou.

488
00:44:55,394 --> 00:45:00,380
Those who choose themselves improperly,
I will get nearer to heaven.

489
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:03,840
And they will be the ones to blame.

490
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:48,654
Judge.

491
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,159
Treasurer.

492
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,504
Council Head.

493
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,035
Come on!
Let's get out of this hole.

494
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,367
-Who are you?
-But you?

495
00:46:55,674 --> 00:46:56,976
Szilagi's soldiers.

496
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:59,809
-You?
-Merchants from Wallachia.

497
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:03,180
-What you have in the carriages?
-Steel.

498
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:08,187
What a shame.

499
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:10,185
I think you are men of the King.

500
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:14,345
-What do you have against the King?
-Ladislau must leave the throne!

501
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:18,181
The Kingdom of Hungary's crown
is for Iancu of Hunedoara.

502
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:22,422
Iancu gave us fame.
Now all Christendom respects us much more.

503
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:25,524
His successors should be our Kings,
not an incompetent.

504
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:30,317
Szilagyi has sworn not to put the sword
into the sheath until he replaces the king
with Iancu's son.

505
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:32,156
And it will be as Szilagyi wants.

506
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:34,650
Aside from the powerful counts,
we all are on his side.

507
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,816
Should be mister,
I said otherwise?

508
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:40,849
- Are you passing through Brasov?
- Yes, through Brasov.

509
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:44,223
Take care, they are
are loyal to the King.

510
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:50,679
The Brasovenians have stopped the carriages 
and imprisoned the merchants.

511
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,196
Why?

512
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:15,053
Szilagy's revolt has extended
in whole downside of Transylvania.

513
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:19,996
Because of this we cannot give back
the carriages to His Highness.

514
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:24,823
Neither Valahia nor our Lord
has anything to do with Szilagy's revolt.

515
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,553
You didn't make any effort to stop it.

516
00:48:27,673 --> 00:48:31,207
As King's vassal His Highness
should intervene.

517
00:48:31,697 --> 00:48:35,459
If he doesn't, this means
he's on the side of the rebels.

518
00:48:36,154 --> 00:48:39,629
The goods of the rebels
or their supporters

519
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:41,450
are being seized by the King.

520
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:45,148
His Highness never agreed to any covenant
of vassalage with Hungary's King.

521
00:48:45,268 --> 00:48:49,285
This is one more evidence
that His Highness is against the King.

522
00:48:49,405 --> 00:48:53,686
We do not say this.
But the high royal princes say this.

523
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:58,817
So... as a proof of our benevolence
we'll free the merchants.

524
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:02,540
But we can't free the carriages
no matter how much we want.

525
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,969
The King will take us as rebels.

526
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:08,589
Regarding those fugitive boyars
that His Highness demands,

527
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:11,566
we can't touch them for the same reasons.

528
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:15,164
As long as they are in Transylvania
they are under the King's protection.

529
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:18,699
His Highness must ask for them
from the King.

530
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:22,550
Mhm, so this is the gratitude
of merchants from Brasov?

531
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:26,147
They want to force us to buy
tools and armament from them,

532
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:30,240
for which we pay ten times more.

533
00:49:30,587 --> 00:49:36,152
That's why they attacked us
and our iron and steel crafting.

534
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:38,702
Let's take away their privileges.

535
00:49:38,822 --> 00:49:39,670
No.

536
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:43,906
When you are pushed to get back
what you gave with one hand,

537
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:46,270
you ought to take back with the other one.

538
00:49:46,557 --> 00:49:52,130
The carriages are worth 100 times 
less than our merchandise.

539
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:56,205
Take their chariots
and give us the merchandise.

540
00:49:56,767 --> 00:50:00,020
From now on you won't pass
the customs at Wallachia

541
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,830
with merchandise that can be
found in our country as well.

542
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:10,683
You won't pass however much, but as much
as merchant from my country will go to Brasov

543
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,905
or through there towards other places.

544
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:21,486
Oxen, horses, wax, fabrics, copper,
silver, iron - are all found in Wallachia.

545
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:26,160
What else will we sell to the Turks?
Silver and gold lace?

546
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,110
You shouldn't have stopped
the carts.

547
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:31,915
Dracula was kind with us.

548
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:35,265
To a hand which reaches out to you,
you don't answer with a fist.

549
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:39,853
We had to stop them.
This road links the West and the East.

550
00:50:40,114 --> 00:50:43,367
What passes through our hands,
must stay in our hands.

551
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:47,055
If we share it, we share the earnings,
the wealth and the power.

552
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:50,128
There is no road.
Dracula cut it.

553
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:51,709
He cut it wrong.

554
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:59,332
The Turks sell veils to us, gems,
carpets, silk, lemon, rice, spices, oil.

555
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,156
Can we find any of this
merchandise in Wallachia?

556
00:51:03,276 --> 00:51:05,963
Buy all Turkish merchandise from the Danube.

557
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,800
Fill up the warehouses.

558
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,234
If we do not give merchandise in exchange,
we lose profit.

559
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:15,606
We'll raise the prices in the West
and blame Dracula for that.

560
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:19,744
Wherever you go, tell everyone
that he is a tyrant,

561
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:22,066
a devil thirsting for blood

562
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,981
and his only pleasure
is to impale innocent people.

563
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:28,778
Tell them that he is feasting
in front of the stakes,

564
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:32,415
and finds great pleasure
in seeing them suffering.

565
00:51:32,535 --> 00:51:36,081
Tell them he burnt the poor,
instead of being charitable.

566
00:51:36,447 --> 00:51:42,256
Tell them he slaughtered 300 merchants from 
Brasov together with their wives and children.

567
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:48,467
The merchants don't walk on the roads
with women and children, like the gypsies.

568
00:51:49,029 --> 00:51:50,577
Everybody knows that.

569
00:51:50,697 --> 00:51:56,432
Tell them once, twice or a hundred times
and they will end up believing you.

570
00:51:57,006 --> 00:52:01,966
Picture him as a demon, an evil spirit.
Turn the whole of Christendom against him.

571
00:52:02,526 --> 00:52:04,663
You slander a man.

572
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:07,845
You want to cover one evil with another.

573
00:52:07,965 --> 00:52:13,046
There is plenty of room for all merchants
from Brasov or Wallachia.

574
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,977
Send the carts with steel to Targoviste.

575
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:22,178
A delegation should go apologize
and everything should be as it used to.

576
00:52:22,298 --> 00:52:25,317
There is a war here,
without swords and spears.

577
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:28,881
In any war there is no room
for both us and them.

578
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,441
The law of war is one: either us or them.

579
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:38,320
How do we get to the Danube?
He won't allow all our merchants to pass.

580
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:41,082
Only a few.

581
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,925
It is enough that one of ours should pass.

582
00:52:44,045 --> 00:52:45,760
He will buy for all.

583
00:53:09,203 --> 00:53:11,381
Dad, why do they call him Draculea?

584
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:16,346
How else? Draculea - the son of Dracul (the devil), as they used to call his father - Vlad Dracul.

585
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:20,123
- Was he a devil?
- He was a man. A good man.

586
00:53:20,243 --> 00:53:22,842
If he was a good man,
why did they call him Dracul?

587
00:53:22,962 --> 00:53:24,629
Because he had a dragon around his neck.

588
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:27,142
What dragon?
Why are you fooling the boy?

589
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:30,378
-That was "dracon".
-Dragon. That's how call it His Highness.

590
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,125
He had received it from the Germans
and it was a sign of great honor.

591
00:53:33,245 --> 00:53:33,932
Dad!

592
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:35,326
What do you want?

593
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,098
Was it a dragon or not?

594
00:53:37,218 --> 00:53:42,196
It was as your grandad says, because he had been in the princely guards and knows better.

595
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,601
Silk, fabric. Buy cheap raisins!

596
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,674
What is their price?

597
00:54:21,794 --> 00:54:23,333
The same as ours.

598
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,185
The road is closed with 7 locks.

599
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:31,303
Only a sword could reopen it.

600
00:54:31,694 --> 00:54:33,585
Let's open it by sword.

601
00:54:37,855 --> 00:54:38,741
Us?

602
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:39,942
No.

603
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:51,049
To his majesty, the King of Hungary.

604
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:54,364
Who gave us the Duchy of Amlas and Fagaras.

605
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,140
Cheers!

606
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:58,423
Cheers!

607
00:55:05,763 --> 00:55:06,989
Gentlemen!

608
00:55:07,817 --> 00:55:12,369
Thank your king for his support
in conquering the throne of Wallachia,

609
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:15,955
which as a grandson of Mircea
I have the right to possess.

610
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,658
I will wait patiently the right time.

611
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:25,365
You have now all the high ranks,
Your Highness.

612
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:27,984
You have also chosen your administration.

613
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:30,471
It is a real princely court.

614
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:35,550
Just one thing is missing: the country.
But it will come...

615
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:47,206
Until then, address your needs to the
brave German merchants, who will help you.

616
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:56,608
What do you decide, Your Highness?

617
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,984
How can you make the most
of what was given to us?

618
00:55:59,373 --> 00:56:02,195
We must gather an army
and this means great expense.

619
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,677
Didn't you hear?

620
00:56:03,797 --> 00:56:07,514
The German merchants
will administer Amlas and Fagaras.

621
00:56:07,634 --> 00:56:10,882
It is the king's will.
Let them be bothered.

622
00:56:11,765 --> 00:56:17,373
To us they will assure our basic needs
and soldiers. When the time comes.

623
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:21,990
- What are we supposed to do, Your Highness?
- We'll go hunting.

624
00:56:23,316 --> 00:56:25,388
Look how far they pushed their bravery.

625
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:29,375
If Mircea the Old could knew that foreign
kings give Romanian land as reward

626
00:56:29,495 --> 00:56:33,199
to those with royal blood
in exchange for their loyalty

627
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:37,579
he would turn 7 times in his grave.
Let's send a messenger to the King.

628
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:40,305
To ask him to drive
these pretenders to the throne

629
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:42,721
out of our borders.

630
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:44,980
Why do you push the king in this matter?

631
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,406
You looked at the documents
from the office?

632
00:56:47,526 --> 00:56:51,303
Is there a treaty between us and king
to let him have Amlash or the Fagarash?

633
00:56:51,423 --> 00:56:52,310
None.

634
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,640
Surround the castle!

635
00:57:44,785 --> 00:57:47,772
Your Highness's cousin
is running pretty fast.

636
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:28,697
Quick, to Targosviste. Let His Highness know!

637
00:59:30,691 --> 00:59:34,497
Manzila, take half of the country's army,
join them with those from Targosviste

638
00:59:34,498 --> 00:59:36,344
and smash the Turks.

639
00:59:36,717 --> 00:59:38,345
A messenger from Szilagyi.

640
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:50,278
Szilagyi is sending word to Your Highness
that the king has asked for an armistice.

641
00:59:50,398 --> 00:59:52,888
Your cause with the merchants from Brasov
will be judged as well.

642
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:54,788
Their delegation will go to Sighisoara.

643
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,698
Let yours come as well.

644
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:00,667
Johanes Reuden - messenger of the bourg of Brasov.

645
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:11,913
The messengers of Wallachia.

646
01:00:25,486 --> 01:00:30,187
Mihai Szilagyi- captain of Belgrade citadel.

647
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:41,628
His excellency Albert, royal vice-chancellor,
Prepositor of the Archishop of Agria.

648
01:00:47,374 --> 01:00:53,975
I have largely exposed the injustice
done to the brave merchants of Brasov,

649
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:58,563
the persecutions they have been subjected to.

650
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:02,445
The cruelty of Dracula
has shaken the Christian world.

651
01:01:02,565 --> 01:01:07,139
If he would meet the Savior himself,
he would crucify Him a second time.

652
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:12,756
Why don't you say something about what
the merchants did against Wallachia?

653
01:01:13,111 --> 01:01:17,230
They had to respond to 
the persecutions that overwhelmed them.

654
01:01:17,462 --> 01:01:20,400
First he showed them
understanding and goodwill.

655
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:24,386
What they got is what they have asked for.

656
01:01:24,506 --> 01:01:28,161
We know the cause.
You don't need to say it once again.

657
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,928
You know it from the people of Brasov.

658
01:01:31,048 --> 01:01:32,693
Nobody listened to us.

659
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:35,454
My people spoke for you.

660
01:01:36,205 --> 01:01:40,278
You will give the people of Brasov
their former privileges back.

661
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:44,768
You will give them back all the merchandise
you have taken from them.

662
01:01:44,888 --> 01:01:48,584
Also, we oblige them
to give you back the carts with steel.

663
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:51,766
Let's make peace.

664
01:01:52,982 --> 01:01:53,870
Amen.

665
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:58,448
We will respect this armistice

666
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:01,974
if His Majesty the King
won't dispose otherwise.

667
01:02:03,424 --> 01:02:05,146
We are not signing.

668
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:10,511
First he should send away
the pretenders at the borders.

669
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:15,778
So that our merchants in Brasov have
the same rights as the ones in Wallachia.

670
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,028
Our brother Vlad  is right.

671
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,872
The things he asks will assure peace
at the borders of Transylvania.

672
01:02:29,171 --> 01:02:30,923
His will is my own.

673
01:02:33,028 --> 01:02:40,517
Either we do as he wants
or we don't sign the armistice.

674
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:43,437
What did you say?

675
01:02:43,557 --> 01:02:45,593
The armistice is for 3 months.

676
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:47,592
For how long have you
given them back their privileges?

677
01:02:47,712 --> 01:02:48,586
For three months.

678
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:50,728
Where is it so written? Where?

679
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:53,063
They will think it is forever.

680
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:57,070
I sent you to sign an armistice,
and you signed a peace treaty?

681
01:02:57,488 --> 01:02:59,834
That is why I came here to see you?

682
01:02:59,954 --> 01:03:01,963
For that I was sleepless?

683
01:03:06,608 --> 01:03:08,382
What happened to you?

684
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:14,583
You gave me my sword, Your Highness,
but not the wisdom required for a royal job.

685
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:18,991
Dismiss me from this rank
and name someone who is more competent.

686
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:24,331
What do you think that serving the country is?
An inn where you go in and out as you please?

687
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,886
There is no turning back here, for anybody.

688
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,572
There is only one way forward or up.

689
01:03:30,754 --> 01:03:32,162
You know where...

690
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:36,668
- Shall  prepare it, Your Highness?
- Not yet.

691
01:04:06,807 --> 01:04:10,707
Sir Benedict of Boytor,
messenger of Hungary's King.

692
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:30,495
Ladislau.... is dead.

693
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:34,959
Matthias Corvinus is now King of Hungary.

694
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:40,262
We wish Matthias to give greatness and
glory to the people who have chosen him.

695
01:04:41,162 --> 01:04:44,149
Like Iancu of Hunedoara did in his time.

696
01:04:44,944 --> 01:04:46,653
His glorious father.

697
01:04:47,629 --> 01:04:51,437
We shall do all in our power 
to make a durable peace.

698
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:53,410
A righteous one.

699
01:04:56,365 --> 01:04:59,704
His Majesty,
protector of Christianity,

700
01:05:00,226 --> 01:05:03,584
wants from Your Majesty to
make at Budapest

701
01:05:03,704 --> 01:05:05,649
the covenant of vassalage.

702
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:09,107
<i>Vassalage? What it this?
This is too much.</i>

703
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,681
His Majesty has just ascended the throne.

704
01:05:19,502 --> 01:05:22,267
He doesn't protect anybody yet.

705
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:34,086
I'm the king of a country which
is free and I want it to stay as it is.

706
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:39,032
I'm an ally and brother in arms against
the dangers that threaten us both.

707
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,561
But not vassal.

708
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:44,697
I'll never be a vassal to anybody.
Never!

709
01:06:07,868 --> 01:06:10,094
The day riding, the night riding.

710
01:06:10,214 --> 01:06:11,627
No home.

711
01:06:12,275 --> 01:06:14,135
I am sick of this job.

712
01:06:14,255 --> 01:06:17,710
It happens to all princes. We all are tired.

713
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:23,512
You can't say that His Highness
spares us or is very grateful.

714
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,007
We will both end up impaled.

715
01:06:27,614 --> 01:06:28,615
I know.

716
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,732
Are you okay with this?

717
01:06:31,598 --> 01:06:33,124
I have no choice.

718
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:36,959
You can always choose.

719
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:39,736
We only live once.

720
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:49,177
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

721
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:52,866
Both of us will die
just before we make a move.

722
01:06:52,986 --> 01:06:55,384
This can be done without danger.

723
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:58,294
The others will kill us, afterwards.

724
01:06:58,553 --> 01:07:01,727
The boyars who don't want a war
against the Turks are on our side.

725
01:07:01,847 --> 01:07:03,448
- How many?
- Enough.

726
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:07,554
Those in Amlas and Fagaras will be
with us as soon as we let them know.

727
01:07:07,814 --> 01:07:09,440
They know how to be grateful.

728
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,212
-Why don't they do that?
-They can't do it.

729
01:07:12,535 --> 01:07:17,218
The guards are with him all the time.
It is easier for us to find him alone.

730
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:20,623
The best thing would be
when he is saying his prayers.

731
01:07:20,743 --> 01:07:22,125
Does he pray?

732
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:25,375
For hours, at night.

733
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:27,788
How do we do it?

734
01:08:12,893 --> 01:08:14,667
Good morning, boyars.

735
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:18,328
Welcome.

736
01:08:34,507 --> 01:08:36,398
Throw away your swords.

737
01:08:47,641 --> 01:08:48,840
Did you take care of what is necessary?

738
01:08:48,841 --> 01:08:50,814
As you ordered, Your Highness.

739
01:08:50,934 --> 01:08:54,716
Don't let them wait.
They must be tired after such work.

740
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,630
You have chosen wrong, magistrate.

741
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,391
Don't send me anywhere!

742
01:09:12,511 --> 01:09:18,090
- And the Turks?
- From 10,000 I don't know how many are left.

743
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,495
For what rank
do you feel yourself worthy, Manzila?

744
01:09:25,486 --> 01:09:27,927
Let me guard you, Your Highness.

745
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,092
As I have done my whole life.

746
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,967
Now I have a princely guard.

747
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:40,812
The guard is defending the prince,
but who'll defend Your Highness?

748
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:50,162
The country pays tribute in vain
for peace at the Danube

749
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,796
that it still doesn't have.

750
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:57,052
Let's stop paying!

751
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:01,901
They will come and take it.

752
01:10:02,141 --> 01:10:03,634
We will welcome them as we should.

753
01:10:03,754 --> 01:10:05,623
In the country things are right now.

754
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:09,243
Why put everything in danger
in a war with an uncertain outcome?

755
01:10:09,363 --> 01:10:11,201
Their power has no limits.

756
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:15,963
Maybe...it would be better...
to buy our freedom.

757
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,435
Its price is low.

758
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:19,498
Freedom cannot be bought.

759
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,321
You say the price is low.

760
01:10:23,813 --> 01:10:25,453
Don't fool yourselves.

761
01:10:25,781 --> 01:10:28,309
It will always increase until one day...

762
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:31,814
when the price of freedom
will be freedom itself.

763
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:34,200
God forbid that day!

764
01:10:35,434 --> 01:10:37,260
Then it will be too late.

765
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:40,862
PART TWO

766
01:10:42,888 --> 01:10:45,249
THREE YEARS LATER

767
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:08,486
Exalted Mehmed, emperor of emperors, king of kings

768
01:11:08,606 --> 01:11:13,402
great emir and sultan orders you to give
to the gate your tribute for 3 years.

769
01:11:13,628 --> 01:11:16,963
Add 500 children per year
for the army of janissaries.

770
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:21,591
The padishah also orders you 
to take the tribute to Adrianople.

771
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:24,379
Why don't you take off your turbans?

772
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:30,150
Allah has commanded us not to uncover our heads, especially in front of the unfaithful.

773
01:11:32,906 --> 01:11:38,890
What if a wind starts now 
and takes your turbans away

774
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:43,185
and your heads will be uncovered,
would that be a sin or not?

775
01:11:43,305 --> 01:11:45,012
It would be, but not so big.

776
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:46,956
This would happen against our will.

777
01:11:47,076 --> 01:11:51,993
You let the wind determine
whether you sin or not?

778
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:53,692
*

779
01:11:54,951 --> 01:11:59,307
Allah should not be upset,
willingly or unwillingly.

780
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,712
Armash!

781
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:07,642
How do you dare bring me such news?

782
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:21,756
Cut off their heads!

783
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:00,696
Yunus Bey.

784
01:13:23,512 --> 01:13:27,360
Do you remember Vlad,
my father's former hostage?

785
01:13:28,193 --> 01:13:31,675
I stayed around him, Master of Masters.

786
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:35,618
You will stay again.

787
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:01,125
- Where are the merchants?
- It is lunchtime.

788
01:14:02,257 --> 01:14:07,768
And the merchandise, all these valuables
left here, without guard?

789
01:14:07,888 --> 01:14:10,651
Who could steal them?
Nobody would take them.

790
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:14,553
God bless His Highness
for the good he brought to the country.

791
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:17,040
When did the stealing cease?

792
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:21,617
About 2 years ago.
Nobody has raised stakes in the fiefs.

793
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:26,290
Terrible punishment.

794
01:14:46,735 --> 01:14:50,648
The glorious padishah, King of kings
grand emir and grand sultan

795
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:55,474
wishes Vlad the Prince a
peaceful and long reign

796
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:59,900
The glorious padishah is glad because you
exempt from fatigue to punish him

797
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:04,231
on those worthless messengers
who were known to behave as they should.

798
01:15:04,706 --> 01:15:08,319
I've came to say this to you and to
take your response to their message back

799
01:15:08,576 --> 01:15:12,998
but first, I have a secret
message for Your Highness.

800
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:19,899
Katavarinos, in the past, in Anatolia,
you used to be a Christian.

801
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:23,405
Then Your Highness too was a hostage.

802
01:15:23,525 --> 01:15:28,600
Should I be judged because I
have converted to the right faith?

803
01:15:29,683 --> 01:15:32,615
Perhaps a more righteous faith
than those of your forefathers?

804
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:36,992
My forefathers were pagans.
They believed in the gods of Olympus.

805
01:15:37,483 --> 01:15:41,487
What is Allah but a lonely Zeus?

806
01:15:43,082 --> 01:15:47,203
You haven't changed.
You always fall on your feet, like a cat.

807
01:15:47,323 --> 01:15:50,568
Only if I don't fall
on one of Your Highness's stakes.

808
01:15:50,688 --> 01:15:52,280
So help you Allah!

809
01:15:58,535 --> 01:15:59,758
What does Mehmed want?

810
01:15:59,878 --> 01:16:03,251
The padishah
wouldn't have wanted the tribute

811
01:16:03,371 --> 01:16:05,620
All was decided by Murat.

812
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:10,079
He inherited this situation and
he can't back out now.

813
01:16:11,445 --> 01:16:13,792
Nothing could justify that step.

814
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:17,025
What should I do to make this right?

815
01:16:17,145 --> 01:16:20,444
Your good will would suffice.

816
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:22,027
How shall I show good will?

817
01:16:22,147 --> 01:16:25,429
Let our army pass through to Hungary.
That's all.

818
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:30,419
No money, no soldiers, no toil.

819
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:35,494
Your Highness will thus become a friend of the padishah.

820
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,653
Friends do not pay tribute.

821
01:16:39,878 --> 01:16:42,030
Come on, tell me. Tell me...

822
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:44,907
Everything must be a secret.

823
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:47,894
Fast as a thunderbolt

824
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:51,125
After the fall of Buda
and when Hungary becomes a pashalic

825
01:16:51,245 --> 01:16:54,932
there won't be any pretenders
to the throne across the mountains.

826
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:58,154
The country will have the peace it wants.

827
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:07,951
With the promise of such advantages,
the answer must be only - "yes".

828
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:15,944
Well... No!

829
01:17:17,772 --> 01:17:20,626
Your Highness wants to defend Hungary?

830
01:17:20,746 --> 01:17:23,221
No.I want to defend my own country.

831
01:17:23,341 --> 01:17:26,062
The padishah will keep his word.

832
01:17:26,591 --> 01:17:32,043
I know. He will keep it. I will conquer Buda,
transform Hungary into a pashalic

833
01:17:32,784 --> 01:17:36,845
What will Wallachia become then?
An island in an Ottoman sea.

834
01:17:37,648 --> 01:17:40,883
He won't touch it, but those who follow?

835
01:17:41,274 --> 01:17:45,341
He who wants to be the master of the world
can't leave anything unmastered.

836
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:47,110
Mehmed knows that.

837
01:17:47,827 --> 01:17:49,810
He gives with the one hand,

838
01:17:50,188 --> 01:17:52,249
but takes with the other.

839
01:17:54,071 --> 01:17:58,182
Christendom is crumbling,
stirred by hostile passions

840
01:17:59,963 --> 01:18:03,145
like a sea of sand in the wind.

841
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:07,117
Against it there is
a big rock rolling down.

842
01:18:07,237 --> 01:18:10,608
The future belongs to that rock.

843
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:16,131
Sooner or later the shadow of the glorious
Crescent will spread over all the earth.

844
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:18,450
The swords will decide that.

845
01:18:19,817 --> 01:18:24,135
It's no good to be
in the way of a rolling rock.

846
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:30,006
Mind you, Katavorinos,
you are not here to give me advice.

847
01:18:31,645 --> 01:18:35,645
The country must pay tribute.
Twice as much.

848
01:18:37,135 --> 01:18:40,973
Mehmed has inherited a tribute
for which he did not intend to ask.

849
01:18:41,093 --> 01:18:43,516
It is a tribute I don't intend to pay.

850
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:48,084
Then let's agree over the borders
of Giurgiu, Your Highness.

851
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:53,618
Let's go here and decide.
If not, cut my head off now,

852
01:18:53,738 --> 01:18:56,927
and spare me the trip
back to Constantinople.

853
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:47,962
Allah hu akbar!

854
01:20:09,317 --> 01:20:12,617
If you don't surrender
I will cut your head off,

855
01:20:12,737 --> 01:20:15,395
stuff it with straw
and send it to Istanbul..

856
01:20:16,488 --> 01:20:20,099
Do you think you will be rewarded for that?

857
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:23,319
Mehmed can't lift you higher than I could.

858
01:20:56,815 --> 01:21:01,432
Master, they are the soldiers of Yunus Bey,
running from infidels.

859
01:21:11,519 --> 01:21:12,941
Open the gates!

860
01:23:02,628 --> 01:23:03,971
Your Highness!

861
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:07,010
If you want a loyal dog, I am one.

862
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,238
Take me into your chancellery.

863
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:10,435
Are you skilled?

864
01:23:10,555 --> 01:23:14,037
I've worked at Venice and Milan
chancelleries.

865
01:23:14,787 --> 01:23:17,500
- Why did you not stay there?
- I can't stay long in one place.

866
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:21,321
Nobody leave my chancellery when he wants.

867
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:24,295
Go on your way, man.

868
01:23:24,595 --> 01:23:25,900
Untie him!

869
01:23:32,927 --> 01:23:33,753
On your knees.

870
01:23:44,868 --> 01:23:47,598
Only death can stop
their appetite for conquering.

871
01:23:49,137 --> 01:23:50,865
Lead the army beyond the water!

872
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:54,100
We will pass to them through fire and sword
on the entire length of the Danube.

873
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:57,126
Don't push the sultan more than should be,

874
01:23:57,352 --> 01:23:59,197
otherwise the fire will come over us.

875
01:23:59,317 --> 01:24:02,578
We have no choice.
It will be war anyway.

876
01:24:03,183 --> 01:24:07,340
I gave the country a new face, made with 
sweat and blood. But the clay is still soft.

877
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:11,143
Only weather or fire can strengthen it.

878
01:24:11,263 --> 01:24:13,606
Fire hardens clay into a pitcher.

879
01:24:13,726 --> 01:24:16,405
A big fire creates something hard like a rock.
Our country will emerge from war like a rock.

880
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,261
Where's the infidel?

881
01:24:19,381 --> 01:24:22,844
He's advancing along the Danube.
Everyone's fleeing from him.

882
01:24:22,964 --> 01:24:25,681
You've dreamed, dirty servant!
Speak up.

883
01:24:25,801 --> 01:24:28,579
The shore of the Bosphorus is full
of refugees, King of Kings.

884
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:31,253
They are as many as the sand.
They want to pass to Asia.

885
01:24:31,547 --> 01:24:35,105
I will whip them back to the
place from which they fled.

886
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:43,588
Lift the siege of Corinth immediately.
All armies back to Istanbul.

887
01:24:51,634 --> 01:24:57,403
Your Highness, Dan is passing the mountains
through Bran, with an army of mercenaries.

888
01:24:57,523 --> 01:25:00,162
Our soldiers can't
hold them for long.

889
01:25:00,438 --> 01:25:03,870
Go and tell them to withdraw slowly
and harass him relentlessly.

890
01:25:04,431 --> 01:25:06,594
In two days I will be there.

891
01:25:06,714 --> 01:25:10,679
If you find the opportunity,
hit him, don't wait for me.

892
01:25:11,292 --> 01:25:15,145
I want Dan alive. His boyars, as well.

893
01:26:09,236 --> 01:26:10,997
Give him a spade.

894
01:26:25,254 --> 01:26:26,049
Dig!

895
01:26:40,202 --> 01:26:44,806
The hand of a prince must hold only 
the sceptre and the sword.

896
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:48,744
How would have you defeated a country
in front of humiliation?

897
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,566
Let him dig his grave up to the end.

898
01:26:51,192 --> 01:26:55,345
Bring some priests to have a sermon.
He should be buried with honor.

899
01:26:57,497 --> 01:27:02,958
He did not know to die as a prince,
at least his burial should be for one.

900
01:27:03,871 --> 01:27:07,036
He is the flesh and blood
of Mircea the Great.

901
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:12,590
They should be lifted up around the grave,
according to their titles.

902
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:16,760
Each lord to sleep into his own foundation.

903
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:29,894
The infidel has retired
with his army across the Danube.

904
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:34,289
Only the shame which he brought
remains behind him.

905
01:27:41,038 --> 01:27:43,264
I'll give Christianity a deadly blow.

906
01:27:43,384 --> 01:27:45,530
100,000 warriors will gather here.

907
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,655
Abudhan Pasha

908
01:27:46,775 --> 01:27:50,679
with 150 ships
and 60,000 warriors here

909
01:27:52,499 --> 01:27:56,527
I will hit the Romanian country
and turn it into a pashalic.

910
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:59,530
After that... Moldavia too.

911
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:03,078
Why so much power for two little countries?

912
01:28:03,553 --> 01:28:05,901
Only our best knights
can trample them underfoot.

913
01:28:06,021 --> 01:28:09,889
From Moldavia and Wallachia, my soldiers
will pass on Transylvania.

914
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:13,101
Crushed from both sides, the king's army will crumble.

915
01:28:13,394 --> 01:28:16,055
I will turn Transylvania 
into a pashalic, too.

916
01:28:16,643 --> 01:28:18,364
After this it will be winter.

917
01:28:18,484 --> 01:28:19,903
I won't release the army.

918
01:28:20,203 --> 01:28:22,817
I'll spend the winter in arms,
in Transylvania.

919
01:28:22,937 --> 01:28:26,156
When the snows begin to melt
a new army will be heading for Belgrade.

920
01:28:26,276 --> 01:28:30,084
We'll send a word to the Tatars
to attack Poland in the same time.

921
01:28:30,326 --> 01:28:33,476
So I will not be attacked in Italy, nor in Poland.

922
01:28:33,743 --> 01:28:36,300
Now, Buda is lost...

923
01:28:36,562 --> 01:28:38,883
After Buda... Vienna.

924
01:28:39,288 --> 01:28:43,644
I will come with armies to Belgrade
and then will begin in full force.

925
01:28:44,192 --> 01:28:46,070
To Rome...

926
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,094
I'll turn the Vatican into a big mosque.

927
01:28:51,214 --> 01:28:56,428
Pope with all his cardinals will walk
behind me dressed like ordinary dervishes.

928
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:58,998
Do you want to upset 
the thinking on the battlefield

929
01:28:59,118 --> 01:29:03,122
as you did with the siege on Constantinople ,
Luceafar between Luceferi?
(hipcamp***Like the moon's eclipse during the siege on Constantinople,

930
01:29:03,383 --> 01:29:06,253
Show the green flag of the Holy War!

931
01:29:07,088 --> 01:29:09,992
In all the mosques
to make prayers to Allah

932
01:29:10,751 --> 01:29:13,379
glory be his name,

933
01:29:13,764 --> 01:29:15,733
to give me power...

934
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:18,068
and victory.

935
01:29:19,952 --> 01:29:21,898
And tell to Pope Pius the 2nd that we
don't want,

936
01:29:21,948 --> 01:29:24,087
to run away from their wilderness,

937
01:29:24,334 --> 01:29:27,230
but we want to fight them.

938
01:29:27,778 --> 01:29:30,830
We are poor and few
compared to their wealth.

939
01:29:31,062 --> 01:29:34,615
And if we'll reach a bad end,
and this small country will perish,

940
01:29:34,735 --> 01:29:37,923
 all Christianity will suffer.

941
01:29:50,027 --> 01:29:56,770
Your brother Vlad,
has raised his arm against my empire.

942
01:29:58,182 --> 01:30:01,996
That arm will fall...., hit by my sword.

943
01:30:04,214 --> 01:30:05,737
You are a hostage here.

944
01:30:05,857 --> 01:30:10,122
I did not betray you.
It is not fair for me to be killed

945
01:30:10,242 --> 01:30:13,107
and the one who confronted you to be alive.

946
01:30:46,624 --> 01:30:52,572
Take 4,000 soldiers, 
go to Danube and try to attract the boyars.

947
01:30:53,173 --> 01:30:56,356
Tell them you will take his place
on the throne.

948
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:15,337
The Turks are crossing the Danube!

949
01:32:49,927 --> 01:32:55,158
The cannons there...
Be careful, don't make noise.

950
01:33:16,555 --> 01:33:20,064
You jackal!
Do you want our bones to remain here?

951
01:34:06,938 --> 01:34:12,299
Pass through the mill. The one from
"Valea Seaca". They'll met there.

952
01:34:13,108 --> 01:34:17,182
Go near His Highness. Guard him well!

953
01:34:17,913 --> 01:34:19,379
See you soon, father!

954
01:34:26,029 --> 01:34:28,739
I ordered the whole country to gather.

955
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:30,631
Why isn't the whole army here?

956
01:34:30,751 --> 01:34:35,269
Some of the boyars did not obey your order.
They did not come with their flags.

957
01:34:35,389 --> 01:34:36,795
The boyars again?

958
01:34:36,915 --> 01:34:42,881
The country has gathered.
Children, old men, all who can hold a sword
have started to go to your camp.

959
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:45,857
King Matei also has left Buda with his army.

960
01:34:46,201 --> 01:34:50,075
Yes, he left 6 weeks ago. And he is only halfway.

961
01:34:51,217 --> 01:34:54,729
Don't fool yourself.
We'll never get help from nobody.

962
01:34:55,379 --> 01:34:56,929
Then why did you send them?

963
01:34:57,049 --> 01:34:58,417
Then why have you sent messengers?

964
01:34:58,537 --> 01:35:02,628
So that nobody could ever say that they
were not aware of our needs and dangers

965
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:07,180
and for the country to understand
they can't wait for anything from anyone.

966
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:09,635
This isn't the first time
we must face the danger alone.

967
01:35:57,529 --> 01:35:58,947
All troops pass till evening.

968
01:35:59,067 --> 01:36:02,440
At dawn we move towards Targoviste. The march order - as usual.

969
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,828
Akincis should go after prey...
***Akincis (raiders, light cavalry) should attack their prey

970
01:36:09,489 --> 01:36:12,291
With no price not go further than.

971
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:26,529
- What do you want to tell me, Yafar?
- Let me join the soldiers. I am a warrior.

972
01:36:30,391 --> 01:36:34,064
Very well, go. Take care not to be killed.

973
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:29,229
Rashid, go and see what's there.

974
01:38:03,879 --> 01:38:08,529
Not a single drop of water. All fountains are poisoned.

975
01:38:11,033 --> 01:38:12,559
What do you command?

976
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:20,237
In 2 days we have lost more than
5000 soldiers.

977
01:38:20,357 --> 01:38:24,065
The supplies are scarce.
The soldiers are hungry and thirsty.

978
01:38:27,856 --> 01:38:30,478
Nobody should go far from the army.

979
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,478
Bring water from the Danube.

980
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:39,430
He is weaker than I thought...

981
01:38:41,102 --> 01:38:43,391
if he thinks that he can stop me like that.

982
01:38:43,715 --> 01:38:48,565
Time has come. Don't let them rest.
We must harass them.

983
01:38:49,172 --> 01:38:53,429
Let's shake the faith
in their own strength.

984
01:39:57,999 --> 01:40:01,918
Yunuss Bey and his soldiers. They have been hanging here for an year.

985
01:40:02,038 --> 01:40:05,143
Let's give to the dead what is 
appropriate for them.

986
01:41:54,496 --> 01:41:59,729
"Yunus Bey, do you remember Vlad? My father's former hostage."

987
01:42:00,216 --> 01:42:05,629
"I stayed around him, Master."

988
01:42:10,078 --> 01:42:12,762
The trenches around their camp
get smaller and smaller.

989
01:42:12,882 --> 01:42:14,471
So we can easily pass over them.

990
01:42:14,591 --> 01:42:16,641
They are used to our harasses at night.

991
01:42:16,761 --> 01:42:19,954
They hardly wake up,
they are less frightened.

992
01:42:20,189 --> 01:42:22,767
We will attack them tomorrow night.

993
01:42:22,994 --> 01:42:26,276
The opening of their camp
is facing the Danube.

994
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,989
The peak is facing Targoviste.

995
01:42:30,109 --> 01:42:33,758
The regular army is here.

996
01:42:35,434 --> 01:42:39,704
More than a half is there.

997
01:42:41,138 --> 01:42:47,803
This is the most exhausted and hungry army.
They will run away after the first attack.

998
01:42:48,055 --> 01:42:50,654
-We don't have enough strength.
-I know.

999
01:42:50,774 --> 01:42:54,655
Mehmed also knows,
that is why he has this army of sorts.

1000
01:42:54,775 --> 01:42:56,812
We can't win.

1001
01:42:57,269 --> 01:43:00,260
Just do as I told you and we will win.

1002
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:09,104
Stay.
What needs to be done I must do it by myself.

1003
01:43:11,115 --> 01:43:14,115
It's not a princely work,
but I have no choice.

1004
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:59,455
Back off! Back off!

1005
01:44:27,598 --> 01:44:28,877
Here we go!

1006
01:44:33,681 --> 01:44:35,872
Hey, you! Get into the line!

1007
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:57,355
Water! Water!

1008
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,920
The water will be shared
at the tent of Adin Pasha.

1009
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:11,398
Don't let them go near!

1010
01:45:16,794 --> 01:45:19,990
Water! Share it here!

1011
01:45:55,039 --> 01:46:00,491
Tomorrow at dawn we attack Targoviste
on 3 lines: Durakan Bey to the right,

1012
01:46:00,611 --> 01:46:03,280
Aly Bey in the center, with 20,000 soldiers

1013
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:07,962
the rest of the army
under your command, to the left.

1014
01:46:43,849 --> 01:46:45,805
Enlighten my mind Allah,

1015
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,658
how can I guess his plan?

1016
01:46:48,088 --> 01:46:52,184
Help me to put the crescent on all
the churches in this country.

1017
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:55,647
If we'll win,

1018
01:46:55,921 --> 01:47:00,669
I'm gonna build for you
a great mosque.

1019
01:47:01,778 --> 01:47:05,010
Just then, the dream of Islam
will be accomplished.

1020
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:08,664
And praised be your name...

1021
01:47:37,634 --> 01:47:39,017
Hey you!

1022
01:47:39,982 --> 01:47:40,844
What is this?

1023
01:47:40,964 --> 01:47:44,245
An talisman. Do you want to buy it?
It's not expensive. And what is good for?

1024
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:49,075
It protects you from the hits of the enemy.
No shit....

1025
01:47:51,663 --> 01:47:55,719
I have an talisman for sale.

1026
01:49:16,755 --> 01:49:20,755
The giaours have taken Turkish clothes
and killed the sultan!

1027
01:49:29,668 --> 01:49:33,313
- What is going on?
- The sultan's tent is on fire.

1028
01:49:35,964 --> 01:49:38,925
The giaours have taken Turkish clothes
and killed the sultan!

1029
01:49:39,045 --> 01:49:41,789
Run to the Danube! Run to the Danube!

1030
01:49:49,484 --> 01:49:50,593
Follow me!

1031
01:50:52,393 --> 01:50:53,502
Follow me!

1032
01:51:02,254 --> 01:51:05,306
Hit them, my brave men!

1033
01:51:12,012 --> 01:51:14,295
The giaours! The giaours!

1034
01:51:34,891 --> 01:51:39,619
Forward with all your strenght!

1035
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:41,215
Follow me!

1036
01:52:01,934 --> 01:52:03,144
Stay!

1037
01:52:09,481 --> 01:52:12,475
Giaours....

1038
01:52:41,884 --> 01:52:43,475
Defend the sultan!

1039
01:54:11,271 --> 01:54:15,716
I faced death in Constantinople, Belgrade
and on all the battlefields of the Islam.

1040
01:54:15,836 --> 01:54:22,702
My heart was never afraid.
Last night I almost died like a dog,
during my sleep.

1041
01:54:22,989 --> 01:54:24,097
Stop them!

1042
01:54:25,232 --> 01:54:28,875
Mehmed is dead, I killed him myself.

1043
01:54:29,284 --> 01:54:32,854
They won't dare.
They won't ever dare.

1044
01:54:50,598 --> 01:54:52,150
Tear them apart!

1045
01:56:20,379 --> 01:56:26,044
Half of my army died here,
*the other half is running to the Danube.

1046
01:56:26,164 --> 01:56:29,686
The ones who have left are wounded.

1047
01:56:29,806 --> 01:56:32,349
They're thirsty, hungry...

1048
01:56:32,579 --> 01:56:35,662
We are three hours away from Targoviste.

1049
01:56:36,066 --> 01:56:40,066
How can you take the country of a man who did so many special things?

1050
01:56:41,275 --> 01:56:44,891
And who knows how to use the power and his subjects.

1051
01:56:45,243 --> 01:56:47,989
Bury the dead. We'll return to Istanbul.

1052
01:57:20,741 --> 01:57:24,935
We atacked Snagov. The families
of Wallachian noblemen are in my hands.

1053
01:57:25,055 --> 01:57:28,939
- Where did you take them?
- In Braila, as you ordered.

1054
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:32,424
- What about my gold?
- Wait!

1055
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:52,193
Padishah, if you give me the army
from Braila, I will take the throne.

1056
01:57:52,427 --> 01:57:54,360
How can you win where I couldn't?

1057
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:58,608
The boyars will be on my side,
I guarantee it with my head.

1058
01:57:59,867 --> 01:58:01,250
Try it.

1059
01:58:10,863 --> 01:58:13,771
Mehmed is alive!

1060
01:58:18,206 --> 01:58:20,932
I have seen him with my eyes.

1061
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:51,241
Three thirds of Mehmed's army is dead. where nobody could have.
 We won an impossible fight.

1062
01:58:51,541 --> 01:58:53,802
Great victory, Your Highness.

1063
01:59:49,489 --> 02:00:00,628
Wallachians, Mehmed King of Kings,
the light of the world, speaks to you:

1064
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:06,641
"I don't want to spread my territories over your lands.

1065
02:00:07,415 --> 02:00:14,059
I want you to exile Vlad and devote 
yourselves to Radu, his brother.

1066
02:00:14,179 --> 02:00:18,794
If you listen to me, my army will withdraw
beyond the Danube

1067
02:00:18,914 --> 02:00:25,973
and no hair will move on your heads.
So help me Allah the Almighty!"

1068
02:00:26,093 --> 02:00:27,456
Otherwise...

1069
02:00:27,576 --> 02:00:33,600
I will kill your women and children
and there will never be peace between us.

1070
02:00:54,341 --> 02:00:57,228
What are you waiting for, Your Highness?

1071
02:01:01,408 --> 02:01:02,738
Surrender.

1072
02:01:07,121 --> 02:01:11,971
Take your women and kids.
I will pretend to flee over the mountains.

1073
02:01:12,863 --> 02:01:15,800
Take Radu to Targoviste.

1074
02:01:16,311 --> 02:01:19,637
When you get there
I will return unexpectedly

1075
02:01:19,757 --> 02:01:23,970
And I will raise him on a stake
as never seen in Wallachia.

1076
02:01:43,845 --> 02:01:45,502
Stop the execution!

1077
02:02:02,884 --> 02:02:06,511
I have received a letter
from Radu The Beautiful.

1078
02:02:07,371 --> 02:02:08,451
What does he want?

1079
02:02:08,571 --> 02:02:12,462
He wants to give us back our old privileges
if we help him take the throne

1080
02:02:12,582 --> 02:02:15,649
and arrange for King Matyas to recognize him.

1081
02:02:16,197 --> 02:02:23,401
Against Vlad? Now that his victory over
Mehmed brought him prestige? This is crazy.

1082
02:02:23,521 --> 02:02:26,442
King Matthias won't want to hear about it.

1083
02:02:27,889 --> 02:02:32,471
Do you have a faithful servant, capable of everything and able to keep quiet?

1084
02:02:33,203 --> 02:02:34,977
What do I have to do?

1085
02:02:35,316 --> 02:02:38,867
Can you counterfeit the handwriting,
the seal and the signature?

1086
02:02:38,987 --> 02:02:41,866
Yes. But I can't like this.

1087
02:02:59,797 --> 02:03:02,659
Give me the letter to copy.
You don't have to copy.

1088
02:03:02,779 --> 02:03:05,531
- Imitate the handwriting.
- It's the same.

1089
02:03:11,292 --> 02:03:13,257
What do I have to write?

1090
02:03:14,496 --> 02:03:19,697
Emperor of emperors and master of masters,
great emir and great sultan

1091
02:03:21,399 --> 02:03:24,738
I, the Wallachian prince Vlad, your slave

1092
02:03:26,277 --> 02:03:33,470
I, Vlad, beg you to forgive my sinful deeds
against your power and empire.

1093
02:03:34,336 --> 02:03:37,225
I know well Transylvania and Hungary.

1094
02:03:39,082 --> 02:03:41,220
If your majesty would like

1095
02:03:42,527 --> 02:03:47,471
I could pay for my mistake
by giving you back Transylvania.

1096
02:03:48,058 --> 02:03:54,425
When it is in your hands you would
be able to easily subjugate Hungary.

1097
02:03:56,031 --> 02:03:58,535
My messengers will tell you more.

1098
02:03:59,696 --> 02:04:01,955
Copy the signature.
And the seal.

1099
02:04:44,201 --> 02:04:46,349
This is not an ordinary job.

1100
02:04:47,741 --> 02:04:49,697
I paid my debt doing it.

1101
02:04:50,092 --> 02:04:52,224
I think I deserve a reward.

1102
02:04:53,366 --> 02:04:54,172
Otto!

1103
02:05:25,478 --> 02:05:29,124
- Where do we go, Your Highness?
- To Matthias Corvinus.

1104
02:05:34,022 --> 02:05:37,403
He has arrived with his soldiers
beyond the mountains.

1105
02:05:37,523 --> 02:05:41,736
We must go and thank him
and beg him to return to Buda.

1106
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:46,259
If Radu finds out that he has an army
at the borders he'll be frightened

1107
02:05:46,379 --> 02:05:50,223
and won't get near Targoviste.

1108
02:06:14,293 --> 02:06:15,519
Six years...

1109
02:06:18,245 --> 02:06:20,136
They passed as one day.

1110
02:06:24,544 --> 02:06:26,800
If I have had at least two... ( days )

1111
02:06:27,792 --> 02:06:31,254
I haven't built monasteries or citadels,

1112
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:36,432
my image won't be in the churches.

1113
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:41,622
But I built in the soul of the country.

1114
02:06:41,742 --> 02:06:45,096
This is the most precious work
for a voievod.

1115
02:06:46,129 --> 02:06:49,226
I leave the country really clean.

1116
02:06:49,346 --> 02:06:53,073
Everything that was bad in it
I took onto myself

1117
02:06:54,827 --> 02:06:56,719
and will carry with me.

1118
02:07:02,975 --> 02:07:06,975
Go to Stefan, tell him what happened
and what's my plan.

1119
02:07:07,095 --> 02:07:09,290
He should be in peace in Suceava.

1120
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:15,355
Otherwise Radu won't get near Targoviste
and it's a shame that his spike is still empty.

1121
02:07:16,566 --> 02:07:19,749
Send somebody else, Your Highness.

1122
02:07:24,688 --> 02:07:25,301
No.

1123
02:07:31,158 --> 02:07:37,340
If he wanted to give to Mehmed Transylvania
and Hungary why didn't he do it
from the very beginning?

1124
02:07:37,771 --> 02:07:40,748
The price would have been smaller.

1125
02:07:40,868 --> 02:07:42,179
This is crazy.

1126
02:07:42,427 --> 02:07:44,885
All his actions show he is insane.

1127
02:07:45,005 --> 02:07:51,174
His cruelty, his thirst for blood has never
distinguished between friends and enemies.

1128
02:07:51,294 --> 02:07:54,774
The whole of Christendom knows
his acts and is shaken.

1129
02:07:54,894 --> 02:07:58,304
Only a sick mind
can think of such a crazy plan.

1130
02:07:58,557 --> 02:08:00,865
Our Vice tell the truth.

1131
02:08:00,985 --> 02:08:05,626
If we hadn't caught the messengers,
your life would have been endangered.

1132
02:08:05,746 --> 02:08:09,107
- Where are the messengers?
- They died fighting for their lives.

1133
02:08:09,227 --> 02:08:11,592
My man can testify that.

1134
02:08:19,753 --> 02:08:23,940
A war against Mehmed is undesirable.
You know that.

1135
02:08:24,436 --> 02:08:27,484
We have enough trouble in the west.

1136
02:08:27,719 --> 02:08:32,151
This letter is the stake Dracula wanted
to stick into the heart of Christianity.

1137
02:08:32,271 --> 02:08:36,116
If it had reached the hands of the sultan,
Hungary would have been lost.

1138
02:08:36,236 --> 02:08:39,063
We wouldn't have had the time
to take our swords out.

1139
02:08:39,183 --> 02:08:43,031
Give to the merchants your
endorsement.

1140
02:08:43,376 --> 02:08:46,793
So we can react with no delay,
and no mercy.

1141
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:51,577
Don't hesitate Sir.
Otherwise we have to welcome him as a hero.

1142
02:08:56,884 --> 02:08:59,258
What are Your Majesty's orders?

1143
02:10:37,943 --> 02:10:41,351
He was sent to prison in Visegrad
for 12 years.

1144
02:10:41,471 --> 02:10:45,969
In November 1476 he succeeds
to take back the throne of Wallachia

1145
02:10:46,089 --> 02:10:48,343
with Stephen The Great's help.

1146
02:10:48,463 --> 02:10:52,665
But he reigned only for two months,
being killed one night.
