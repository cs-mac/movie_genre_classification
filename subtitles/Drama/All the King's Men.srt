1
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,268
Burden!

2
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:26,687
Hey, Jack Burden!

3
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,898
The boss wants to see you.

4
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,660
Jack, ever heard of a fellow
called Willie Stark?

5
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,245
No, who'd he shoot?

6
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:46,332
It'll be the other way around
if he keeps it up.

7
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,835
He's got the boys in the
Kanoma County courthouse worried.

8
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:51,629
Politician?
What's he running for?

9
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:55,174
County treasurer
or something like that.

10
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,468
What's so special about him?

11
00:01:57,802 --> 00:02:00,554
They say he's an honest man.

12
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,850
-I want you to hop into your car.
-You promised me a vacation.

13
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,519
That can wait.

14
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,105
But there's a girl I know.

15
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:13,067
She can wait too.

16
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:14,902
The question is, can l?

17
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,155
And the answer is, get up there.

18
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:19,490
Right.

19
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,828
What did you say his name was?

20
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,037
The fellow's name.

21
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,333
Stark. Willie Stark.

22
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,088
I found him in Kanoma City.

23
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:38,676
A typical, hot, dusty,
backwoods county seat.

24
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,351
--lie in order to line their own
dirty pockets with taxpayers' money.

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,855
When have Kanoma citizens ever
witnessed a campaign like this?

26
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:54,984
Why is the opposition
so anxious to defeat me?

27
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:59,572
Why have they used every dirty method
to make sure I'm not elected treasurer?

28
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:03,993
I'll tell you why.
They're afraid of the truth.

29
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:06,579
And the truth is this:

30
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:09,290
They're trying to steal your money.

31
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,542
Yeah, I said ''steal.''

32
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,337
The commissioners rejected
the low bid on the schoolhouse.

33
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:16,547
Why?

34
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,425
They'll say that
the job will be done better.

35
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,387
They would have you believe
they're interested in public welfare.

36
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:25,723
They're interested in welfare, sure.

37
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:27,057
But it's their own.

38
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:31,145
Let's look at their reason
in the light of the facts.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,899
That factory's owned by
a brother-in-law of a commissioner.

40
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:38,402
That same brick factory
uses convict labor.

41
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:42,323
Sorry, Willie,
you'll have to move on.

42
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:43,365
Why?

43
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:45,618
City Ordinance Number 1 05.

44
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,622
More than five people congregating
is disturbing the peace.

45
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,249
If you folks will read
these handbills...

46
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,835
...my boy will pass them out among you.

47
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:57,838
There's an ordinance
against that too.

48
00:03:58,464 --> 00:03:59,632
Pass them out, Tom.

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,801
-Let him alone.
-Get that camera!

50
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,969
Willie, you're under arrest.

51
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:25,866
Where can I find Tiny Duffy?

52
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,744
Right over there, mister.

53
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,834
They told me I could get
my camera back here.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,794
Who told you that?

55
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,380
People. Can l?

56
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:42,842
You the reporter that's been
snooping around town?

57
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,426
Are you Tiny Duffy?

58
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,011
What paper?

59
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,596
Chronicle.

60
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:53,060
You come a long way to stick your nose
into other people's business.

61
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,063
True, only my boss
on the paper can't see that.

62
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,524
It ain't any of his business either.

63
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:02,611
-Whose business is it?
-Them as that's tending to it.

64
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,823
County commissioners
the voters of Kanoma elected...

65
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:09,452
...to tend their business
and not take no butting in.

66
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:11,662
You a commissioner?

67
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:15,040
Name's Pillsbury.
Dolph Pillsbury.

68
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,711
Me too.
I'm a commissioner too.

69
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:20,463
Who isn't a commissioner?

70
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,673
He's the head man.

71
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:25,092
You're in a position to know--

72
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:29,138
ln a position to know nothing
and to say nothing.

73
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:31,056
I thought you said he was head man?

74
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,725
He uses my head.

75
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,937
Tiny, you're a card!

76
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:38,397
Ain't he a card?

77
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:40,107
He's a card.

78
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:44,403
Who thought up ordinances about
arresting someone for making a speech?

79
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,155
Who's arrested?

80
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:48,699
Ain't nobody arrested.

81
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,367
Hi, Willie.

82
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,370
Did you apologize to Willie?

83
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,331
I apologized to Willie.

84
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,209
-Did you give him his handbills?
-I gave them back.

85
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,920
And give him back
his flag and his bag.

86
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,048
And give this man his camera.

87
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,595
I'll be on that street
tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.

88
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,555
You go right ahead.

89
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:14,141
We all believe in free speech.

90
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,643
We got to.

91
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,895
It's in the Constitution.

92
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,232
My boy is distributing
those handbills now.

93
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,400
It's a free country, Willie.

94
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:26,070
If you can convince people
to vote for you...

95
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:27,905
...you go right ahead.

96
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,533
What did you want to see me about?

97
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,368
I wanted you to meet a fella...

98
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:36,205
...that came all the way up
from the state capital to meet you.

99
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:37,832
A reporter.

100
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:40,000
Wants to write you up.

101
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,753
Maybe put your picture in the paper.

102
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,338
I'm happy to know you.

103
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:46,590
Burden's my name. Jack Burden.

104
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,676
Can we go somewhere and talk?

105
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,928
That ain't polite.

106
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,764
Don't you want to hear
both sides of the story?

107
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,058
I know your side.

108
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,561
Where's the slate
your men took from my camera?

109
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,230
Must have dropped out.

110
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:04,108
Come on, fellas, let's relax.

111
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:05,943
It's a hot day.

112
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:07,153
Hey, Sugar Boy!

113
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:10,072
Bring some cold beer for the boys.

114
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,782
None for me.
Thank you kindly.

115
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,495
You know Willie don't drink, Tiny.
His wife don't favor drinking.

116
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,748
And Willie's the teacher's pet,
ain't you?

117
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,001
I'll have orange pop,
if you don't mind.

118
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:23,002
Orange pop?

119
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:26,881
All right, Sugar Boy.
Bring him some orange pop.

120
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,467
The pop, sir, is sold out.

121
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:34,472
Did you hear that, boys?
''The p-p-pop is sold out.''

122
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,267
Now ain't he a card?

123
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:40,311
He stutters, Mr. Duffy.

124
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,854
But you don't say anything.

125
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,023
Let's go, mister.

126
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,006
This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.

127
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,342
-How do you do?
-That's my pa.

128
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:17,598
Now we'll talk.

129
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:20,017
You've been talking for a long time.

130
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:21,852
Willie's got a lot to say.

131
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,813
You sleepy, Pappy?
You want a nap?

132
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,731
I want to hear it.

133
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:27,858
I'm worried about Tom.

134
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,194
It's getting dark.
He should have been home.

135
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:32,780
He's a strong boy.
He can take care of himself.

136
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:35,324
-How old is the boy?
-Fifteen.

137
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,992
How long have you been married?

138
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:40,830
Nine years.

139
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,207
He was a neighbor's boy.

140
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,835
They were poor folks.
Both died.

141
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,754
I couldn't have any children so....

142
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,840
-He's a good boy.
-He's the best.

143
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:53,467
I couldn't love him more
if he was my own flesh and blood.

144
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,594
And now you, Mrs. Stark.

145
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,389
There isn't very much
to tell about me.

146
00:08:58,597 --> 00:08:59,723
How did you meet?

147
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:02,393
I was teaching school.
One day, a pupil walked in.

148
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:03,727
It was Willie.

149
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:08,190
I couldn't have a man in class,
and Willie wanted to learn badly...

150
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,316
...so I married him.

151
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:11,152
ls that the only reason?

152
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
Except that I loved him.

153
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:15,739
Get the coffee, Lucy.

154
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,659
When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?

155
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,454
A couple of weeks ago.

156
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,749
l've been teaching a long time.
Nobody ever said I wasn't all right.

157
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,084
But I don't care.

158
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:31,547
I won't teach in a schoolhouse built
so somebody can steal some money.

159
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:34,216
Willie doesn't want
to be treasurer either...

160
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:37,178
...if he has to associate
with those dishonest people.

161
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:40,473
I'm going to run.
They can't keep me from running.

162
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,601
If you want the truth,
you haven't much of a chance.

163
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,479
I'm going to run.
They won't kick me around.

164
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,189
I don't care if Willie loses...

165
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:50,149
...just so he gets the truth
to the people.

166
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,650
lsn't that true, Willie?

167
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,444
lsn't it?

168
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:56,447
Sure, that's right.

169
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:59,783
If you lose, you can study
your law books more.

170
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:01,535
Are you studying law too?

171
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:03,913
By myself, at night.

172
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,748
Willie's a smart boy.

173
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,877
If I find time,
I'll take a university course.

174
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:18,552
What happened, Tommy boy?
What's the matter?

175
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,806
-I gave out the handbills, Pa.
-Speak up! Speak up!

176
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,642
Let him tell it in his own way.

177
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,101
Go on, Tommy.

178
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,812
They were waiting for me.

179
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,023
They took them, threw them
in the dirt and beat me up.

180
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:33,484
I brought some of them back.

181
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:36,403
Good boy!

182
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,613
Have you eaten?

183
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:41,033
Let him wash up first.
Why don't you lie down, Pappy?

184
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:51,877
I'm going to run.

185
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,171
You're not going to stop me.

186
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,341
I'm going to run
even if I don't get a single vote.

187
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:18,821
Here you are.

188
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,907
The last of the Willie Stark articles.

189
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:22,992
Can I go?

190
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,036
Yes, you've earned your vacation.

191
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:30,207
You've been writing these
like you really mean them.

192
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,876
I do.

193
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,716
I hadn't been home in a long time.

194
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:41,510
Home was Burden's Landing.

195
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:45,014
Only 130 miles from Kanoma City.

196
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:49,685
It was separated from the mainland
by a body of water.

197
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:54,773
For the first time, I wondered
if it wasn't separated by more.

198
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:02,823
Hello, Mother.

199
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,909
Floyd, Jack's home.

200
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:08,537
He looks fine.
Doesn't he look fine?

201
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,247
How do I look, Jackie boy?

202
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,583
You look beautiful, Mother.

203
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,629
l've got so many things
planned for you.

204
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,131
Parties and--
It'll be like old times.

205
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:20,591
Let's have a drink.

206
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:22,510
Can't that wait till evening?

207
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:24,011
Floyd, my son's home.

208
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:26,138
How long are you staying?

209
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,516
Two or three weeks,
if that's all right.

210
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:29,558
-Your father--
-Stepfather.

211
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:31,894
Now, Jackie.

212
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,979
Here we are. Floyd.

213
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,314
Jackie.

214
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:36,690
Myself.

215
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,401
To the best time
we've ever had together.

216
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,945
Yes, Mother.

217
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,662
Excuse me, l--

218
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,594
Dr. Stanton, I presume.

219
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,805
ls my shingle showing?

220
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:10,975
-Good to see you, boy.
-Good to see you, Judge.

221
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:12,768
How've you been?
What've you been doing?

222
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:16,272
Just sitting here, waiting
for all of you to come home.

223
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:21,318
When a man starts to get old,
his eyes play funny tricks on him.

224
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,571
As I watched you in that boat...

225
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,198
...I saw a boy of 1 2
with a fishing rod.

226
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:29,952
And I was sure the first thing
he'd say would be--

227
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:38,878
Mind if I kiss your niece?

228
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,911
To all the good times
we've had at Burden's Landing.

229
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,914
And especially this one,
because my son's home.

230
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,500
Thank you, Mother.
Thank you very much.

231
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,584
Monty, we've been discussing
Jack's career.

232
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:20,211
Monty, we've been discussing
Jack's career.

233
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:23,172
What do you think he should be?
A lawyer?

234
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,215
Doctor?

235
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:27,218
-We were discussing whether--
-I like what I do.

236
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,261
You do very well at it.

237
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:32,181
I read your articles
about Willie Stark.

238
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:36,060
Very convincing.
Too convincing for my tastes.

239
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:37,394
People like them.

240
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,647
People are fools.

241
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,066
Articles like that
shouldn't be permitted.

242
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,234
They incite people.

243
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:44,318
Why are you afraid?

244
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:48,239
I thought they were very good.
I was proud of you.

245
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:51,492
I was interested in Stark's ideas
on health and medicine.

246
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:54,787
You know hospital conditions.
They're intolerable.

247
00:14:54,954 --> 00:14:57,373
l'd like to meet him.
He sounds like an honest man.

248
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,041
Honest man?

249
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,337
This state is full of log-cabin
Abe Lincolns with price tags on them.

250
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:06,298
The louder he yells,
the higher his price.

251
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,342
You think you can buy anything.

252
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,845
Yes, don't you?

253
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:13,764
What do you think, Judge?

254
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:17,935
-This state could stand a few changes.
-I'll tell you what I think.

255
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:20,980
Please.
Let's not talk politics.

256
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:25,109
Anne is right.
I absolutely forbid any more of it.

257
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,820
I know what we need.
We need another toast.

258
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,865
You propose it, Monty.
You're so good at it.

259
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:33,200
To the young people.

260
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:37,329
To Anne, to Jack, to Adam.
To what lies before them.

261
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:41,750
To the world they'll make,
in spite of the mistakes we've made.

262
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,253
The mistakes you've made, not me.

263
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:48,632
You're all still pretty
high and mighty, aren't you?

264
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:52,845
You think this state needs a change.
You don't like how it's run.

265
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:56,807
Who's going to run it?
Willie Stark, the Judge, you?

266
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,561
You can be bought too.
ln fact, you have been.

267
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,897
And with my money.

268
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:09,028
That's a waste of good liquor, boy.

269
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:10,905
Your mother wouldn't approve.

270
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,539
-You go back and apologize.
-I'd rather die.

271
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:23,584
-I've got to live with him.
-You don't love him.

272
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,461
Don't spoil anything.
He can help.

273
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,671
You need this house
and the parties...

274
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,008
...the cars, the clothes, the lies.
I don't.

275
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:34,512
It's the truth, face it.
For once in your life, face it.

276
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,056
Anne, please.

277
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,391
Make him understand.

278
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,102
Burden's Landing is
a place on the moon.

279
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:44,438
It isn't real.
It doesn't exist.

280
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:47,900
It's me, pretending
I live on what I earn.

281
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,945
It's my mother,
trying to keep herself young...

282
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:53,906
...and drinking herself old doing it.

283
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,910
It's you and Adam living here
as if your father were still alive.

284
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:01,789
It's an old man like the Judge,
dreaming of the past.

285
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:05,501
Anne, come away with me.

286
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,461
And do what?

287
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:12,758
Live in a shack and eat red beans.
What do you want me to do?

288
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:17,388
You haven't been sure. You've gone
from one thing to the other.

289
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:19,807
A year at law school,
this job as a reporter.

290
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:23,519
-Are you afraid I can't make a living?
-No, it isn't that.

291
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:25,604
I don't care about the money.

292
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:28,482
It's just that
I want you to be something.

293
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:31,277
-What is it you want me to be?
-I don't know.

294
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:35,281
I want you to be,
to do something important.

295
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,907
Like your father?

296
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:39,535
All right, I'll run for governor.

297
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:45,416
Anne, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that.

298
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:48,586
All right, Jack.

299
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,505
I'll go away with you.

300
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:54,383
I'll do anything you want me to.

301
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:04,810
l've wanted you to say that
more than anything in the world.

302
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,771
And now that you have said it--

303
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,735
I guess you were right.

304
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:17,239
I'm not sure of anything,
including myself.

305
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,825
I'm not sure I could live up to the--

306
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,956
Wait for me.

307
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:28,042
Please wait for me.

308
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,503
I'll wait for you.

309
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,927
Hello, Jack.
Cut your vacation short, didn't you?

310
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:42,306
By the way, Jack...

311
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:46,727
...the fellow you wrote
the articles about, Stark.

312
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,687
He lost.

313
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,984
I guess that's the end
of Willie Stark.

314
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,869
The measure of the damages
is caused by--

315
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,162
A breach.

316
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:08,707
-A breach.
-Of an agreement.

317
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,211
-To sell personal property.
-To sell....

318
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:15,965
-Two years of this!
-Go on, Willie.

319
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,054
''Willie Stark.

320
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,723
Bachelor of Law.''

321
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,061
If you'll let me take your case...

322
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:33,274
...I'll wait for my fee
just as long as you want me to.

323
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,779
They won't kick me around.

324
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,366
If you lose, you can study
your law books more.

325
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:44,535
I'll be on that street tomorrow!

326
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,996
By all means.
Free speech, free country.

327
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:50,124
That factory's owned by
a brother-in-law of a commissioner.

328
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:53,627
The commissioners rejected
the low bid on the schoolhouse.

329
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:01,051
All right, children,
this is a fire drill.

330
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,304
Remember now, walk.

331
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,472
Quietly.

332
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,292
''Verily I say unto you...

333
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:36,170
...except ye turn
and become as little children...

334
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:39,131
...ye shall in no wise
enter the kingdom of heaven.''

335
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,633
Let us pray.

336
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:45,679
''The grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ
and the love of God...

337
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:49,767
...and the Holy Spirit
be with us all evermore.''

338
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:51,101
Amen.

339
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,993
Lord, I'm punished for voting
against an honest man.

340
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:09,578
God bless you.

341
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:12,123
-If we'd only listened.
-We'll never forget.

342
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:13,666
You were right.

343
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,336
-Let me shake your hand.
-We should have listened.

344
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,547
You were right all the time.

345
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,801
''Voice in the wilderness.

346
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:27,763
A man named Willie Stark.''

347
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:30,558
How about that, Lucy?
That's me.

348
00:21:57,585 --> 00:22:00,921
Get up there fast.
Willie's hotter than a firecracker.

349
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,590
And stay with him.

350
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:03,716
Before this Kanoma City business,
we had this whole area tied up.

351
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:07,178
Before this Kanoma City business,
we had this whole area tied up.

352
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:09,305
Now we're losing the hick vote.

353
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:11,432
Let's find a way to split that vote.

354
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,395
All I know is, the way it is now,
it looks like I'm not going to win.

355
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:18,939
I know a way. Find a dummy.

356
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:20,816
Find a dummy.

357
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:23,944
That's what we got.

358
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:26,947
A guy from the sticks,
strong enough to grab votes...

359
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:29,450
...and dumb enough
not to ask questions.

360
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:32,912
If you want to listen to a boy
from the sticks...

361
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:35,623
...I know just the guy.

362
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,627
So it's no more politics?

363
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:42,505
l've worked too hard
in my time to get there.

364
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:45,800
I'll just go on practicing law
and making more money.

365
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:47,301
l'd like to ask...

366
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,805
...why all the speeches you're making
around the countryside?

367
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:57,561
I wonder who that is.

368
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:20,501
I brought some people up
from the capital just to meet you.

369
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,420
Folks, I want you
to meet Willie Stark...

370
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:25,506
...the next governor of our state.

371
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:48,821
Bear patiently with me
for a few minutes.

372
00:23:48,988 --> 00:23:51,824
l'd like to tell you
what this state needs.

373
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:54,702
It needs a balanced tax program.

374
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,413
l'd like to give you the facts
and the figures.

375
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:58,956
How did it sound?

376
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,416
Fine, fine.

377
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,419
I forgot to send a telegram to Lucy.

378
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,004
Conductor!

379
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:23,856
l'd like to add something
about last year's taxes.

380
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,859
I wouldn't add a thing.
Just give them the facts.

381
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:29,111
-And the figures.
-Great speech!

382
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:33,491
What this state needs is
a balanced tax program.

383
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:35,993
Last year...

384
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,914
...the state claimed
to have spent on roads....

385
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:48,464
We know figures don't lie,
and facts are easy to understand.

386
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:51,675
-Do you mind if I sit with you?
-Stand, sit, whatever.

387
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:53,093
Thanks.

388
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,430
What are you
on this merry-go-round for?

389
00:24:56,722 --> 00:24:58,140
I take notes.

390
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,935
-For whom?
-For those ''whom'' pay me.

391
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:03,187
-Which is?
-People.

392
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:05,231
Smart people?

393
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:07,024
Anybody that pays me is smart.

394
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:10,444
You don't have to be smart
to frame Willie Stark.

395
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:11,487
No, you don't.

396
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:12,863
lsn't it a frame?

397
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:16,200
Why don't you give me a cigarette?

398
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,995
To split the vote,
so Harrison can win.

399
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,081
If you know, why you ask?

400
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,667
I just want to make sure.

401
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,920
Why don't you tell the boys
to save their money?

402
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:30,798
Willie couldn't steal a vote...

403
00:25:31,006 --> 00:25:33,926
...from Abe Lincoln in
the cradle of the Confederacy.

404
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:37,680
I wish the poor had enough sense
to have somebody give him...

405
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:40,307
...a greasing for the beating
he's going to get.

406
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:42,309
All he gets out of it is the ride.

407
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:45,604
Those speeches.
Ain't they awful?

408
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:48,107
Ain't they just plain awful?

409
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,277
Question to you:

410
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:54,822
If somebody told him
he was a sucker...

411
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,991
...you think he'd quit?

412
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:00,619
I don't know, Sadie.

413
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,956
I really don't know.

414
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:07,418
-Did it sound all right?
-Fine.

415
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:17,303
Now if you'll bear with me
for a few minutes...

416
00:26:17,303 --> 00:26:19,555
Now if you'll bear with me
for a few minutes...

417
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:21,599
...I'll give you the figures.

418
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:24,768
What we need is
a balanced tax program.

419
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:26,228
I need sleep!

420
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:27,938
-Shut up.
-Shut up yourself!

421
00:26:29,315 --> 00:26:30,649
Try it on your feet.

422
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,819
My feet are killing me.
Let me stay here.

423
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:35,905
Look, you tell them too much.

424
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:39,992
Tell them you'll soak the fat boys,
and forget the tax stuff.

425
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:41,911
That's what I say.

426
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,915
But it's the way you say it.
Make them cry or laugh.

427
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:49,710
Make them mad. Stir them up
and they'll come back for more.

428
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:53,422
But for heaven's sakes,
don't try to improve their minds.

429
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:56,926
A man don't have to be governor.

430
00:26:57,134 --> 00:26:58,052
What?

431
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,762
A man don't have to be governor.

432
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:03,974
-They haven't counted the votes yet.
-I'll lose, I know that.

433
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:06,101
Don't try and fool me.

434
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:08,771
I won't lie to you.
I wanted it.

435
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:12,983
I wanted it so badly,
I stayed up nights thinking about it.

436
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:16,445
A man wants something so badly,
he gets mixed up.

437
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:18,739
It's something inside of you.

438
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:23,994
l'd have made a good governor.
Better than those others.

439
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:26,997
-Come in.
-A great governor.

440
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:28,749
Give me a drink.

441
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,543
Build them highways....

442
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,002
Help yourself.

443
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,047
-I'd build them schools.
-What's up?

444
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:38,843
Nothing, except he says
he's not going to be governor.

445
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:40,553
So you told him?

446
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:43,722
I don't tell anyone anything.
I just listen.

447
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:45,349
Who told you?

448
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:47,059
Told me what?

449
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:51,647
Told me what?

450
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,608
That you won't be governor.

451
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:56,527
Jack, told me what?

452
00:27:59,738 --> 00:28:02,575
That you've been framed,
you poor sap.

453
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,618
-Framed?
-And how!

454
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,037
Oh, you decoy.

455
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:09,582
You woodenhead decoy.

456
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,000
And you let them.

457
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,169
You know what you are?

458
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:15,963
You're the goat.

459
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,967
The sacrificial goat.
You are a sap because you let them.

460
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:21,969
-That's enough!
-Enough?

461
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,305
He didn't even get
anything out of it.

462
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:27,057
They'd have paid you
to take a rap like that.

463
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:30,186
But they didn't have
to pay a sap like you.

464
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:32,271
You were full of yourself.

465
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,317
All you wanted was to stand up
on your hind legs and make a speech.

466
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,319
''My friends....

467
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:42,114
My friends, this state needs
a good five-cent cigar.

468
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:44,408
What this state needs is a--''

469
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:48,954
-Is it true?
-He wants to know if it's true.

470
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:50,456
ls it true?

471
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:52,541
That's what they tell me.

472
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,628
Here.

473
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:02,760
-You're not used to it.
-He's not used to a lot of things.

474
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:05,095
Why don't you lay off him?

475
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:06,639
Are you? Are you?

476
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,823
Things seem to have quieted down.

477
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,952
Yep, I quieted him down.

478
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:30,955
How was he? Noisy?

479
00:29:31,163 --> 00:29:32,832
He reared some.

480
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,084
He's been telling me
the things he'll do.

481
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:38,629
He's going to do big things.
He's going to be president.

482
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:41,799
He's going to kill people
with his bare hands.

483
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:43,926
I quieted him down.

484
00:29:44,135 --> 00:29:45,719
Hey, who's Lucy?

485
00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:47,513
His wife.

486
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:51,725
He talks like she's his mammy.
She'll blow his nose for him.

487
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:55,146
I'll take him from here.
They're waiting at the barbecue.

488
00:29:57,523 --> 00:30:01,152
Give me a receipt for the body.
I'll be on my way.

489
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:13,247
Come on, wake up.

490
00:31:49,552 --> 00:31:50,928
Where is he?

491
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,055
There he is.

492
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:07,653
ls he drunk?

493
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:11,198
Never touches the stuff.
Lucy doesn't favor drinking.

494
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:19,081
How'd you get him here?
He was out stiff.

495
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,375
Hair of the dog that bit him.

496
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:25,296
He must have swallowed the dog.

497
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,596
Ladies and gentlemen.

498
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:38,309
It gives me pleasure to introduce
that true man of the people...

499
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,311
...the next governor of the state...

500
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:42,521
...Willie Stark.

501
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,281
My friends....

502
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:56,994
My friends, I have a speech here.

503
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:00,539
It's a speech...

504
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:04,126
...about what this state needs.

505
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:08,339
There's no need in my telling you
what this state needs.

506
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:11,300
You are the state
and you know what you need.

507
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:13,052
You over there.

508
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:16,305
Look at your pants.
Have they got holes in the knees?

509
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:18,349
Listen to your stomach.

510
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:20,976
Did you ever hear
it rumble for hunger?

511
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,729
And you.
Do your crops ever rot...

512
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:26,649
...because the road was too bad
to get to market?

513
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,068
And you.

514
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:31,403
What about your kids?

515
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:34,824
Are they ignorant as dirt, like you,
because there's no school?

516
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:37,827
I'm not going to read you any speech.

517
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:40,121
But I will tell you a story.

518
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:41,789
It's a funny story.

519
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,874
-What's he up to?
-Shut up.

520
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,294
Get ready to bust your sides laughing
because it's funny.

521
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:49,547
It's about a hick.

522
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:52,675
A hick like you, if you please.

523
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:56,387
He grew up on the dirt roads
in the gully washes of a farm.

524
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,057
He knew how to get up before dawn,
get feed, slop and milk...

525
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:04,436
...then walk six miles to a one-room,
slab-sided schoolhouse.

526
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:07,398
This hick knew
what it was to be a hick.

527
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:11,277
He figured that to get anything done,
he had to do it himself.

528
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:13,070
So he sat up nights and studied.

529
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,991
He studied law because he thought
he could change things...

530
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:19,410
...for himself
and for folks like him.

531
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:22,413
I'm not going to lie to you.

532
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:24,957
He didn't start off
thinking about the hicks...

533
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:26,876
...and the things he'd do for them.

534
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:29,545
He started off thinking
of number one.

535
00:34:29,753 --> 00:34:32,214
But something came to him on the way.

536
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:35,718
He could do nothing for himself
without the help of the people.

537
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:38,429
It came with the force
of God's lightning...

538
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:42,516
...when the school building collapsed
because of politics' rotten brick.

539
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:48,397
It killed and mangled a dozen kids.
But you know that story.

540
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,401
The people were his friends
because he fought it.

541
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:55,321
The politicians in the city knew that.

542
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:57,490
So they rode up to his house...

543
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:00,409
...and said they wanted him
to run for governor.

544
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:02,787
He's wonderful!

545
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,289
And he swallowed it.

546
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:10,795
He thought in all humility how
he'd like to try and change things.

547
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:14,799
He was a country boy who thought
even a poor man can be governor...

548
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:18,385
...if his fellow citizens find
he's got the stuff for the job.

549
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:24,308
Those fellows in the striped pants
saw that hick and took him in.

550
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:27,478
-What are you doing?
-There's your Judas lscariot!

551
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,688
Lickspittle, nose-wiper!

552
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:30,856
Play! Play!

553
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:32,733
-Play anything!
-Harrison's dummy!

554
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:35,444
-Look at him!
-That's a lie!

555
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:37,655
Go get him, boys!

556
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:44,912
Now shut up!
Shut up, all of you.

557
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:46,163
Listen to me.

558
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:50,251
They fooled you 1 000 times,
just like they fooled me.

559
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,546
But this time, I'll fool somebody.
I'll stay in this race.

560
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:55,506
I'm on my own and out for blood.

561
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:57,299
Listen to me, you hicks!

562
00:35:57,508 --> 00:36:01,303
Lift up your eyes and look at
God's blessed and unfly-blown truth.

563
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:02,513
This is the truth!

564
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,390
You're a hick.

565
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:07,101
Nobody ever helped a hick
but a hick himself.

566
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:09,478
Listen to me, listen to me!

567
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:11,689
They were going to use me
to split the vote.

568
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:14,900
But I'm standing here now
on my hind legs.

569
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:16,777
Even a dog can learn to do that.

570
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:20,948
Are you standing on your hind legs?
Have you learned that yet?

571
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,076
Here it is, you hicks!

572
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:26,787
Nail up anybody who stands
in your way.

573
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:28,706
Nail up Joe Harrison!

574
00:36:28,914 --> 00:36:31,041
Nail up McMurphy!

575
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:35,421
If they don't deliver, give me
the hammer and I'll do it.

576
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:43,429
I want his throat cut
from ear to ear.

577
00:36:51,604 --> 00:36:55,274
No use going any further.
We're not printing them anymore.

578
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:59,028
-I thought the Chronicle line was--
-Divide and conquer.

579
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,949
Stark's getting big for his britches.
The hicks are getting too smart.

580
00:37:04,158 --> 00:37:06,118
We're now supporting Harrison.

581
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:08,162
How do you square that?

582
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:10,372
I work here.

583
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,583
I don't, not anymore.

584
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:14,001
You fool.

585
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,588
-If you had guts, you'd print this.
-I take orders.

586
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:21,467
You've got a wife and three kids,
and your boy goes to Princeton.

587
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,513
You won't find it easy
to get another job.

588
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,807
I'm too rich to work.

589
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:59,130
We didn't do so good.

590
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:01,132
-Double bourbon.
-Same for me.

591
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,716
And a beer.

592
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:07,304
I hear you got fired from the paper.

593
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:09,807
You heard wrong. I quit.

594
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:11,642
You're smart.

595
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:14,436
Before I'm through,
they won't have money...

596
00:38:14,645 --> 00:38:16,981
...to pay the boy
that cleans the spittoons.

597
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:18,732
How do you feel?

598
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:20,943
I feel fine.

599
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:25,072
You see, Jack, I learned something.

600
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:26,532
What?

601
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,661
How to win.

602
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:39,211
I didn't see Willie again
until his second campaign...

603
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:40,838
...four years later.

604
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:43,632
I drifted from job to job.

605
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:46,552
That is, whenever I could find one.

606
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:50,723
But always further
and further away from Anne...

607
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:53,392
...and the life at Burden's Landing.

608
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:57,563
But Willie wasn't drifting.
He knew where he was going.

609
00:38:57,771 --> 00:39:00,649
He had his foot in the door
and kept right on pushing.

610
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:04,111
He'd lost the election
but he'd won the state.

611
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,822
And he knew it.
And the people knew it.

612
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:10,451
They all were hopping on
his bandwagon, even Tiny Duffy.

613
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:14,371
Willie came back
like he said he would.

614
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,707
You want to know
what my platform is?

615
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:20,169
I'm going to soak the fat boys
and spread it out thin.

616
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:23,214
Willie was right.
He'd learned how to win.

617
00:39:23,422 --> 00:39:27,676
He spent a lot of money doing it.
An awful lot of money.

618
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:30,888
I was beginning to wonder
where he got it from.

619
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,723
There were rumors...

620
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:36,811
...that Willie was making deals
with all kinds of people.

621
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:38,687
Strange deals.

622
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:41,565
For Willie Stark.

623
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:45,069
The second time wasn't a campaign.
It was a slaughter.

624
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:47,905
It was Saturday night
in a mining town.

625
00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:50,825
Willie came back
like he said he would.

626
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:53,619
He came back
and he took me with him.

627
00:39:56,747 --> 00:40:00,042
This is a friend of mine.
He's going to live here.

628
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:08,676
Let these boys through, officers.

629
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:11,387
-Duffy works for me.
-Everybody does.

630
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:13,055
Not yet.
I want him around.

631
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:15,891
He reminds me of something
I never want to forget.

632
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:20,896
Come on.

633
00:40:21,605 --> 00:40:24,567
-These the boys?
-The boys that can get the boys.

634
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:27,027
-How many can you get?
-Fifty.

635
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:29,697
-How much?
-Five dollars a head.

636
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:32,324
What do you think?
They look like good boys?

637
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:35,703
They better be.

638
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:38,497
Get 1 00.

639
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:41,959
Go on, all of you. Blow.
You too, Duffy, go on.

640
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:46,088
Handbill distributors.

641
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:48,174
If they all look like them,
l'd take one.

642
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,968
That's the object. Not like
when they beat up my boy.

643
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:52,470
-How is Tom?
-He's fine.

644
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:55,473
-He starts college in the fall.
-And Lucy?

645
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:57,266
Fine.

646
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:01,520
I need a boy.
Where's a boy?

647
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:04,857
Take that downstairs
right away, on the double.

648
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:08,027
Double-space all of this.
He can't read it.

649
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:12,990
-Hi, how are you?
-Sadie is my secretary now.

650
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,117
Fix your tie, Willie.

651
00:41:19,371 --> 00:41:20,706
Hey, Sugar.

652
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,502
Keep everybody out.
I want to talk to Jack and Sadie.

653
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:27,004
Now you'll work for me.

654
00:41:27,505 --> 00:41:28,464
Doing what?

655
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:31,342
I don't know.
Something will turn up.

656
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,427
We need a college man around.

657
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:35,262
For research.

658
00:41:37,515 --> 00:41:39,975
How much they pay you
on that newspaper?

659
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:42,686
Three hundred dollars a month.

660
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,232
I could buy you cheap, couldn't l?

661
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,025
For a bag of salt.

662
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:51,529
I don't play that way.
I like you. I always have.

663
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:53,405
I tell you what I'll do.

664
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:57,743
I'll give you $400 a month
and traveling expenses.

665
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,038
You throw money around
like it was money.

666
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:02,790
Money.

667
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,626
I don't need money.

668
00:42:07,545 --> 00:42:08,921
People give me things.

669
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:10,589
Why?

670
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:16,137
Because they believe in me.

671
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:22,268
I was going home again.
But this time, it was different.

672
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:25,229
I had a feeling that
maybe the waiting was over.

673
00:42:25,437 --> 00:42:27,773
For me and for Anne.

674
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:29,108
It's a far cry from where
I come from to this house.

675
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:32,444
It's a far cry from where
I come from to this house.

676
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:36,198
Standing under the portrait of
one of the greatest governors...

677
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:37,992
...and talking to you...

678
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,036
...it's an honor I never
thought l'd have.

679
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:45,749
Are there any questions?

680
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,084
Mr. McAvoy?

681
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,255
I have no questions.

682
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:53,257
Judge?

683
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:56,427
-A few, but it will hold.
-I have a question.

684
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:58,596
Shoot.

685
00:42:58,804 --> 00:43:02,933
A lot of people in this state say
that you've been making deals.

686
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:06,395
Some of them with the groups
you claim you're against.

687
00:43:06,604 --> 00:43:07,563
ls that true?

688
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:10,691
-You know how rumors start--
-Yes, that's true.

689
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,943
I have nothing to hide.

690
00:43:13,152 --> 00:43:16,197
I'll deal with the devil
if it'll help with my program.

691
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:17,323
But believe me...

692
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,909
...there are no strings attached.

693
00:43:20,117 --> 00:43:21,702
You're sure about that?

694
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:27,082
Jack has been telling me
how you feel about things.

695
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,960
You'd like the sick people
given a break.

696
00:43:30,294 --> 00:43:32,296
You'd like to see
a new hospital built...

697
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:35,424
...a hospital that's the best
that money can buy.

698
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:40,304
You want those things because
you're a man who wants to do good.

699
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:43,224
l'd like to ask a question.

700
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,433
Shoot.

701
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,064
-Do you know what good comes out of?
-You tell me.

702
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:52,274
Out of bad, that's what.

703
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:55,194
Because you can't make it
out of anything else.

704
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:56,570
Did you know that?

705
00:43:56,987 --> 00:43:58,572
No, I didn't.

706
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:02,201
There's another question
l'd like to ask you.

707
00:44:02,368 --> 00:44:04,537
You say there's only bad
to start with...

708
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,914
...and the good must come from the bad.

709
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:10,209
Who's to determine
what's good and what's bad?

710
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,627
You?

711
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:13,462
Why not?

712
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:14,839
How?

713
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:16,465
Why, that's easy.

714
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,968
Make it up as you go along.

715
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:21,053
Folks.

716
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,223
There's a time to talk
and there's a time to act.

717
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:26,392
I think the time to act is now.

718
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,688
With your support, I will win
and do all of the things I promised.

719
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,066
I need your help.
I need it badly.

720
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,651
But I won't beg for it.

721
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:38,737
ln the name of this state
which we love...

722
00:44:39,572 --> 00:44:43,492
...and the governor in whose house
we meet, I demand it.

723
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:50,749
-What do you say, sir?
-You've got to say yes.

724
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,878
-I'm an old bird.
-But a game one.

725
00:44:54,086 --> 00:44:56,589
I'll give you complete power
as attorney general.

726
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:59,884
You can do anything you see fit.
I'll clear your way.

727
00:45:00,092 --> 00:45:02,386
-Is that a deal?
-It's a deal.

728
00:45:02,595 --> 00:45:05,014
We have to get back to town.
A lot to do.

729
00:45:05,222 --> 00:45:06,557
Good night.

730
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:12,605
I'm glad to have met you.

731
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:23,657
We want Willie!
We want Willie!

732
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:51,435
This is not a time for speechmaking.

733
00:45:51,644 --> 00:45:55,606
I should ask God for strength
to carry out your will.

734
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:07,326
This much I swear to you.

735
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:09,995
These things you shall have:

736
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:12,540
I'm going to build a hospital.

737
00:46:12,748 --> 00:46:15,042
The biggest that money can buy.

738
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:18,629
And it will belong to you.

739
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:23,676
That anyone who is sick or in pain
can go through those doors...

740
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:27,221
...and know that everything
will be done for them...

741
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:29,682
...to heal sickness,
to ease pain.

742
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,767
Free.
Not as a charity...

743
00:46:31,976 --> 00:46:33,227
...but as a right.

744
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,646
And it is your right.
Do you hear me?

745
00:46:35,855 --> 00:46:39,108
It's your right that
every child have an education.

746
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:43,279
That all who produce can take things
to market without paying toll.

747
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:47,616
And no poor man's land can be taxed
or taken away from him.

748
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:52,788
It is the right of the people that
they shall not be deprived of hope.

749
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:08,846
Does he mean it, Jack?

750
00:47:09,054 --> 00:47:10,723
That's his bribe.

751
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:17,188
What if it is his bribe?

752
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:21,484
He swept the old gang out of office.
They hollered like stuck pigs.

753
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:26,071
He jammed through bills,
and the people got what they wanted.

754
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:28,574
I demand that this bill be passed.

755
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:30,868
Nobody tells me
how to run this state.

756
00:47:31,243 --> 00:47:33,120
He started to build roads...

757
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:34,872
...schools, power dams...

758
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,833
...to change the state
from one end to the other.

759
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:40,795
His methods?
Politics is a dirty game.

760
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:44,507
And he played it rough and dirty.

761
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:48,219
Willie's little black book was
a record of corruption.

762
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:52,515
And me, Jack Burden, I kept the book
and added up the accounts.

763
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:55,643
''Clown, show-off, playboy,''
they yelled out.

764
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:57,895
Building stadiums.

765
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,940
Fiercely proud of his son
who played in them.

766
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:05,069
They said he was building
a private army.

767
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:07,488
But he was always building.

768
00:48:08,697 --> 00:48:12,451
Playing up to the crowd,
letting them trample on tradition.

769
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,497
Well, tradition needed trampling on.

770
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:26,215
The crowds loved it.

771
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,009
Willie loved it...

772
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,011
...and so did I.

773
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:42,606
You low-down, no-good redneck!

774
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:46,443
-What goes on?
-That's what Sadie wants to know.

775
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:49,155
The boss poses for too many pictures.

776
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:53,450
I'll kill him!

777
00:48:54,452 --> 00:48:55,411
Why, Sadie!

778
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,246
I'm surprised at you.

779
00:48:57,455 --> 00:48:58,706
I'll kill him!

780
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,460
I hate all women!

781
00:49:06,797 --> 00:49:08,340
Was she pretty?

782
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:13,596
Was she pretty?

783
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:16,307
If I met her on the street,
l'd never recognize her.

784
00:49:16,515 --> 00:49:19,143
I wasn't looking at her face.

785
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:22,480
If it'll cause this grief,
let him go.

786
00:49:22,688 --> 00:49:24,857
Let him go?
I'll kill him!

787
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:27,026
I'll drive him out of this state.

788
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,570
A guy sits with girls
on his knees in public--

789
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:32,198
Public or private, I know him.

790
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:34,742
How about Chicago?
That girl on skates.

791
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,536
And the time you both
went to St. Louis?

792
00:49:37,745 --> 00:49:41,540
There's a new invention, you know.
Photography and newsreels.

793
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:44,877
Willie Stark in a nightclub.
Willie with a blonde.

794
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:49,632
-You could always bleach your hair.
-I could also break his neck.

795
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:54,220
After all l've done for him,
now he's two-timing me.

796
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:58,641
He's two-timing Lucy, so there's
another kind of arithmetic for you.

797
00:50:00,226 --> 00:50:01,685
Lucy's a fool.

798
00:50:01,894 --> 00:50:05,523
If she had her way,
he'd be back slopping the hogs.

799
00:50:05,731 --> 00:50:08,484
He knows what she'd do for him.
She had her chance.

800
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:10,069
You think Lucy's out?

801
00:50:10,236 --> 00:50:13,864
-He'll ditch her. Give him time.
-You ought to know.

802
00:50:14,073 --> 00:50:17,535
You got the wrong guy.
I'm not the hero of this piece.

803
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:21,455
Come on, both of you.
Let's go, hurry it up.

804
00:50:26,377 --> 00:50:30,381
Pillsbury got caught.
I never did trust that guy.

805
00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:33,759
-Later, boys.
-What about these charges?

806
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:35,386
Go get the Judge.

807
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:38,430
Get him over to my hotel
as soon as you can.

808
00:50:41,225 --> 00:50:42,560
I waited for you.

809
00:50:45,688 --> 00:50:49,483
You promised we'd discuss
my charity project, children's home.

810
00:50:49,692 --> 00:50:53,320
I'm very sorry.
Something very important came up.

811
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:56,073
-You'll call me later, won't you?
-Certainly.

812
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:58,159
We're late.

813
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,461
Look at you, Pillsbury.
Fifty years old.

814
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:11,046
Gut sprung, teeth gone.
Never had a dime.

815
00:51:11,464 --> 00:51:14,967
If the Almighty wanted you rich,
He'd have done that long ago.

816
00:51:15,384 --> 00:51:18,137
The idea of you being rich.
That's blasphemy.

817
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:20,097
Ain't that a fact?

818
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:21,849
Answer me.

819
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:26,770
Don't mumble. Speak up!
Say, ''It's a blasphemous fact.''

820
00:51:27,146 --> 00:51:28,939
It's a blasphemous fact.

821
00:51:35,154 --> 00:51:36,113
I see.

822
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:37,990
Dumond can't come.
His wife is sick.

823
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:43,329
I don't care if she's dying.
Get him and bring him over here.

824
00:51:43,496 --> 00:51:45,623
You know what you're supposed to do?

825
00:51:45,998 --> 00:51:47,833
You stay poor and take orders.

826
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:51,378
There'll be sweetening sometimes.
Duffy'll take care of that.

827
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:54,507
Don't set up on your own again,
understand?

828
00:51:57,009 --> 00:51:58,344
Say ''I understand that.''

829
00:51:59,094 --> 00:52:00,471
I understand that.

830
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:02,473
Give him a pen and paper.

831
00:52:05,643 --> 00:52:06,685
See who that is.

832
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:14,527
Hello, Judge, sit down.
I'll be with you soon.

833
00:52:16,362 --> 00:52:18,447
Write what I tell you to write.

834
00:52:18,656 --> 00:52:20,157
Dear Governor Stark:

835
00:52:21,617 --> 00:52:23,911
I wish to resign as auditor
due to ill health...

836
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:27,123
...to take effect as soon as
you can relieve me.

837
00:52:28,499 --> 00:52:29,750
Respectfully yours.

838
00:52:33,212 --> 00:52:34,088
Did you sign it?

839
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:36,549
Well, sign it!

840
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:38,843
Don't date it.
I'll fill it in.

841
00:52:45,057 --> 00:52:46,016
Bring it to me.

842
00:52:52,565 --> 00:52:54,024
Now get out.

843
00:52:56,152 --> 00:52:58,904
-The papers have the story.
-I know.

844
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:02,241
They're talking about
impeachment proceedings.

845
00:53:02,867 --> 00:53:05,870
-Against who?
-This time, Pillsbury.

846
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:08,956
I got that ''this time.''

847
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:11,208
-How true is it?
-It's too true.

848
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:18,257
This is it.
Jeff Hopkins on the wire.

849
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:20,092
What have we got on Hopkins?

850
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:23,888
Hello, Jeff.
About that Pillsbury business.

851
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:26,724
Here's what you do
in the legislature.

852
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:29,935
Wait a minute.
You listen to me.

853
00:53:31,103 --> 00:53:34,273
You got a mortgage due
on your place in five weeks.

854
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:37,234
You'd like to get it renewed,
wouldn't you?

855
00:53:38,068 --> 00:53:40,738
Tiny will talk to you in the morning.

856
00:53:40,946 --> 00:53:41,780
Get going.

857
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:46,243
You haven't answered my question.
Why are you saving Pillsbury?

858
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:50,289
Not Pillsbury. It's something
much more important than that.

859
00:53:50,456 --> 00:53:53,959
If McMurphy gets away with this,
no telling where he'll stop.

860
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:55,461
Or where you will.

861
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:57,630
Pillsbury's guilty.

862
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:00,633
As attorney general,
it's my job to prosecute.

863
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:03,677
Judge, you talks like
Pillsbury was human.

864
00:54:03,886 --> 00:54:05,679
He isn't. He's a thing.

865
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:09,099
You don't prosecute a machine
that makes a mistake.

866
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:10,351
You fix it.

867
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,852
Well, I fixed him.

868
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:16,190
I'm not interested in Pillsbury.
It's something much bigger.

869
00:54:16,398 --> 00:54:18,192
Yes, it is.

870
00:54:21,028 --> 00:54:23,656
He's right.
Can't you see that he's right?

871
00:54:23,864 --> 00:54:25,866
Because you want him to be right.

872
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:28,160
You're afraid to admit
you made a mistake.

873
00:54:28,661 --> 00:54:31,288
Do it now, before it's too late.

874
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:36,836
I'm offering my resignation
as attorney general.

875
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:39,505
You'll have it in writing
in the morning.

876
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:41,048
Dated.

877
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:49,723
It took you a long time
to make up your mind.

878
00:54:50,182 --> 00:54:52,017
What made you take so long?

879
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:54,103
I wasn't sure.

880
00:54:54,311 --> 00:54:55,813
Now you are?

881
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:59,400
I'll tell you what you are.
You're scared.

882
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:03,320
You sat for 30 years
and played at being a judge.

883
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:06,657
Then I put a bat in your hand
and said, ''Start swinging!''

884
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:09,493
You had a good time,
but now you're scared.

885
00:55:09,702 --> 00:55:11,662
You don't want to get
your hands dirty.

886
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,582
You want to pick up the marbles
but not get dirty.

887
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,710
Look at my program. How do you
think I put that across?

888
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:20,838
I knew how but I never knew why.

889
00:55:21,464 --> 00:55:25,050
You're not thinking of going over
to McMurphy, are you?

890
00:55:25,259 --> 00:55:27,344
I'm through with politics.

891
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:30,514
I'm happy to hear that.

892
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:32,391
No hard feelings.

893
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,185
Goodbye, governor.

894
00:55:34,727 --> 00:55:36,687
You coming with me?

895
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,857
You're making a mistake.

896
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:49,909
You think he means it when he says
he's through with politics?

897
00:55:50,743 --> 00:55:52,536
No, I don't.

898
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:59,293
What about you?

899
00:55:59,502 --> 00:56:02,171
l've known the judge all my life.

900
00:56:02,379 --> 00:56:04,924
He's always meant
everything he's said.

901
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:06,717
All right, take it easy.

902
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:10,471
I'll take your word for it.

903
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:21,732
Sugar, take Miss Stanton home.

904
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,945
When am I going to see you again?

905
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:30,491
What's the matter?

906
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:32,701
Please take me home now.

907
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:36,288
-You've got to understand me.
-I understand you.

908
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:38,999
It's myself I don't understand.

909
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:42,128
Do you think I like sneaking around?

910
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:46,173
But with the Pillsbury business
and your uncle quitting, a divorce--

911
00:56:46,382 --> 00:56:49,135
Maybe we'd better stop
seeing each other.

912
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:55,808
We won't stop seeing each other,
will we?

913
00:56:57,601 --> 00:57:00,187
Because you believe what I tell you.

914
00:57:01,397 --> 00:57:03,274
Because I believe what you tell me.

915
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:05,860
Good evening, Governor Stark.

916
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:10,239
You might like to know that
Judge Stanton kept his promise.

917
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,535
He gave the story
to every paper in town.

918
00:57:14,994 --> 00:57:17,746
Sugar, meet me at the hotel
as soon as you can.

919
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:28,883
These are serious charges...

920
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:31,927
...that Judge Stanton
has given to the press.

921
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:36,140
This legislature is entitled
to a complete and full report...

922
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,017
...on the Pillsbury affair.

923
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:40,978
Let the truth be known.
Let it come out.

924
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:43,063
-I move we adjourn.
-I second it.

925
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:45,357
All those in favor say ''aye.''

926
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:47,735
Motion carried.

927
00:57:50,112 --> 00:57:51,071
House is adjourned.

928
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:02,666
You let Stark get away with
the graft, there's no telling--

929
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:07,171
We beat the Pillsbury rap.
It's over.

930
00:58:07,379 --> 00:58:09,340
These things are never over.

931
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:11,509
Tell you what I want you to do.

932
00:58:12,384 --> 00:58:14,970
I want you to start
a new page in your book.

933
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:17,348
Under the name of Judge Stanton.

934
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:20,476
-There's nothing on him.
-Why?

935
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:22,728
Because his name is Stanton?

936
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:24,647
Easy.

937
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:26,774
What if I won't do it?

938
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:29,735
You know, some of this
has rubbed off on you.

939
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:33,906
What will you do?
Have me shot?

940
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:37,451
No, but I'll have
to get myself a new boy.

941
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,829
There's nothing on the judge.

942
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:42,373
There's something on everybody.

943
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:45,876
Man is conceived in sin
and born in corruption.

944
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:47,795
It's a waste of time.

945
00:58:49,046 --> 00:58:50,673
What's the matter?

946
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:54,260
You afraid you might find
something out?

947
00:59:06,897 --> 00:59:10,776
I kept saying to myself
that Willie was wrong about the judge.

948
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:14,780
If there was anything left
at Burden's Landing, it was honor.

949
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:17,074
I had to believe that.

950
00:59:18,868 --> 00:59:21,120
I want to ask you a question.

951
00:59:22,496 --> 00:59:24,582
Was the judge ever broke?

952
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,459
Really broke?

953
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:28,961
Why do you want to know?

954
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:31,297
I don't.

955
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:33,841
But l've got to.

956
00:59:35,217 --> 00:59:37,761
-Did he tell you--
-Did who tell me?

957
00:59:40,222 --> 00:59:41,682
I don't know.

958
00:59:44,101 --> 00:59:46,228
How should I know
if he was ever broke?

959
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:49,023
Come on, take this food
and start cooking.

960
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:51,066
-I'm hungry.
-I'm thirsty.

961
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:53,694
Bring some glasses quick.

962
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,241
It's been a long time
since l've played this thing.

963
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:04,580
-Let's wake up the ghost.
-Another glass, Anne, for a ghost.

964
01:00:11,003 --> 01:00:15,925
Remember the last time I played this?
You and Anne were dancing.

965
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,345
Shall we dance?

966
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:22,348
Let's have a drink first.

967
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,351
Keep playing.

968
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:28,312
Anne and I want to hear this.

969
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:30,022
Don't we?

970
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:31,649
Adam.

971
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:35,736
Ghost.

972
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:38,280
And me.

973
01:00:39,156 --> 01:00:40,866
What shall we drink to?

974
01:00:41,742 --> 01:00:43,035
To Ghost?

975
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:46,539
To Adam.

976
01:00:46,747 --> 01:00:49,834
To the director
of the new medical center.

977
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,548
Don't you ever stop working for him?

978
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:58,175
-I'm sorry.
-Well, I'm not.

979
01:00:58,425 --> 01:01:01,137
What's wrong with being
director of the center?

980
01:01:02,388 --> 01:01:04,849
Nothing, except
I'm not going to take it.

981
01:01:05,057 --> 01:01:06,934
Why?
Because your uncle resigned?

982
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,310
That's partly it.

983
01:01:08,602 --> 01:01:11,063
-There are other things.
-What other things?

984
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:13,190
You too?

985
01:01:13,399 --> 01:01:14,692
Me too.

986
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,570
If Adam doesn't want
to discuss it, let's not.

987
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:21,323
-Let's discuss it.
-But calmly.

988
01:01:21,532 --> 01:01:23,075
Calmly.

989
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:26,871
Go ahead.
Why do you think he wants me?

990
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:28,998
You're the best man for the job.

991
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:31,250
It has nothing to do with my name?

992
01:01:31,459 --> 01:01:32,960
It could.
Let's grant that.

993
01:01:33,461 --> 01:01:36,255
-That's your answer.
-No, it's not.

994
01:01:36,464 --> 01:01:39,258
If that were the only answer,
I wouldn't be with him.

995
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:43,637
There's another side of it.
I learned something from him.

996
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:46,140
You can't make an omelet
without cracking eggs.

997
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:47,641
Or heads?

998
01:01:48,142 --> 01:01:50,769
A hospital will be built
and the sick cared for.

999
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:52,438
At what price?

1000
01:01:52,646 --> 01:01:54,440
At any price.

1001
01:01:56,108 --> 01:01:57,943
Do you really believe that?

1002
01:01:58,402 --> 01:02:01,113
I really believe
that Stark wants to do good.

1003
01:02:01,322 --> 01:02:03,824
You do too.
It's a matter of method.

1004
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:07,286
Many times, out of evil comes good.

1005
01:02:07,536 --> 01:02:09,955
Pain is evil.
As a doctor, you know that.

1006
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:14,126
Pain is an evil, it is not evil.
It is not evil in itself.

1007
01:02:14,335 --> 01:02:15,836
Stark is evil.

1008
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:19,465
The people of this state
don't think so.

1009
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:21,175
How would they know?

1010
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:24,970
Stark took over the newspapers
and radio stations.

1011
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:27,640
Why be so afraid of criticism?

1012
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:30,476
If Stark does good,
he should be interested in truth.

1013
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:33,229
I don't see how
you can separate the two.

1014
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:37,817
-Stark is not for me.
-No, Stark is not for you.

1015
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,443
Well, what's for you?

1016
01:02:39,652 --> 01:02:43,322
Pride. That's all it is.
Foolish, stupid pride.

1017
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:47,701
You've talked about what you could do
if somebody would build.

1018
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,246
Somebody has,
and he's given it to you.

1019
01:02:50,454 --> 01:02:53,999
But he's not for you.
No, he's not for you.

1020
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,482
Will I find anything, Judge?

1021
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:20,192
Will I?

1022
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:25,364
I didn't find it all at once.

1023
01:03:25,573 --> 01:03:29,535
Takes a long time to go through
old records and musty deeds.

1024
01:03:29,743 --> 01:03:31,495
A very long time.

1025
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:35,875
But it wasn't too hard for me.

1026
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,252
I was well-trained in research.

1027
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,546
Especially this kind.

1028
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:51,223
I found what I didn't want to find.

1029
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:57,188
Have some photostat copies
made of these.

1030
01:03:58,272 --> 01:04:00,483
I'll be back tomorrow for them.

1031
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:04,904
-Who is it?
-It's me, Sadie Burke.

1032
01:04:05,112 --> 01:04:06,405
Wait a minute.

1033
01:04:08,657 --> 01:04:10,242
All right, come in.

1034
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:15,456
Awful lot of smoke.

1035
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:18,334
Awful lot of whiskey.

1036
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:23,798
You sober?

1037
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:25,090
Stone.

1038
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:26,926
I'll have one with you.

1039
01:04:29,845 --> 01:04:31,639
What are you hiding out for?

1040
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:33,808
-I've been sleeping.
-For four days?

1041
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:36,352
You've been back in town
for four days.

1042
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,022
-Willie knows everything.
-Willie's worried about his boy.

1043
01:04:40,272 --> 01:04:43,067
Willie's boy is worried
about Willie's boy.

1044
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:46,195
Why don't you put a mean blues
on the phonograph?

1045
01:04:46,403 --> 01:04:50,032
Play it until you get sick of it,
then go back to work.

1046
01:04:50,241 --> 01:04:52,493
-I do it.
-That's not my problem.

1047
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:55,037
No, it isn't your problem.

1048
01:04:56,497 --> 01:04:59,291
I'll wait for you
if you want to powder your nose.

1049
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:01,544
I'll be with you in a minute.

1050
01:05:07,216 --> 01:05:08,843
I can see it.

1051
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:14,640
l've got to look
in the mirror to see it.

1052
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:18,602
Soft, white skin.

1053
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:22,606
Not like mine.

1054
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:26,819
I had smallpox when I was a kid.

1055
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:32,283
Where I lived, it seemed nearly
all the kids had smallpox.

1056
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:36,704
It leaves your face hard.

1057
01:05:38,622 --> 01:05:40,458
And she's got poise.

1058
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:44,378
Look at the way she holds her head
at just the right angle.

1059
01:05:45,004 --> 01:05:48,799
That takes training.
That takes years of training.

1060
01:05:50,926 --> 01:05:53,387
I see what Willie sees.

1061
01:05:55,097 --> 01:05:57,016
-Willie's got big ideas.
-What?

1062
01:05:57,224 --> 01:06:00,644
A girl like that could be
a governor's wife or a president's.

1063
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:04,398
-What are you saying?
-He ditched me and he'll ditch you.

1064
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:07,276
He'll ditch everybody
because that's what he wants.

1065
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:09,403
-Nobody in the world but him.
-What?

1066
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,198
You and your high-toned friends.

1067
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:16,202
What do they know about anything?
Why did you have to mix her in?

1068
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,704
-You're out of your mind.
-Am l?

1069
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:20,790
Why don't you go ask her?

1070
01:06:20,998 --> 01:06:23,709
-Or ask him, ask Willie.
-Shut up!

1071
01:06:34,136 --> 01:06:35,137
Nice catch.

1072
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:43,521
All the ends over here.

1073
01:06:43,938 --> 01:06:46,232
All the ends over this way.
Come on.

1074
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:48,108
He's off today.

1075
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:50,861
It's only practice.
He'll be all right.

1076
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,532
You've been gone a long time.

1077
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:57,576
I figured if you needed me,
you'd yell.

1078
01:06:58,285 --> 01:06:59,787
Why'd you lay around
that hotel?

1079
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:02,081
-Thinking.
-About what?

1080
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,582
Things.

1081
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,293
What did you find on the judge?

1082
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:07,753
Nothing.

1083
01:07:08,754 --> 01:07:10,422
You sure?

1084
01:07:11,382 --> 01:07:13,801
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-You'll keep trying?

1085
01:07:13,968 --> 01:07:16,095
-If you want me to.
-I want you to.

1086
01:07:16,303 --> 01:07:19,890
-There's something else.
-What? Bucket boy? Towel swinger?

1087
01:07:21,016 --> 01:07:23,561
-What's eating you?
-What else do you want?

1088
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:26,689
If you've got something
on your mind, spit it out.

1089
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:27,982
What do you want?

1090
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:32,570
Your pal Adam Stanton turned down
the hospital director job.

1091
01:07:33,112 --> 01:07:36,365
That's bad.
Especially at a time like this.

1092
01:07:37,491 --> 01:07:41,287
-How did you hear it?
-What difference does it make?

1093
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:44,874
-I just wanted to know.
-I heard it around.

1094
01:07:45,082 --> 01:07:47,209
How did you hear he turned it down?

1095
01:07:47,418 --> 01:07:49,295
I'll be back.
Something's happening.

1096
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:53,090
-You'll practice the way I say.
-I'll do it my way.

1097
01:07:53,299 --> 01:07:54,508
What's going on?

1098
01:07:54,717 --> 01:07:57,553
I don't care if he is your son.
No special rules for him.

1099
01:07:57,761 --> 01:07:59,638
It makes no difference
if I play or not.

1100
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,474
It does to me.
What should he do?

1101
01:08:01,682 --> 01:08:03,809
Behave himself
like the other boys.

1102
01:08:04,018 --> 01:08:07,855
Four times, he's broken training.
He comes to practice half-potted.

1103
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,566
You're going to have
to obey the rules.

1104
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:13,944
Every Saturday,
I put them across, don't l?

1105
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:16,864
I do it drunk or sober.
That's all you want.

1106
01:08:17,072 --> 01:08:21,160
So you can big-shot it around.
lsn't that all you want?

1107
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:26,290
He's a little high-strung.
Tom, come here.

1108
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:40,846
Come on, let's go faster.
Come on.

1109
01:09:22,596 --> 01:09:24,390
It's the governor's son.

1110
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:38,779
Mr. Hale's here to see you.

1111
01:09:44,452 --> 01:09:47,830
Go upstairs.
I have some business with Mr. Hale.

1112
01:09:48,038 --> 01:09:50,249
What l've got to say
anybody can listen to.

1113
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:54,086
-Where's your boy?
-Now don't get excited.

1114
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:58,090
-Get me another drink.
-My daughter may die.

1115
01:09:58,299 --> 01:10:02,428
She won't die. She'll get
the best medical attention there is.

1116
01:10:02,636 --> 01:10:03,888
-Where is he?
-I'll get him.

1117
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:05,347
Wait a minute.

1118
01:10:05,556 --> 01:10:08,142
He's asleep.
He'll be all right.

1119
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:12,563
He won't be all right
unless you make him all right.

1120
01:10:12,771 --> 01:10:14,023
I'll get him.

1121
01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:23,240
-Care for a drink?
-No, thanks.

1122
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:27,119
-Accidents will happen, you know.
-Accidents?

1123
01:10:27,328 --> 01:10:28,454
Your boy was drunk.

1124
01:10:28,662 --> 01:10:32,917
I saw the police report. There was
nothing about drunkenness on it.

1125
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,794
Whose police and whose report?

1126
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:38,088
I say the boy was drunk,
and I know it.

1127
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,050
Here before your father, I want--

1128
01:10:41,842 --> 01:10:43,803
The doctor says you need rest.

1129
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:46,806
I don't want you to try
to cover up for me.

1130
01:10:47,014 --> 01:10:48,516
I was wrong and that's it.

1131
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:50,476
You don't know.
I saw the report.

1132
01:10:50,684 --> 01:10:53,646
I don't care
what the police report says.

1133
01:10:53,854 --> 01:10:57,274
I was driving and I was drunk.
It's all my fault.

1134
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:00,986
Anything you want to do to me,
you can do.

1135
01:11:01,195 --> 01:11:03,531
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do.

1136
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:06,575
Nobody has to do anything.
I'll take care of it.

1137
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:09,328
I don't want you to take care of it.

1138
01:11:12,623 --> 01:11:14,834
Go on upstairs and get some rest.

1139
01:11:16,919 --> 01:11:18,420
Sugar, help him.

1140
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:29,932
Come on over and sit down.

1141
01:11:42,194 --> 01:11:44,363
Sure you wouldn't care for a drink?

1142
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:50,327
Tiny, go home, will you?
Go on, out of here.

1143
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,380
What business did
you say you're in?

1144
01:12:01,589 --> 01:12:03,215
I didn't say.

1145
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:07,303
-What business are you in?
-Trucking business.

1146
01:12:07,511 --> 01:12:09,263
Trucking business.

1147
01:12:10,181 --> 01:12:12,391
Trucks run on state roads.

1148
01:12:13,684 --> 01:12:17,771
If a man in the trucking business
had a contract with the state...

1149
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,191
...that'd be pretty good,
wouldn't it?

1150
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:23,068
Tell him what would happen.
Go on.

1151
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:25,988
Trying to bribe me, aren't you?

1152
01:12:27,364 --> 01:12:30,284
No, I'm not trying to bribe you.

1153
01:12:30,493 --> 01:12:32,953
I'm only talking
things over with you.

1154
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,289
You're pretty good at talking.

1155
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:38,459
I remember when you
first started talking.

1156
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:40,336
A place called Upton.

1157
01:12:40,544 --> 01:12:44,590
You did a lot of talking then.
The things you said made sense.

1158
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,967
To me and a lot of other people.

1159
01:12:47,176 --> 01:12:51,305
I believed in you, I followed you,
and I fought for you.

1160
01:12:52,056 --> 01:12:54,475
Well, the words are still good.

1161
01:12:55,768 --> 01:12:57,311
But you're not.

1162
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,736
And I don't believe you ever were.

1163
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:16,205
Follow him.
Keep calling in.

1164
01:13:48,988 --> 01:13:51,282
l'd like Anne to see you now.

1165
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,743
l'd like Anne to see you now,
you drunken sot!

1166
01:13:59,498 --> 01:14:00,875
Come on.

1167
01:14:11,385 --> 01:14:13,512
All right, I'll give you a statement.

1168
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:16,432
This is a mess of lies.

1169
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,852
Have the man that made that
statement repeat it to my face.

1170
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,270
You can't.
He's vanished.

1171
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:23,522
Let me ask you some questions.

1172
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:25,608
Why has he gone?
Where is he?

1173
01:14:25,816 --> 01:14:27,860
Maybe you could answer those too?

1174
01:14:29,487 --> 01:14:32,823
-I won't dignify that with an answer.
-One more question.

1175
01:14:33,032 --> 01:14:33,949
Where's your son?

1176
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:36,535
At the stadium, where he should be.

1177
01:14:36,744 --> 01:14:40,414
He'll play for the university, which
my administration is responsible for.

1178
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:41,999
He's not hiding.

1179
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,503
He'll be there in full view
of 70,000 cheering fans.

1180
01:14:45,711 --> 01:14:47,296
One of which will be me.

1181
01:14:47,505 --> 01:14:48,839
See you, men.

1182
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:53,385
Where's Stark?

1183
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:56,680
How about Tommy Stark?

1184
01:14:56,889 --> 01:14:58,182
Send your boy in!

1185
01:15:00,893 --> 01:15:02,228
Why don't they put him in?

1186
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:04,897
Come on, Willie.
Send your boy in.

1187
01:15:05,105 --> 01:15:08,359
What's the matter?
ls your boy ashamed to show his face?

1188
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,069
-Shut up!
-Get him out of here!

1189
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:13,614
-Go on, get him out of here!
-What's the idea?

1190
01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:19,495
They're booing you.

1191
01:15:19,703 --> 01:15:22,206
-My head--
-The doctor said it's nothing.

1192
01:15:22,456 --> 01:15:25,000
-I get dizzy, can't see.
-You're scared.

1193
01:15:25,209 --> 01:15:27,086
-Get out!
-They're booing me too.

1194
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:29,130
I built this for those dirty--

1195
01:15:29,338 --> 01:15:32,550
Thattaboy, show some spirit!
Tell him what his playing means.

1196
01:15:32,758 --> 01:15:35,094
You can't tell about a head injury.
Maybe he's hurt.

1197
01:15:35,302 --> 01:15:38,722
He's hurt. I'm hurt.
I didn't crash the car or get drunk.

1198
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:40,182
But I'm taking the rap.

1199
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:44,019
Get out there and play.
Show them what a Stark is made of.

1200
01:15:44,228 --> 01:15:45,729
I wouldn't know.

1201
01:15:47,898 --> 01:15:49,483
Come on.
Cut it out!

1202
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:56,240
All right, I'll play.
Now get out of here!

1203
01:16:10,337 --> 01:16:12,173
Stark's going in.

1204
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:40,826
One, two, three, four, five....

1205
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:15,569
Boss, you got to eat.

1206
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:17,363
You got to.

1207
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:21,158
I'm the one that made him play.

1208
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:22,993
I sent him in.

1209
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:25,704
Sit down.
Please sit down.

1210
01:17:29,834 --> 01:17:33,921
-I sent him in.
-What difference does that make now?

1211
01:17:34,839 --> 01:17:35,673
What goes on?

1212
01:17:35,881 --> 01:17:39,385
-There isn't a plane flying.
-They got to. My son's got to live.

1213
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,054
I got a call from Dr. Birnham.

1214
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:44,765
The earliest he can get here
is tomorrow morning.

1215
01:17:46,016 --> 01:17:47,017
There's nobody else?

1216
01:17:47,226 --> 01:17:49,895
-Dr. Stanton should operate.
-That's up to Stark.

1217
01:17:50,104 --> 01:17:53,816
He wanted another doctor,
a specialist. I sent for one.

1218
01:17:54,024 --> 01:17:56,193
How bad is it really, doc?

1219
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:58,529
He's unconscious and paralyzed.

1220
01:18:02,116 --> 01:18:04,285
-Has he got a chance?
-To live, yes.

1221
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:05,578
What do you mean?

1222
01:18:05,786 --> 01:18:10,416
Even if the operation is successful,
that is, if he lives...

1223
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,586
...I think he'll be paralyzed
for life.

1224
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:16,422
You'll do everything you can,
won't you?

1225
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,924
Anything between us wouldn't count,
would it?

1226
01:18:19,133 --> 01:18:22,803
Anything you want,
just ask for it and you got it.

1227
01:18:23,012 --> 01:18:26,724
There are some things
that even you can't buy.

1228
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:29,059
Do you want me to operate
or don't you?

1229
01:18:31,812 --> 01:18:33,772
I want you to operate.

1230
01:18:37,902 --> 01:18:39,778
May I see Tom now?

1231
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:55,419
How much does he know?

1232
01:18:55,628 --> 01:18:58,047
-About what?
-You know what I'm talking about.

1233
01:18:58,255 --> 01:19:00,257
-How much does he know?
-About what?

1234
01:19:00,466 --> 01:19:02,259
About Anne and me.

1235
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,805
He doesn't know a thing.
Not a thing!

1236
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:18,651
How is he?

1237
01:19:19,193 --> 01:19:20,486
The boy?

1238
01:19:21,028 --> 01:19:23,197
-He'll live.
-Thank God.

1239
01:19:24,532 --> 01:19:26,325
-How is--?
-Willie?

1240
01:19:27,535 --> 01:19:29,662
He blames himself, doesn't he?

1241
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:33,165
He'll find someone else
to blame in a few days.

1242
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:37,336
I tried to call here
at the hospital but I just--

1243
01:19:57,898 --> 01:19:59,650
Why did you do it?

1244
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:02,653
He wasn't like anybody
I ever knew before.

1245
01:20:03,404 --> 01:20:05,364
You mean he wasn't like me.

1246
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:08,701
It wasn't like anybody
I ever knew before.

1247
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,620
I love him.
I guess that's the reason.

1248
01:20:11,829 --> 01:20:13,831
Everybody loves him.

1249
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:15,916
He wants to marry me.

1250
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:20,880
-Are you going to?
-Not now. It would hurt him.

1251
01:20:21,088 --> 01:20:23,299
A divorce would hurt his career.

1252
01:20:24,175 --> 01:20:25,759
His career!

1253
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:28,762
What are you going to do?

1254
01:20:28,971 --> 01:20:32,933
You can't leave him now.
He needs you more than ever.

1255
01:20:33,184 --> 01:20:34,935
What Willie needs, Willie's got.

1256
01:20:35,144 --> 01:20:36,896
You don't know him.

1257
01:20:37,438 --> 01:20:40,691
You've known him all these years
and you don't know him.

1258
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:41,734
What about Adam?

1259
01:20:44,028 --> 01:20:45,529
Don't worry about him.

1260
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:49,533
If he finds out, it'll prove a Stanton
is no different than anyone else.

1261
01:20:49,742 --> 01:20:51,577
Just show him these.

1262
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:55,748
Willie was right. ''A man is conceived
in sin and born in corruption.''

1263
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:59,251
Even Judge Stanton.
Show them to him.

1264
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,922
Change the picture of the world
that Adam has in his head.

1265
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,633
Just like our picture of it
has been changed.

1266
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,427
Wipe out everything he believes.
It'll be good for him.

1267
01:21:08,636 --> 01:21:12,264
There's no God but Willie Stark.
I'm his prophet and you're his--

1268
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:18,229
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--

1269
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,982
What's going on here?

1270
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,443
It's all right, officer.

1271
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:27,321
We both work for Willie Stark.

1272
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:39,750
That'll be the main building.
Fifteen stories high.

1273
01:21:39,959 --> 01:21:42,628
That's the laboratory.
World's finest equipment.

1274
01:21:42,837 --> 01:21:45,589
What are you trying to do?
l've taken the job.

1275
01:21:45,798 --> 01:21:47,091
Why?

1276
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,636
My reasons are my own.

1277
01:21:51,011 --> 01:21:54,181
-Why are you building the hospital?
-To do good for the people.

1278
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:55,307
And get votes.

1279
01:21:55,516 --> 01:21:58,310
-There's lots of ways to get votes.
-I know.

1280
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:01,772
I won't stand for any interference.

1281
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:03,524
I won't interfere.

1282
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:06,652
I may fire you,
but I won't interfere.

1283
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:10,656
You're wasting your time with threats.
You know what I think of you.

1284
01:22:10,865 --> 01:22:13,450
Yes, I know.
I'll tell you what.

1285
01:22:14,326 --> 01:22:16,537
We'll each stay
on our own side of the fence.

1286
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:18,205
ls that a deal?

1287
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:24,879
Now he had us all.

1288
01:22:25,087 --> 01:22:27,840
Me, Anne and Adam.

1289
01:22:28,048 --> 01:22:30,593
Now we all worked for him.

1290
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:37,016
So the eyes of the entire nation
are now focused upon Governor Stark...

1291
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:40,060
...an amazing phenomenon
on the political scene.

1292
01:22:40,269 --> 01:22:43,189
A whole state is filled
with his accomplishments.

1293
01:22:43,397 --> 01:22:46,817
Each one of them
bearing his personal signature...

1294
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:50,362
...to make sure
no one will ever forget him.

1295
01:22:50,821 --> 01:22:53,324
This is the way
the roads used to be.

1296
01:22:53,574 --> 01:22:56,494
But some claim
that they were adequate...

1297
01:22:57,161 --> 01:23:01,081
...that you don't need a 4-lane
highway for a horse and buggy.

1298
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:05,836
When Stark boasts of his great
school system, his critics say:

1299
01:23:06,045 --> 01:23:09,131
''You can't go to school
and work fields at the same time.''

1300
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:12,176
They question the benefit
of these projects...

1301
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:15,429
...charging that need and poverty
is as great as before.

1302
01:23:16,263 --> 01:23:19,517
Willie Stark has never forgotten
the source of his power:

1303
01:23:19,725 --> 01:23:21,727
The people who supported him.

1304
01:23:21,936 --> 01:23:25,231
He still keeps his touch
with these people of the backwoods...

1305
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:28,567
...making periodic trips
to such places as Kanoma City...

1306
01:23:29,109 --> 01:23:31,821
...now famous as his birthplace.

1307
01:23:32,446 --> 01:23:35,491
For those who say Stark
is a man of destiny...

1308
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:38,619
...there are others who claim
that he is evil.

1309
01:23:38,786 --> 01:23:42,414
A man who cares neither
for the people or the state...

1310
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:46,043
...but only for his own
personal power and ambition.

1311
01:23:46,377 --> 01:23:50,589
Obviously, these ambitions go
far beyond the state's boundaries.

1312
01:23:50,798 --> 01:23:54,343
Just how far,
only time will tell.

1313
01:23:54,552 --> 01:23:56,220
Meanwhile, he is here.

1314
01:23:56,428 --> 01:23:59,223
From the looks of things,
he is here to stay.

1315
01:24:00,474 --> 01:24:02,226
Willie Stark.

1316
01:24:02,434 --> 01:24:04,562
Messiah or dictator?.

1317
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:08,899
How do you like it?

1318
01:24:09,108 --> 01:24:11,193
-How many theaters will play this?
-All over.

1319
01:24:11,402 --> 01:24:13,571
Hear that?
All over the country.

1320
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:17,408
There's one thing I didn't like.
That ''messiah or the dictator.''

1321
01:24:17,616 --> 01:24:19,952
That's our view.
That's the way it stands.

1322
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:27,293
That's the way it stands
as of now.

1323
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:09,752
How are you making it, Pa?

1324
01:25:10,085 --> 01:25:11,629
How are you, Tom?

1325
01:25:11,837 --> 01:25:13,631
I made some refreshments.

1326
01:25:13,839 --> 01:25:15,508
-I'll get them.
-I'll help.

1327
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:18,052
No, thank you.
Thank you kindly.

1328
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:21,639
The boys have to get back
to make the morning editions.

1329
01:25:21,847 --> 01:25:25,351
Set them up on the porch.
We'll take pictures here first.

1330
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:34,985
Mrs. Stark.

1331
01:25:36,862 --> 01:25:39,281
Take one down there.
Shoot it up this way.

1332
01:25:48,999 --> 01:25:51,377
You're still a great cook.

1333
01:25:57,216 --> 01:25:59,385
I better be getting back to town.

1334
01:26:00,427 --> 01:26:02,763
Nice to have spent the day
with the family.

1335
01:26:04,223 --> 01:26:05,224
Goodbye.

1336
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:08,227
Take care, Pappy.

1337
01:26:08,435 --> 01:26:11,313
How do you like
the new radio I got you?

1338
01:26:11,522 --> 01:26:14,692
You can get police calls on it.
I'll show you.

1339
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:19,780
This one for police calls.

1340
01:26:19,989 --> 01:26:23,075
Car 62, proceed to 518 Oak Street.

1341
01:26:23,284 --> 01:26:25,911
Tom Jones is beating his wife again.

1342
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,749
-Car 62, proceed to 518 Oak Street.
-Now this one, go ahead.

1343
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:33,961
We interrupt this
for a special announcement.

1344
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:38,424
Today, the body of Richard Hale,
father of the girl who died...

1345
01:26:38,632 --> 01:26:41,385
...in the governor's son's car,
was found.

1346
01:26:41,594 --> 01:26:44,555
A medical examination revealed
he was beaten to death.

1347
01:26:44,763 --> 01:26:46,432
The charge of murder...

1348
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,143
...has been hurled
at the administration...

1349
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:52,438
...by Stark's opponents,
led by Judge Stanton...

1350
01:26:52,646 --> 01:26:54,607
...lately an outspoken critic....

1351
01:26:54,815 --> 01:26:56,150
Your friend, the judge.

1352
01:26:56,358 --> 01:27:00,279
Thus an almost forgotten incident
provided the spark that might set off...

1353
01:27:00,488 --> 01:27:03,782
...the explosion needed to rock
Willie Stark out of power.

1354
01:27:03,991 --> 01:27:08,454
The latest report says impeachment
proceedings may be institut--

1355
01:27:10,331 --> 01:27:13,584
How long will it take to pack?
Come to the city with me.

1356
01:27:13,793 --> 01:27:15,336
-Why?
-Because I need you.

1357
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:18,088
-What for?
-I'll explain later.

1358
01:27:18,297 --> 01:27:21,592
-I'll wait outside.
-Stay. I want you to witness this.

1359
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:23,260
She can bear witness too.

1360
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:27,473
-I'm going back to get Duffy.
-You stay right here.

1361
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:30,518
Somebody's got to go back
to the capital.

1362
01:27:30,726 --> 01:27:31,769
I'll go.

1363
01:27:31,977 --> 01:27:34,522
Tell Duffy not to do anything
until I'm there.

1364
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:39,109
Now that he's in trouble,
he needs us.

1365
01:27:39,318 --> 01:27:43,239
He can lead us around like monkeys
and say, ''Feel sorry for me...

1366
01:27:43,447 --> 01:27:46,116
...a family man with a wife
and a crippled son!''

1367
01:27:46,325 --> 01:27:47,660
Shut up!

1368
01:27:49,078 --> 01:27:51,831
-Why don't you leave us alone?
-Leave him alone?

1369
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:53,958
How many scrapes
have I gotten him out of?

1370
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:55,709
Stop!

1371
01:27:55,918 --> 01:27:57,878
It's not him they're after.
It's me.

1372
01:27:58,087 --> 01:28:00,631
How many half-wits
must I pay to square this?

1373
01:28:00,881 --> 01:28:02,842
What do you think this will cost me?

1374
01:28:03,384 --> 01:28:05,511
What do you think it cost him?

1375
01:28:10,141 --> 01:28:14,353
A man builds for his son.
That's all he builds for.

1376
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:36,959
Give me a drink.

1377
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:44,133
She'll go.

1378
01:28:50,556 --> 01:28:51,974
No good.

1379
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:54,435
No good.

1380
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:19,919
Mr. Speaker!

1381
01:29:20,211 --> 01:29:22,046
I offer a house resolution:

1382
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:25,174
Whereas Willie Stark...

1383
01:29:25,382 --> 01:29:27,176
...governor of the state...

1384
01:29:27,676 --> 01:29:30,805
...has been guilty of incompetence...

1385
01:29:31,013 --> 01:29:34,642
...corruption
and favoritism in office...

1386
01:29:35,309 --> 01:29:37,228
...and other high crimes.

1387
01:29:37,436 --> 01:29:40,481
And he is hereby impeached...

1388
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:42,525
...and ordered to be tried.

1389
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:50,199
-What's the score?
-They're lined up against you solid.

1390
01:29:50,407 --> 01:29:51,408
Were you there?

1391
01:29:51,617 --> 01:29:53,786
-What would I be doing there?
-Selling me out.

1392
01:29:54,662 --> 01:29:56,956
-How many votes have we got?
-Eleven.

1393
01:29:57,164 --> 01:30:00,292
-We need 20.
-We might dig up a few more.

1394
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:03,129
-Do you know how?
-No, do you?

1395
01:30:03,337 --> 01:30:04,797
Jack, come here.

1396
01:30:05,297 --> 01:30:06,757
What do you got on your friend?

1397
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:10,553
-Who do you mean?
-Your friend, the judge.

1398
01:30:10,761 --> 01:30:12,471
-If you need it--
-I need it.

1399
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,474
He's got four senators in his pocket.
What do you got?

1400
01:30:15,683 --> 01:30:19,478
If he can prove it isn't true,
I won't spill it.

1401
01:30:19,687 --> 01:30:21,480
I ought to bust you.

1402
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:24,733
-I promised two people l'd do this.
-Who are they?

1403
01:30:24,942 --> 01:30:28,696
Myself and someone else.
It doesn't matter who.

1404
01:30:28,904 --> 01:30:31,991
-I'll give him a break.
-But if you got facts, you got them.

1405
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:36,162
-The truth is sufficient.
-That's the way it's going to be.

1406
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:39,373
All right, boy.
I trust you.

1407
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,210
Where you going?

1408
01:30:43,544 --> 01:30:44,962
I'll be around.

1409
01:30:48,466 --> 01:30:51,051
Who else do you think he promised?

1410
01:30:52,052 --> 01:30:54,972
He's smart.
Play square with him.

1411
01:30:55,556 --> 01:30:58,350
You're going to need people
like us around.

1412
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:02,980
Are you sure?

1413
01:31:04,982 --> 01:31:07,485
The chips were down
and Willie knew it.

1414
01:31:07,693 --> 01:31:09,445
He was fighting for his life.

1415
01:31:09,653 --> 01:31:12,323
He roared across the state
making speeches.

1416
01:31:12,573 --> 01:31:15,075
All of them adding up
to the same thing:

1417
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:17,369
''It's not me they're after.
It's you!''

1418
01:31:17,578 --> 01:31:19,497
Willie hollered ''foul.''

1419
01:31:19,705 --> 01:31:22,625
He knew if you hollered
hard and loud enough...

1420
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:24,251
...people begin to believe.

1421
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:28,255
Just in case they didn't,
he organized demonstrations.

1422
01:31:28,464 --> 01:31:30,966
Tell the boys to get the hicks out.

1423
01:31:31,175 --> 01:31:32,718
Bring them in from the sticks.

1424
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:34,929
Turn the yokels out!

1425
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:40,142
In case anyone hollered back,
he organized spontaneous slugging.

1426
01:31:41,018 --> 01:31:45,022
Willie pulled every trick
he ever knew and added a few more.

1427
01:31:51,862 --> 01:31:53,572
You won't live to be impeached.

1428
01:31:53,781 --> 01:31:56,909
Boy, I'll live to be president.

1429
01:31:57,117 --> 01:31:58,410
Step on it.

1430
01:31:58,744 --> 01:32:01,914
l've got 1 4 senators to vote
against this impeachment.

1431
01:32:02,123 --> 01:32:05,084
If I win, you're out of politics.

1432
01:32:06,669 --> 01:32:08,504
I'll do whatever the judge says.

1433
01:32:09,964 --> 01:32:12,591
And always the trail led
to one place...

1434
01:32:12,967 --> 01:32:16,262
...to Burden's Landing
and the judge.

1435
01:32:28,858 --> 01:32:31,110
You sure you don't want me
to go in?

1436
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:33,487
I'm sure.

1437
01:32:33,988 --> 01:32:36,740
Hurry it up, boy.
We got places to go.

1438
01:32:42,872 --> 01:32:45,374
I beg you, as a favor
to yourself, to me.

1439
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:47,460
Call up, release your votes.

1440
01:32:47,668 --> 01:32:50,796
I made a mistake once.
When I resigned.

1441
01:32:51,005 --> 01:32:54,592
It was too easy then,
just resigning and pulling out.

1442
01:32:55,092 --> 01:32:58,804
l've made my choice.
I have nothing more to lose.

1443
01:32:59,096 --> 01:33:01,015
You know what Stark is capable of.

1444
01:33:01,348 --> 01:33:05,436
Think it over.
You can give me your answer tomorrow.

1445
01:33:05,895 --> 01:33:09,356
I can't wait until tomorrow.
I'm a very impatient man.

1446
01:33:10,524 --> 01:33:12,568
I told you not to come in here.

1447
01:33:12,776 --> 01:33:15,237
ls it true
you're behind the impeachment?

1448
01:33:15,446 --> 01:33:17,198
It's true.

1449
01:33:17,406 --> 01:33:20,993
-I wanted to hear you say it.
-You've heard it.

1450
01:33:21,202 --> 01:33:24,622
If that's all, you could have
saved yourself a trip.

1451
01:33:28,459 --> 01:33:30,878
Mind if I pour myself a drink?

1452
01:33:35,382 --> 01:33:37,551
How about you?
Will you have one?

1453
01:33:38,469 --> 01:33:40,554
You better.
You're going to need it.

1454
01:33:44,058 --> 01:33:45,643
What'd he say?

1455
01:33:47,353 --> 01:33:49,313
You'll get your answer tomorrow.

1456
01:33:49,563 --> 01:33:52,691
Are you kidding?
Did you show it to him or not?

1457
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,735
Show me what?

1458
01:33:56,445 --> 01:33:58,030
That's what I figured.

1459
01:33:59,615 --> 01:34:01,534
Get down to cases.

1460
01:34:04,495 --> 01:34:06,705
You remember a man named Littlepaugh?

1461
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:09,959
How did you find out?

1462
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:13,671
You remember Littlepaugh?

1463
01:34:17,007 --> 01:34:18,968
Remember the Fortune
Electric Company?

1464
01:34:19,176 --> 01:34:22,263
Of course. I was their counsel
for over ten years.

1465
01:34:22,471 --> 01:34:25,933
-Remember how you got the job?
-How did you find out?

1466
01:34:27,977 --> 01:34:30,604
Do you remember how you got the job?

1467
01:34:32,481 --> 01:34:35,818
You know, dirt's a funny thing.

1468
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:38,988
Some of it rubs off on everybody.

1469
01:34:39,613 --> 01:34:42,867
How did you get the job?
Blackmail?

1470
01:34:43,742 --> 01:34:47,288
I swear I never even
remembered his name.

1471
01:34:47,496 --> 01:34:49,540
lsn't that remarkable?

1472
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:52,585
I never even
remembered his name.

1473
01:34:52,793 --> 01:34:55,713
It's so long ago
it's hard for me to realize it ever happened.

1474
01:34:56,672 --> 01:34:58,340
But it did.

1475
01:35:01,135 --> 01:35:02,803
Yes, it did.

1476
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:05,723
Just difficult for me to realize it.

1477
01:35:05,973 --> 01:35:07,766
For me too.

1478
01:35:07,975 --> 01:35:09,852
Thanks for that much.

1479
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:12,730
You know what the next move is,
don't you?

1480
01:35:13,397 --> 01:35:15,107
Yes, I do.

1481
01:35:15,357 --> 01:35:16,692
Jack Burden.

1482
01:35:16,901 --> 01:35:19,695
Willie Stark's hatchet man.

1483
01:35:19,904 --> 01:35:21,530
How did you find out?

1484
01:35:21,739 --> 01:35:24,074
This would never stand at law.

1485
01:35:24,283 --> 01:35:26,702
It happened over 25 years ago.

1486
01:35:26,911 --> 01:35:29,205
You could never get any testimony.

1487
01:35:29,413 --> 01:35:30,915
Everybody is dead.

1488
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:35,586
Everybody except you.
You're alive.

1489
01:35:35,795 --> 01:35:37,755
People think
you're a certain kind of man.

1490
01:35:38,005 --> 01:35:40,508
You couldn't bear
for them to think otherwise.

1491
01:35:40,716 --> 01:35:44,970
But ever since then,
l've done my duty.

1492
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:48,182
I'm responsible for many good things.

1493
01:35:48,682 --> 01:35:50,017
But I also did this.

1494
01:35:50,226 --> 01:35:53,646
-Yes, you did.
-Judge, I beg of you.

1495
01:35:53,854 --> 01:35:56,232
Call and release your votes...

1496
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,192
...for your sake.

1497
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,530
You have tender sensibilities
for a hatchet man.

1498
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:04,990
Good night, gentlemen.

1499
01:36:05,533 --> 01:36:07,326
How about my answer?

1500
01:36:07,535 --> 01:36:10,162
-You'll have it in the morning.
-I want it tonight.

1501
01:36:10,371 --> 01:36:12,123
ln the morning.

1502
01:36:18,003 --> 01:36:19,797
Good night, gentlemen.

1503
01:36:41,026 --> 01:36:42,278
How did you find out?

1504
01:36:42,486 --> 01:36:44,655
We got a lot to do.
Let's get back.

1505
01:36:44,864 --> 01:36:48,450
-You know we're through, don't you?
-You don't mean that.

1506
01:36:57,918 --> 01:36:59,628
-Why are you here?
-It's all right.

1507
01:36:59,837 --> 01:37:01,714
Just here to discuss politics.

1508
01:37:03,424 --> 01:37:04,884
I see.

1509
01:37:06,385 --> 01:37:07,887
Well, good night.

1510
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,811
-Did you give him--?
-Wait a minute.

1511
01:38:04,944 --> 01:38:06,779
Aren't you going back with him?

1512
01:38:07,655 --> 01:38:09,448
Why not?
You belong with him.

1513
01:38:10,032 --> 01:38:11,826
How could you have done it?

1514
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:15,037
Anne said you promised not
to tell Stark--

1515
01:38:15,246 --> 01:38:16,705
Yeah, I know.

1516
01:38:18,332 --> 01:38:20,501
And I kept my promise.

1517
01:38:36,225 --> 01:38:40,354
From all over, they're streaming in.
From the hills, farms, lumber camps...

1518
01:38:40,563 --> 01:38:44,608
...by boat or train, by horse
and on foot. Willie Stark's army.

1519
01:39:04,378 --> 01:39:08,924
There are rumors that Stark
is planning to seize power by force.

1520
01:39:09,133 --> 01:39:12,011
As commander of
the state militia, he has--

1521
01:39:22,688 --> 01:39:24,648
Come in.
The door's open.

1522
01:39:31,572 --> 01:39:33,032
What do you want?

1523
01:39:38,746 --> 01:39:40,873
I want to see you cry.

1524
01:39:47,963 --> 01:39:49,215
Stop it!

1525
01:39:50,591 --> 01:39:53,052
-I called you all day.
-I know, I was here.

1526
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:55,554
-You've got to tell Adam.
-Tell him what?

1527
01:39:55,763 --> 01:39:57,973
-He knows about--
-About you and Willie?

1528
01:39:58,182 --> 01:40:02,812
I tried to explain to him that
it wasn't the way he thought it was.

1529
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,606
How was it? You tell me.

1530
01:40:09,235 --> 01:40:11,070
He hit me.

1531
01:40:12,029 --> 01:40:13,447
My own brother hit me.

1532
01:40:14,073 --> 01:40:17,910
Your brother's old-fashioned.
He believes in a sister's honor.

1533
01:40:18,536 --> 01:40:21,622
I'm modern man,
the 20th century type. I run.

1534
01:40:21,831 --> 01:40:23,457
I'm frightened!

1535
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:25,084
For your brother or Willie?

1536
01:40:26,293 --> 01:40:27,545
We're through.

1537
01:40:27,753 --> 01:40:29,004
Who's through with who?

1538
01:40:29,797 --> 01:40:31,632
He called me this afternoon.

1539
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,718
He's going back to Lucy.

1540
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:37,513
He said it was better this way.

1541
01:40:37,721 --> 01:40:39,348
Better for who? Him?

1542
01:40:41,142 --> 01:40:42,101
Both of us.

1543
01:40:42,351 --> 01:40:45,479
Did he say that, too,
when he asked you to betray the judge?

1544
01:40:46,438 --> 01:40:48,149
At least I walked out on him.

1545
01:40:49,483 --> 01:40:53,445
Help me, please.
Adam's all l've got left now.

1546
01:40:57,950 --> 01:41:00,327
If you ever loved me....

1547
01:41:02,037 --> 01:41:04,081
If I ever loved you?

1548
01:41:07,418 --> 01:41:09,253
I'll go find Adam.

1549
01:42:24,829 --> 01:42:27,623
Where are you going?
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

1550
01:42:27,832 --> 01:42:30,000
Do you know who Dr. Stanton is?

1551
01:42:30,209 --> 01:42:32,253
-Did he come here today?
-Haven't seen him.

1552
01:42:32,461 --> 01:42:33,587
Check the other entrances.

1553
01:42:33,796 --> 01:42:38,050
They're blocked off.
Orders are to take no chances.

1554
01:42:38,259 --> 01:42:40,469
Come in and wait.
We can find you a seat.

1555
01:42:40,678 --> 01:42:43,430
I'll wait here.
If he shows up, let me know.

1556
01:42:43,639 --> 01:42:46,183
Pass the word to the boys, will you?

1557
01:42:47,935 --> 01:42:50,062
All right, now.
Everybody!

1558
01:42:50,271 --> 01:42:52,148
That means everybody.

1559
01:42:53,482 --> 01:42:56,694
Let's let Willie know we're here.
All together!

1560
01:42:57,153 --> 01:43:00,781
Willie! Willie!
We want Willie!

1561
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:04,368
Willie! Willie!
We want Willie!

1562
01:43:13,085 --> 01:43:15,629
We'll first take
the judgment of the Senate...

1563
01:43:15,838 --> 01:43:17,798
...on the question of impeachment.

1564
01:43:18,007 --> 01:43:19,967
Mr. Speaker.

1565
01:43:20,301 --> 01:43:22,428
This is a farce...

1566
01:43:22,761 --> 01:43:24,263
...to ask us to vote...

1567
01:43:24,472 --> 01:43:27,933
...in the face of the kind
of intimidation and pressure...

1568
01:43:28,142 --> 01:43:31,061
...that has been exerted
in the past few weeks.

1569
01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:33,939
Even that crowd outside...

1570
01:43:34,482 --> 01:43:36,484
...yelling on cue...

1571
01:43:37,693 --> 01:43:39,737
...is part of that pressure.

1572
01:44:09,642 --> 01:44:11,560
Attention, please.

1573
01:44:12,019 --> 01:44:13,646
Attention, please.

1574
01:44:14,021 --> 01:44:18,150
This is an announcement from
Willie Stark to you people out there.

1575
01:44:18,901 --> 01:44:21,570
He doesn't want any one
of you to leave.

1576
01:44:21,904 --> 01:44:26,158
He wants you to stay in front of
this capitol until the fight is over.

1577
01:44:27,159 --> 01:44:29,328
If you want Willie Stark to win...

1578
01:44:30,037 --> 01:44:32,540
...stay where you are.
Do you hear me?

1579
01:44:32,748 --> 01:44:36,168
Stay where you are.
Don't go away.

1580
01:44:56,188 --> 01:44:57,648
Attention, please.

1581
01:45:01,068 --> 01:45:04,697
The balloting on
the impeachment proceedings...

1582
01:45:04,905 --> 01:45:07,324
...against Governor Stark...

1583
01:45:07,533 --> 01:45:09,493
...has just ended.

1584
01:45:10,578 --> 01:45:13,497
This is the result:

1585
01:45:14,665 --> 01:45:16,876
Willie Stark...

1586
01:45:17,293 --> 01:45:19,044
...has won!

1587
01:46:00,836 --> 01:46:02,755
They tried to ruin me.

1588
01:46:03,088 --> 01:46:04,757
But they are ruined.

1589
01:46:05,299 --> 01:46:08,719
They tried to ruin me because
they didn't like what l've done.

1590
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:11,388
Do you like what I have done?

1591
01:46:26,946 --> 01:46:28,405
Remember.

1592
01:46:28,614 --> 01:46:30,574
It's not I who have won...

1593
01:46:30,783 --> 01:46:31,659
...but you.

1594
01:46:33,369 --> 01:46:35,704
Your will is my strength.

1595
01:46:35,955 --> 01:46:38,249
And your need is my justice.

1596
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:41,836
I shall live
in your right and your will.

1597
01:46:42,336 --> 01:46:45,840
And if any man tries to stop me
from fulfilling that...

1598
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:47,258
...I'll break him.

1599
01:46:47,466 --> 01:46:51,846
I'll break him with my bare hands.
For I have the strength of many.

1600
01:47:04,859 --> 01:47:06,777
I'm glad you're here.

1601
01:47:10,364 --> 01:47:11,490
Doctor, I'm glad--

1602
01:47:45,941 --> 01:47:48,152
Does it hurt much, boss?

1603
01:47:48,861 --> 01:47:51,155
Does it hurt much?

1604
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:04,835
-Where are you going?
-Leave me alone.

1605
01:48:05,044 --> 01:48:06,462
-To do what?
-I don't care.

1606
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:07,505
That's too easy.

1607
01:48:07,713 --> 01:48:09,423
-I don't know.
-I do!

1608
01:48:09,632 --> 01:48:11,967
-Leave me alone, please.
-No more.

1609
01:48:12,176 --> 01:48:14,386
-My brother's dead!
-We're alive.

1610
01:48:14,595 --> 01:48:17,139
We've got to go on living...

1611
01:48:17,348 --> 01:48:20,518
...so Adam's death has meaning.
So it wasn't wasted.

1612
01:48:20,726 --> 01:48:24,480
Our life has to give his death meaning.
Don't you see that?

1613
01:48:25,314 --> 01:48:27,149
Look at those people.

1614
01:48:27,358 --> 01:48:28,317
Look at them!

1615
01:48:28,526 --> 01:48:30,194
They still believe in him.

1616
01:48:30,402 --> 01:48:32,822
We must make them see
Willie as Adam did...

1617
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:35,449
...or there's no meaning in anything.

1618
01:48:37,117 --> 01:48:39,203
The governor's asking for you.

1619
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:42,414
You'd better hurry.
He's going fast.

1620
01:48:44,041 --> 01:48:45,668
Will you wait here?

1621
01:48:47,253 --> 01:48:49,088
Will you wait here?

1622
01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:11,986
It could have been whole world,
Willie Stark.

1623
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,490
The whole world, Willie Stark.

1624
01:49:18,284 --> 01:49:21,954
Why does he do it to me,
Willie Stark?

1625
01:49:23,581 --> 01:49:25,166
Why?
