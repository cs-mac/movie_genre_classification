1
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,780
Dear Attilio,
we are all gathered here together...

2
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,980
Who's the half-wit who left his car outside?

3
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,180
- That's mine.
- Well you can't leave it there

4
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,300
- Ten Minutes!
- Too long.

5
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,900
- Five!
- No more than five.

6
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,220
In five minutes I'm going to clamp you!

7
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,140
Gang of loonies, here every bloody night...

8
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,260
This woman has something to say to you.

9
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,700
Attilio De Giovanni,

10
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,340
I sing your name,
it opens the gates of Paradise.

11
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,580
You will be mine forever,
so grant me gods.

12
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,980
When you kiss me, the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse gallop forth

13
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,540
and when I think of your body,
so troubled and vague,

14
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,620
the ground opens beneath my feet.

15
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Your divine manhood ascends to heaven,

16
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,020
you're beautiful!

17
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,900
You sunflower crazed by light,

18
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,460
when you raise your eyes you
set the sky ablaze.

19
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,780
Friends, see how the Earth,

20
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,500
like a mother,
gives suck to her most precious child.

21
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,180
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passion,

22
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,340
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth burst forth this cry.

23
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,740
I love you.

24
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,940
I want to make love to you now.

25
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,860
That's the best line
I ever heard in my life.

26
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,940
Still not here?

27
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,460
No.

28
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,540
Here he is!

29
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,660
- On the dot!
- You're 20 minutes late, Daddy!

30
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,900
- Yes, 20 minutes on the dot.
- You couldn't find the car?

31
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,060
- Hi Carla, everything okay?
- Fine, thanks.

32
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,140
I have a programme and tomorrow
I'll have them at school at 9:00 sharp.

33
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,700
- At 8:30!
- I know.

34
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,700
- I'll remind him.
- I'll remember all right!

35
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,220
Mamma doesn't trust you.

36
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,260
She doesn't trust me?

37
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,660
She doesn't trust you.

38
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,460
- Where are we going?
- A surprise!

39
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,260
- Sure I'm not hurting him?
- Course you are not.

40
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,220
Shall I wash his feet too?

41
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,220
I honestly couldn't care less.

42
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,900
Still the same guy, what's-his-name?

43
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,820
Yes, Francesco Verri,
he's not even in my class.

44
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,620
- The less I see him the better.
- Is he really that bad?

45
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,140
Very bad, hateful

46
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,340
- Hateful?
- Hateful.

47
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,300
- In other words, you love him.
- Yes.

48
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,980
- A lot?
- Lots and lots.

49
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,620
- Emilia, Daddy!
- Rosa!

50
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,740
Hang on!

51
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,780
- The best camel driver ever.
- What a fantastic present!

52
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,540
Thank the director here, thanks Camillo.

53
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,980
Now we're in Rome I hope
we'll see you more often.

54
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,860
- Want to have a go?
- Me?

55
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,100
- You're scared.
- Daddy's not scared of anything.

56
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,900
He's all right?

57
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,740
- Does he spit?
- No.

58
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,060
This is great,
how do you get him to stand up?

59
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,060
It's twice as high as a horse!

60
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,500
No seat belt!

61
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,060
How about that then, eh?

62
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,700
Just when I'm on a camel!

63
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,180
Attorney!

64
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,100
You've got the hearing this morning.

65
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,860
For the furniture you shouldn't have sold,

66
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,940
ignoring a summons back in '98...

67
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,980
I can't right now, can we do it tomorrow?

68
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,420
You've got to be here within three minutes
or they'll sentence you!

69
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,220
Three minutes, make that two!

70
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,340
Down, boy.

71
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,100
Slowly.

72
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,620
Ubruk!

73
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,100
How about that?

74
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,460
Camels may be smelly, but they're smart.

75
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,980
- What's that?
- A bat!

76
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,860
Get down, keep down!

77
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,420
It's casing the joint,
let's see what it's up to!

78
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,540
Let's get under the bed.

79
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,780
Go away, beastly bat!

80
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,140
Don't say that.

81
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,380
You'll offend it if you call it a beastly bar,
you've got to be nice.

82
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,740
Oh bat, sweet creature of the night,

83
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,660
you'll find the window on your right!

84
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,380
"What luck!"

85
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,500
That's what poetry's all about,
you called it a beastly bat...

86
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,980
It always works.

87
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,660
I was shaving in the bathroom yesterday.

88
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,140
A spider climbed in

89
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,860
and I said to it,
"Spider dear, get out of here".

90
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,380
- It went!
- And if you find a mouse?

91
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,660
"Mr. Mouse, leave this house"
then run for it.

92
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,420
Will you teach me to write nice poems?

93
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,100
How did you become a poet?

94
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,380
How do you start?

95
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,340
I was small, younger than you are now,
eight or nine.

96
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,580
I was with my mother,
I loved her so much...

97
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,860
We were at Uncle Giustino's
and there was a wood.

98
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,180
- Do you know what happened?
- What?

99
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,900
A little bird flew by,
singing, flying lower...

100
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,540
and lower.

101
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,340
He landed right here on my shoulder.

102
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,100
I swear!

103
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,540
He'd chosen me, of all people.

104
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,980
I was afraid he'd fly away,
so I pretended to be a tree,

105
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,820
I didn't move a muscle.

106
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,420
I started to feel my heart beating,
thumping actually.

107
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,740
- And then?
- It flew away.

108
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,300
I wanted to tell my mother.

109
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,460
"Mamma, a little bird, flying and singing...

110
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,106
landed on my shoulder
and sat there for an hour."

111
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:34,341
She said, "I thought something awful happened"
and carried on chatting.

112
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,218
That was mean of Granny,
didn't she like birds?

113
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,773
No, Granny wasn't mean,
and she did like little birds.

114
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,690
It wasn't her, it was me.

115
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,046
It was my fault for not telling
the story properly,

116
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:50,322
for not making her feel what I'd felt.

117
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,879
I was so upset I told myself,

118
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,035
"There must be people whose job
it is to use the right words,

119
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:59,352
put things in a way...

120
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:02,948
who when their hearts beats,
can get other people's hearts to beat."

121
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:05,585
That day I decided to become a poet.

122
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:10,779
- My heart beat.
- Mine too, but Granny's didn't.

123
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:14,135
If the words aren't right, nothing's right.

124
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,450
If I say now, "go to sleep",
those are the right words.

125
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,046
- And if another bat comes in?
- Off to bed with you.

126
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:24,563
I've got to get you to school
at 9:00 tomorrow.

127
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:26,121
At 8:30!

128
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:29,956
I know.

129
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,827
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passions,

130
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:41,623
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth bursts forth this cry,

131
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,061
I love you!

132
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:48,814
My love, I want to stay
with you here forever,

133
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,652
for all eternity.

134
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,489
Don't you have to take
the girls to school at 8:30?

135
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,444
Give me five minutes, be right back.

136
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:07,952
You don't remember
where I left the car, do you?

137
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,948
- Same bloody car parked outside...
- It's mine, I'll move it.

138
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:14,065
Five minutes.

139
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:17,861
Come along, don't hang around,

140
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,539
take your time.

141
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:22,895
Don't start writing love poems,

142
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:26,131
they're the hardest,
wait till you're at least 80.

143
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:32,044
Write about something else, the sea,
the wind, a radiator,

144
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:36,120
a tram running late,
no one thing's more poetic than another.

145
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,076
Poetry isn't without, it's within.

146
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,512
Don't ask what's poetic or true,
look in the mirror, poetry's you.

147
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,827
Dress your poems up,
choose your words carefully,

148
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:51,142
be selective, some things you need
eight months to find one word.

149
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,338
Beauty started when people began to choose,

150
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:55,577
since Adam and Eve.

151
00:11:55,777 --> 00:12:00,252
You know how long Eve took
to pick the right fig leaf?

152
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:05,885
How about this one? She stripped bare
all the fig trees in Paradise.

153
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:10,680
Fall in love,
if you don't love it's all dead!

154
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,757
Fall in love and
everything will come to life.

155
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:17,032
Squander yourjoy,
dissipate your cheerfulness.

156
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:20,109
Be sad and silent with enthusiasm,

157
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:23,425
hurl your happiness into people's faces.

158
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,460
And how? Let me look at my notes,
I've forgotten.

159
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,538
That's what you should do.

160
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,575
I can't read 'em.

161
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:37,289
To convey happiness you must be happy,

162
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:40,525
to convey pain you must to happy.

163
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:45,080
Be happy, you must suffer!
Don't be scared of suffering,

164
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,757
the whole world suffers!

165
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:52,791
If you don't have the means, don't worry,

166
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,108
only one thing is necessary
to write poetry, everything.

167
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:59,303
Don't try to be modern,
it's the most old-fashioned thing there is.

168
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:03,019
If a line doesn't come to
you in this position,

169
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,495
chuck yourself on the ground like this!

170
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:10,970
It's lying down that you see the sky.

171
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,767
Why didn't I do that before?

172
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,963
What are you looking at?
Poets don't look, they see.

173
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,000
Make words obey you.

174
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,475
If the world "wall"
doesn't take any notice,

175
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,272
don't use it again for eight years,
that'll teach it.

176
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,230
What's that? No idea!

177
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,827
That's true beauty, like those lines there,

178
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:33,304
that I want left there forever.

179
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:36,300
Erase it all, we've got to start,
the lesson's over.

180
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,657
See you Wednesday... Thursday.

181
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:41,334
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

182
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,566
The room's all yours, Professor Browning.

183
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:51,163
Thank you Signor De Giovanni.

184
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:58,834
Please don't, I'll do it.

185
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:02,829
Still having problems with the principal?

186
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:07,983
Lots, about the course,
I'd like to discuss it with you.

187
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,098
Can we sleep together tonight?

188
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,173
Nancy!

189
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:20,049
Last time we slept together it snowed,

190
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:23,286
it was the coldest
most beautiful day in January.

191
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:32,475
- Lets sleep together.
- The kids'll be back.

192
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,712
It's laying down that you see the sky.

193
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,790
Don't you like me anymore?

194
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:47,578
I had such a wonderful time with you,

195
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,454
why did you want to cut it so short?

196
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:53,611
When I fell in love with you...

197
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,406
I fell in love with you
because you fell in love with me.

198
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,243
And a wonderful fall it was.

199
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:02,121
What are you doing this evening?

200
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,595
- Nothing.
- Let's sleep together tonight.

201
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,111
Attilio, we've gotta go.

202
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:12,229
Hi Ermanno.

203
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,666
Do you remember where I left the car?

204
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:18,861
- Near the entrance.
- Thank you, Nancy.

205
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,295
Knock-knock, I look through the peep-hole,
all I see is hair.

206
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:29,848
I open the door and a bear says,
"Hello Ermanno, give me a Kiss."

207
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:32,006
I ask, "Who are you?"

208
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:35,202
And she, "Don't you recognize me, my son?"

209
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,120
No!

210
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,357
And she starts crying.

211
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:43,712
I say, "I'm sorry, Mamma",
and put my arms around her,

212
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:46,709
then this morning
when I woke up I felt so happy.

213
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:50,704
- Your mother was a bear?
- I'd just never realized it before.

214
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:54,300
I kept dreaming about vultures,
hyenas, crocodiles...

215
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,498
Good for you.

216
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,855
I always have the same dream.

217
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:00,613
The same animal?

218
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,331
No, no animal at all.

219
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:04,728
I'm at a kind of wedding
with lots of people,

220
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:09,043
and then in she walks,
the woman I'm crazy about.

221
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:12,239
She ends up telling me,
"I want to make love with you, kiss me."

222
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,157
So what do you do?

223
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,594
I pass out.

224
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:19,591
- It's wonderful.
- What kind of animal is she?

225
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,947
It's her, the love of my life.

226
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,064
What kind of a dream is that?

227
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:30,578
It's like saying I like cherries
and in my dream I eat cherries.

228
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:33,615
It denotes a primitive subconscious.

229
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:37,051
- A Dream that won't come true?
- Come true!

230
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,926
If I like a woman,
I dream about her in a symbolic fashion,

231
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,642
she's a penguin bearing
the mythological baggage of penguins,

232
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:48,517
or she's a iguana, that's a mature dream.

233
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,314
- You think?
- What, me? Sigmund Freud thinks so.

234
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:54,271
Freud.

235
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,428
Dream about an animal?

236
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:03,819
Right on time, just starting.

237
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:13,648
Love thou thy dream,
all base love scorning.

238
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,524
Love thou the wind, and here take warning.

239
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:22,558
That dreams alone can truly be.
For this dream I come to thee.

240
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:28,551
He's the greatest living Arab poet.
Beautiful that poem, eh?

241
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:30,748
- Rips you apart.
- Sure does.

242
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,024
You'll hear the rest.

243
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:38,100
Fuad concluded with a homage to one
of his inspirational mentors.

244
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,976
Fuad, in these difficult days
for his home country,

245
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:44,332
decided to leave France
and go back to Baghdad.

246
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:49,526
Let's hope this senseless war
never breaks out.

247
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:52,363
Let's thank Fuad, goodbye to all.

248
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,118
Damn, I think it's over!

249
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:00,634
- Shall we go eat?
- I want to go and say hello to him.

250
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,272
Fuad, remember that name.

251
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:06,427
In four, five years' time,
he'll get the Nobel Prize.

252
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,023
It'll be a wrench to leave
Paris after 18 years...

253
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,778
- When will you go back to Baghdad?
- As soon as possible.

254
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:16,695
How much time do you need
to finish the book?

255
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,690
The publishers want it in September,
but I refuse to rush.

256
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,008
I'd like to spend at least
a week with you.

257
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:24,286
We'll find the time.

258
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:27,522
Goodbye, see you soon.

259
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,958
Attilio!

260
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:32,916
- Fuad!
- Where were you?

261
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:37,830
Back there, I got here a bit late
but I enjoyed the whole thing.

262
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,665
You've got fans here,
when I quoted you at the start

263
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:45,382
they all cheered, did you hear it?

264
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,859
Vittoria!

265
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,297
Your book.

266
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,975
Oh, thank you.

267
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,845
I'm losing my mind.

268
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,515
- Do you have time for dinner?
- Let's have dinner together.

269
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,592
Then I'll leave you to it.

270
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,068
Goodbye.

271
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,944
Dear Attilio, it's as
if no time has passed at all.

272
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,220
Attilio?

273
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,017
Fuad, thanks, I'll say goodbye then.

274
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:49,575
Goodbye, Fuad, goodbye.

275
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,931
- When are you leaving?
- Right after dinner.

276
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,049
Plenty of time!

277
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:58,085
Love you.

278
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:02,560
- What about dinner?
- Sure, any time.

279
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,475
- You coming to eat then?
- Sure, any time.

280
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:44,711
- I came here to have tea by myself.
- So did I.

281
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:49,665
We can have it together! Two teas.

282
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:55,099
Mr. Poet Attilio De Giovanni,
there's absolutely no question.

283
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,535
I don't want to disturb you, heaven forbid.

284
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:02,890
Since we don't see each other often...

285
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,138
You see,

286
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,214
the two of us, not immediately...

287
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,700
Why do you keep pestering me?

288
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,601
Haven't you got anything else to think about?

289
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:27,539
Me think about you?
Whoever thinks about you?

290
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:30,875
Someone said they even saw you in Verona!

291
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:33,152
No, wait!

292
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:36,828
What's that? Me, in Verona?

293
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,025
- Who told you that?
- Settembrini.

294
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,343
He saw you outside my hotel for hours.

295
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:44,499
Listen, I was not in Verona.

296
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:47,815
Why on Earth should
I care if you're in Verona

297
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,172
or Piazza dell'Esquilino?

298
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,009
I don't believe it, you were there too?

299
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:57,644
I never know where you are
and I don't care.

300
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:05,874
Why don't you come to my place?

301
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:09,231
To see where I live,

302
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,786
sleep, read, write, wash the dishes.

303
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:17,861
Come on, let's walk round Rome,
you can come over and...

304
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,938
We can be together.

305
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:23,714
Yes? Huh?

306
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:27,590
You tell me who's speaking, you called me.

307
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:29,947
Valeri who?

308
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,464
Yes, I was at Fuad's, why?

309
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:36,619
In fact, this jacket isn't mine.

310
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:38,817
This phone isn't either!

311
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:44,011
This jacket is five times too big,
yours must be too small.

312
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:45,689
Pay more attention!

313
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:49,125
He took my jacket instead of his.

314
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:54,079
I can't, I'm in a meeting.

315
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:56,716
Yes, okay.

316
00:22:56,996 --> 00:23:02,909
I'm in the bar round the corner,
but right away, I'm busy.

317
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:30,616
Signor Valeri, over here,

318
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:33,293
how did you mistake my jacket for yours?

319
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:36,968
- It's three sizes larger!
- Yes in fact, I didn't...

320
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:41,523
Signor Valeri mistook my jacket for his.

321
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:45,439
- Didn't you realize it was tight?
- I didn't put it on.

322
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:49,114
Now I know why you didn't realize it.

323
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:52,231
All's well that ends well, goodbye.

324
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,306
Some people are so scatter-brained.

325
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,623
He hardly knew what to say,

326
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:01,939
at one point he said, I love you,

327
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:05,216
I dream of you every night,
let's get married.

328
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:07,853
What would you have said?

329
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,569
- The check, please.
- No, let me.

330
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,527
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

331
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:14,884
Vittoria!

332
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:18,920
How much is it?

333
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,317
Keep the change.

334
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:23,914
The tea had absolutely no taste.

335
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:40,814
I want to see where you wash your dishes,

336
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:43,331
take me home.

337
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:35,431
"SURPRISE!"

338
00:26:32,964 --> 00:26:36,320
- Let's walk up, I prefer it.
- Me too.

339
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,996
"I've walked down millions of
stairs holding your arm,

340
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:43,312
now you're no longer here,
there's a void beneath every step."

341
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:48,147
- Dammit, I tripped...
- Serves you right.

342
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:51,103
We're here, this is me.

343
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:56,097
I trip on that wretched step every day.

344
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,935
Go ahead.

345
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:09,202
Please do come in, Vittoria.

346
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:13,797
Here we are,
Vittoria and I together at home...

347
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:17,632
I always leave the candles on.

348
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:21,947
And the television.

349
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:29,139
I always like to have things ready
in case Vittoria comes...

350
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,294
I'll go make some coffee,

351
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:37,410
I'll make you some too,
it won't take a sec...

352
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:42,004
What's the matter?

353
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:45,240
Nothing, I just burnt myself slightly.

354
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,835
- The coffee is ready?
- I make it in case Vittoria comes.

355
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,273
Have a seat.

356
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:53,391
It was coming to the boil as we came in.

357
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,389
Here.

358
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:57,906
I always like to tell the truth.

359
00:27:58,265 --> 00:28:00,942
Seeing you sitting here
at night alone with me,

360
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:04,778
drinking coffee, it makes my heart race.

361
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:08,414
You're so beautiful!

362
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:12,649
Women are so beautiful
when they're about to make love.

363
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:17,843
Why not live together
for the rest of our lives? It's easy.

364
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:20,719
As easy as seeing a tiger in the snow.

365
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,236
When I do, we will be together forever.

366
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:26,872
Off to Tibet with us then,
it always snows on tigers there.

367
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,510
But we live in Rome.

368
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,507
Snow falling on a tiger in Rome!

369
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:33,544
I get it.

370
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:37,939
Please stay and sleep with me.

371
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:41,295
You've got a man here who loves you.

372
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:46,130
A man who loves you is
a sight worth seeing, isn't it?

373
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,365
It's a cold, grey world outside, stay here.

374
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:54,001
We can have a nice hot bath together.

375
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,996
I'll dry you,
I'll wrap you in a blue bathrobe.

376
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:03,190
You know what you are, Blondie!
You're on big son of a bitch!

377
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:11,301
All this, every evening for me,

378
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,656
you've forgotten one thing though,
the champagne.

379
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,887
Explain the rest later,
but I want to know how you did that.

380
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:26,203
You know, tricks of the trade.

381
00:29:26,403 --> 00:29:28,241
But just as I said "champagne".

382
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,799
A bit of luck.

383
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:31,877
Here, Vittoria.

384
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:39,068
I want to do with you
what the spring does with cherries.

385
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:41,226
Now, now, now.

386
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,583
You haven't said anything about the house.

387
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,778
I'd move this table,
I'll finish my champagne then go...

388
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:52,093
and your books, don't try and stop me,
shouldn't be on the floor,

389
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,691
it's a bit too bohemian.

390
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:57,727
There's a time for everything,
peach trees don't bloom in December.

391
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,924
This green wall's hideous.

392
00:30:00,204 --> 00:30:02,561
I long to feel your arms around me.

393
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,158
This floor... but I can't...

394
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:06,876
is office-like.

395
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:10,112
I'm not sure if I should stay or go.

396
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:13,349
What'll I do? You decide.

397
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,504
My compliments on your apartment.

398
00:30:18,822 --> 00:30:23,737
I think I know what you're getting
at about the apartment,

399
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:26,254
I think this is the best solution.

400
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:31,208
As far as the floor's concerned,
let's leave it as it is.

401
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:34,484
About the table,
I agree with you, I'd move it,

402
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:38,280
and make more space,
I'd put two armchairs there.

403
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:43,394
For the fittings, I know
a carpenter downstairs, so that's sorted.

404
00:30:43,713 --> 00:30:48,468
The floor we said leave as it,
the ceiling isn't great...

405
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:51,424
I wasn't really planning
on staying here long,

406
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:58,177
I'm only renting and
I can't remember when my lease ends.

407
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:03,051
All I know is
that tonight'll never come back.

408
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,686
There's just one word
on the great clock of time, now.

409
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:11,002
But you're right about one thing, my love.

410
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:13,399
That green wall has got to go.

411
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:25,984
Where are you going?

412
00:31:28,501 --> 00:31:30,539
I'm going to put on the blue bathrobe.

413
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:33,895
If only you knew what I have inside of me,

414
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:40,128
fleets of minesweepers dropping
death-charges into my chest,

415
00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:42,246
torpedoing my thorax,

416
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:44,922
circumnavigating my heart.

417
00:31:45,442 --> 00:31:48,438
Now I can tell you, I was Verona,

418
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:51,315
and in Piazza dell'Esquilino.

419
00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:53,193
Two and a quarter hours!

420
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:55,550
I'm ashamed to say,

421
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:59,625
I was in Catania too, I never told you.

422
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:04,580
I dream of you every night,
always the same dream, always you.

423
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:08,735
I see you everywhere,
my whole life hears you.

424
00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:12,970
In all creation
I feel the beating of your heart.

425
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,845
You these books,
the bubbles in my champagne,

426
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:20,961
you're the flame of these candles,
these trees,

427
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,358
you're down the street...

428
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,593
Vittoria?

429
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:29,671
Vittoria!

430
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:35,144
I'll fix her, when I catch her!

431
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,062
Vittoria, I'll sue you!

432
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:40,178
I'll take you to court!

433
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:46,012
Vittoria! Vittoria!

434
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,250
Wait!

435
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,848
Vittoria!

436
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:56,999
Stop!

437
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,557
Vittoria!

438
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:00,355
Stop this tram!

439
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:05,149
Driver, stop!

440
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:08,665
Vittoria!

441
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,222
You know what you are?

442
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:16,177
You're one big daughter of a bitch!

443
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:23,688
It's raining!

444
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:27,683
It rains on the city,

445
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:31,239
like tears in my heart.

446
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:39,392
Oh my beloved,
all creation overflows with passion,

447
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:43,228
and like a golden comet in the sky,
from my mouth bursts forth this cry.

448
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:44,586
"Kiss me!"

449
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:47,023
Please my love.

450
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:50,260
I said kiss me.

451
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,657
Attilio. Attilio!

452
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:56,772
It's her, the symbolism is so obvious!

453
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:59,049
I know, I guessed it right away

454
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:01,566
but I'm not kissing a kangaroo,
it's revolting.

455
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:05,002
Revolting? Goodbye then,
you'll never see me again.

456
00:34:05,202 --> 00:34:06,760
Oh!

457
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,918
Vittoria!

458
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:11,475
I wasn't talking to you.

459
00:34:11,835 --> 00:34:12,394
Vittoria!

460
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,152
Stop!

461
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:18,786
What a coincidence!

462
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:20,225
Vittoria!

463
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:24,340
I was walking along thinking of
everything except you...

464
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,818
Vittoria!

465
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,496
What are you doing, leaving?

466
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:29,614
Okay, I get the message.

467
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:32,531
Since I know you're leaving,
I just came to tell you this.

468
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,884
It's all over between us,
you'll never see me again.

469
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:40,641
Goodbye forever!

470
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:49,791
Sorry, I forgot to tell you something.

471
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:55,704
Oh Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!

472
00:34:56,443 --> 00:35:00,199
Peace! Peace!

473
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:04,035
You tell him,
I can't in half an hour, Attorney.

474
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,870
Go to prison? But I'm in the right!

475
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,546
- This is an act of violence.
- War's an act of violence.

476
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:15,062
Hanging out the peace
banner never hurt anyone.

477
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,157
I can't in half an hour.

478
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:18,956
Professor!

479
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:20,274
Yes?

480
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:31,802
Mamma Mia, what a bang!
Almost killed me!

481
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:33,281
What the...

482
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:39,112
Stop hopping about like that.

483
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:42,428
Will you please stop hopping?

484
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:45,824
Vittoria, I will not get into your pouch,

485
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:49,340
I won't fit, be a good girl.

486
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,496
Don't kiss me,
I know it's you but stop it.

487
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:56,211
Behave, Vittoria.

488
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,686
Vittoria...

489
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:27,456
Yes, speaking.

490
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,254
Who is it?

491
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:30,972
Who?

492
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:36,286
Fuad, what a nice surprise!

493
00:36:36,725 --> 00:36:38,923
I'm glad, how are you?

494
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,599
What's wrong?

495
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:47,473
Vittoria? Of course.

496
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,388
She's there with you, right?
She talked about me, eh?

497
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,944
What happened?

498
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,489
Is she dead?

499
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:12,164
I don't know,
I just came back from the hospital.

500
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:15,600
The doctor is afraid she won't make it
through the night.

501
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,476
She's alive but there's nothing to be done,

502
00:37:19,676 --> 00:37:22,073
We've got no medicine or supplies here.

503
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,789
We'd nearly finished out work,

504
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:30,383
we were walking in Baghdad,
there was an explosion, a building fell.

505
00:37:31,222 --> 00:37:32,381
What?

506
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,855
I don't know, when I opened my eyes
she was lying there unconscious.

507
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:41,291
What's the hospital called?

508
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:46,245
I'll be there right away, see you soon.

509
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:47,923
See you soon in Baghdad.

510
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:51,399
I'll call you as soon as I arrive.

511
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:09,618
Carla, it's me, I know, sorry but...

512
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:11,336
Everything's fine, don't worry.

513
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:13,853
They're both fine, they're asleep.

514
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:15,451
I've got to go away right now.

515
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:18,128
I'm not sure when, please don't start.

516
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:20,605
I've got to go, I don't know when.

517
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:25,559
Come early tomorrow morning,
I'll leave the keys out,

518
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:29,435
you look after Rosa and Emilia.

519
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:42,140
- Good morning.
- Yes?

520
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:46,655
I'd like a ticket to Baghdad,
first available flight.

521
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:49,611
What?

522
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:54,566
I said I'd like a ticket to Baghdad,
first available flight.

523
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,601
- Maybe I misheard.
- What's the problem?

524
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,039
Not again.

525
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,676
- I am at the airport, aren't I?
- Of course.

526
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,874
I'd like a ticket to Baghdad please.

527
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:09,149
Perhaps you haven't heard,
but there's a war in Iraq.

528
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:12,585
There are no flights,
there's no longer an airport!

529
00:39:12,944 --> 00:39:14,982
- I have to go to Baghdad.
- You can't!

530
00:39:15,182 --> 00:39:17,099
There must be an airport near Baghdad!

531
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,896
Give me a ticket for
an airport near Baghdad

532
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:25,809
then I'll take a taxi, boat, or walk,
that's up to me.

533
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:28,726
- Give me the nearest airport
- Nearest to what?

534
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:29,685
"Baghdad!"

535
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:31,003
Where do you want to go?

536
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:36,717
No, just wanted to know...
no time to waste.

537
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,872
You're very kind, extremely kind, goodbye.

538
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,828
Everything okay?

539
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,465
A ticket for Baghdad!

540
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:49,342
Was he joking?

541
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:19,410
Hi Eleonora, what's for dinner?

542
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:23,046
They sent the certificate back,
you've got to call them.

543
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:27,361
- How are you? You look tired.
- The usual stuff...

544
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,716
Apart from this morning
some guy comes in all agitated

545
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:34,033
asking for a ticket to Baghdad!

546
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,790
Imagine, wanting to go to Baghdad
that game day!

547
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:39,027
A ticket for Baghdad? What was he like?

548
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:40,785
Quite ordinary looking.

549
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,101
Like that guy there.

550
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:48,856
That guy there unloading
the crates in Iraq.

551
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:54,130
It's the splitting image!

552
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,046
Eleonora!

553
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:58,844
That's him!

554
00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:01,441
Will you help me drain the pasta?

555
00:41:05,556 --> 00:41:07,594
How the hell did he manage that?

556
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:13,227
No, these stay here in Basra,
those are got Baghdad.

557
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:16,064
Where's Gauzzelli?

558
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:18,861
- What is it?
- We've got to leave for Baghdad.

559
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:22,297
- We haven't gotten the okay.
- Yes we have, from Mrs. Serao.

560
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:25,453
- Come on, let's go now.
- Start it up!

561
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:28,769
- Mrs. Serao!
- Finally found you.

562
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:32,685
You're a marvelous, wonderful person.

563
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:37,399
Sorry if I pressed you,
but I'm so happy to be here!

564
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:42,793
Thank you, Doctor,

565
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:46,029
Sorry if I seemed doubtful in Rome.

566
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:50,424
So many people want to help
but just end up wasting our time,

567
00:41:50,824 --> 00:41:53,301
but we can't get enough of
surgeons like you.

568
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:56,497
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you, goodbye.

569
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:59,054
Let's go!

570
00:42:08,523 --> 00:42:11,839
- Can't you go a bit faster?
- No.

571
00:42:12,758 --> 00:42:15,635
- Shall I drive?
- Why don't you take a nap?

572
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:31,936
What's the problem?

573
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:35,971
Doctor Guazzelli, why've we stopped?

574
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:39,128
We just got the order to go back to Basra.

575
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:41,845
Back to Basra?

576
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:43,163
You crazy?

577
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:47,998
Stop, counter-orders!

578
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:50,115
- How far is it to Baghdad?
- About 100 kilometers.

579
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:54,031
Wait, stop.

580
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,866
I've got to get to Baghdad.

581
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:00,303
- But it's all desert.
- I've got to get to Baghdad.

582
00:43:00,503 --> 00:43:04,019
Thanks, I'll tell Guazzelli, don't worry.

583
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,256
Go, go!

584
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,153
Fuad, it's Attilio.

585
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:39,508
I'm glad you called,
I've been trying to reach you all day.

586
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:43,983
I've found a way to get you
to Iraq in a few days.

587
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:47,339
- I'm in Baghdad!
- What do you mean?

588
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:53,052
There are two huge hands
holding two scimitars.

589
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,649
- Where's the hospital?
- I don't believe it!

590
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:57,647
I'll take you, don't move.

591
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:14,468
Fuad!

592
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:17,584
You took your time!

593
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:21,899
- How are you?
- Fine. How'd you get to Baghdad?

594
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:23,457
By bus.

595
00:45:23,777 --> 00:45:26,134
Where's the hospital? Let's go.

596
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,930
We're off.

597
00:45:57,578 --> 00:45:58,776
Come along.

598
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,011
- Where is she?
- Over here.

599
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:07,486
- That's odd...
- What?

600
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:09,164
She was here last night.

601
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:15,037
- I'm afraid it's a bad sign.
- You're joking!

602
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,593
It's a good sign, they've probably moved
her to a convalescent ward.

603
00:46:18,793 --> 00:46:23,468
Let's ask, there must be a doctor,
a surgeon, a sister a brother...

604
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,945
I'll try and find someone, don't worry.

605
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:27,862
I'm quite happy.

606
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:32,098
It's a very good sign,
I'm happy she's recovered,

607
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,255
I'll go look for her...

608
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:13,050
Vittoria?

609
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:17,005
Vittoria.

610
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:18,963
See who it is?

611
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:21,840
See who it is?

612
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:27,753
What a coincidence!

613
00:47:27,953 --> 00:47:29,950
You in Baghdad, too!

614
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,341
With that blanket on your face you seemed...
but you're breathing!

615
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,418
You're looking great.

616
00:47:40,618 --> 00:47:42,256
Really great.

617
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:47,250
They told me you weren't well,
I got a bit scared.

618
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:56,799
What was that?

619
00:47:58,637 --> 00:48:01,434
Thought you said something.

620
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,267
You know...

621
00:48:07,946 --> 00:48:11,582
Fuad's gone to talk to this doctor

622
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:13,500
who is just great.

623
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:19,533
The whole of Baghdad's talking about him.

624
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,531
I said, "Who is he?"

625
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:27,164
The hospital's empty, he's cured everyone.

626
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:32,558
I've spoken to him,
I'll have you home in a couple of days,

627
00:48:32,837 --> 00:48:33,756
I promise.

628
00:48:34,076 --> 00:48:36,074
Found her.

629
00:48:36,274 --> 00:48:41,547
Bed stuck away at an angle,
a blanket covering her face,

630
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:42,506
I thought she was dead.

631
00:48:42,706 --> 00:48:45,423
The doctor doesn't speak Italian,
I've spoken to him.

632
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,619
- The prospects aren't good.
- Why?

633
00:48:48,819 --> 00:48:51,096
Great color in her cheeks...

634
00:48:51,616 --> 00:48:54,093
Look, Fuad's here, see?

635
00:48:54,412 --> 00:48:55,731
She's all right.

636
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,406
She's better, she can leave now?

637
00:49:01,165 --> 00:49:02,563
She's better?

638
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:05,560
What did he say?

639
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:08,316
There's no hope.

640
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:14,030
Are you nuts, in front of her?
She can hear every word.

641
00:49:14,269 --> 00:49:16,467
So she's better, I knew it.

642
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:20,183
He said there's no hope,
but he didn't say she's dead.

643
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:22,140
- Is she dead or alive?
- She's alive but...

644
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,377
What does "she's alive but" mean?
She's alive!

645
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:27,654
Couldn't be better!

646
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:31,969
What needs to be done? Ask him.

647
00:49:36,324 --> 00:49:39,480
- What did he say?
- Vittoria has a cerebral edema.

648
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,797
She's not reacting,

649
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,674
we've got no drugs to treat edemas,

650
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:46,991
this means

651
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:49,269
she'll die soon.

652
00:49:51,586 --> 00:49:55,502
Unless we find the right medicine,

653
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:59,976
she takes it, the edema goes
and she'll be up and about.

654
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:03,133
How long do we have to find the medicine?

655
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:09,046
- There must be a pharmacy open!
- There are no medicines in Baghdad!

656
00:50:09,246 --> 00:50:10,524
I got that, but...

657
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:14,639
Ask him how long she's got
without this medicine,

658
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:19,554
30, 34, 47 minutes,
get him to tell you something.

659
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:30,261
- What's he say?
- It's all written here.

660
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:34,137
He wrote the name of the medicine?
How long have we got?

661
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:36,414
No more than four hours.

662
00:50:37,852 --> 00:50:41,368
Four hours!

663
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:42,767
More than enough!

664
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:45,404
Give us time to have a coffee too!

665
00:50:46,163 --> 00:50:49,799
Let's go get it, four hours...

666
00:50:49,998 --> 00:50:53,035
Let me say goodbye to Victoria.

667
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:56,471
The doctor said you could come with us,

668
00:50:56,671 --> 00:50:59,547
but I reckon more bed rest won't hurt you,

669
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:01,265
get your strength back.

670
00:51:01,465 --> 00:51:03,942
Then I'll find you a better spot,

671
00:51:04,142 --> 00:51:08,337
I saw a fancy spot under the stairs
where no one comes by.

672
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:10,495
Goodbye.

673
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:12,133
Okay, Fuad.

674
00:51:15,928 --> 00:51:18,565
Here's one open.

675
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,722
Pharmacist! Anybody there?

676
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,839
Pharmacist!

677
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,797
Clients!

678
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:29,752
This one's closed too, now what?

679
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:32,629
Maybe there's one there.

680
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:34,267
Look!

681
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:38,702
How do you say in Arabic?
Bazaar, they've got everything.

682
00:51:38,902 --> 00:51:41,219
Give me the prescription, thanks.

683
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:42,897
They'll have everything there.

684
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:49,210
Good morning, I'm Italian.
Do you have this medicine?

685
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:54,364
I need that. I look around, maybe you have
the medicine and maybe you don't remember...

686
00:51:54,563 --> 00:52:00,557
...in this confusion. I have a look.
Where is medicine?

687
00:52:01,116 --> 00:52:02,834
Medicine?

688
00:52:03,034 --> 00:52:05,391
Come along.

689
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,668
You don't have...

690
00:52:07,868 --> 00:52:11,624
They've got Etruscan vases,
diving equipment,

691
00:52:11,823 --> 00:52:13,541
motor-cycle helmets,

692
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:15,739
and they don't have any medicine!

693
00:52:15,939 --> 00:52:19,934
- It's no use, this medicine...
- What does it do?

694
00:52:20,214 --> 00:52:22,052
- It's an anti-edema.
- Let's get it made!

695
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:24,169
- Who by?
- Don't you know a pharmacist?

696
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:27,126
- A pharmacist?
- You're from Baghdad!

697
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:28,804
I know one!

698
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:32,879
Al-Giumeili, an old friend of my father's,

699
00:52:33,878 --> 00:52:35,596
a formidable man.

700
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:04,665
- Is he home?
- Yes.

701
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:08,700
- I told you so, come on.
- She's gone to ask permission.

702
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,417
He's extremely old,
I wonder if he remembers me.

703
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:13,535
My father used to hold him up
as an example

704
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:16,491
of the most noble man he ever knew.

705
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:20,167
- Why, what did he do?
- He as a real poet.

706
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,363
He was young, fell in love
with a woman and married her.

707
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:26,200
A few years later while he was
fighting in some war,

708
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,835
he heard his wife and contracted smallpox
and had been disfigured.

709
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:35,429
So Al-Giumeili said, "My eyes hurt".

710
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,386
And then, "I've gone blind".

711
00:53:39,025 --> 00:53:43,061
When his wife died, 12 years later,
he opens his eyes again.

712
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,095
So as not to upset his wife,

713
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,532
he pretended to be blind for 12 years?

714
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:55,446
Every person is a chasm,
it makes you dizzy to look down...

715
00:53:55,806 --> 00:53:57,724
He never explained to anybody

716
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,476
I'll go and talk to him first then I'll call you.

717
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:26,930
For me?

718
00:54:28,288 --> 00:54:30,765
It's a present for me?

719
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:33,802
It's a beautiful present.

720
00:54:35,959 --> 00:54:36,838
Come.

721
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:39,156
- Bye.
- Bye.

722
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:51,062
Attilio.

723
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:52,460
Hello.

724
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:57,215
Thank you.

725
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:03,327
What did he say?
Can we make it in three hours?

726
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:05,964
I'm sorry,

727
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:09,161
he can't make the medicine we need,

728
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,957
he hasn't got any of the equipment,

729
00:55:12,277 --> 00:55:16,392
he needs mannitol, cortisone,
and various other things.

730
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:18,030
It's not possible.

731
00:55:20,348 --> 00:55:23,464
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

732
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,261
Mannitol, cortisone, what are they?

733
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:28,219
Can you tell him something else?

734
00:55:28,418 --> 00:55:31,415
Tell him in Arabic, fifty years ago

735
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:34,212
there was no mannitol or cortisone.

736
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,047
When someone got a bump on the head,

737
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:40,924
people did say, "He's got an edema,
he'll be dead soon"...

738
00:55:47,756 --> 00:55:51,552
So what did he,
Iraq's foremost scientist, do?

739
00:55:57,864 --> 00:56:02,299
- We tried gastric treatment.
- What did they pump into the stomach?

740
00:56:05,016 --> 00:56:06,135
Glycerine.

741
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:08,492
Glycerine.

742
00:56:08,692 --> 00:56:11,608
I've heard of that, you see.

743
00:56:11,808 --> 00:56:16,523
Where do we buy it?
Forget it, I know everything's closed...

744
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:21,996
Can we make some glycerine
and feed it into her stomach?

745
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:33,103
There's a way.

746
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:36,180
Really!

747
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:39,096
He's trying to remember.

748
00:56:47,207 --> 00:56:49,684
What time is it? How long do we have?

749
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:05,346
Al-Giumeili my old friend,
find me this glycerine.

750
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:10,900
I know you can,
otherwise she's going to die.

751
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:12,018
If she dies,

752
00:57:13,656 --> 00:57:17,212
they can close
this whole show of a world...

753
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:22,406
They can cart if off, unscrew the stars,

754
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:27,440
roll up the sky and put it on a truck,

755
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,875
they can turn off this sunlight
I love so much,

756
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:33,753
you know why I love it so much?

757
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:36,510
Because I love her
when the sun shines on her.

758
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:42,343
They can take everything away,
these carpets, columns, houses,

759
00:57:42,703 --> 00:57:47,217
sand, wind, frogs, ripe watermelons,

760
00:57:47,937 --> 00:57:52,451
hail, seven in the evening,
May, June, July,

761
00:57:52,651 --> 00:57:57,485
basil, bees, the sea, courgettes...

762
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:00,322
Courgettes, Al-Giumeili!

763
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:02,240
Get me this glycerine!

764
00:58:22,896 --> 00:58:26,891
- What's he say?
- Butter, palm oil, olive oil.

765
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:36,920
The base is soda,
but ashes will do, fat and ashes.

766
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,836
It might work, I've got it all,

767
00:58:40,036 --> 00:58:42,433
we can do it in a couple of hours.

768
00:58:46,828 --> 00:58:49,545
A thousand thanks, Al-Giumeili.

769
00:58:57,496 --> 00:58:59,174
Thank you.

770
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:08,683
I reckon it's ready, come here!

771
00:59:08,883 --> 00:59:11,560
- A little more ash.
- No, we've got quite enough.

772
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:14,996
- Doesn't need any more.
- Just another spoonful.

773
00:59:15,195 --> 00:59:16,474
Thank you, Fuad, for everything.

774
00:59:16,674 --> 00:59:18,551
I'll do this, go have a rest.

775
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:21,628
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little, in this chair.

776
00:59:21,828 --> 00:59:25,503
Al-giumeili intimidated me a bit.
Was that his daughter?

777
00:59:25,783 --> 00:59:28,740
She's the last wife of his son Ali.

778
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:32,016
He was murdered six months ago,

779
00:59:32,495 --> 00:59:34,333
he was a real free spirit.

780
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:37,769
Saddam Hussein didn't like free spirits.

781
00:59:38,368 --> 00:59:39,847
Poor Al-Giumeili.

782
00:59:41,804 --> 00:59:44,841
Time has left me nothing

783
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,518
to sustain my eyes

784
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:49,316
and my heart.

785
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,033
Come on, Fuad,

786
00:59:52,232 --> 00:59:56,947
if this stuff works
we'll have dinner and celebrate.

787
01:00:10,092 --> 01:00:12,369
Good, eh?

788
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:16,804
It's home made, hand-made by me and Fuad,

789
01:00:16,964 --> 01:00:19,720
no preservatives, colorings, chemicals,

790
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,115
just like home-made tagliatelle,
"butter please, oil please,

791
01:00:24,315 --> 01:00:26,513
chop some onions, put in garlic",

792
01:00:26,712 --> 01:00:31,627
really delicious,
Fuad and I both had second helpings.

793
01:00:31,826 --> 01:00:36,581
Fuad wanted a third but I said,
"No, leave some for Vittoria!"

794
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:40,736
You're looking well, I tidied you up...

795
01:00:40,936 --> 01:00:42,534
Really well.

796
01:00:43,693 --> 01:00:46,969
I was forgetting, look what I've got!

797
01:00:47,408 --> 01:00:50,205
Hang on, close your eyes.

798
01:00:50,525 --> 01:00:52,842
Close 'em!

799
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,917
Open your eyes.

800
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:58,356
Open!

801
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:03,789
I'll hang it here, okay?

802
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:09,862
How's that? I banged my head!

803
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,218
I'll be getting an edema next!
It's full of flies here!

804
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:16,015
You like it? Look.

805
01:01:16,335 --> 01:01:20,210
Take a quick look,
tell me whether it's okay or not.

806
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:25,205
One second...

807
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:48,218
Did you move?
I thought before you were like that...

808
01:01:51,214 --> 01:01:53,012
She looks worse than ever to me.

809
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,086
That brew didn't do much good.

810
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:06,517
I'll go have a word with the doctor,
a personal matter,

811
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,634
be right back.

812
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:13,029
Doctor?

813
01:02:13,588 --> 01:02:17,823
Doctor, excuse me, doctor.
Excuse me, but ahh...

814
01:02:18,303 --> 01:02:22,019
...she seems worse.
The glycerine didn't help.

815
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:23,177
- Didn't help at all?
- No.

816
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:27,173
Without it she'd be dead already.
It's a miracle she's still alive.

817
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:31,128
Now we must wait and hope
that the medicines arrive soon.

818
01:02:31,368 --> 01:02:37,121
Doctor, if I can lend a hand,
if you need anything I...

819
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:39,838
Thank you, I will get to her
as soon as possible.

820
01:02:40,038 --> 01:02:41,196
Yes...

821
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,345
Hey, what are you doing?

822
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:53,582
Doctor! Who the hell is he?

823
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:56,698
Where do you think you're going?

824
01:03:00,933 --> 01:03:01,733
Who are you?

825
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:04,969
What have you done to her?

826
01:03:05,288 --> 01:03:09,883
Doctor, he was leaning over Vittoria
like this. What did he want?

827
01:03:10,842 --> 01:03:12,121
This, I suspect.

828
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,756
Vittoria's chain.

829
01:03:16,156 --> 01:03:18,953
You have thieves in the hospital?

830
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:25,065
I think it's better if you keep that.
It's a nightmare...

831
01:03:25,265 --> 01:03:29,700
...looters everywhere. The Americans
promised us some security people...

832
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,338
...let's hope they get here soon.

833
01:03:31,538 --> 01:03:34,654
Doctor, how is she, she looks very pale.

834
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:36,572
Do you think she can breathe all right?

835
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:38,969
She could probably do with some oxygen.

836
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:40,408
Goodbye for now.

837
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:43,484
Thank you, excuse me Doctor.

838
01:03:43,684 --> 01:03:46,800
You breathing?

839
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,476
Breathe, Vittoria.

840
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:56,389
The only ones breathing are the flies.

841
01:03:56,629 --> 01:03:59,745
Damnit, where do they get so much oxygen?

842
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:04,540
It's a nightmare.
I'll go find you some oxygen right away.

843
01:04:04,819 --> 01:04:06,138
Hang on.

844
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:12,091
Poor doctor, hasn't even got any band-aids.

845
01:04:12,411 --> 01:04:15,966
Hi, it's Attilio.

846
01:04:16,526 --> 01:04:20,202
By any chance to you
have an oxygen tank at home?

847
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:22,279
Yes, oxygen tank.

848
01:04:22,479 --> 01:04:26,514
You might have forgotten you had one...

849
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:33,786
You don't know anyone
who might have some oxygen?

850
01:04:36,063 --> 01:04:37,661
Got it!

851
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:40,778
Don't worry, don't need it any longer.

852
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,496
Thanks bye.

853
01:04:43,095 --> 01:04:47,290
I'll get you some oxygen, I know where.

854
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:48,848
I'll go fetch it.

855
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:56,559
Goodbye Vittoria.

856
01:05:10,743 --> 01:05:11,981
Mamma Mia!

857
01:05:20,611 --> 01:05:23,089
It's total hell!

858
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:30,080
Look out!

859
01:05:32,757 --> 01:05:34,755
It was here, who pinched it?

860
01:05:35,274 --> 01:05:36,513
Excuse me, did you see where...

861
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:38,071
Where've they put it?

862
01:05:40,868 --> 01:05:42,706
Have you seen

863
01:05:43,825 --> 01:05:46,182
A wet-suit with a mask?

864
01:05:46,621 --> 01:05:49,378
Stop!

865
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:53,134
Hey Mr. Arab, stop!

866
01:05:53,413 --> 01:05:54,932
I said stop!

867
01:05:55,171 --> 01:06:00,126
Mr. Arab, whatever your names is, stop!

868
01:06:00,525 --> 01:06:02,003
You crazy?

869
01:06:02,203 --> 01:06:04,001
Stop!

870
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:07,996
Friend. Italian. I am Italian.

871
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:16,826
I need the oxygeno.
Oxygen tank, for me. Oxygen.

872
01:06:17,026 --> 01:06:19,903
I need. I pay. I pay. I pay.

873
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:21,101
Dollar?

874
01:06:21,301 --> 01:06:23,219
Like Dollar. Euro... Do you know?

875
01:06:23,419 --> 01:06:26,255
Italy, France, Germany,
Luxembourg... I pay...

876
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:33,047
More? How much does he want?

877
01:06:34,885 --> 01:06:36,963
He's left me the whole cart!

878
01:06:37,362 --> 01:06:38,881
The tank!

879
01:06:41,118 --> 01:06:43,435
It's stuck.

880
01:06:45,353 --> 01:06:49,468
I'd better go, if anyone comes

881
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:51,666
tell him I paid for all this lot!

882
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,822
I paid for it!

883
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:00,975
Hang on, there's more, there's this too.

884
01:07:01,255 --> 01:07:03,852
A dog, where shall I put it?

885
01:07:04,251 --> 01:07:07,008
Next to you?

886
01:07:07,847 --> 01:07:11,323
Here, that way he can keep an eye on you.

887
01:07:11,563 --> 01:07:12,522
Looks good here.

888
01:07:12,721 --> 01:07:17,396
I spent a fortune but it was worth it,

889
01:07:17,596 --> 01:07:20,552
above all because
I found something absolutely fantastic.

890
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:22,550
Really close your eyes.

891
01:07:23,069 --> 01:07:27,384
A fly whisk! I've found the weapon
of mass destruction.

892
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:28,943
I found it!

893
01:07:29,782 --> 01:07:33,817
I'm going to have myself a massacre,
you're dead!

894
01:07:38,372 --> 01:07:40,409
Breathing okay?

895
01:07:40,609 --> 01:07:43,246
What's the weather like up
in the mountains?

896
01:07:45,443 --> 01:07:47,401
Is it snowing?

897
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,996
If only you know
how pretty you are in blue.

898
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,152
I've put some tape here, hope it works,

899
01:07:58,588 --> 01:08:01,305
Do you like music? I'll show you.

900
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:04,581
I've found an old record player,
it's all Arab music,

901
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:05,940
but they're nice, I bet.

902
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:08,696
Can't figure out a thing here...

903
01:08:08,896 --> 01:08:11,933
Look who's here in Baghdad.

904
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:16,008
Look who I've found, close your ears,

905
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:19,324
this is incredible, just listen.

906
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:42,218
As soon as you're better
we'll go to Granada together and dance.

907
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:45,893
How are you muchacha, breathing okay?

908
01:08:47,452 --> 01:08:48,850
The light's gone again.

909
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:00,197
Fuad, yes, hello.

910
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,075
Fuad, is that you?

911
01:09:02,274 --> 01:09:04,991
It's you Attorney, I can't hear you well.

912
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,548
Be in my office at 8:00 tomorrow,

913
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:12,343
you've got to sign the charge sheet,
or off tojail with you!

914
01:09:12,742 --> 01:09:14,740
No messing around.

915
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:17,257
Attilio! Attilio!

916
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:19,295
Hello? Hello?

917
01:09:20,134 --> 01:09:21,412
Thank goodness.

918
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:33,758
Doctor, good evening. Doctor, excuse me,

919
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:36,195
I have done everything you said, but...

920
01:09:36,395 --> 01:09:39,751
...she doesn't answer. She doesn't move,
she doesn't react in anyway.

921
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:42,867
She's like ahh... dead.

922
01:09:43,027 --> 01:09:44,106
I don't know what else...

923
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:48,181
But ahh, how can I tell
if she's getting better, recovering.

924
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:53,535
If there's the slightest movement,
a finger, a hand, an eye.

925
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:56,571
You'll know she has made it,
any movement is from the mental.

926
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,607
What on earth? Claudio Villa!

927
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,639
What is that?

928
01:10:08,717 --> 01:10:12,273
An old record I found,
the music might cheer her up.

929
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:14,031
Is the oxygen okay?

930
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:15,709
Yes, but it's finished.

931
01:10:15,989 --> 01:10:16,548
Already?

932
01:10:16,748 --> 01:10:18,066
Yeah. This can be removed.

933
01:10:18,266 --> 01:10:21,622
You hear that? The oxygen's done you good.

934
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:24,219
How is she?

935
01:10:25,378 --> 01:10:26,457
She is alive.

936
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,652
Alive? But Doctor. Doctor...

937
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:34,368
Without water, without food,
how can she go on.

938
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:36,885
Isn't there anything we can give her?

939
01:10:37,204 --> 01:10:38,203
If only I had...

940
01:10:38,403 --> 01:10:39,402
Had what?

941
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:41,839
Some sort of nutritional drip
I could give her...

942
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:46,154
along with the cortisone
and the antibiotics... never mind.

943
01:10:46,473 --> 01:10:47,872
But what can we...

944
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:49,430
It will help a lot.

945
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:51,028
Goodbye for now.

946
01:10:52,387 --> 01:10:54,624
Now he tells me one thing at a time!

947
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:57,820
The nutritional drip is crucial.

948
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:00,138
I'll find you something to eat,

949
01:11:00,337 --> 01:11:04,173
don't worry, I'll get food for you.

950
01:11:04,892 --> 01:11:09,567
Right away, if I say I will, I will.

951
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,405
Nunzio, how are you?

952
01:11:11,644 --> 01:11:16,638
It's De Giovanni.
Doctor Guazzelli, I've missed you!

953
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:20,714
I'm in Baghdad, I'm all right.

954
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:21,992
And you?

955
01:11:22,192 --> 01:11:25,029
Where are you? When'll you get here?

956
01:11:25,468 --> 01:11:29,863
Yeah right! We need things now,
there are sick people here!

957
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:35,656
They won't let the Red Cross through
the road blocks? Knock'em down!

958
01:11:36,016 --> 01:11:38,653
You know what, I'll come to you.

959
01:11:39,052 --> 01:11:41,210
Goodbye, Nunzio. Goodbye.

960
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:43,767
I'll get you some food.

961
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:48,082
I'll get a couple of candles
so we can have dinner together.

962
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:52,477
I'm off, they're not far, 50 kilometers,

963
01:11:52,677 --> 01:11:54,994
I'll borrow the doctor's bike,

964
01:11:55,194 --> 01:11:57,990
if I go at 100,
I'll be there in half an hour.

965
01:11:58,190 --> 01:11:59,349
Don't move,

966
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:04,263
actually do move...
a finger, a hand, an eye, whatever.

967
01:12:43,538 --> 01:12:46,574
Might have know it, now I've hurt...

968
01:12:48,891 --> 01:12:50,210
my foot.

969
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:02,835
Out of gas in Iraq, it's too much!

970
01:13:03,435 --> 01:13:06,791
On we go, then we'll see.

971
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:26,768
Hello! Hello! I am Italian!

972
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,125
Anyone there?

973
01:13:29,484 --> 01:13:30,923
Hello! Please!

974
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:33,759
I'm borrowing a camel.

975
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:37,355
I'll bring it right back.

976
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:45,985
You're much more beautiful than him,
my favorite camel.

977
01:13:46,864 --> 01:13:48,303
Now be good, down.

978
01:13:48,502 --> 01:13:52,777
Let me get on,
how do you say "down" in Arabic?

979
01:13:57,212 --> 01:13:59,410
You've got to get down!

980
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:12,115
You're more beautiful than he is,
and he's deaf too!

981
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:13,833
Now let's go.

982
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:18,228
Hang on.

983
01:14:20,785 --> 01:14:23,622
Slowly!

984
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:28,336
Now this is a real camel,
you're ugly and dead too!

985
01:14:28,696 --> 01:14:31,333
That way!

986
01:14:31,772 --> 01:14:34,329
Other way, camel!

987
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:37,725
This is the way back to Baghdad!

988
01:14:39,004 --> 01:14:42,000
He's taking me back to the hospital.

989
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,637
Camel, can you hear me?

990
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:46,755
Go that way!

991
01:14:47,034 --> 01:14:48,433
Down boy!

992
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:51,749
I can't jump off, I've hurt my foot.

993
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:57,302
Look where we are,
he must be used to going to Baghdad!

994
01:14:57,502 --> 01:14:59,660
Stop!

995
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,085
Just my luck, the dumbest camel
in the whole of Arabia!

996
01:15:12,605 --> 01:15:13,723
Goodbye.

997
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:19,237
What is it?

998
01:15:20,675 --> 01:15:22,313
What do you want?

999
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:24,431
Go away!

1000
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:28,666
Before you couldn't wait to get to Baghdad!

1001
01:15:28,866 --> 01:15:30,224
Other way!

1002
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:31,942
Go away, camel.

1003
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,337
What on earth are you following me for now?

1004
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:40,932
Mamma Mia, you smell disgusting.

1005
01:15:41,491 --> 01:15:43,329
How come you have such bad breath?

1006
01:16:13,186 --> 01:16:16,303
- The Italian Red Cross?
- Doctor!

1007
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:19,339
Is Nunzio around, Dr. Guazzelli?

1008
01:16:22,455 --> 01:16:23,454
That's the lot.

1009
01:16:23,654 --> 01:16:28,528
Did you remember some decent anti-edema,
syringes and cortisone?

1010
01:16:28,728 --> 01:16:32,763
Everything, don't know how you'll
manage this lot on your bike.

1011
01:16:32,923 --> 01:16:37,198
What I can't squeeze in,
you can bring back with you.

1012
01:16:38,597 --> 01:16:40,275
You put some gas for the bike?

1013
01:16:40,435 --> 01:16:43,071
Did you recharge my cell phone?

1014
01:16:48,385 --> 01:16:52,820
What do you think, Chemiotina or Talamagil?

1015
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:53,859
Chemiotina.

1016
01:16:54,059 --> 01:16:59,333
I might as well take both,
except I've got no more room.

1017
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:06,924
- When will you get to Baghdad?
- They won't let us in.

1018
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:11,079
It's a real nightmare in Baghdad,
they haven't even got band-aids.

1019
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:13,396
- Are they in here?
- Right there.

1020
01:17:14,275 --> 01:17:17,152
Thanks a million.

1021
01:17:17,352 --> 01:17:19,030
Could you give me a push?

1022
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:23,824
I'll tell you when.
One, two, three... push hard!

1023
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,259
Good luck!

1024
01:17:28,459 --> 01:17:30,337
Thanks, same to you!

1025
01:17:50,593 --> 01:17:51,752
Sir!

1026
01:17:52,191 --> 01:17:53,470
Halt!

1027
01:17:54,189 --> 01:17:57,305
Halt I said! The bike, down!

1028
01:18:00,182 --> 01:18:01,261
I'm Italian.

1029
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,498
Take cover! Take cover! Take cover!

1030
01:18:04,976 --> 01:18:06,814
Hold your fire!

1031
01:18:07,054 --> 01:18:09,331
Don't you move!

1032
01:18:09,611 --> 01:18:11,848
Put your hands on your head!

1033
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,724
Hands on your head I said! Don't move!

1034
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,442
He's a fuckin' powderkeg!

1035
01:18:17,642 --> 01:18:18,721
Don't shoot!

1036
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,198
Are you crazy! I'm Italian!

1037
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:22,037
These are medical...

1038
01:18:22,236 --> 01:18:24,034
Stop! Don't touch those!

1039
01:18:24,234 --> 01:18:25,233
They're medical supplies!

1040
01:18:25,433 --> 01:18:27,351
- Medical what?
- Medical supplies!

1041
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:30,707
Stay there or we'll shoot you!

1042
01:18:31,995 --> 01:18:33,354
I don't move!

1043
01:18:33,673 --> 01:18:35,232
Put your hands on your head!

1044
01:18:35,431 --> 01:18:36,510
Okay!

1045
01:18:37,949 --> 01:18:39,507
Tell him to stay calm.

1046
01:18:39,706 --> 01:18:40,745
He is very nervous.

1047
01:18:40,945 --> 01:18:43,103
"He's going to shoot me!
He's shaking!"

1048
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:46,139
Stay calm! Put that gun machine down!

1049
01:18:46,339 --> 01:18:48,696
Stay calm! I am having heart attack!

1050
01:18:48,856 --> 01:18:50,134
Shut up!

1051
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:55,488
Williams, Johnson, check him out!

1052
01:18:58,645 --> 01:19:00,562
Careful, watch for the trigger, careful!

1053
01:19:00,842 --> 01:19:03,799
You're... ow! You're... ow!

1054
01:19:03,998 --> 01:19:05,636
- Tell him...
- He's clean sir.

1055
01:19:06,036 --> 01:19:10,751
Aspirin. Got saline. He's clean.

1056
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:15,106
Okay. He's just some nut!
Some crazy Italian!

1057
01:19:15,745 --> 01:19:17,982
Who the fuck is he!

1058
01:19:19,941 --> 01:19:22,378
Now you listen to me, Sir. Who are you?

1059
01:19:23,097 --> 01:19:23,976
I am Italian.

1060
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,495
Yeah, we got that.

1061
01:19:25,654 --> 01:19:27,093
What do you do?

1062
01:19:27,452 --> 01:19:29,490
- I am a teacher.
- Of what?

1063
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:30,569
Poetry.

1064
01:19:30,768 --> 01:19:31,847
What poetry.

1065
01:19:32,047 --> 01:19:35,083
- Poetry.
- Poetry.

1066
01:19:35,283 --> 01:19:36,442
Poetry.

1067
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,478
He's a poet!

1068
01:19:39,678 --> 01:19:40,357
What?

1069
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:41,396
What did you say?

1070
01:19:41,596 --> 01:19:42,754
Poet!

1071
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:44,952
So you're a poet?

1072
01:19:45,951 --> 01:19:48,108
Yes. Like ahh...

1073
01:19:48,308 --> 01:19:50,226
Dante. Walt Whitman.

1074
01:19:51,225 --> 01:19:52,503
Walt Whitman.

1075
01:19:56,698 --> 01:19:58,217
Okay... get the fuck out of here!

1076
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,213
Pull the wire!

1077
01:20:06,329 --> 01:20:08,127
Very sorry about that.

1078
01:20:08,407 --> 01:20:11,683
Yes, thank you. Thank you...

1079
01:20:11,883 --> 01:20:13,082
...excuse me.

1080
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:16,598
Just a push. A last favor.

1081
01:20:16,797 --> 01:20:18,715
Thank you, a push, yeah.

1082
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:20,593
One, two, three! Yes!

1083
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:26,027
Bye sir! Thank you!

1084
01:20:27,185 --> 01:20:31,700
Bye! Bye-bye! Thank you!

1085
01:20:32,379 --> 01:20:35,576
Go down!

1086
01:20:35,735 --> 01:20:37,853
Damn thing's stuck,

1087
01:20:38,372 --> 01:20:39,970
Just won't budge.

1088
01:20:42,567 --> 01:20:44,405
Ahh Doctor this too.

1089
01:20:46,163 --> 01:20:48,720
Thank you for this, and for all the rest.

1090
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,276
Even if it's just a drop in the ocean.
She's okay now.

1091
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:53,715
Thank you.

1092
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:54,873
I must be going.

1093
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:57,470
She's okay, Doctor,
but she still isn't moving.

1094
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,307
I mean, rather than do
one thing at a time,

1095
01:21:00,507 --> 01:21:02,105
how about if you do everything at once.

1096
01:21:02,305 --> 01:21:03,383
What can we do now?

1097
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:07,778
At this stage, there is nothing more
we can do. Just hope and pray to Allah.

1098
01:21:08,178 --> 01:21:09,416
Ah, thank you.

1099
01:21:12,613 --> 01:21:14,291
You hear that?

1100
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:17,727
He said we've done all we can.

1101
01:21:18,286 --> 01:21:20,683
You're fine, it's all inside here.

1102
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:26,477
There's nothing more we need to do,
just relax.

1103
01:21:26,796 --> 01:21:28,514
He told me to pray to Allah.

1104
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:36,465
It's the only thing we can do,
pray to Allah.

1105
01:21:36,904 --> 01:21:38,503
I would pray.

1106
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:43,337
We've done everything else...

1107
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:50,129
Allah, the only prayers
I know is the Lord's Prayer in Italian,

1108
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,726
you understand Italian?

1109
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:55,123
It's a beautiful prayer.

1110
01:21:56,322 --> 01:21:58,599
How about it?

1111
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,954
Allah, here goes.

1112
01:22:04,912 --> 01:22:06,950
Our Father, who are in heaven,

1113
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:09,347
hallowed be thy name.

1114
01:22:10,106 --> 01:22:13,462
Thy kingdom come, they will be done

1115
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,460
in Earth as it is in heaven.

1116
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:17,857
Give us this day our daily bread,

1117
01:22:18,097 --> 01:22:20,134
and forgive us our trespasses

1118
01:22:20,374 --> 01:22:21,972
as we forgive them
that trespass against us

1119
01:22:22,172 --> 01:22:23,371
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

1120
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,689
Now we've really done all we can.

1121
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:37,474
Rest, I'm going to have
a little rest myself.

1122
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,149
Bye Vittoria.

1123
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:50,459
Anything you need, I'm at the barber's.

1124
01:22:57,052 --> 01:22:59,050
That's just what I said to Vittoria

1125
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,086
when she asked
why I'd come back to Baghdad.

1126
01:23:02,726 --> 01:23:07,041
I told her about the 351st Arabian Night,
remember it?

1127
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,076
You know all 1001? How about 406th?

1128
01:23:11,276 --> 01:23:15,631
406 is about the Italian poet
with a funny sole.

1129
01:23:16,589 --> 01:23:18,907
"The Arabian Nights", wonderful!

1130
01:23:19,866 --> 01:23:21,424
"Beautiful sky!"

1131
01:23:21,624 --> 01:23:24,101
The Baghdad sky is
the pillow of the world.

1132
01:23:26,058 --> 01:23:28,336
Looks like they're firing angels.

1133
01:23:30,373 --> 01:23:33,690
80km from here, over 3,000 years ago,

1134
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:37,605
they built the Tower of Babel
so they could climb up to this sky.

1135
01:23:38,204 --> 01:23:41,201
80km from here all
our languages were born.

1136
01:23:41,401 --> 01:23:45,236
Since they tried to touch this sky,
we no longer understand each other.

1137
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:53,627
A Muslim legend says that now
and then Allah comes back to Earth

1138
01:23:53,826 --> 01:23:55,824
because he misses the look of
the starry sky from below.

1139
01:23:56,104 --> 01:23:59,819
Centuries of wisdom
and what have we learned? Nothing.

1140
01:24:00,099 --> 01:24:01,977
You know why there are wars?

1141
01:24:02,616 --> 01:24:06,731
Because the world started without men
and without men it'll finish.

1142
01:24:10,447 --> 01:24:14,682
Come over and get a good night's
sleep in a proper bed.

1143
01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:19,796
Thanks, but I've got
a comfortable barber's chair.

1144
01:24:20,076 --> 01:24:21,674
I'll sleep like a log near Vittoria,
you never know.

1145
01:24:21,874 --> 01:24:23,032
I do know.

1146
01:24:23,911 --> 01:24:24,830
Goodbye.

1147
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:26,628
Goodnight, Fuad.

1148
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:28,826
Fuad?

1149
01:24:29,225 --> 01:24:33,101
Come on, if we're good and behave well,
we'll get to heaven!

1150
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,698
There's nothing after this.

1151
01:24:35,818 --> 01:24:37,935
Even less than nothing,
which would at least be something.

1152
01:24:38,135 --> 01:24:40,572
Still, I'm glad I was born,

1153
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:45,127
I'm sure even when I'm dead
I'll remember when I was alive.

1154
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:47,084
Good night, Attilio.

1155
01:24:48,523 --> 01:24:49,801
See you, Fuad.

1156
01:27:19,747 --> 01:27:20,666
Fuad!

1157
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:27,618
Fuad!

1158
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,343
Oh Vittoria!

1159
01:27:59,861 --> 01:28:03,257
Vittoria! Vittoria! Vittoria!

1160
01:28:15,976 --> 01:28:19,492
No, you can't take her away yet.
She can hardly stand.

1161
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:23,647
You'll have to give her a day or two.
Look it's almost a miracle,

1162
01:28:23,847 --> 01:28:25,285
but in here they do happen sometimes.

1163
01:28:25,485 --> 01:28:31,278
But, sorry... sorry to keep asking you doctor.
But she really is better?

1164
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:34,075
Yes, she's better. Come and see.

1165
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:35,753
But do you think she'll recognize me?

1166
01:28:35,953 --> 01:28:36,752
Of course she will.

1167
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:38,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

1168
01:28:41,467 --> 01:28:44,024
I bet she won't. Wait, Doctor...

1169
01:28:44,223 --> 01:28:47,739
Maybe first, a pair of new shoes...

1170
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:52,374
...or some flowers, or maybe a shower,
I must stink like a camel.

1171
01:28:57,774 --> 01:29:01,929
Fine, we'll try to get her walking.
There's still so much to do.

1172
01:29:02,089 --> 01:29:04,446
Thank you Doctor.
Doctor, Doctor... Excuse me.

1173
01:29:05,285 --> 01:29:09,280
Forgive me but ahh...
Have you even been kissed by a camel?

1174
01:29:13,635 --> 01:29:16,392
I'll give her a surprise.

1175
01:29:25,182 --> 01:29:26,580
A dark brown.

1176
01:29:30,216 --> 01:29:33,053
They are used. But they are beautiful.

1177
01:29:33,732 --> 01:29:38,007
Thank you. Beautiful, yes, thank you.
Okay, so how much is it?

1178
01:29:38,726 --> 01:29:39,845
Only twenty dollar.

1179
01:29:49,434 --> 01:29:53,429
I... l... I don't... Excuse me.

1180
01:29:53,629 --> 01:29:54,708
Yes?

1181
01:29:57,265 --> 01:30:01,620
May I try just two, three steps?

1182
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:04,177
Just to see how they fit me?

1183
01:30:04,376 --> 01:30:06,973
- Yes.
- Sometimes they are large, they are tight.

1184
01:30:07,173 --> 01:30:08,452
Take your time. Take your time.

1185
01:30:08,651 --> 01:30:13,686
To try, yeah? Two, three steps, yeah?

1186
01:30:13,925 --> 01:30:15,004
They are wonderful.

1187
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:16,043
Yes.

1188
01:30:16,243 --> 01:30:19,079
Wonderful. What a beautiful good man.

1189
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:21,037
- Couple of steps more.
- Please.

1190
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:23,235
It's not bad.

1191
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,349
Sir! Sir!

1192
01:30:42,932 --> 01:30:44,849
All for a pair of shoes that are too big!

1193
01:30:48,086 --> 01:30:49,724
Leave me alone!

1194
01:30:49,924 --> 01:30:54,318
Stop, that's a minefield!

1195
01:30:57,475 --> 01:30:59,273
You're scared!

1196
01:30:59,512 --> 01:31:00,831
Wimps!

1197
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:11,698
Don't move!

1198
01:31:11,898 --> 01:31:13,656
Careful where you tread!

1199
01:31:16,253 --> 01:31:19,050
You want your wretched shoes!

1200
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:21,047
Boom! Boom!

1201
01:31:21,247 --> 01:31:22,965
I'll give them back.

1202
01:31:23,205 --> 01:31:26,082
Here, have 'em!

1203
01:31:33,473 --> 01:31:36,310
The other one too? Want both?

1204
01:31:37,548 --> 01:31:39,346
So long as you leave me in peace.

1205
01:31:56,446 --> 01:31:59,403
There are mines!

1206
01:31:59,763 --> 01:32:02,320
Now what'll I do?

1207
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:05,076
Mines!

1208
01:32:05,276 --> 01:32:08,992
Allah, do a friend a favor,

1209
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:11,109
I'll never ask for another.

1210
01:32:11,349 --> 01:32:13,027
Help me.

1211
01:32:13,467 --> 01:32:17,023
Maybe if I tread where I trod before...

1212
01:32:17,622 --> 01:32:18,900
dead east,

1213
01:32:19,899 --> 01:32:21,497
Let's go.

1214
01:32:22,576 --> 01:32:24,414
There, just as I thought.

1215
01:32:24,853 --> 01:32:26,931
That's my footprint...

1216
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:32,245
Would you believe it?
Stuck in the middle of a minefield!

1217
01:32:32,804 --> 01:32:34,283
There and there.

1218
01:32:45,629 --> 01:32:47,068
Oh Mamma Mia!

1219
01:32:49,505 --> 01:32:52,461
Thanks for your help,
I'll do the same for you.

1220
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,739
Bye, thanks.

1221
01:33:00,332 --> 01:33:02,210
Fuad, can I come in?

1222
01:33:04,527 --> 01:33:05,646
Fuad?

1223
01:33:06,126 --> 01:33:08,523
It's Attilio, can I come in?

1224
01:33:08,882 --> 01:33:12,678
I've got some great news,
the best in the world!

1225
01:33:13,157 --> 01:33:14,756
What a wind!

1226
01:33:16,034 --> 01:33:17,912
You're losing all your papers.

1227
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:21,747
However much poetry do you write?

1228
01:33:22,746 --> 01:33:26,222
It's all falling down,
shall I close the door?

1229
01:33:34,493 --> 01:33:36,370
Fuad...

1230
01:33:38,808 --> 01:33:40,845
Fuad...

1231
01:33:42,763 --> 01:33:44,641
What have you done?

1232
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,636
Fuad...

1233
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:52,632
What have you done?

1234
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:55,628
Fuad...

1235
01:34:50,724 --> 01:34:54,440
First squad! Flush against the houses!
Clear the rooms! Move!

1236
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:22,967
I'm Italian! I'm Italian!

1237
01:35:24,445 --> 01:35:26,003
I'm Italian!

1238
01:35:27,282 --> 01:35:33,315
I am Italian! I am Italian!

1239
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:36,471
Shut up, will you!

1240
01:35:36,671 --> 01:35:40,147
You've been shouting for days!

1241
01:35:41,146 --> 01:35:43,183
Let me sleep!

1242
01:35:44,262 --> 01:35:49,296
I am Italian. I am Italian.

1243
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:59,924
I am Italian! I am Italian!

1244
01:36:00,803 --> 01:36:05,038
I am Italian! I am Italian!

1245
01:36:05,917 --> 01:36:07,515
- You want a cigarette.
- No man.

1246
01:36:08,035 --> 01:36:09,313
Hey Pete, you want a cigarette?

1247
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:10,632
No thanks.

1248
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:15,786
I'm Italian!

1249
01:36:16,784 --> 01:36:18,582
I'm Italian!

1250
01:36:19,461 --> 01:36:21,419
I am Italian!

1251
01:36:22,698 --> 01:36:24,256
The poet.

1252
01:36:25,694 --> 01:36:27,013
I am Italian!

1253
01:36:43,114 --> 01:36:44,712
Good morning, I'm Italian.

1254
01:36:45,072 --> 01:36:48,867
I've got no papers,
they gave me this at the Consulate.

1255
01:36:52,383 --> 01:36:54,940
Attilio De Giovanni, that's me.

1256
01:36:58,136 --> 01:36:59,175
Thank you.

1257
01:37:03,330 --> 01:37:06,367
Come with me, nothing to worry about.

1258
01:37:06,766 --> 01:37:08,045
Nothing?

1259
01:37:08,564 --> 01:37:09,643
Just a check.

1260
01:37:23,332 --> 01:37:24,530
Attilio!

1261
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:26,488
See who's here, your attorney!

1262
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:31,043
They actually put me in prison!

1263
01:37:31,242 --> 01:37:33,640
Glad to help,
one night and I got you out, eh?

1264
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:36,756
See what your attorney does?

1265
01:37:37,395 --> 01:37:40,631
I'll drive you home.

1266
01:37:56,409 --> 01:37:59,565
This damned pollen,
it won't let me sleep at night.

1267
01:38:06,562 --> 01:38:08,121
But that's a zebra!

1268
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,919
Beautiful!

1269
01:38:10,758 --> 01:38:13,674
What's a zebra doing here?
That looks like an ostrich.

1270
01:38:14,433 --> 01:38:16,671
They've turned it into a zoo?

1271
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:19,707
Could be, there's a cop, ask him.

1272
01:38:21,106 --> 01:38:23,063
Officer, what's with the zebra?

1273
01:38:23,263 --> 01:38:27,818
There's even a monkey in my garden,
what's going on?

1274
01:38:28,018 --> 01:38:31,334
There's a fire at the circus, back up!

1275
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,360
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1276
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,707
- Open up!
- Rosa, let's go

1277
01:40:03,906 --> 01:40:06,423
I'm here!

1278
01:40:06,703 --> 01:40:10,259
- The door's locked.
- Why'd you always lock it?

1279
01:40:10,459 --> 01:40:12,536
I can't swim without my goggles.

1280
01:40:12,736 --> 01:40:15,693
- My red bathing cap?
- You always forget everything.

1281
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:22,125
Papa!

1282
01:40:22,285 --> 01:40:25,162
What a coincidence! Where've you been?

1283
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,158
Rosa too?

1284
01:40:29,237 --> 01:40:32,353
How pretty we are!

1285
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:35,670
- Where've you been?
- Me? Where have you been!

1286
01:40:35,949 --> 01:40:38,306
Mamma's round the back!

1287
01:40:38,706 --> 01:40:42,062
Mamma, Daddy's back!

1288
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:48,854
- Did you know Daddy was coming?
- No.

1289
01:40:49,094 --> 01:40:50,692
Are you happy?

1290
01:40:53,449 --> 01:40:55,606
I thought I'd give you a surprise.

1291
01:40:56,805 --> 01:40:58,363
I'm glad you did.

1292
01:40:58,883 --> 01:41:01,599
I've got a surprise for you, a great one.

1293
01:41:01,759 --> 01:41:03,677
We're going to be late for swimming.

1294
01:41:03,877 --> 01:41:05,675
Hang on!

1295
01:41:06,434 --> 01:41:07,672
Come here.

1296
01:41:08,232 --> 01:41:10,150
Mamma's looking well, isn't she?

1297
01:41:10,749 --> 01:41:13,466
Yes, but she was very sick,

1298
01:41:13,665 --> 01:41:15,264
she nearly died in Baghdad.

1299
01:41:15,823 --> 01:41:17,062
They don't know who saved her,

1300
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:19,778
some unknown Italian doctor,

1301
01:41:19,978 --> 01:41:21,496
a medical genius.

1302
01:41:29,367 --> 01:41:33,203
First he disappears then back
he comes when it suits him.

1303
01:41:33,403 --> 01:41:36,199
- Dreadful, isn't he?
- Yes, he is just dreadful.

1304
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:39,436
- You can't stand it any longer.
- Quite right.

1305
01:41:39,675 --> 01:41:41,913
- Can't live with someone like that.
- No.

1306
01:41:42,112 --> 01:41:44,470
So, you're madly in love with him?

1307
01:41:45,229 --> 01:41:46,148
Yes.

1308
01:41:46,707 --> 01:41:51,062
Open your eyes... two goldfinches.

1309
01:41:51,262 --> 01:41:54,378
- What do they do?
- Sing and fly.

1310
01:41:54,578 --> 01:41:56,416
Emilia and I got them in Perugia for you.

1311
01:41:57,535 --> 01:41:59,772
Beautiful, thanks.

1312
01:41:59,972 --> 01:42:01,330
I'll go and get the car.

1313
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:03,767
- I wanted to...
- Stop it!

1314
01:42:04,646 --> 01:42:07,243
Goodbye Papa!

1315
01:42:09,441 --> 01:42:09,960
Goodbye!

1316
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,677
I'll see lots of you later.

1317
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,470
Sorry, I'm a bit tired.

1318
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:21,667
- Something to drink?
- No, thanks.

1319
01:42:31,775 --> 01:42:35,051
It's lovely here, I haven't been here in a while.

1320
01:42:35,251 --> 01:42:37,049
How are the lectures?

1321
01:42:37,488 --> 01:42:38,447
Fine.

1322
01:42:41,883 --> 01:42:44,160
Nancy took off, you know.

1323
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:48,715
She went back to England for good,
just quit and left.

1324
01:42:49,474 --> 01:42:50,273
I'm sorry.

1325
01:42:50,433 --> 01:42:52,790
There hadn't been anything
for a long time.

1326
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:56,546
- I must say, you...
- I was upset.

1327
01:43:15,606 --> 01:43:18,083
- I'd rather not talk about it now.
- Nor me.

1328
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:25,514
The girls are beauties,
Emilia's just like you,

1329
01:43:25,714 --> 01:43:29,030
tough, takes things hard.

1330
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:31,507
I'd like to see more of them.

1331
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:34,264
So you should, you just disappeared.

1332
01:43:34,544 --> 01:43:37,340
The girls asked about you, then I was away.

1333
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:40,097
I haven't been very well,
I must take it easy.

1334
01:43:40,936 --> 01:43:44,612
It's a long story,
but I'll tell you some other time.

1335
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:48,847
I have very sad news through, Fuad's dead,

1336
01:43:49,047 --> 01:43:50,285
he killed himself.

1337
01:43:51,085 --> 01:43:54,001
- Maybe you read it.
- Yes, I know.

1338
01:43:59,315 --> 01:44:01,992
- How's the book going?
- I haven't finished it.

1339
01:44:07,505 --> 01:44:08,824
Here...

1340
01:44:16,255 --> 01:44:17,374
You know,

1341
01:44:17,574 --> 01:44:23,127
I still dream about us getting
married every night.

1342
01:44:23,886 --> 01:44:26,843
Even if we don't that's fine.

1343
01:44:27,043 --> 01:44:31,318
- What?
- Would you like another cushion?

1344
01:44:31,837 --> 01:44:33,196
No, thank you.

1345
01:44:40,188 --> 01:44:43,104
I'll go, get some rest.

1346
01:44:43,584 --> 01:44:50,336
I'll see you soon, tomorrow,
the day after, I'll come often.

1347
01:44:50,536 --> 01:44:53,133
- Stay if you'd like.
- No, you look tired.

1348
01:44:53,332 --> 01:44:55,210
Goodbye, Vittoria.

1349
01:45:04,999 --> 01:45:06,917
Sorry, I took the wrong...

1350
01:45:11,431 --> 01:45:12,630
My jacket...

1351
01:45:57,698 --> 01:45:58,856
The birds!

1352
01:46:23,628 --> 01:46:25,625
They sing and fly...

1353
01:46:30,699 --> 01:46:31,818
Bye.

1354
01:47:00,345 --> 01:47:05,659
You don't by any chance know
where I left the car, do you?
