00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,533
Are you connected
with the Koch Institute?

164
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,867
That's right.

165
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,567
Well, I envy you working
under one like Robert Koch.

166
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,467
It must be an inspiration.
He's such a great man.

167
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,867
- Indeed he is.
- Are you on diphtheria?

168
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,067
Just beginning.

169
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,633
Have you verified
the work done

170
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,467
At the Pasteur Institute?
Louis' experiments?

171
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,433
That's where
I'm about at the moment.

172
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,600
Well, if proven,
his contention will change

173
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:13,267
Our whole perception
of bacteriology.

174
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:17,267
True, so if you
realize that thing.

175
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,800
What department
are you in doctor?

176
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,400
Dermatology.

177
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,633
It's extraordinary
that you should be so...

178
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,900
Well informed
on the subjects

179
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,733
So far removed
from your own field.

180
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,533
Are you interested
in microscopic findings?

181
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,433
Well, I've been
experimenting with dyes.

182
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
The new anilines.

183
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,067
Trying various combinations
and their effect on cells.

184
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,067
If you'd care
to see some slides?

185
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,600
I'll be delighted.

186
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,300
- Extraordinary!
- Hm?

187
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,767
(Dr. Behring)
'The nuclei of the white
blood cells are deep blue.'

188
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,567
This is by far
the clearest picture

189
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,333
Of human blood
I've ever seen.

190
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,633
It seems the chemical
make-up of the nuclei

191
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,133
Has a special
affinity for this dye.

192
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,867
What do you mean affinity?

193
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,600
The attraction, certain atoms
possess for certain other atoms

194
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,400
Causes them to unite
and form compounds.

195
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,167
Most extraordinary.

196
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:10,567
A few minutes ago
I injected a living worm

197
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,633
With a dye I call
methylene blue.

198
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,200
It has an affinity
for the nerves of the worm.

199
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,267
The same phenomenon.

200
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,533
The whole nervous system blue.

201
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,100
It is blue, upon injection
into the blood stream

202
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,133
The dye circulated
to the worm's body.

203
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,867
It combined with the nerves.
The nerves and nothing else.

204
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,200
Wonderful!

205
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,767
It all depends upon discovering
the special dye which has

206
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,867
An affinity to the substance,
one which is to stain.

207
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,200
Specific staining.

208
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,967
Great heavens!
What about a microbe?

209
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,200
Do you think it'd be possible...

210
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:54,867
To stain a microbe
and nothing else on the slide?

211
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,400
It would be possible,
I think.

212
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,400
Then, this is very important.

213
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,633
I mean, really important.

214
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,800
Well, you... you make me
very happy.

215
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,500
- Goodnight, Dr...
- Ehrlich.

216
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:11,900
Ehrlich.

217
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,500
- Let's see each other soon.
- The sooner, the better.

218
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,667
Good morning. I must see
Professor Hartman right away.

219
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,467
You'll have to wait.
Dr. Wolfert is with him.

220
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:27,067
I hope you'll understand,
Herr geheimrat

221
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,067
That I wouldn't have spoken
in this way

222
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,800
If I hadn't considered
it absolutely necessary.

223
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:34,900
I have nothing against
Dr. Ehrlich personally.

224
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,967
Although, I must confess
to a certain feeling

225
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,067
Against people of his faith
in our profession.

226
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,100
I quite understand.

227
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,433
Thank you, Herr geheimrat.

228
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,567
Tell Dr. Ehrlich to come
here at once.

229
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:47,900
'Yes, herrgeheimrat.'

230
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,833
Good morning, herrgeheimrat.

231
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,867
'Ehrlich.'

232
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,467
I have an unusually long list

233
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,400
Of complaints about you
this morning.

234
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,067
First, in the case
of the patient Merk.

235
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,067
You disregarded the instructions
about the sweat baths.

236
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,700
Yes, sir.

237
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:12,667
'Second, you were wanted in
ward, and you were not there.'

238
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,333
Well, I was busy working
in the laboratory.

239
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
So Sensenbrenner informed me.

240
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,067
I have an idea or two

241
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,067
Which might to lead
to something, Herr geheimrat.

242
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,500
My staining experiments.

243
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:28,567
I am not interested
in your ideas and experiments.

244
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,400
I am only interested
in your conduct

245
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:33,667
As a member of the staff
of this hospital.

246
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,967
I want to know, are you
going to mend your ways?

247
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:41,900
Do you intend to fulfill duties
according to the regulations?

248
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,133
Tell me, Ehrlich?

249
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,867
Yes, Herr geheimrat.

250
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,467
I've been lenient with you.

251
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,667
Far too lenient.

252
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,867
But let me tell you this.

253
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:58,533
Any further breach
of discipline on your part

254
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,767
And your connection with this
hospital will be severed.

255
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,200
'That's all.'

256
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,267
'One moment.'

257
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,600
Listen to a word of advice
from an older man.

258
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,967
Men like you usually have
a very difficult time

259
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:23,600
In this world because they
do not know how to conform.

260
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,267
You must learn, Ehrlich.

261
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,167
It's conform or suffer.

262
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,600
Give number 11
his regular bromide.

263
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,600
Yes, Herr doctor.

264
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,900
Number 15 may sit up
for half an hour.

265
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,067
- That's all.
- 'Herr doctor.'

266
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,167
By the way, have we
plenty of bandages?

267
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,800
Yes, Herr doctor.

268
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,600
Kunze, look!

269
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,533
Look what just came.

270
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,400
An invitation to go to a meeting
at the Koch Institute.

271
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,733
That's wonderful!

272
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,133
However did you get it?

273
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,833
Through a Dr. Behring, one
of Koch's younger assistants.

274
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,933
It's for Friday evening.

275
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,400
Friday, you're on duty.

276
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,433
On duty?

277
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,100
Oh, yes, I'd forgotten.

278
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,367
What a pity!

279
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,967
Well, I'm going, no matter what.

280
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,067
This is too important.

281
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,067
- Use your head...
- No, I'm going.

282
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,067
You're finished
if the old man discovers...

283
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:25,233
He needn't. I'll find a way.

[Indistinct chattering]

285

(Dr. Behring)
'Dr. Ehrlich!'

286
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:46,833
I'll be delighted
to see you, Dr. Ehrlich.

287
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,233
It was very kind
of you to ask me.

288
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,467
Well, shall we go in?

289
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,133
Oh, wait.

290
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,967
Is the stout man with
the flower in his button hole

291
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,100
Professor Virchow.

292

Oh, yes, that's he alright.

293
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,567
The man he's talking to is
Althoff, Minister of Science.

294
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:02,767
- Althoff.
- Hm.

295
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,567
I've already succeeded
in getting the cabinet

296
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:06,900
To increase my budget
for scientific purposes

297
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,267
For next year.

298
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,567
- So, there's no way on that...
- Oh.

299
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,667
Huh!

300
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:12,767
Professor.

301
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,700
- What's the matter?
- Hartmann.

302
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,800
- Where?
- He mustn't see me.

303
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,833
- Why not?
- I'm not supposed to be here.

304
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,667
I'm supposed
to be at the hospital.

305
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,333
Oh.

306
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,500
We'll get seats
in the back. Follow me.

307
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,067
It has long been my belief

308
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:37,233
That tuberculosis is caused
by a living microbe.

309
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,067
And for the past several years

310
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,900
My work in the field
of bacteriology

311

Has been devoted to research

312

For such a microbe.

313
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,267
And today, I am able to announce

314
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,767
That the search has come
to a successful conclusion.

315
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,733
I have discovered
the cause of tuberculosis

316
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,933
In the sputum of persons

317

Suffering from this disease.

It is a living germ

Which, henceforth, I shall call

00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,433
Tubercle bacillus.

it with acid alcohol.

644
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,233
- I feel well.
- Let's show him his laboratory.

645
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,567
- I wanna thank you about that.
- Ah!

646
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:56,367
Why, you look younger
and stronger than ever.

647
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:59,067
- Thank you.
- Oh, go straight in.

648
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:01,133
Ah, it's your laboratory.

649
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,667
Go straight in.

650
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,133
If you will look
at the shelves

651
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,333
You will see every dyestuff
known to man.

652
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,100
Now, you can go ahead developing
new staining methods.

653
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,300
Aren't you happy, Paul?

654
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,100
Well, uh,
I-I'm deeply grateful, but...

655
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,133
If you don't mind
I would much rather

656
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,867
Not work with dyes
at present.

657
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,867
Indeed.

658
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:29,167
Well, in that case you
might join Behring

659
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:31,467
In his diphtheria experiments.

660
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:34,967
Oh, the number of new cases
is alarming.

661
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:39,533
Most alarming, it looks as
if we were in for an epidemic.

662
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,433
Well, I'm afraid, diphtheria is
not what I'm looking for either.

663
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,800
Then what in heaven
do you want to do?

664
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,533
Well, right now
I'd like to work on snakes.

665
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,700
Snakes?

666
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,333
I wanna test the effect
of various quantities of poison

667
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,800
On the animal organism.

668
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:02,833
I laughed at you before
and I was wrong.

669
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,067
If it is snakes
you want...

670
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,400
You shall have
your snakes.

671
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,167
Get three more snakes
and prepare them for me

672
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:21,633
To collect the venom.
These are depleted.

673
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,567
Every child that tried the
diphtheria serum on died.

674
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:46,300
Didn't work at all.

675
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,167
Yes, I heard this morning.

676
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:53,500
I can't figure it out, Paul.

677
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,667
"What went wrong?"
I keep asking myself.

678
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,267
I injected guinea pigs with
the serum and it cured them.

679
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:09,600
During months of experiments,
I gave diphtheria

680
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:13,100
To other animals
and the serum cured them.

681
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:17,067
Yesterday I tried it on
children, it didn't work.

682
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:19,867
Emil, forgive me, but I'm in the
middle of an experiment.

683
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:22,067
Another time I'll be
very happy to listen.

684
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:25,433
Another time? Perhaps,
all the children in the country

685
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,900
Would have choked
to death by then.

686
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,900
But of course, your experiment
whatever it may serve

687
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:32,533
To demonstrate comes first.

688
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,067
That's because it's yours!

689
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:35,833
Yours!
Dr. Ehrlich's very own.

690
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,400
You don't know what
you're saying.

691
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:40,200
On the other hand, the dying
children are not your own.

692
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:42,667
Steffi and Marianne have
not diphtheria yet.

693
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:45,300
But if the worst should come
and it sometimes does...

694
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,067
You'll find me
in my laboratory.

695
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,333
Emil, I believe I know
why you failed.

696
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,133
I'm in the middle
of an experiment.

697
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,233
When I was in Egypt, a man and
a boy were bitten by an adder.

698
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,100
The boy died horribly.
The man wasn't even made sick.

699
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm only interested
in diphtheria.

700
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,200
Now wait, Emil.
Here is the point.

701
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,067
Three times before this man
had been bitten, three times.

702
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,300
Each time the poison
had less effect.

703
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,433
These symptoms
became less and less severe.

704
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,067
Until this last time,
the man wasn't even made sick.

705
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:25,933
Immune?

706
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:28,067
Huh?

707
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:32,067
For weeks now, I've done
the same thing experimentally.

708
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:35,367
Injecting animals with gradually
larger doses of snake venom.

709
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,400
Until they were getting shots,
they would ordinarily

710
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:38,933
Kill a hundred
of their species.

711
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,100
Go on.

712
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:43,367
All of which proves that
immunity is not a quality

713
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:45,267
Of the blood as you think.

714
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,867
But it's, it's something
in the blood.

715
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:51,133
Specific substances
that they create.

716
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,167
Antibodies, so to speak.

717
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:56,933
A chemical army which destroys
invading microbes and poisons.

718
00:39:57,067 --> 00:40:00,333
Then my idea of imparting
resistance by transferring

719
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,133
Blood serum from
one animal to another...

720
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,900
Is absolutely right.

721
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,933
The reason that the method
failed with humans

722
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,533
Is because
the serum didn't contain

723
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,367
A sufficient number
of antibodies.

724
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,667
Now look, Emil.

725
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:13,867
Here.

726
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:16,000
This graph represents
the development

727
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,300
Of immunity
to snake venom.

728
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:23,133
It shows how you can increase
the quantity of antibodies

729
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,167
To neutralize any given
amount of poison.

730
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:29,100
- Well, then in diphtheria?
- Why not?

731
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:31,400
We've to store a sufficient
number of antibodies

732
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:35,200
In an animal by injecting it.
Not once but 10, 20, 30 times.

733

Then the blood
of a horse, perhaps.

Which has withstood 20
increasingly large doses

735

Of diphtheria toxin
would cure a child.

him to, he'll be very famous.

00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:12,067
- Good afternoon, Herr doctor.
- Good afternoon.

960
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:13,533
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

961
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,733
May I present our new
member, Dr. Wolfert.

962
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,467
We need no introduction.
Wolfert and I are old friends.

963
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:20,600
- Aren't we, Wolfert?
- Indeed.

964
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:23,067
And of course,
you know Herr Mittelmeyer.

965
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,433
How do you do, Herr Mittelmeyer?

966
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,167
Be seated, gentlemen.

967
00:55:28,267 --> 00:55:30,367
Have a cigar?

968
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:31,700
Thank you.

969
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:33,800
- They're excellent cigars.
- No, thank you.

970
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:36,600
- Wrapped in Havana.
- No, thank you.

971
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,833
Well, gentlemen,
what is your pleasure?

972
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,867
Would you care to look
around the institute?

973
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:43,667
First of all, we'd like to ask
a few general questions.

974
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:45,067
At your service.

975
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,500
Is it true, Herr doctor

976
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:48,300
That for some years
you've been working

977
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:51,500
To find a cure for a disease
that afflicts mice?

978
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:53,067
Yes, that's true.

979
00:55:53,067 --> 00:55:54,833
Why, may I ask?

980
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,167
It's not because
I am prompted by any special

981
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:58,467
Tenderness
toward a mice.

982
00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:01,233
Others look for ways
to get rid of mice.

983
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,900
But Dr. Ehrlich decorates the
walls of his rooms with them.

If the gentlemen would care
to look into the microscope...

snake-like objects

'They're the cause of the mouse
disease you just mentioned.'

their size and singular shape

My staining
the tubercle bacillus.

994
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:47,467
Well, following
the same idea of affinity

995
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:50,067
I compounded
an arsenic preparation.

996
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,233
Which when injected
in to the bloodstream

997
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,067
Combines with the microbe
and destroys it.

998
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,433
Like a magic bullet.

999
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,400
May I enquire
to what practical use

1000
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:00,900
You intend to put
this discovery?

1001
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:02,800
Well, I'm trying to find
magic bullets

Oh, in a reasonably
short time.

1007

Let's say, uh,
ten or fifteen years.

- But, doctor.
- Really, Herr doctor?

Ten or fifteen years, huh?

will still be with us then.

I see you're working with
rabbits, doctor, why?

Rabbits are better
for our purpose.

What is your purpose
here, Herr doctor?

1020
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,233
- To inject them.
- Inject them with what?

Uh, Dr. Hata,
what are you doing here?

To test the effect of
the chemicals on the microbes.

me this proofs for approval.

01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:55,867
And arsenic destroys
the trypanosomes

1116
01:02:55,933 --> 01:02:57,900
In the living bodies of mice.

1117
01:02:57,967 --> 01:02:58,967
Perhaps...

1118
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,633
I hardly dare say it.

1119
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:05,500
But it is possible
that one day

1120
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:08,067
In our cynical combination
will destroy the spirochaetes

1121
01:03:08,133 --> 01:03:09,633
In the living bodies of men.

1122
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:13,700
Herr professor,
today we are ready

1123
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:16,133
To show you the results
of the first test.

1124
01:03:17,733 --> 01:03:20,533
Here, they're all crazy.

1125
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,400
Yes, but they live,
that's the important thing.

1126
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,500
Only germ has been destroyed
in their bodies.

1127
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,967
That indicates
we're on the right track.

1128
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:30,767
Uh, Morgenroth, I want you
to draw a chart for me.

1129
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:33,067
I wish to record the progress
of our work.

1130
01:03:33,133 --> 01:03:36,600
Um, a chart, uh,
a chart like this.

1131
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,867
There.

1132
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:48,633
Now, we have two factors
to reckon with.

1133
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,067
The poisonous effects of our
preparation on the microbe.

1134
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,233
And the poisonous effects
on the cells of the body.

1135
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,067
Now, the preparation
we've just tested...

1136
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:01,867
We'll call that number one.

1137
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:04,233
Now, that is approximately
100 percent successful

1138
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,967
Against the microbe.

1139
01:04:06,067 --> 01:04:08,700
But, also it is approximately
100 percent poisonous

1140
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:12,800
To the cells of the body,
as the mice all went crazy.

1141
01:04:12,867 --> 01:04:14,467
Now, what we have to do

1142
01:04:14,533 --> 01:04:17,567
Is to keep our preparation
100 percent successful

1143
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:19,667
Against the microbe

1144
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:22,167
While reducing its poisonous
effects on the body...

1145
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,400
To zero.

1146
01:04:25,533 --> 01:04:27,700
When we have done that

1147
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:30,067
Then we shall have been
successful in our search

1148
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:31,200
For the magic bullet.

1149
01:04:32,533 --> 01:04:33,500
It would take...

1150
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,633
Oh, heaven knows how many...

1151
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,167
Hundred preparations
before we find it.

1152
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:42,500
But, we shan't stop
until we do.

1153
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:44,467
Herr professor,
Geheimrat Von Behring

1154
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:45,733
Is here to see you.

1155
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,767
I can't see anybody.
I'm much too busy.

1156
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:49,533
Wait. Who did you say?

Don't you remember me?
Hmm? He he.

1162
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,500
- Aah.
- What a surprise!

1163
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,133
What a wonderful surprise!

1164
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,667
I'm delighted to see you, Paul.
I really am.

1165
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:11,633
Well, how are you, Emil?

1166
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,567
No need to ask you that.
You're the picture of health.

1167
01:05:15,633 --> 01:05:18,900
- Well, what're you doing now?
- Oh, I'm up to my ears in work.

1168
01:05:18,967 --> 01:05:20,500
- Are you?
- I'm on something new.

1169
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:23,300
- Well, what is it this time?
- A cure for syphilis.

1170
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:24,700
You don't tell me.

1171
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:27,267
Come, I want to show you
all that I'm doing.

1172

You'll be amazed at the results
that we're getting.

Tell her I'm bringing
a guest to dinner.

1175

Oh, and tell her
to have potato pancakes.

1176
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:37,267
She'll know immediately.

Hedi's pancakes are the best,
the very best I ever tasted.

Well, I married her because
of her potato pancakes.

the cooking is good

Yeah, that's true,
I'm getting fat.

1187
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,300
But let me tell you.
My authority

1188
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:05,367
In scientific matters
has increased

1189
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:07,567
Inch by inch
with my waist line.

1190
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:09,400
So, I give my appetite
free rein.

1191
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:11,733
I wish Paul would do the same.

1192
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,933
He never will, missing meals
the way he does.

1193
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:18,567
Hedi talks about meals as
if they were railroad trails.

1194
01:06:18,633 --> 01:06:21,933
Well, Emil,
my home life's unbearable.

1195
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:24,733
Maybe, that's why I spend
so much time at the laboratory.

1196
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,300
Now that Steffi
and Marianne are married

And have homes of their own,
I'm the sole object

Of Hedi's passion for order.

Well, I have come to an age
where I have to be careful.

It profits you too, Paul,
to look after you're health.

Oh, I can't think
without a cigar in my mouth.

So? Why?

Well, Minister Althoff
has asked me to express

An opinion as of
the value of your work.

to grant your appropriation.

Of what I showed you
this afternoon?

Eventually all that
will be done away with.

Please do, doctor,
we're most interested.

Well...

1340

Nobody has ever
seen a molecule.

1341

that they look like this.

Let him alone. How am I
to understand otherwise?

1345
01:14:35,567 --> 01:14:38,567
Now, if we imagine the
molecules composing of microbes

1346
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:40,600
To look like this key hole...

1347
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:42,633
We can readily see that
any chemical molecule

1348
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,567
That's gonna combine with them
must be shaped like a key

Now, this is the basis
of my theory of affinity.

1351
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:57,833
So, after many years,
I discovered that arsenic

1352
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,867
Was the key
which fit in the molecules

1353
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:02,233
Of which
the microbe is composed.

1354
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,933
But it also fits the
molecules of which the brain

1355
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:06,400
And the nerves are composed.

1356
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:08,833
Now if you must shape
our key

1357
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,300
So that it fits
only the microbe.

That it might take

A young girl,
it would be a tragedy

to all such considerations.

from his broadest aspect.

1733

Whether or not that is the case
is of secondary importance.

01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:36.067
'Of passing
the disease onto others.'

1738
01:37:36,067 --> 01:37:38,300
And if there is no
transmission of infection

1739
01:37:38,367 --> 01:37:40,400
The disease must
necessarily die out.

1740
01:37:41,567 --> 01:37:46,667
True, 38 individuals
are dead from 606.

1741
01:37:46,733 --> 01:37:51,367
But those dead should be
thought of as sacrifices.

1742
01:37:51,433 --> 01:37:55,133
As martyrs, if you will,
to the public good.

1743
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:59,200
But if 10, if a 100 times
that many had fallen

1744
01:37:59,267 --> 01:38:02,067
I would still say,
it is all for the best.

1745
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:10,433
For through it,
and only through 606

1746
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:14,800
Can the fight against
this dread disease be won.

There are a few things
I want to talk over.

1757
01:40:02,167 --> 01:40:05,033
606 works, we know.

1758
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,267
The magic bullet
will cure thousands.

1759
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,700
The principle
upon which it works

1760
01:40:15,767 --> 01:40:18,067
Will serve against
other diseases.

1761
01:40:19,633 --> 01:40:22,433
Many others I think.

1762
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,867
But, there can be
no final victory

1763
01:40:26,933 --> 01:40:30,467
Over diseases of the body

1764
01:40:30,533 --> 01:40:34,800
Unless the diseases
of the souls are also overcome.

1765
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,100
They feed upon each other.

1766
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:44,200
Diseases of the body,
diseases of the soul.

In days to come

epidemics of... greed...

Hate, ignorance.

1770
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,567
We must fight them in life

never stop fighting.
