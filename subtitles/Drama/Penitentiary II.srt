1
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,111
Declare all valuables to Customs.

2
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,575
Items undeclared will be
confiscated plus a 1000% fine.

3
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,782
{\an1}Fei-hung, declare the
ginseng to Customs.

4
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:10,097
Dad, we've to pay at least
a duty of 50 yuan.

5
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,373
- Here.
- Right.

6
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,306
Let's pass by hiding
it inside our pants.

7
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:20,462
They won't search him,
taking it for hernia only.

8
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,348
The idea...

9
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,111
- Outrageous, outrageous!
- It won't work.

10
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,723
You've got nothing but lousy ideas.

11
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:30,023
The Northern Army has imposed
heavy duties. That's most unfair.

12
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,065
Nothing in this world is fair.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,317
One traveling must avoid
as much as possible.

14
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:35,760
Declare it.

15
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,548
- What's going on?
- Who's he?

16
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,823
Don't you know British
Consul is privileged?

17
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:55,898
You don't pay duties if
you become a Consul.

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,424
He's lucky.

19
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:20,648
- What the hell are you up to?
- He was knocked down.

20
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,598
Please, sir, I apologize.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,598
Why have you given away
such a big ginseng?

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,848
To avoid tax!
I'll get it back in a minute.

23
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,748
- Let me have another fall then.
- What?

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,876
By putting everything in,
I don't have to pay tax.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,898
What's wrong with him.

26
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,891
Epilepsy. Tso, get up!

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,119
File in!

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,487
- Dad, I'll pay tax in front.
- Take care.

29
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:07,027
Catch it, master.

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,494
Good, there they are.

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,949
Easy, easy.

32
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,226
Be careful. You'll crush everything.
That's good.

33
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,184
Hold it.

34
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,481
Fei-hung!

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,682
Fei-hung, don't chase him!

36
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:42,399
Fei-hung, remember what I've taught you.

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,723
You can't win over a local boy.

38
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,623
Don't chase a desperate
thief, understand?

39
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,923
But he's stole your money.

40
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,773
Forget it, as there's no loss.

41
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,798
Remember, the important
thing in life is...

42
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,348
Forgive while you can.

43
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,902
- Remember it.
- I forgot.

44
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,473
Checkmate!

45
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,798
Again.

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,098
A man shouldn't renege.

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,298
- How should I move now?
- Try it again.

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,998
Think, think it over.

49
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,298
Dad, look, many trees.

50
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,123
That tree's big!

51
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,199
Already gone.

52
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:41,623
Come on.

53
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,223
Can I concede the loss?

54
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,898
- Use your brains.
- What? Can't move now.

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,835
Ready? Catch!

56
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,399
Are you okay?

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,885
I'll take care of it.

58
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,248
I'm sorry, sir.

59
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,173
Young man, be careful in playing ball.

60
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,749
Thank you.

61
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,946
- Have you thought it over?
- Come on.

62
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,399
What's this?

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,936
It's called cheating.

64
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,185
Dad, you don't like this. Let me go
down to buy roast chicken for you.

65
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,198
Just wait. A vendor
will come in a minute.

66
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,523
No, we must go down to get
a nice roast chicken.

67
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:09,398
Right, right.

68
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,203
You yearn for a chance to move around.

69
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,948
Why make an excuse?

70
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,164
- Go then.
- Go, go.

71
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,098
Hey!

72
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,194
You two stay out of trouble!

73
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,288
Be sure to come right back!

74
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,889
God, do you believe
the smell of this place?

75
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,642
I think I'm gonna be sick.

76
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,949
Hey!

77
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,420
It's like another world.

78
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,913
I like it.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,473
This is first class.

80
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,123
The number of foreigners speaks for it.

81
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,699
What are you doing?

82
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,598
Looking for a friend.

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,498
- Could you possibly have friends here?
- Yeah, yeah, we do.

84
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,348
Yes.

85
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,998
- You mustn't go in anyway.
- Can't we just have a look?

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,999
No. Go away!

87
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,631
One more time,
and you're off the train.

88
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:16,248
- Master, what now?
- I got an idea.

89
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:30,515
- Master, the next step?
- Just watch me.

90
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,549
Go!

91
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,389
They've gone wild!

92
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,619
Get him!

93
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,503
Sorry.

94
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,599
Hey!

95
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,617
I'm sure I saw him come this way.

96
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,199
Hey, stop!

97
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:37,324
Halt!

98
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,290
Wait. Why you hit--?

99
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,698
Traitor.

100
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,699
What?

101
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,448
Next time, I cut your throat.

102
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,499
Traitor.

103
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,884
Hey, don't run. Listen!

104
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,854
First, I'm not a traitor. Second...

105
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,095
- I've already conceded to you.
- Who cares? I won't lose.

106
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,623
You mule, what do you want?

107
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,698
Simple, just apologize to me.

108
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,748
Apologize to you?

109
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,471
How dare you call me a traitor.

110
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,567
Okay. Sorry.

111
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,119
And let me box you on the ear.

112
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,299
Ducking? Again.

113
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,925
You must be kidding me.

114
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,449
Let's make this fair.

115
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,395
- Ready?
- Ready!

116
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,932
Drunken boxing.

117
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,728
Sure, you think I'm getting dizzy?

118
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,401
OK, come on.

119
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,018
- Come on.
- Come on.

120
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,399
Come on.

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,891
Well, wait till you get sober first.

122
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,587
I show you! Tiger slash at bear!

123
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,307
What do you call that one?

124
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,337
It's called "Turtle holding wine barrel."

125
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,315
Fairies Littering Petals.

126
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,496
Eagle grabs the rabbit!

127
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,652
Drunk plays the flute?

128
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,212
And this one?

129
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,432
Nursing a hangover.

130
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,892
Okay.

131
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,452
Don't worry, stand up.

132
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,073
Your Kung Fu is pretty good.

133
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:33,623
Young man, you're not too bad yourself,

134
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,854
but that drunken boxing was...

135
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:37,498
faultless?

136
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,398
Basically, it's slow,
and you have no power.

137
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,401
It's pathetic.

138
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,146
What?

139
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,683
I can defeat any Kung Fu.
I show you power.

140
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,398
You're running out of time.

141
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,204
I'm young and strong.
I've lots of time.

142
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,190
The train's leaving.

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,917
Nice try, old man,
but now you're going to get it.

144
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,249
Come back here!

145
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,099
The train!

146
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,396
Wait for me!

147
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,336
Come on, give me your hand.

148
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,698
Thank you.

149
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,244
Get what you were after?

150
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,999
Ginseng?

151
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,924
Get up, all of you!

152
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,681
Gather your luggage for inspection.

153
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,800
Hurry up! Move!

154
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,198
Everyone, now. Come on.

155
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,542
You. Wake up.

156
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,573
Good morning.

157
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,198
What are you doing?

158
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,224
Something has been stolen,
so everyone has to be searched.

159
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:02,759
Guard.

160
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,299
Search them.

161
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,589
Open your luggage, be quick!

162
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,699
Hurry up.

163
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,144
- What's this?
- Lingtzu.

164
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,540
Bear gall.

165
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,671
What's that? Show me.

166
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,507
- Open that.
- This one?

167
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:27,698
What's that?

168
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,602
- Fried yak.
- Okay, next.

169
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,999
Now the other box. Come on.

170
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,598
That box...

171
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,398
Not that. That.

172
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,736
Let me see that one.

173
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,123
- Not that one.
- That box?

174
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:43,649
- Which one?
- On the seat between you.

175
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,298
Now!

176
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,678
He means the ginseng.
He wasn't hiding it.

177
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,399
Open it.

178
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,978
Open that box!

179
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,431
They're clearly physicians from Hunan.
Why don't you give them a break, huh?

180
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,442
Who are you?

181
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,169
Show me your papers.

182
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,706
Sir, my apologies.

183
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,801
He's with Counterintelligence.

184
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,598
He's with the central government.

185
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,799
Better not challenge his authority.

186
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,098
Check the next compartment.

187
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,716
- Search up there.
- Next car.

188
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,598
This young man's quite capable.

189
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,248
Fei-hung, follow his example.

190
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,194
Put aside the ginseng.

191
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,643
You said the jade seal's missing?

192
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,822
The Emperor's jade seal is like
the crown of England. Understand?

193
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,953
Everything combined here is not as valuable.
The British Empire's premier is my friend.

194
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,199
I promised to put the jade
seal symbolizing the power

195
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,399
of Chinese Emperor into
the London Museum of Art.

196
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,168
I don't care how you do it.

197
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,370
I want it back.

198
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,398
Sir, I know who's taken it.

199
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,399
Find him!

200
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,499
John,

201
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,273
The workers at the steel factory
refuse to work at night.

202
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,216
Anything you can do about it?

203
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,698
Don't worry.

204
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,498
I know just what to do in this situation.
I promise you'll have no more trouble.

205
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Go then.

206
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,819
Ancestors be blessed.

207
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,438
All of a kind!

208
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,398
Thank you, Patriarch.

209
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,209
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on, pay up.

210
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,627
Quickly. We haven't got all day.

211
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:02,449
For treatment tell him
to see Luk-Ah-choi.

212
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,422
Come on.

213
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,398
My luck's beat you all.

214
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,002
One make leads to a series of others.

215
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,522
She wins every time.

216
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,099
Madam?

217
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,500
Master's back.

218
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,844
Good, why fuss?

219
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,354
Master's back!

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,866
Master.

221
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,176
What's taken you so long?

222
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,821
I didn't hear you from inside.

223
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,895
Master, you're back.
Any hardship on the journey?

224
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,199
No, no.

225
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,896
Mother, no mahjong?

226
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,506
Nonsense!

227
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,644
I told you repeatedly not
to treat when I am out.

228
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,398
Master, you preached a
doctor's parental love too.

229
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,948
I couldn't stand by doing
nothing about a dying person.

230
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,550
If I did, you'd blame me.

231
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,198
Have they lost much?

232
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,267
Yes.

233
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,028
Perhaps I should examine them.

234
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,898
It's a female problem.
I can handle it.

235
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,268
Fei Hung, would you
prepare my altar for me?

236
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,879
Wash your hands before you do it.

237
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,023
Don't laugh.

238
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,548
- Get a ladder for him to do it.
- Yes.

239
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,675
- Did you water the plants regularly?
- Yes, master.

240
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,099
Mother.

241
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,499
The chips.

242
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,149
Fei-hung.

243
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,453
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

244
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,249
The altar.

245
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,248
Get up. Go now, go.

246
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,881
- This is mine.
- It's mine, it's on my chair!

247
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:12,224
What are you doing?

248
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,999
Behave yourself.

249
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,064
Remember to come again for treatment.

250
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:27,823
- Mr. Chan.
- Madam Wong.

251
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,502
- Is Master Wong back?
- Yes, he's inside.

252
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,023
Any news about my ginseng?

253
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,167
Did he get it?

254
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:34,798
He must've got it. This way, please.

255
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,100
Master, Mr. Chan's here to get the ginseng.

256
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,748
Mr. Chan, you've come...

257
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,948
To get the ginseng?

258
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,148
What are you doing?

259
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,148
- I'm going in to get the ginseng.
- Yes. Go quick.

260
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,198
Mr. Chan, I've bought you a big ginseng.

261
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,629
Sit a while. Let's chat
after I've serve incense.

262
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,474
{\an3}Sorry for the trouble.

263
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,598
{\an1}Mr. Chan, let me bring
you a cup of tea.

264
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,832
{\an3}Good, thank you.

265
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,749
Where're you going?

266
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,098
If master knows the ginseng's lost,
I'll be finished.

267
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,099
- You won't.
- Fei Hung.

268
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,773
- What are you two doing?
- Step-mom, come here.

269
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:04,112
We're finished.

270
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,698
We're in such trouble.
The ginseng was replaced on the train.

271
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:09,798
Tso, you're finished.

272
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,948
Look. Step-mom, what shall we do now?
Do something.

273
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,373
Fei Hung!

274
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,248
Coming!

275
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,098
Go and get a cup
of tea for Mr. Chan.

276
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,345
- Go! I'll think of something.
- What? I'll leave it up to you two.

277
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,222
He gets the tea. What about me?

278
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,982
Okay, you see what's behind me?

279
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,138
- A staircase.
- And above the stairs?

280
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,579
- The medicine storehouse.
- And inside the storehouse?

281
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,198
- A box.
- And inside it?

282
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,598
Another ginseng. I can't believe it!

283
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,973
It's poison.

284
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,323
- What for?
- For you.

285
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:36,199
Oh, no, madam,
please don't tease me this way!

286
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,199
Who's teasing?

287
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,152
- I have your tea, Mr. Chan.
- Thank you.

288
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,661
Enjoy.

289
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,198
Father, you must be very hot.
Let me help you.

290
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,199
Mr. Chan.

291
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,323
- You...
- It's real.

292
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,086
A rare genus of super quality
appears only once in a blue moon.

293
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:17,752
Just put it in boiling water. After taking it,
you're assured of potency and youth.

294
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,988
Why have you brought a carrot?

295
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,174
What?

296
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,735
This is a carrot?

297
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,603
You mean it isn't ginseng?

298
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:28,834
No.

299
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,824
Of course it isn't ginseng.

300
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:33,398
What I meant to tell you was that
you should stay away from carrots,

301
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,895
especially big ones like this one,
while you're taking ginseng.

302
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,391
Don't take it within three months
after taking ginseng. Understand?

303
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,374
Excuse me.

304
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:45,320
Mr. Chan,

305
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,382
I'm glad she remembered
to tell you about that.

306
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,048
You know, most people don't realize
that when you use ginseng...

307
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,046
you should avoid the use of carrots,
because they're not a good mix.

308
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,023
Why doesn't it look like it?

309
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,092
- I didn't see it.
- Nor did I.

310
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,170
I didn't see it either.

311
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,581
Fei-hung, what are you doing?

312
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,358
- Good luck, now.
- Step-mom, does it look like it?

313
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,848
Oh, yeah, it looks just like it.

314
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,987
Where did you find it?

315
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,147
Father's bonsai tree.

316
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,048
What a great idea.
Just blame it on Tso.

317
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,049
Okay.

318
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,619
I'll try to keep your father distracted.

319
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,703
What do you think of this?

320
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:27,288
- Boy, that looks great.
- Of course.

321
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,614
Excuse me. May I have a word?

322
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:33,074
Just a second.

323
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:34,424
Of course.

324
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,064
- What is it, dear?
- Come on, come over.

325
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:44,198
- Why are you acting so furtively?
- I want to consult you on something.

326
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,798
Fei-hung's grown now,
he must be lonesome.

327
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,627
- What then?
- Do you feel that...

328
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,248
Mr. Chan, your ginseng.

329
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,132
Still wet?

330
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:54,861
Just unearthed, Mr. Chan.

331
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,750
My dad got it hard.
He said it's wild ginseng.

332
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:02,473
It's to be taken only after being put
in a rice container for three days.

333
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:06,298
- To bring him a small brother or sister?
- No hurry, let's talk about it later.

334
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,704
Why not? Your master Lu
Ah-choi's birthday is coming.

335
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,898
It's just passed.

336
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,048
He'll have his birthday
again next year.

337
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,535
- Honey, not now. Mr. Chan--
- No, no. We're not finished.

338
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,697
Okay. Roll it up tight to keep it nice
and fresh and close to your heart.

339
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,498
Remember what I told you.

340
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,398
And don't forget tomorrows
fund-raising assembly.

341
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,399
Master Wong.

342
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,340
- I must take my leave.
- Have you seen the ginseng?

343
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:31,298
Just fine. I'll keep it inside.

344
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,573
- Let me see you out.
- Let Fei Hung do it.

345
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:36,073
- Mrs. Wong, bye-bye.
- I can show you. Please, this way.

346
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,923
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

347
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:42,099
The Militia want you to be their coach.
They ask if you're interested.

348
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,998
- I've already given them my answer.
- I know you did.

349
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,824
Step-mom. Mr. Chan has left.

350
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,648
What do you want to tell me?

351
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,449
I need your advice.

352
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,148
Are we to ask for a 30-years
deposit in advance?

353
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,223
Forget it. You're tired.
Talk about it tomorrow.

354
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,798
- Yes, Father. Please go in and retire.
- How long am I going to live?

355
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,348
Frankly, if they do pay
you a 30-year deposit,

356
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,981
that's a good thing.

357
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:04,823
Hey, why do you make that look?

358
00:25:04,825 --> 00:25:06,523
Because I'm afraid he'll find the tree.

359
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,464
Don't be silly. Throw the pot away.

360
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,375
- One more thing.
- What's it?

361
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,036
What happens when Mr. Chan drinks
the tea made from those roots?

362
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:17,514
Let's wait till he is sick.

363
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,135
Wish he could really
wait for three days.

364
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,598
All right, that's it for me.

365
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,598
See you tomorrow.

366
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,546
Deliver the coffee
before ringing the bell.

367
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,948
Fo Sang, my stove's going out. Stoke it.

368
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,106
Just a minute.

369
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,732
Stand back.

370
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,598
That was great. Thanks for the light.

371
00:25:50,602 --> 00:25:52,125
It's almost quitting time.

372
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,754
After this, I ought to.

373
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,699
Off now.

374
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,349
Hey!

375
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,699
Get them back to work.

376
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,989
- But why?
- Go!

377
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,942
I'm the new foreman.
Now ring the bell.

378
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,799
Go on.

379
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,398
Hey, Fo Sang,

380
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,498
what the hell you doing now?

381
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,598
- Yeah, what are you, out of your mind?
- Yeah!

382
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,599
He is...

383
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,379
The new foreman told me to do it.

384
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,698
The new foreman?

385
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,999
Well,

386
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,398
we seem to have fallen
behind this month,

387
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,848
so everybody works the
night shift for one month.

388
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,684
What? One month?

389
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,380
Hey, guys, hold on.

390
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,723
So, let's say we work all
those overtime hours for you,

391
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:02,060
then we need overtime pay.

392
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:05,273
Quiet.

393
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,723
You give us no choice.

394
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,583
You either work the overtime,
or we close the steel mill down,

395
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:13,923
and you'll all be without jobs.
Now, you can take it or leave it.

396
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:17,048
Mr. Smith, you can't
blackmail us anymore.

397
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,687
We worked hard for you, and now
we've had enough! We quit!

398
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,167
Hey! Hold it!

399
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,298
Nobody is to leave.

400
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,298
You'll stay and work.

401
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,489
Do you understand that?

402
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:33,748
You can take my job,
but you can't run my life!

403
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,638
You think you can make us?
Who you think you are? Let's go!

404
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,253
- Don't move!
- You're in our way!

405
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:48,727
Back to work, you hear me?

406
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,468
That's enough!

407
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,243
Keung!

408
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,574
Everyone up! Back to work!

409
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,157
Henry, you're great!

410
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,423
You see? He's very persuasive.

411
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:18,103
They have to work.

412
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,217
You go on with practice.

413
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,698
It's bloody impossible
to sleep with all this noise.

414
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,848
Why don't we just buy it
and have it bulldozed?

415
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,994
The land is owned by Po Chi Lam gym.
He just won't sell.

416
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,198
Damn it! I must get rid of him!

417
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,199
Yes, sir.

418
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,898
Fun, are you tired working alone?
Why not let someone help you?

419
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,906
Don't you agree?

420
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,596
Getting help, huh?

421
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,598
No woman dares to kill snakes like I do.

422
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,298
And I can't afford to
pay wages to a man.

423
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,498
So I prefer to be alone.

424
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,798
Right you are.

425
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,446
But seriously now, Fun,

426
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,166
But a woman may suffer
without the care of a man.

427
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:42,298
Hey, Fun, why not let me teach you
Kung Fu to protect yourself?

428
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,900
How about drunken boxing?

429
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,198
What good is it? It can't fight.

430
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,723
Come to Sha Min tonight and I'll
teach you Tsai Li Fu boxing!

431
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:53,672
I prefer drunken boxing.

432
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,596
What you looking at?
Get back to work.

433
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,655
How much you want?

434
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,257
We've got customers waiting.
They need the help now.

435
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,697
Drunken boxing beat Tsai Li Fu?
Nonsense!

436
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,299
Hey, Master Tsang.

437
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,349
Wong Fei-hung?

438
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,341
A fillet of salmon and a
pound of fish maw, okay?

439
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,034
Which half?

440
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,123
Snake gall good for the eyes,
suits elderly persons best.

441
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,340
- Hey, Fun...
- boil snake soup...

442
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,849
Fei Hung! Hi!

443
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,424
Oh, it's getting away.

444
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,398
- Never mind. What can I get you?
- Three snake galls and one pheasant.

445
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,882
I've already reserved them for you.

446
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,049
Thank you.

447
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,712
Which half do you want?

448
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,773
It makes no difference.

449
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,298
Fei-hung, I hear your
drunken boxing is the best.

450
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,148
Thank you.

451
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,298
Would you be able to teach me?

452
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,299
Of course.

453
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,849
Hey!

454
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,548
I won't mince fish today.

455
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,848
I'll do it at home myself.

456
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,338
How about later with that?
We're discussing drunken boxing.

457
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,598
Fei Hung, when will you
teach me drunken boxing?

458
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,998
What good is drunken boxing?
It's so sissy.

459
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,098
Wong Fei-hung, you've spoken the truth.

460
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,700
Why don't you ask Tsan
to teach you Tsai Li Fu?

461
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,648
What good is your Tsai Li Fu?

462
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,823
At least it's better
than drunken boxing?

463
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,098
Never mind him, Fei-hung.

464
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,598
When will you teach
me drunken boxing?

465
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,382
Fun, don't you prefer
Tsai Li Fu to drunken boxing?

466
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,598
Pupils, don't you agree?

467
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,336
- Yes.
- Sure.

468
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,398
It depends on who's the master.

469
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,875
What do you say to
a challenge, then?

470
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,999
Out of my way.

471
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:43,799
Wong Fei-hung, if I lose, I'll pay for
the fish and fish head you bought today.

472
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,299
- Tsan, isn't that a deal?
- Yes, it's a deal!

473
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,498
Master Tsan, I'm afraid
I may hurt the passers-by.

474
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,514
Let them be the witness then.

475
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,048
Attention, everybody!

476
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:06,317
I, fishmonger Tsan, will have a fight
with Wong Fei-hung. Be our witness.

477
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:08,474
Come on.

478
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,255
Don't worry, just a token fight.
Go ahead.

479
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,003
Why don't you use drunken boxing?

480
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:19,404
Good! Great, Fei-hung, you've won.

481
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:23,258
No, I drew with Master Tsan.
I think Tsang Sang would agree.

482
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,749
It's not over yet!

483
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,948
Coming. Step-mom wants me.

484
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,701
Excuse me. My Step-mom wants me.

485
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,149
Fei Hung!

486
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:36,473
Your fish.

487
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,640
- What do I owe you?
- It my treat.

488
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,974
Thank you.

489
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,799
All right now. It's a draw.
Buy anything you want. Go.

490
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,173
Getting your food free?
Didn't you fight?

491
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:50,998
No.

492
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You may get the hell from
dad again if you did.

493
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,098
How can we afford
to replace the ginseng?

494
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,318
Just sell my diamond
necklace from your dad.

495
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,223
- No way.
- Why not?

496
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:02,298
We'll be in big trouble if Mr. Chan
decides to brew that tree root.

497
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,358
- You would do that?
- Just remember, you owe me one.

498
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,531
He's the man we're looking for.

499
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,148
Stay close to him while I go
and get the boss, okay?

500
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,149
Yes, sir.

501
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,398
Wong Kei-ying sells his wife's
jewelry only in emergency.

502
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,248
- Try to cut down the price, understand?
- Look, I'm late already.

503
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,902
- I'll see you later.
-  Let's go, okay?

504
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,298
Is the drought so serious?

505
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,298
The province is known for infertility.

506
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,623
There's no harvest and no rainfall.
How can it not be serious?

507
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:41,023
My friend told me one whole family
there shares one pair of pants only.

508
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,454
Who wears it then?

509
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,198
If you have to go outside,
you wear the pants.

510
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,298
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

511
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,698
- It's all right. How are you?
- Good to see you.

512
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,348
Fei Hung, don't you think
we should be going?

513
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,123
Aren't you meeting my wife for tea?

514
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,623
Oh, no, not mahjongg again.

515
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,523
How can you say that?

516
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,423
It's our fund-raising meeting,
and you were supposed to remind me.

517
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:03,598
Oh, I forgot. I'll try to
get a donation from Tsan.

518
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,598
Go quick, don't keep them waiting.

519
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,522
- Of course. You're right.
- Nice talking to you.

520
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,331
Don't arouse trouble.

521
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,499
I won't.

522
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,299
Get the others.

523
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:20,298
It's been called to our attention

524
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,848
that Master Wong needs us
to lend him some money.

525
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,802
Good. This...

526
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:27,548
Since Po Chi Lam's in trouble, we must
answer Master Wong's request for donation.

527
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,360
Please don't misunderstand.
The donation is not for Po Chi Lam.

528
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,273
It's for the relief of draught victims.

529
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:36,861
The donation goes to whoever's in trouble.
We're all Chinese, right?

530
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:39,477
- Nothing right now.
- Okay.

531
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,598
You better not have said anything,
you understand?

532
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,698
- I won't say a word.
- I won't tell a soul.

533
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,268
- Besides, she's the one that talks a lot.
- Like you don't?

534
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,048
How dare you say that?
I only told my sister--

535
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,656
Chiu doesn't even know I came here.

536
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,298
Ladies, somebody has been talking.

537
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,498
They always lie to me.
Look at their faces.

538
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,298
- Now, that's enough.
- Can't we just take a look?

539
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,098
- Let's see.
- There.

540
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,079
It's beautiful!

541
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,448
Oh, don't handle it like that.

542
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,198
And I'm only borrowing the money.
You're going to have to give it back to me.

543
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,998
I know, I know. I understand.
Come on. Show it to us.

544
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,999
Here.

545
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:23,398
So did you get it?

546
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,199
No. I haven't actually seen it,
but I'm sure they have it.

547
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,098
Well, we can't waste any more time.

548
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,904
Grab the seal,
and we'll meet you out front.

549
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,349
Okay.

550
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:33,623
Okay, grab it, and I'll see you outside.

551
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:38,219
- Listen, don't wear it to show off.
- Don't worry, I'll enjoy it at home only.

552
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,398
- What's wrong?
- Thief!

553
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,999
You've got to learn to speak up.

554
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,381
Thief! Thief!

555
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,040
Wait here.

556
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,299
Leave it.

557
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,034
Fei-hung, over there.

558
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,498
You better run.

559
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,848
Fei-hung, great, you've got it back!

560
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,112
My dear son!

561
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,398
- Hey, Fei Hung.
- Fat, hello.

562
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,399
Great!

563
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,764
- What's this?
- You bumped me.

564
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,449
Sorry.

565
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,092
Sorry's not good enough.

566
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,714
- What do you want then?
- Kneel down and kowtow to say 'sorry'.

567
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,158
- What? You're crazy.
- Hold it!

568
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,348
You were in on it.
I saw the whole thing.

569
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,898
Mind your own business, bitch.

570
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,773
Who you calling bitch?

571
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:01,298
You couldn't escape our attention.
You exchanged eyes with that man.

572
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,155
You look wretched
even in a foreign suit.

573
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:05,515
Wait--!

574
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,348
Step-mom, are you all right?

575
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,629
I want this guy's ass!

576
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,648
Step-mom, you'll be okay.

577
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,284
She wants to fight?
We'll take on both of you.

578
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,578
What? You're going to start this again?

579
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,398
- What'd you say?
- I said, kick his ass!

580
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,335
- You want me to go kick--
- You will, or I will.

581
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,222
- What happened to your mouth?
- I'm all right.

582
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:38,334
The necklace is inside.
It's going to be ruined!

583
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:42,388
Fei Hung! Throw it over here!

584
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:43,320
Catch!

585
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,473
- Where'd he learn to do that?
- Oh, look at that!

586
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:57,898
Po Chi Lam.

587
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,398
- His drunken boxing is terrific.
- It's a superb!

588
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,498
How's drunken boxing? Show me.

589
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,998
Ask him!

590
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,150
All right.

591
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,885
Whatever you want. Fei Hung!

592
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,998
Fei-hung, teach them a
lesson with drunken boxing.

593
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,336
- What about Father?
- I'll take care of him.

594
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,298
Besides, it will be great
publicity for the school.

595
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,638
- Your dad will be happy.
- Okay.

596
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,976
Drunken boxing!

597
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,736
What the hell's wrong with you?
The four of you can't beat one man?

598
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:40,874
Get him!

599
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,798
- Is this drunken boxing?
- I think so.

600
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,448
- Not bad.
- Excellent!

601
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,823
- Not too powerful.
- Just so-so.

602
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:01,873
Hey, you don't understand.

603
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,599
Come on.

604
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,589
- Hold it quick!
- Take as much as you can carry.

605
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,748
Hey, who's going to pay for that?

606
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,335
- Charge it to Mrs. Wong's account.
- All right, then.

607
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,626
- They're fighting over there.
- Go over quick!

608
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,707
- Hey, where'd they go?
- Over there, I think.

609
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,198
- I'm going to call the police.
- Don't call the police.

610
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,389
Fei-hung, catch!

611
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,873
Dad won't let me drink!

612
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:42,531
I will. You're finished if you're
beaten and your gym ruined.

613
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,629
Here you go, white wine, red wine.

614
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,797
- Can your son drink it adult rated?
- why not? It adds to the strength.

615
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,491
Are you all right?

616
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,612
One more drink would be helpful.

617
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,417
A little bit. Give it to me. Catch!

618
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:56,738
Get up!

619
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,147
What the hell was that?

620
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,109
What does it mean when
there's a picture of a skull?

621
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,349

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,247
Hold this. Fei Hung!

645
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,457
- Fei Hung!
- God on Birthday Celebration!

646
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,403
Oh, no!

647
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,810
Have you been drinking?

648
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,822
You stop it right now!

649
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:54,157
- I'm your father!
- Father?

650
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,918
You have the cutest little nose.

651
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,948
Great father and son.

652
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,639
- How are you, Dad?
- Fighting again!

653
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,199
Fighting?

654
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,073
- What's going on?
- You should come earlier.

655
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:16,798
Fei-hung fought brilliantly.

656
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,246
The thugs snatched Fa's diamond
necklace from Mrs. Wong.

657
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,049
{\an1}With the little money from you,
I couldn't buy it.

658
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,049
{\an3}Why did you sell the diamond necklace?

659
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,023
Master, why hide Po Chi
Lam's financial trouble?

660
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:29,098
Why raise funds under
the pretext of relief?

661
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,511
Po Chi Lam doesn't need money.

662
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,900
You can take charge
of the funds we raised.

663
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,523
Stop drinking!

664
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,149
Mrs. Wong.

665
00:45:42,175 --> 00:45:43,174
I said stop it!

666
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,348
- Master Wong, let's help him back.
- Step-mom, fetch me another bottle.

667
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,298
- Let me help you.
- Step-mom, fetch me another bottle.

668
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,636
Why are you standing there?

669
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,298
- Go home.
- Yes, master.

670
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,768
- Do as he says. All right.
- Let's go.

671
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,155
See you.

672
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,864
Where's he going?

673
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,450
Go on. Follow him!

674
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,199
Losers.

675
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:09,913
You didn't do any better.

676
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,776
You meant to tell on me?
You meant to tarnish our image.

677
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:20,284
You brat! Now everybody thought I raise
money under the pretext of relief!

678
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,667
Are you broke?
You're even selling my jewelry.

679
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:25,698
Who's selling it?

680
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,698
I showed it to Fa as an example only
because she likes the pattern.

681
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,098
Don't lie to me!

682
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,706
Mr. Chiu's wife asked him
for money to buy it.

683
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,800
How much did you
lose playing mahjongg?

684
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:40,248
Fa could've lied to her
husband to get the money.

685
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,798
Besides, who are you going
to believe, them or me?

686
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,267
Step-mom, I believe you.

687
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,198
Be on your knees properly!

688
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,493
See how drunk you are! Kneel properly!

689
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:53,923
I told you not to drink, fight
or use drunken boxing.

690
00:46:53,925 --> 00:46:55,245
You even fought with me!

691
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,158
I'll kill you.

692
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,724
Wait! Wait! Stop hitting him.
He was just defending me!

693
00:47:06,726 --> 00:47:08,023
They tried to break my jaw.

694
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:09,827
I guess that's something
you don't care about.

695
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,098
Damn you, woman!
It was forbidden!

696
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,058
They could have killed him.
Don't you care about that?

697
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,298
Oh, sure. Like it matters.

698
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,349
You're beating him worse
than those guys ever did.

699
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,421
You're driving me insane!

700
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:27,074
I can't believe this!

701
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,873
What has happened to my
300-year-old bonsai?

702
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,953
Damn it! I forgot to throw it out!

703
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:43,876
Tso!

704
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,374
You're responsible.

705
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,698
Well...,

706
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,373
Why fuss over such a trifles?
Why get so excited?

707
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,273
I ruined the plant.

708
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:03,195
I sold the necklace because
I lost in gambling.

709
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,869
And I forced Fei-hung to use drunken boxing.
And I made him drink as he did.

710
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:11,415
Curse me! Kill me,
I asked for it! Oh well!

711
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,775
I've had enough, Ling.

712
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,417
I am so sick and tired
of your deception!

713
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,172
If you're going to hit me, just go on.

714
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,193
Don't think I daren't lay hands on you!

715
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,331
That's not gonna work this time!

716
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,697
You better hit me so I won't
cause you any more trouble.

717
00:48:39,902 --> 00:48:41,267
You're driving me out of my mind!

718
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,999
Hit me then! Or better yet, kill me!
One body with two lives!

719
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,999
What?

720
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,399
Are you pregnant?

721
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,954
We're going to have a baby?

722
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,998
- Get up.
- No!

723
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,498
You told me to kneel.
So I kneel, kneel.

724
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,299
Well, I'm sorry, all my fault!

725
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,330
Great, I'm going to
have a small brother!

726
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:12,448
- Get up, come on!
- Leave me alone! Keep away!

727
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,190
- I crouch!
- Watch out!

728
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,698
Don't!

729
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,723
- Then put me down!
- Okay.

730
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:19,280
I hate you! I'll back-somersault!

731
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:22,161
- Don't!
- Put me down!

732
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,580
- It's all my fault!
- I'll spin one full circle.

733
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,398
Calm down, it was all my fault!

734
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,686
Tso, get a chair for madam!

735
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,192
I'm begging you, please sit down!

736
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,367
Sorry!

737
00:49:42,425 --> 00:49:43,424
I'm so sorry.

738
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:47,881
- You tripped me.
- It was an accident.

739
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,343
You did it on purpose.

740
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,001
- Is the baby all right?
- Stop it!

741
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,496
- It's fine.
- Oh thank God!

742
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,549
Master Wong,

743
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,349
Mrs. Chan wants to see
you on urgent business.

744
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,132
I'll be right back.

745
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,473
Dad's OK, he's as sophisticated as ever.

746
00:50:14,475 --> 00:50:15,478
Nonsense!

747
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,323
- Master Wong.
- Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure.

748
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:23,423
Master Wong, look.
This is not ginseng.

749
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,648
I showed it to another doctor
and he says it's poisonous.

750
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,448
Now, I'm not sure where you got it,
but you've surely been misled.

751
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,409
It has made my husband deathly ill.
Thank God he only brewed half of it.

752
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:41,423
You owe me, and you're going to have
to take the blame for this mess.

753
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:42,424
Now!

754
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,748
Forgive me. Uncle Ho,
get the snake extract.

755
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,762
I can assure you he will
recover if you give him this.

756
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,548
Master Wong, this is wonderful.

757
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,598
I promise I won't tell anyone.

758
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,594
- It must have been a mistake.
- You're kind.

759
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,099
Goodbye.

760
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,299
Who did it?!

761
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:11,874
What's this?

762
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,199
He did it!

763
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,125
Not my fault.

764
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,827
How could you do such a thing?

765
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,259
Are you out of your mind?

766
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,171
You are destroying my reputation!

767
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,512
Hey, Mother.
He dropped his bonsai tree.

768
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,799
I'll kill you!

769
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,299
Wait!

770
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,653
Just listen! He lost it on the
train and couldn't get it back!

771
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,794
Oh, shit. What am I saying?

772
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,048
He was trying to save you some tax.

773
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,607
He hid the ginseng in someone
else's luggage and it got lost.

774
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:03,348
To evade tax for me? Outrageous!

775
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,898
I may be poor, but I'm honest.

776
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,120
Dishonesty is worst than starvation.

777
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,378
How could I have raised
such a deceitful bastard!

778
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,707
You want to drink?

779
00:52:15,575 --> 00:52:16,675
I'll let you drink it now.

780
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,331
Drink it, drink it like hell, come on!

781
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,406
Come on, drink!

782
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,552
Drink it like hell!

783
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,875
How dare you fight back?

784
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,298
I've brought you up for nothing.

785
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,196
Get out of my sight!

786
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:59,483
You're not my son!

787
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,907
Get out! Get out of here!

788
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,763
Stop it! That's enough!

789
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,949
You're going to kill him!

790
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,549
Fei-hung.

791
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,199
Fei Hung! Fei Hung!

792
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,680
- Get out! You're not my son!
- Stop it!

793
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,973
Master, stop it, please!

794
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:36,733
Master, don't.

795
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,066
Up! Get out of here!

796
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,139
That was self-defense!
He didn't mean to do it!

797
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,245
Get out!

798
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,449
Get out!

799
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,649
Fei Hung!

800
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,295
Tso, after him!

801
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,649
Tso!

802
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,749
That way.

803
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,899
Catch.

804
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,598
- Boss, here you are.
- Thank you.

805
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:30,232
- Hello. Beer, please.
- Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

806
00:54:31,775 --> 00:54:35,623
Fei-hung, your dad
wouldn't let you loose,

807
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:38,348
this is to protect the
image of Po Chi Lam.

808
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,514
I see a generation gap.

809
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:43,673
Let me toast dad.

810
00:54:43,675 --> 00:54:44,347
Drink!

811
00:54:44,355 --> 00:54:47,277
No way. That's it for tonight.
I'm cutting you off.

812
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,465
Excuse me, miss?

813
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,599
I want a song here.

814
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,207
Something I should sing?

815
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,702
"The Ocean's Crying,"
but I'll sing it myself.

816
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,698
The Ocean's Crying.

817
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,699
Okay.

818
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:13,325
I am so sad now.

819
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,498
I was so happy and now...

820
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,928
I'm all alone with no home...

821
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,649
What can I do?

822
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:31,648
If not for the wine...
I'd be hurting all the time

823
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,134
If only I could go home...

824
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:42,073
Father, listen to me now...
What can I do to make it up...

825
00:55:42,075 --> 00:55:44,075
To make you proud...

826
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,842
A pity I never know...

827
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,048
I only tried to help...

828
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,135
Why did you--

829
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,699
Why did you--

830
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,055
Why did you--

831
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,698
- Why did you--
- Look, it's that guy.

832
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,308
He doesn't look so tough.

833
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,888
Oh, yes, his drunken boxing is terrific.

834
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:09,998
Well, let's just see about this.

835
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,672
I still love you... No matter what you--

836
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:18,013
Party's over. I suggest you go.

837
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,943
Hey! What are you doing?!

838
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,998
Stand back, or you'll regret it!

839
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,498
- The rest of you, leave!
- Come on.

840
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,499
Get out!

841
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,388
- Yeah. You gotta leave. Go on. Move!
- Keep away!

842
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,655
What happened to the music?

843
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,320
Are you the drunken boxer?

844
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,541
Dad won't let me fight.

845
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,730
He's just faking.

846
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,598
What's going on?
What's the matter with him?

847
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,499
Fei-hung?

848
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:17,891
- Out of my way! What are you doing?
- Hold it!

849
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,035
It's none of your business!

850
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,273
Get rid of him! Keep him away!

851
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:30,198
What's going on?
Is this some kind of joke?

852
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,089
No, no! He wasn't like that earlier.

853
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,561
He couldn't be stopped. Ask anyone.

854
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,769
Why you kick me?

855
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,875
Look at you.
Get up and fight me! Come on!

856
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,293
You call that drunken boxing?

857
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:59,198
Kill him! Go! Go on!

858
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,199
Wait.

859
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,581
There are too many witnesses,
just teach him a lesson.

860
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:11,570
{\an1}"King of Drunken Boxing"?\N\N\N

861
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,054
- I know who that is.\N\N\N

862
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,648
- I know who that is.
- He's hurt bad.

863
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:14,598
Wong Fei-hung.\N\N\N

864
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,245
Master Wong, over here.\N\N\N

865
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,265
Fei Hung!

866
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:29,229
{\an3}I hear his father is
a drunk as well.

867
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,229
What did you say?

868
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:52,225
Don't be ashamed. When we were children,
we ran around naked as well.

869
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,631
If I had found you sooner,
this might not have happened!

870
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,785
Young master, don't be sad.

871
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,325
I have some good news for you.

872
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,273
Every woman in town
wants to marry you.

873
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:12,348
Are you happy now?

874
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,434
Don't cry. Come on, wipe your face.

875
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:19,898
Father--

876
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,998
In the garden.

877
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,698
Fei-hung never forgets he once
won with drunken boxing.

878
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,018
I've my reason for not
letting him use it.

879
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,498
There's nothing wrong
with drunken boxing.

880
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,298
You have to drink for it to work,
and you may become too drunk.

881
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,698
Let alone fighting, you lose stability.
He get into trouble because of this.

882
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,723
Don't drink so much then.

883
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:43,498
No, he must drink a proper portion,
before it becomes effective.

884
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,048
He gets powerful but feels
no pain when beaten.

885
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,298
So it gives the illusion
of being powerful.

886
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,437
A drinker knows he can't stop drinking.

887
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:58,948
Is it worth being a
drunkard to use this style?

888
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,098
"Boats can float on water,"
or so it says,

889
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,298
"but they can sink in it, too."

890
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,598
Now, that's really profound...
but I have only a question.

891
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,398
What?

892
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,198
Whose boat are we talking about?
How much drink is a proper portion?

893
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,891
How do boats float on water,
but sink in it, too?

894
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,719
I won't drink any more.

895
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,273
I'm glad to see that you're okay now.

896
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:48,814
 Come on, let's get up and thank your
friends here for helping you. Go on.

897
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,098
- How's the baby today?
- Don't touch him. He's asleep.

898
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,082
Yes, yes.

899
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,188
Come again for treatment tomorrow.

900
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,998
- Does Wong Fei-hung live here?
- What if he does?

901
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,148
- Is he here?
- He might be. What for?

902
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,222
I can't tell you.

903
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,603
Did those men send you here?

904
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,773
What was that for?

905
01:01:46,775 --> 01:01:48,598
- Keep your distance.
- I want you to leave.

906
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,599
I'm warning you.

907
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,059
Have you had enough?

908
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,299
You dare hit my Step-mom?

909
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,546
Fei-hung, let me help you.

910
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,597
He attacked me.

911
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,985
Father, help!

912
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,499
Beat him!

913
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,798
- Fei Hung, are you hurt?
- I feigned only to make dad fight.

914
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,084
Fei Hung, who is that?

915
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,348
Hold it!

916
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,723
- Hey!
- We have you surrounded!

917
01:02:48,725 --> 01:02:50,498
I'm talking to you.

918
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,423
He's talking to you.

919
01:02:51,425 --> 01:02:53,198
Me? Okay.

920
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,098
I'm Wong Kei-Ying. And you?

921
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,548
You're the coach of the Militia.

922
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,354
I'm Fu Wen-chi.

923
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:03,779
Fu Wen-chi?

924
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,123
{\an3}- Father knows him?
- It looks that way.

925
01:03:04,725 --> 01:03:06,964
Our most decorated Manchu officer.

926
01:03:07,265 --> 01:03:08,998
It's nice seeing you. It's an honor.

927
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,771
- Please.
- Okay.

928
01:03:12,075 --> 01:03:13,202
- Please.
- Please.

929
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:17,848
I guess that man is someone important.

930
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:21,305
Trust me, if he was important,
he wouldn't be hitting women, would he?

931
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,315
Think about it.

932
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,699
What?

933
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:27,098
Such a mess.

934
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,521
Look in the parlor when you're done.

935
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,271
- Fei-hung, have you found it?
- No.

936
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,335
Where could it be?

937
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,061
Tso might know!

938
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,598
What are you doing?

939
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,818
It's hot tonight.
I'm keeping cool over here.

940
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,827
She's quite a handful.

941
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,871
- Where did you put it?
- What?

942
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,498
What's this?

943
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,798
I don't know.

944
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,011
- Is it the one I brought back?
- I don't know.

945
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,598
I've found it!

946
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,897
Hey, I'm not finished with that.

947
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,473
Mr. Fu, you came from Beijing to Canton,
and got back the jade seal.

948
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:17,554
Yes, the jade seal is a
Chinese Royal emblem.

949
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:19,773
Tell me something,

950
01:04:19,775 --> 01:04:22,348
there must be a hundred
jade seals in our museums.

951
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,023
Why is this one so special?

952
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:26,198
If you tolerate the plunder
of a jade seal now,

953
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,098
tomorrow he may...

954
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,998
...pull down the Great Wall.

955
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:36,873
Then our children will have to go
aboard to see Chinese treasure.

956
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:40,523
Don't you know why the
Allies invaded Beijing?

957
01:04:40,525 --> 01:04:43,798
To seize the large territory of China.

958
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:49,448
Would they restrain themselves
if you don't collect yourself?

959
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:52,198
It's but natural that might wins.

960
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,773
You won't win respect without spines.

961
01:04:54,775 --> 01:04:57,434
Anyone gets bulled if he
bullies himself, understand?

962
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,770
I do. Thanks for your guidance, sir.

963
01:05:02,025 --> 01:05:02,840
Drink.

964
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,304
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.

965
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,422
Right. They left without saying a word.

966
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,178
Let me go and see if Tsan has come.

967
01:05:18,075 --> 01:05:19,398
Where's everybody in the street?

968
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:28,543
Kill them!

969
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,137
- What do we do?
- Fei-hung, follow me.

970
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,069
I'll lead!

971
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,154
Get him!

972
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,464
Fei-hung, grasp it.

973
01:06:47,675 --> 01:06:48,587
Let's go!

974
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,898
How's the situation?

975
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,123
No problem.

976
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,104
When you hire the Ax Gang,
you're sure to get the job done.

977
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,640
That's what we're paying for.

978
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,482
Fei Hung, here!

979
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,519
Fei Hung!

980
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,631
Oh, my God! No!

981
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:39,983
Undress.

982
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,176
Undress now!

983
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,135
Okay!

984
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,018
Catch!

985
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:42,493
Run!

986
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,173
- What's going on?
- Don't get involved.

987
01:09:54,175 --> 01:09:57,735
- Get on out of here.
- Now. Go on.

988
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,373
Sir!

989
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,066
Fu Wen-chi!

990
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,536
- Sir!
- Sir!

991
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,257
Try to stop the bleeding.

992
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,699
Sir!

993
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,598
The jade seal...

994
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,398
- Don't worry, I'll get it back for you.
- We'll get it back for sure.

995
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,879
Forget it. You can't beat them.

996
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,098
I'll help you back to Po Chi Lam.
My dad will treat you.

997
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,307
Don't die. He'll help you for sure.

998
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,998
Master!

999
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,089
Master--

1000
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,295
What are you thinking?

1001
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,914
Nothing!

1002
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,010
- Tsan?
- Fei Hung?

1003
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,273
What are you doing here?

1004
01:12:34,275 --> 01:12:35,164
Same for you!

1005
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:43,898
- So where's the seal?
- How should I know? Come

1006
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:44,918
Here.

1007
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,198
Hey, did you bring a light?

1008
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,731
- Yes.
- Light it quick!

1009
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,637
Welcome.

1010
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,534
You want to get back this.

1011
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,498
You really are too naive.

1012
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,448
I've already taken photos of you.

1013
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,673
Intrusion into a consulate
means invasion.

1014
01:13:46,675 --> 01:13:48,923
I can punish you any way I like.

1015
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,582
Kill us if you've the guts.

1016
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,476
Good.

1017
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,996
Do you understand what I said?

1018
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,156
Yes, sir.

1019
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,503
Things have worked out rather well
now that we have the jade seal back

1020
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,477
and a way to acquire Po Chi Lam.

1021
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:27,587
Right.

1022
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:32,398
Po Chi Lam has been in power
for too long. Now it's our turn.

1023
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,651
Send someone to Po Chi Lam,

1024
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,798
and tell him his son sneaked
into our consulate illegally...

1025
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,124
and see what he says.

1026
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:43,569
If he doesn't agrees to
sell the land to us cheap,

1027
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,276
we'll execute the both of them.

1028
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,498
Damn those boys!

1029
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,648
Don't they understand
there's nothing we can do?

1030
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,932
As an embassy,
they're exempt from the laws of China.

1031
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,935
- Maybe we can reason with them. I'll go.
- Sit down!

1032
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:01,198
You know what they want,
the rights to Po Chi Lam!

1033
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,998
They just wanted to return the seal.

1034
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,698
They aren't the criminals.

1035
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:05,973
This is all your fault!

1036
01:15:05,975 --> 01:15:07,475
- You disowned him!
- You spoiled him!

1037
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,904
You're impossible.

1038
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,256
And you're his father.

1039
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,283
We're running out of time.
We've got to do something.

1040
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,906
- You're right.
- I refuse.

1041
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,582
How can I?

1042
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,800
You know this land has been
in our family for centuries.

1043
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,358
There has always been a school here.

1044
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,850
What would you do, just give it up?

1045
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,996
I'll never do it.

1046
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,084
Oh, really?
If you won't help your son,

1047
01:15:32,675 --> 01:15:33,650
I'll beg his mother to.

1048
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,546
Sister, I need your wisdom

1049
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,962
more than ever.

1050
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,048
Please show me your divine powers.

1051
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,594
Can you help us?

1052
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,147
Release them.

1053
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:15,644
You okay? Just go on.

1054
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:20,166
Master Wong.

1055
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,467
- Step-mom.
- Just look at you.

1056
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,776
I'm gonna be all right.

1057
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,798
- Auntie.
- Master, are you all right?

1058
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,548
Some bruises, but I'll be fine.

1059
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:36,498
- Master, where are we moving to?
- What do you mean?

1060
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,023
Master Wong has sold
the school to the embassy.

1061
01:16:39,025 --> 01:16:39,793
He did what?!

1062
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,398
What has dad done?

1063
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,048
To help you, Master Wong did it.

1064
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:46,815
He had to sell the land cheap to the
consulate or you'd both be dead.

1065
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,557
Fei Hung, this fight is over.

1066
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,642
We can't do this anymore.

1067
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,098
I hope you know your father
has sacrificed everything.

1068
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,063
I regret not having taken dad's advice.

1069
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,260
It's not too late for you to repent now.

1070
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,226
Life's changes are like a moving river.

1071
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:08,204
What's here today is gone tomorrow...

1072
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,398
and tomorrow brings a whole new journey.

1073
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,075
Let's move forward and live.

1074
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,523
So when will the ship be leaving?

1075
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,539
In 10 days.

1076
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,340
Have you completed production?

1077
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,050
Yes, sir. Ready and waiting, sir.

1078
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,698
Good. Close the factory for the
time being and lay off the workers.

1079
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,848
After the shipment leaves,
find cheaper workers.

1080
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:36,368
Yes.

1081
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,698
First we work overtime!

1082
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,948
We refuse, then they beat us!

1083
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:50,798
And now they think they can
just fire all of us just like that!

1084
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,798
So are you guys going to
let him get away with that?

1085
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,619
What do you say, huh?

1086
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,998
Tsan, what happened?

1087
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,998
They closed the mill,
and you know what?

1088
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,448
The English ambassador who had
us beaten is also the foreman.

1089
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:03,273
Right.

1090
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,373
Tsan, forget it.
The less trouble the better.

1091
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,798
Oh, sure. You didn't lose your job.

1092
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,698
Well, I'm not gonna
let them push us around.

1093
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,998
Yeah. As soon as they
finished the last shipment,

1094
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,147
they fired all the men.

1095
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,399
How could the factory
have suddenly closed?

1096
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,912
I've lately found they've
been acting furtively.

1097
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,472
They must be up to no good.

1098
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,117
Fei-hung, what now?

1099
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,973
Well, we know they're up to something.

1100
01:18:29,975 --> 01:18:31,695
- Find a way into the factory.
- Okay.

1101
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,790
Then we'll find a way to stop them.

1102
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:34,988
- Come on!
- Right.

1103
01:18:50,975 --> 01:18:51,985
Looks valuable.

1104
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,146
Why're these hidden
with the steel for shipment.

1105
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,511
- I'll go and tell them.
- Go quick.

1106
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,078
Go! Go!

1107
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:44,154
Get out of here!

1108
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,526
Get help!

1109
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,484
Go now!

1110
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,548
Madam, they're coming out.

1111
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,778
All right, keep it down.

1112
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,698
- Bye.
- Good, take care on the journey.

1113
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,067
- Madam, we're leaving.
- Good, take care on the journey.

1114
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,478
- Take care of the baby.
- I will.

1115
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,297
Fei Hung?

1116
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,548
- Yes, Father?
- Don't get up. Keep working.

1117
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:35,598
- You know what to do.
- I'll remember what you said.

1118
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,398
Make another one afterwards.

1119
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,691
I'll make sure he does.
It's my responsibility.

1120
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,798
Listen. He's not allowed to leave.
You understand me?

1121
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,896
- Perfectly.
- All right, good.

1122
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,145
I want to have a word with you.

1123
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,679
If we were to have a boy,
he could be Wong Tei-Pau.

1124
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:54,548
If it's a girl, Wong Pei.

1125
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,848
Nice. Both names are fine.

1126
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,873
But do we really
need to pick one now?

1127
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,348
What if I'm early?

1128
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,798
That should be alright if you
take it easy till I get back.

1129
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,098
Good.

1130
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,492
- Fei Hung?
- Yes?

1131
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,898
Remember.

1132
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,098
- Oh, I will!
- Master Wong, time to leave.

1133
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:09,898
Coming.

1134
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,098
- Take care.
- I'll rein Fei-hung in.

1135
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,058
Take good care on the road.
Come back early.

1136
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:17,778
Go! You may come out!

1137
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,662
They are shipping Chinese treasure.

1138
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,148
Wonder how Uncle Hing is.

1139
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,398
I've got him involved.

1140
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,298
Don't be silly.

1141
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,628
No Chinese would tolerate seeing
treasures being shipped away.

1142
01:21:32,525 --> 01:21:33,742
Step-mom, what now?

1143
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,075
Come with me.

1144
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:38,156
Step-mom, where are you going?

1145
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,771
To beat the bastard!

1146
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,965
- Dad said...
- Madam, you're pregnant.

1147
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,543
Only 4 months, nothing serious.

1148
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:51,281
Auntie, we told Master Wong
nothing would happen to you.

1149
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,798
You're right.
That son of the bitch is lucky.

1150
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:56,898
I'll go get my students.
Meet me at the mill.

1151
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,490
Right. I'll gather up the men.

1152
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,291
See you at the bridgehead.

1153
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,450
Fei-hung, let's go.

1154
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:06,873
- We're leaving.
- Take care.

1155
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:07,376
Right.

1156
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,898
If anything happens to me,
take care of my dad.

1157
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,448
Damn your dirty mouth!

1158
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:13,498
One without ambitions
is not my worthy son!

1159
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,649
I'm leaving.

1160
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,700
Fei Hung!

1161
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,207
Don't return if you get beaten.

1162
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,904
Yes, Step-mom.

1163
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:30,348
Protest unreasonable closure,
demand reasonable compensation!

1164
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,798
Protest unreasonable closure,
demand reasonable compensation!

1165
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,475
Don't get carried away

1166
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,298
What are you doing here? Go away!

1167
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,353
Hand over the treasure
or we won't let you go.

1168
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,498
Those antiques are not yours,
and we won't let them out of China!

1169
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,759
You have no right to them.

1170
01:23:13,975 --> 01:23:14,607
Is that so?

1171
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:21,717
Throw them out!

1172
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,820
No! Don't shoot!

1173
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,126
Fei Hung, rescue Uncle Hing!

1174
01:24:36,075 --> 01:24:36,332
Wait!

1175
01:26:25,075 --> 01:26:25,549
Fei Hung!

1176
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:36,662
Don't.

1177
01:26:38,325 --> 01:26:39,365
Go and rescue Uncle Hing.

1178
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,541
- I know where he is.
- Good. Keep an eye on him.

1179
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,048
Wong Fei-hung is here!

1180
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:55,804
Stop him!

1181
01:27:15,325 --> 01:27:15,800
Wait!

1182
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:19,298
Do you realize what you're doing?

1183
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,728
He's helping foreigners steal
China's treasure. Why help him?

1184
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,148
State treasure?
What about our empty stomach?

1185
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:30,212
- Others will do it if they don't.
- I won't let you do it.

1186
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,998
And what are you
gonna do about it?

1187
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,398
Listen here,
nothing's gonna stand in my way,

1188
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,860
so why don't you just
go home to daddy?

1189
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,498
I've heard enough.

1190
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,323
Oh? Well, that makes two of us.

1191
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,933
Enough talk. Just kill him already.

1192
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,037
Do it.

1193
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:50,848
Do it!

1194
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,135
Finish him!

1195
01:29:00,725 --> 01:29:01,324
Come on!

1196
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:31,957
Drunken boxing.

1197
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,963
Just so-so.

1198
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:40,293
Come on!

1199
01:32:03,425 --> 01:32:04,669
I also have a fist.

1200
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:25,618
"A boat can float in water,
but also sink in it"?

1201
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,690
You are beyond help!

1202
01:35:24,325 --> 01:35:25,854
Just perfect!

1203
01:35:28,075 --> 01:35:29,074
Damn you.
