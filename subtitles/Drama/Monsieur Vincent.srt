1
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:29,688
MONSIEUR VINCENT

2
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,132
Châtillon's that way;
we're not going there.

3
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,755
Hello there.

4
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,399
What are you looking for?

5
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,630
I am the new Priest.

6
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,175
I am the new Priest.

7
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,575
There is no Priest here.
Hasn't been one in a while,

8
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,182
-and that's not about to change!
-What is happening here? Everything's shut down.

9
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,250
They're all cursed!

10
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,650
Where does Monsieur Bénier live?

11
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,525
Monsieur Bénier!

12
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,762
They're all cursed!

13
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,633
What is it?

14
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,075
- Is this Monsieur Bénier's house?
- What do you want?

15
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,543
Tell your master
Monsieur de Paul is here.

16
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:47,095
I don't know any Monsieur de Paul.
I told you not to open the door for anyone!

17
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,497
You idiot!
No one, I said!

18
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,036
These idiots could let
the plague into my house!

19
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,704
Be on your way.
We don't know any Monsieur de Paul.

20
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,472
I am the new Priest.
Monsieur Bénier is expecting me.

21
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,309
I told you
I won't open the door.

22
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:08,084
I am Monsieur de Paul.
Go tell your master.

23
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,084
He says he's a Priest!

24
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,517
Open the spy hole.

25
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,861
Pray forgive me, Monsieur de Paul.
I forgot your name.

26
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,328
I was expecting you.

27
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,466
- Did you just arrive?
- I took the afternoon coach.

28
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,771
You came straight away, didn't you?
You didn't talk to anyone in the village, did you?

29
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,499
-No. Why?
-Good. Open the door.

30
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,142
Go on!

31
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,785
Welcome, Monsieur de Paul.

32
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,629
- Did you have a good trip?
- Not too bad.

33
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,770
Except for a few pirates.
Do I scare them?

34
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,936
Be more discreet.
We are all going to die, dear Anne.

35
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,411
I hope we still have some time.

36
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,779
-And my husband is right here!
-He'll probably be the first to go, my dear!

37
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,681
The plague isn't
such a plague after all.

38
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,154
The plague?
Who's been contaminated?

39
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:22,393
A lady from the old part of town.
We walled her into her house.

40
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,687
When she dies,
we'll just set it on fire.

41
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,866
God willing, we'll still be able
to enjoy a few joyous days.

42
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,267
Have some chicken!

43
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,937
- How long has she been locked in?
- Three days.

44
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,235
Patience is the key here.
Some people take up to 10 days to die!

45
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,435
You should try the cup-and-ball.
It's a great pastime.

46
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,113
We have to do something.

47
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,807
We have to drink, eat and dance
and be merry. That's the only cure.

48
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,610
- Where does that woman live?
- What woman?

49
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,219
- The plague victim.
- Why?

50
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,219
I wish to visit her.

51
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,860
This is nonsense.
Why expose yourself to contamination?

52
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,758
Your quarters are ready for you.
You must be tired. Have some rest.

53
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,901
Thank you, but I am the Priest of Châtillon
and thus I will stay at the presbytery.

54
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,994
Dear Monsieur de Paul...

55
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,641
You have obviously not seen that building.
Our Priests gave up on it 10 years ago.

56
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,504
I shall stay there anyway.
Please have my things brought to me.

57
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,772
- And direct me to that woman's house.
- Enough joking around.

58
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,811
We shall be glad to have you here...

59
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,145
but if you leave tonight,
I will not be able to have you back.

60
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,254
Excuse me,
but that is my desire.-

61
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,455
Go get my things.

62
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,524
Tell me where
that sick woman lives.

63
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,595
I am your Priest and
I am asking you a question!

64
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,661
-It's the small house with the fires.
-Thank you.

65
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,929
My bag.

66
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,076
My hat.

67
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,340
Open up.

68
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,447
Excuse me, Sir,
but I must see that woman.

69
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,051
Thank you for your warm welcome.

70
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,085
What a boor!

71
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,818
I do apologize. He was recommended
by a friend of mine.

72
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,156
Looks like he forgot something.

73
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,835
Listen to this!
It is rather amusing.

74
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:19,268
"Resolutions towards
my masters the poor."

75
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,275
Look! He is really going!

76
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,442
He's going to get stoned to death!

77
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,482
That crazy man is so funny!

78
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,121
If he's still round on Sunday,
I'll go to Mass!

79
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,790
He'll be gone by Sunday.
Or he'll be dead.

80
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,423
Don't be afraid, child.

81
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,002
Carpenter, I need a coffin.

82
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,686
Do you hear me?
I need you to make a coffin.

83
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,446
Open up!

84
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,257
I am your Priest!

85
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,092
You'll open up
if you're not a coward!

86
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,802
Do not fear.

87
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,754
Get back!

88
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,216
Get back!

89
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,087
Forward!

90
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,062
Seventh!

91
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,960
I hear you insisted on seeing me.
Who are you?

92
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,726
I am the Priest of Châtillon, Sir.

93
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,039
- Touché!
- My guard was down!

94
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,231
There is no Priest in Châtillon.

95
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,741
-There's been one for an hour.
-What do you want?

96
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,276
You are lord of this village,
so I've come to pay my respects...

97
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,118
and to ask you to order
the burial of this child's mother.

98
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,823
I appreciate your visit and
I welcome you to Châtillon,

99
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,787
but I have better things to do.
On guard!

100
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,653
The carpenter refuses
to make her coffin,

101
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,887
and that woman needs
a proper burial place.

102
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,532
- As lord of this village, your duty...
- My duty?! What duty?

103
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,636
Who do you think you are,
teaching me lessons?

104
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,065
And what is this?

105
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,810
The plague victim's daughter.
She had been locked in with her.

106
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,613
Aren't you crazy?!

107
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,476
Get out!
Get out at once...

108
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,048
or I'll have you thrown out!
Are you trying to kill us all?

109
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,416
What do you want?

110
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,092
- We need shelter.
- This is my house!

111
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,765
It is mine too.

112
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,101
- What did you say?
- This is my house.

113
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,146
Isn't this the presbytery?
I am the Priest of Châtillon.

114
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,442
There is no Priest in Châtillon!
There is no Priest and no God!

115
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,050
Get out!

116
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,981
You'll find out about God some day;
as for the Priest, I am right here.

117
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,989
Priest or not,
I won't be taken for a fool.

118
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,855
Nobody likes that.

119
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,961
- Is the soup ready?
- Don't touch it!

120
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,702
We don't want her
to choke on that bread.

121
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,147
Wait up. What do you
eat it with?

122
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,575
Do you want me to gut you?!
Get out!

123
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,851
- You would kill over soup?
- I would!

124
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,956
You wouldn't be the first!

125
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,384
The girl is hungry.
She hasn't eaten in three days.

126
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,095
Put your blade away...

127
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,162
and get me a spoon.

128
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,067
God damn it!

129
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:23,031
Quit insulting the Lord's name in my presence.
He created you out of love.

130
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,373
The same way He created that girl.

131
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,808
You both are equally unhappy,
that's why you'll share your soup with her.

132
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,275
Give her your spoon.

133
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,921
Thank you.

134
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,356
Take it easy.
There'll be more.

135
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,569
You know what?

136
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,933
You're the first Christian
I've met in Châtillon!

137
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,383
Did you lose your leg
during the war?

138
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:10,315
- I spent 10 years on Bassompierre's side.
-Then you are a brave man. We will get along.

139
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,358
- Are you courageous?
- Courageous?

140
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,892
Look at this!

141
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,761
I wouldn't look
like this if I had run off!

142
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,065
Do you really believe
it's the plague?

143
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,733
Do you really believe
it's the plague?

144
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,135
What plague?

145
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:34,439
The girl is the plague victim's daughter.
I'll make her mother a coffin...

146
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,980
-and I might need you tomorrow.
-No, I won't fall for that!

147
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:43,582
-But you've risked your life many times.
-Not like this. With weapons...

148
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,552
...but not like that.

149
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,154
-What is your name?
-La Fouille.

150
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:55,190
If I ever run into the Maréchal de Bassompierre,
I'll tell him about...

151
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,732
how you could fight 10 Spaniards but
that you feared illness like an old woman!

152
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,809
I can do this
better than you.

153
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,124
What is that?

154

161
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,133
Yes.

162
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,129
I am still alive.

163
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,803
That woman did not have the plague,

164
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,200
yet you left her to die
in the most awful way.

165
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,379
If I hadn't broken
into her house last night,

166
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,375
this little girl would be dead too...

167
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,050
maybe eaten by the dogs.

168
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,958
While praying for the deceased,
I asked God...

169
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,125
to forgive you too.

170
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,355
Wherever she is now...

171
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,133
I am sure she is praying for you too.

172
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,169
What will you do
with this child of God's?

173
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,040
She will need a home, a mother.

174
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,270
Who will take her in?

175
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,673
I am not talking to those
who have everything

176
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,782
but to the woman who barely
has enough for her own children.

177
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,782
May that one only move forward...

178
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,090
to take the child in.

179
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,793
The Lord will bless her,

180
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,588
He who was poor and alone.

181
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,175
I already have five at home.

182
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,605
Good. She is yours.

183
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,447
Go.

184
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:11,379
Tomorrow is Sunday. The church will
be ready for Mass at 8am.

185
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,888
Hurry, you idiots!
Do you need a week to take me back?!

186
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,827
Hurry!

187
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,572
Where's the doctor?
What is he doing?

188
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,800
Be patient, father. He might have
been called somewhere else.

189
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,545
My grandfather had his own live-in doctor
and got the attention he needed.

190
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:12,808
Nowadays they want to be paid!
Everybody wants to be paid!

191
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:17,282
In my day, being honest and serving
one's lord was more important.

192
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:21,758
- What is he doing?!
- Relax, dear uncle. He'll be right over.

193
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,154
Poor Louise. You're not about to forget
your stay in Châtillon!

194
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,991
Between my injury and the plague...

195
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,068
It was not the plague. The new Priest
buried that woman and he'll say Mass tomorrow.

196
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,671
Don't you mention that Priest!
I'm injured because of him!

197
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,968
-How can you say such a thing?
-I know what I'm talking about.

198
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,407
Everything's been going wrong
since he arrived.

199
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,343
I usually get people injured!

200
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,946
What took you so long, you stupid idiot?
You left me here to die!

201
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,352
-But Sir...
-You left for three hours!

202
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,722
I've been bleeding
like a pig at the butcher's!

203
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,090
- I've searched the whole village, Sir.
- Quiet!

204
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,323
-But Sir...
-Quiet, I said!

205
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,999
So you're leaving again...

206
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,764
what are you doing here?

207
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,875
They can't find the doctor,
so I'll take care of you.

208
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,740
Get the hell out of here!
I want my sword! Bring me my sword!

209
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,748
Well...

210
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,687
you won't use your sword
for a while, I'm afraid.

211
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,914
Do you think a few words
in Latin will fix that?

212
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,117
Miss, I need some water and linens.

213
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,130
I might also need a scalpel.

214
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:37,261
-Or a sharp dagger.
-Don't you think I've waited long enough?

215
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:43,434
You're quite some Priest.
You bury people, you heal wounds...

216
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,166
Where did you learn all that?

217
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:51,576
I was held as a slave for two years in Barbary.
I lived with a doctor.

218
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:56,977
I had got hurt in a fight on the boat,
so he treated my wounds...

219
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,790
and he taught me to do the same.

220
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,822
During a fight, you said?
Were you in combat?

221
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,687
-What was your weapon, a rosary?
-I took the sword of a wounded man.

222
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,367
Did God say it was okay
to kill people?

223
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,797
He never said to submit
to unfair punishment.

224
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,371
I like you! If all Priest were
like you, I'd attend Mass.

225
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,579
Sunday might be a little early,
but I want to see you...

226
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,372
there in two weeks.

227
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,346
-Bring us something to drink.
-Yes.

228
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,285
I could use some wine, indeed.

229
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,583
I'm tired.
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

230
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,159
-No wine for you, though.
-No wine for me?

231
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,025
Nobody's ever used
that tone with me!

232
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,011
Duty to the lord... it used to be true,
when lords still had their rights.

233
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,951
Nowadays, peasants are nothing
but a bunch of lazy idiots!

234
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,451
All they do is not pay
the taxes they owe me!

235
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,753
- They are dirt poor.
- Me too!

236
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,189
- No.
- Just a drop.

237
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,456
- A tiny drop.
- No.

238
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,999
Thank you.

239
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,304
You are not as poor as they are,
so you owe them everything.

240
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,204
If you made the law,
the world would be something else.

241
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,076
Yes, it would be
quite something else.

242
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,084
That girl you kicked out yesterday,
do you know who took her in,

243
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,455
- Who is sharing her bread with her?
- I don't.

244
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,717
The poorest woman in the village.
She already has five children to feed.

245
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,998
The rich of Châtillon
are feeling cozy at home,

246
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:53,329
and to them,
the world is in perfect order.

247
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,701
But that poor woman

248
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,632
took that extra burden.

249
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:04,274
She'll stay up later at night and she'll
wake up just a bit earlier in the morning.

250
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,247
But she is richer than you.

251
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:12,815
Of course, it all makes sense coming from
your mouth! The world is as it is.

252
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,749
It is as we created it, Sir.

253
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,603
We'd never seen a lady at our house!
And I'm just standing here...

254
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,430
I'm sure you've had your share
all day! Let me do it.

255
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,008
-Mom!
-Yes, I'm coming.

256
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,171
You don't want to get
that beautiful dress dirty. Here.

257
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,517
What's been going on in Châtillon?

258
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,220
Hello, good woman!

259
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,947
Have the children emptied
the cupboards yet?

260
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,055
I've come to bring more food.

261
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,747
-So?
-Sir, Madame la Comtesse sends her apologies.

262
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,909
Madame la Comtesse
does not wish to see anyone.

263
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,720
Fine.

264
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,931
I apologize.

265
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,497
I am afraid Madame de Gondi isn't feeling
well and won't be seeing you.

266
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,102
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- No.

267
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,967
No, she has heard some
upsetting news, that's all.

268
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,104
I don't wish to remind you
about the reputation of our name,

269
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,712
but the Gondi should
have enough influence

270
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,906
to find their own runaway!

271
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,448
An official complaint might...

272
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,713
-...have accelerated the search.
-A complaint?

273
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,255
Against Monsieur de Paul?
A complaint against my own confessor?

274
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,226
Against my children's tutor?

275
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,125
Of course I'm complaining,
but not to the police!

276
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,563
He's a Priest,
and we cannot find him!

277
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,205
We've been with the archbishop
for half a century!

278
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,705
A Priest says Mass, and Monsieur de Paul
must be saying Mass somewhere!

279
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,347
His Grace has sent emissaries
to all bishoprics in France.

280
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,379
Has he left any clues
when he left?

281
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,409
He wrote a note of apology.

282
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,018
The tone was firm yet tender.

283
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:27,214
He said he felt his duty was
to renounce his position with us.

284
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,388
We also found
some scrap paper in his room.

285
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:38,202
This is a list of resolutions
he must have accidentally left behind.

286
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,671
- Admirable resolutions!
- Of course,

287
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:47,604
but where have they led him? In what
kind of hole, with what kind of savages?

288
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,576
Give me a minute.

289
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,151
Madame,

290
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,689
God allowed this fortunate encounter
so I could apologize properly.

291
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,757
This is no fortunate encounter.
God has nothing to do with it.

292
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,165
so I came on my own. I found out where
you were and I've come to take you home.

293
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,960
Why did you abandon me?

294
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,672
I was appointed Priest of this town
and I have a duty towards these souls.

295
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,904
What about my soul? You know how much
I needed your guidance.

296
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,345
Who will soothe my pain?

297
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,808
God will provide.

298
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,152
What about my children's souls?

299
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,647
There are plenty of excellent
men of faith in Paris, Madame.

300
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,121
You shall find another,
more worthy confessor.

301
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,388
Excuse me.

302
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,091
These poor people

303
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,136
are waiting on the soup
I give them every day.

304
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,069
They are hungry.

305
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,533
Hungry.

306
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,980
Monsieur de Paul!

307
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,099
Father...

308
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,064
I am as hungry as they are.
I am waiting, just like them.

309
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:56,103
The Gospel tells us the good shepherd
left his flock to save one soul.

310
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,669
One soul is not enough,

311
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,077
and these people

312
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,805
are more miserable than you are.

313
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,047
I am aware that one single woman...

314
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,188
is too little for you.

315
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,325
12.000 souls live on my land.
They are yours.

316
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,838
Since you have time in the morning,
you'll help me with the soup.

317
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,641
Why? Is Monsieur de Paul
not staying with us?

318
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,212
I believe so.

319
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,461
"Sir Philippe-Emmanuel de Gondi,
Count of Joigny, Marquis of the Hyeres Islands,

320
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,463
lieutenant of the Eastern Seas,
general of the French galleys,

321
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,897
and the grand Françoise
Marguerite de Silly,

322
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,834
Baroness of Montmirail
and our lord's wife,

323
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,239
hereby agree to pay Monsieur de Paul,

324
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,037
Priest at the Diocese
and holding a Degree in Canon Law,

325
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,808
45.000 Livres
which shall be used

326
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:17,215
as income fund constituted
and which profits will serve

327
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:22,059
to clothe, feed
and other needs of

328
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,430
six Priests who shall travel
through villages

329
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:31,693
to preach and instruct
poor countrymen."

330
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,727
Poor and abandoned

331
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,736
countrymen.

332
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,177
"Poor and abandoned

333
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,277
countrymen."

334
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,019
This is what was read to you, Sir.

335
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:57,016
I know.
I am verifying the number.

336
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,589
This money belongs to the poor
and I'm responsible for it.

337
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:06,336
-They're covering him in gold,
and he's verifying the number.

338
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,709
-What a strange fellow.
-Are you happy now?

339
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,077
I will be happy
when I have done something.

340
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,045
- You have all powers now.
- God has all powers.

341
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,483
I will try and accomplish a little
if He lets me.

342
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,217
Will you have supper with us?

343
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:35,390
The Duchesse of Chevreuse
is interested in your project.

344
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,198
-She shall have dinner with us.
- I am not used to the world.

345
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:44,306
You'll have to get used to it. You asked
the world to help you, so you can't just

346
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,475
-ignore it anymore.
-I will see you later. I'm counting on it.

347
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,725
Are you waiting for someone?

348
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,729
Yes, I am waiting
for Monsieur de Paul.

349
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,296
I am the curate of Montmirail.

350
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,631
You have an accent.
Where are you from?

351
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,771
- From the Landes.
- What part

352
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,499
Dax.

353
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,979
I knew a little boy from Dax.

354
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,849
He was a little shy
and awkward like you.

355
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:32,480
That boy was not looking
to impose himself in the world.

356
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,856
What did you do there?

357
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,591
My parents are really poor.

358
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,460
- I was tending the sheep.
- Why be ashamed?

359
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,202
The boy I was telling you about
used to tend the pigs.

360
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,834
Listen, go back to Montmirail.

361
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,273
Don't pay your respects to Madame.
I will tell her you came by.

362
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,179
Once you're there,

363
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,850
go visit the poor. go visit the poor.
Go visit him personally.

364
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,585
Don't let anyone come between you two.
Believe me, you need your poor.

365
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,456
-At least as much as he needs you.
-Monsieur de Paul.

366
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,763
-What is it?
-The duchesse of Chevreuse has just arrived

367
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,866
-and she wishes to see you.
-I'll be right there.

368
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,427
Farewell, my boy.
We shall see each other again.

369
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:25,801
I shall show my face to the duchesse of
Chevreuse. One of the great ladies in France

370
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,209
You go see your poor.

371
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,440
At least we won't both
be wasting our time.

372
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,371
Come closer, Monsieur de Paul.

373
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,515
I asked to see you because
I've heard a lot about you.

374
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:13,445
From women, mind you.
Madame de Gondi started a new trend.

375
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,251
All the great ladies at court
only swear by you. That's a good thing.

376
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,997
In the meantime, they're not
plotting to have me assassinated.

377
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,299
I thought maybe you could
be even more helpful.

378
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:30,697
I am afraid his Grace might overestimate
my talents. I am nothing but a local Priest.

379
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,607
Not everybody can be well born.

380
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,406
What's important is
what we do next.

381
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,143
Will you serve us, Sir?

382
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:46,320
Those missions you organized
are a very smart thing.

383
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:51,220
Being a guide to humankind
makes us blind to charity

384
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:52,790
sometimes.

385
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,488
You little brutes!

386
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,168
These beautiful little creatures

387
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,903
give me respite from men,
yet they're the cruelest!

388
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,870
They make me bleed every day.

389
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,702
-What were we talking about?

390
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,412
-Charity.

391
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,172
It is your friend.

392
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,644
I would probably like it too
if those plotting against France

393
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,551
didn't steal all my time.

394
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,187
I don't have the luxury
of thinking about charity.

395
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,420
But I can help you.

396
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,899
What you are doing
on a small scale,

397
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,298
can you do it bigger?

398
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:36,000
You belong to the Gondi. Monsieur
de Gondi is general of the galleys.

399
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,568
I am thinking of creating
a new position for you:

400
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,911
chaplain to the King's galleys.

401
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,747
Your Grace...

402
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:51,180
Good news has a strange
effect on you. You seem confused.

403
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,088
I'm scared, your Grace.

404
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,122
- I cannot accept.
- Scared of what?

405
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:04,264
You are remarkably organized
and you never fail.

406
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,936
Are you afraid you might not be
good enough for the job?

407
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,200
No, your Grace.

408
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,941
With God's help, I feel like I can
accomplish any task at hand,

409
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:20,181
-with patience and humility.
-Then what are you scared of?

410
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:21,985
Speak!

411
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:26,086
Of what you may call my success.

412
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,690
I am nothing
but the son of peasants.

413
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,893
I wanted to become a Priest
to help save people poorer than me,

414
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,528
and ever since the important people
of this world started noticing me...

415
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,871
ever since they allowed me
to do big things, as they say...

416
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,347
-the essential things seem to escape me.
-The essential things?

417
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,806
- Yes, your Grace.

418
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:57,453
Since I've returned to Paris, you've
been telling me I've done a lot.

419
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,885
I've seen a lot of important people,
I've talked to them a lot

420
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:08,055
to convince them to give some
of their time and money for the poor...

421
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,336
but I haven't called a poor
person by their name.

422
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,636
I don't know the face

423
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,077
or the name of a single
poor person.

424
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,182
That is what scares me.

425
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,348
I think I might be
making a mistake.

426
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,386
Everyone of us has a part
to play on this earth,

427
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,591
according to what's
been given to us.

428
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,120
Do you think I know any names?

429
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,761
Do you think I have the luxury
of looking at people's faces?

430
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,867
All I do is call an unknown officer
I don't even look at

431
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,267
All I do is call an unknown officer
I don't even look at

432
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,735
There, an army
of faceless unknowns

433
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,075
get on their way
to face their destiny,

434
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,940
or, in some prison,

435
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,647
to cut an unknown head off.

436
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,353
Only my king and France
have faces and names I recognize!

437
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,453
I am not asking what your feelings
or preferences are, Monsieur de Paul.

438
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,586
I hereby appoint you chaplain
to the King's galleys

439
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,967
because his majesty
and France need you.

440
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,023
We're headed to a good start.

441
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,957
We have many good galleys,

442
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,258
but with the general on board,
the Real is bound to win today!

443
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,128
Good man!

444
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,770
I am sure
Monsieur de Paul is praying for us.

445
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,232
Your grace.

446
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,841
-What is it?
-A great invention.

447
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:39,573
The top opens like so,
and releases a nice sent.

448
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,513
-Sent?
-I advise you to keep it.

449
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,655
After a half hour of hard work,
if the wind don't help...

450
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:49,758
-the smell gets intolerable.
-You are a man of faith, Monsieur de Paul.

451
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,655
Here you are, chaplain to the galleys,

452
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,263
and your galley slaves stink so much,
you will appreciate the sweet smell.

453
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,367
-Here is how you use it.
-Strong winds!

454
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,430
Strong winds!

455
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,503
Forward!

456
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:22,958
One would think that, after such an effort,
these men would get weaker. Not at all!

457
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,492
After a certain point,
men go past the exhaustion.

458
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,563
They're catching up to us!

459
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,059
Isn't this fascinating?

460
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,433
It is indeed, Sir.

461
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,630
It's fascinating.

462
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,167
Whip!

463
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,205
Whip!

464
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,605
-Why?
-You'll see.

465
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,740
Whip!

466
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,241
Whip!

467
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,679
This might hurt your Christian
sensitivity, dear chaplain,

468
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,153
but the whip is absolutely necessary.

469
00:44:56,493 --> 00:45:00,657
At the height of their effort,
it is a stimulant the men request,

470
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,297
sometimes.

471
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,066
Muzzle!

472
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,833
The muzzle is a leather device we insert into
their mouths to prevent them from screaming.

473
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,099
Sir! Look!

474
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,782
I think the Real will honor
your presence!

475
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,538
Wonderful!

476
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,142
I could increase the rhythm, but that won't
be necessary. We don't want to lose any men.

477
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,409
Heart problems.

478
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,130
Shall I stop him?

479
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,699
-Leave him. It is his good will.
-He'll die from exhaustion.

480
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,476
It is a terrible effort.

481
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,941
Maybe it is God's will.

482
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,111
And we have no right to interfere.

483
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,023
I shall give...

484
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,399
from this day forward...

485
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,435
my belongings...

486
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,733
in other words...

487
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,545
consisting in 900 Livres...

488
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,176
as well as...

489
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,411
40 acres of land...

490
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,321
inherited from my father...

491
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,889
to my brothers and
my sister Marie's older son.

492
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,522
I renounce the profits made

493
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:56,267
by the abbeys and priories
of Saint-Leonard-de-Chaume...

494
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,536
and the Equilles...

495
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,578
of Saint-Leonard-de-Chaume
and the Equilles...

496
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:12,411
as well as my responsibilities
of Priest in Clichy...

497
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:17,355
and to all related
advantages and privileges.

498
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,662
I wish to keep...

499
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:28,369
no sign of power or fortune...

500
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,171
so as to better love
and serve the poor...

501
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,308
my brothers...

502
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,583
and masters.

503
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,033
That will be four soles a week.
That includes housekeeping.

504
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:37,936
You'll like it here.
A Priest used to live here.

505
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,069
He left the crucifix.

506
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,714
It is nothing luxurious,
but the bed is clean.

507
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,607
And this is a reputable house.

508
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,645
Don't you like it?
Is it too expensive?

509
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,491
Maybe it is not
good enough for your taste.

510
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,795
No, it is actually too good.
Thank you.

511
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,779
Yes?

512
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:59,287
- Do you know if there are any rooms for rent?
- Try upstairs.

513
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:06,161
My milk ran out,
so he's hungry.

514
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,844
Would you like...

515
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,511
some bread?

516
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,949
I have too much.

517
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,964
It is not a palace,
but it's good enough to sleep.

518
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,668
The person before you
never paid.

519
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,440
So you need to pay upfront.
It's three soles a week.

520
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,095
You're splurging, for a week.

521
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,725
My daughter takes care
of the housekeeping.

522
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:48,327
Did you hear? He's got money!
Go bring him some water.

523
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,428
Go now!

524
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,132
Do what I say!

525
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,813
The water.

526
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,983
Thank you.

527
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,558
What is it?

528
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,191
Lambert doesn't
live here anymore?

529
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,091
No. I do.

530
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,197
Well...

531
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,998
What do you want?

532
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:42,167
I used to sleep on his floor
when I didn't know where else to go.

533
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,073
Stay.

534
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,913
Stay.

535
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,419
Where did you sleep?

536
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,395
He would let me borrow a cover.

537
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,928
Here.

538
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,931
You must have caught a cold.

539
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,874
Do you think?

540
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,176
I've been coughing up blood
since I was born.

541
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,044
Don't you have anywhere
else to go?

542
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,882
No.

543
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,048
How do you make a living?

544
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,249
I am no beggar.
I am a worker.

545
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,049
I paint fans.

546
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,196
But my coughing has
turned off all my bosses.

547
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,862
I spit on their fans...

548
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,435
and the ladies don't like that.

549
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,359
<i>No!</i>

550
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,458
<i>You tramp!</i>

551
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,827
<i>You tramp!</i>

552
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,765
<i>- You tramp!
- No!</i>

553
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,403
<i>- It's true!
- Don't worry.</i>

554
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,674
The guy on the first floor
just got home.

555
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,839
He's been beating his wife
ever since he got laid off.

556
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,740
What are we to do?

557
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,885
Just sleep.

558
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,748
Just try to sleep.

559
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,424
The neighbors know...

560
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:45,560
the children will fall asleep
in the hallway...

561
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,470
husband and wife will
end up making up.

562
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,770
They both drink a lot.

563
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,481
See?

564
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,919
It's going to be quiet again.

565
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,952
Well, almost.

566
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:13,124
That'll be one more child to share
the joys of this world with them.

567
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,698
That's the crazy lady
from the third floor.

568
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,432
She does that
every 15 minutes.

569
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,674
But you get used to it.
You'll see.

570
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,310
What's that?

571
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,011
The weaver.

572
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,789
He's got 10 kids
and his parents with him.

573
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,694
He gets one sole an hour,

574
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,861
so he works at night too.

575
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,070
Men of faith don't suspect
such things, do they?

576
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,604
I'm sure God Himself doesn't.

577
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,842
The poor don't sleep at night.

578
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,908
They work.
They insult each other.

579
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,611
They cough.

580
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,317
They make more poor people.

581
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,828
You can't let that get to you.

582
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,664
You have to do like everybody else
and not care.

583
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,528
The rich can afford to care.

584
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,432
The poor have had enough.

585
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,373
Every man for himself.

586
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,616
Forgive me, God.

587
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,487
I didn't know.

588
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,027
I didn't know.

589
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:16,383
I told her it's a mortal sin.
She said it was only a venial sin.

590
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,177
But I'm sure it's a mortal sin!

591
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,914
She didn't come to Mass yesterday.

592
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,630
The flowers for the Virgin Mary
were all wilted!

593
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,799
She picked them the night before
so she wouldn't have to get up early.

594
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:35,170
She wants to serve the Lord,
but she also wants to sleep in late.

595
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:39,941
So you noticed?
I told the Priest the flowers were wilted.

596
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:41,974
God will do justice.

597
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:44,969
Portail.

598
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,406
Portail!

599
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,848
Monsieur Vincent.

600
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,987
- Come with me.
- But, Sir...

601
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,679
Come quick.

602
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,451
- I need you.
- What do I do about confession?

603
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,353
Leave it.

604
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,757
Portail.

605
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,826
I learned something awful last night.

606
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,402
I realized that,
before saving their souls,

607
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,071
we need to allow the poor

608
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,843
to live a life of awareness.
To have a conscience.

609
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,387
Let's go!

610
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,435
Herminie Labotte.

611
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,196
Herminie Labotte!

612
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,607
So what have you been doing?
Begging?

613
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,136
I used to live with the children,

614
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:54,214
but my son got married
and his wife claims I eat too much.

615
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:57,818
- That's not true. I don't eat too much.
- You told me already.

616
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:02,583
- You don't have any teeth, but eat well.
- Yes. A good soup...

617
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,495
Well, you'll get soup today.

618
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,891
And tomorrow too.

619
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,864
But...

620
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:15,128
you know, soup is expensive, and we
need a lot every day. We, too, are poor.

621
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:18,639
But you keep coming back,
and I don't know what to do with you.

622
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,639
I don't know what to do
with myself either.

623
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,774
Okay, you can stay.

624
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,580
But you'll cause our ruin!

625
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,992
With you, it's different!

626
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,627
- It's fate!
- You've been pushing your fate!

627
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,525
And fate is not everything!
There is the Providence.

628
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:46,759
The little birds get food every day,
but they still have to look for it!

629
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,028
You're a strong guy!
You could hold a shovel!

630
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,672
- I can't find a job!
- I'll find you one!

631
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,365
Come back tomorrow,
I'll get you hired.

632
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,804
Get some bread
with Mr. Portail...

633
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,449
But this is the last time
you swindle God!

634
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,445
Tomorrow's bread will be earned!

635
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:09,050
They're hungry.
I'm not asking for anything for myself.

636
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,352
Four.

637
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,032
Okay, you can come every day.

638
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,131
Give me a minute.

639
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,839
Monsieur Vincent, we're out of bread.
- Cut up some more.

640
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,008
- But...
- Then buy some more.

641
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,213
There are no more...

642
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,313
Really? Already?

643
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,997
Monsieur Vincent, we have
some people for you.

644
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:59,464
- Who sends them?
- The hospital can't do anything.

645
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,142
They are not sick.

646
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,572
- But they are sick.
- From what?

647
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,509
- Misery.
- Mother Superior said...

648
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,481
that if you didn't want
them, we'd have to throw them out.

649
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,255
Tell her I'll keep them.

650
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,556
- What will we give them?
- Soup and bread.

651
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:25,927
Bread?

652
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,159
Okay, soup.

653
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,861
And a little prayer,
after they've eaten.

654
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,832
- Father...
- What do you want?

655
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,705
- We ran out of wood.
- What do you do, eat it?

656
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,507
I was careful and followed
your instructions.

657
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:43,242
Let's start with prayer. That, we have.
I'll see about the rest.

658
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,358
Come in!

659
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,297
Monsieur Vincent is here for you.

660
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,671
Bring him in.

661
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,074
- I apologize, Sir.
- What else do you want?

662
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,204
- I ran out of wood.
- That doesn't make sense.

663
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,282
- Are you cooking those poor?!
- I've been cautious!

664
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:19,011
Some important people have helped me
get you a room here

665
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,452
and I was made
to provide for your wood.

666
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,421
I don't even want to know
who visits you in that room.

667
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,061
You are so weak and credulous!

668
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:30,528
Those people would spend the whole day
there if they could!

669
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,327
They are weak, old and sick!

670
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,437
I am the regional hospital accountant.

671
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,972
That is an important office!
I have set resources...

672
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,872
that I can't possibly increase!

673
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:47,740
I cannot afford your generosity
and frivolity!

674
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,210
I don't have any more wood either.

675
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,621
Monsieur Vincent...

676
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:57,850
you are a pleasant man. If you
are cold, come warm up at my place.

677
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,291
I am always happy
to chat with you.

678
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,458
Thank you, Sir.

679
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,404
Money...

680
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,171
I need money.

681
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:21,182
Without money,
nothing can happen.

682
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,862
Madame!
You came right away!

683
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,574
- I am not one to make you wait.
- You are right.

684
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,504
This is the money
you asked for.

685
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,015
Thank you.

686
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,248
That will buy a lot of bread. We
couldn't give them anything this morning.

687
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:02,615
Hurry up! Get some bread!

688
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,085
And wood?

689
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,555
And wood.

690
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,091
Is money the only thing
I can give you?

691
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:18,606
You are such a lady,
what else could you possibly give me?

692
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,933
You are carrying the weight
of your fortune and your name...

693
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:26,375
just as they are carrying
the weight of their misery.

694
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:30,415
Excuse me.

695
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,449
I need these linens...

696
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,484
to cover their wounds, later.

697
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:41,121
A maid would cost money I could use for
bread, and I don't want to deprive them.

698
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,965
You may leave now.

699
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,232
Madame...

700
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,668
you can't possibly do this every day.

701
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,743
I can. And others will, too.

702
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,952
This is our first meeting,

703
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,861
and we wish to thank you
first and foremost, Monsieur Vincent.

704
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,590
I should thank you, ladies.
Without you, I was lost.

705
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,960
You have come down from the heavens,
to help my poor...

706
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:59,998
like angels carrying jam, soup,
warm clothing and good words.

707
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,836
I was dreadfully
scared the first time!

708
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:06,276
I had always given them
a coin or two after church,

709
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:10,282
- But I had never talked to them.
- I thought they'd insult me!

710
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:12,420
But not at all.
They are very polite.

711
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,690
- They always thank me.
- Not all of them.

712
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,719
I demand a "thank you."

713
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,020
Just like with my dog:
you want sugar, show your paw.

714
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,364
Poor people are quite sensitive.

715
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:26,292
You have to be rather creative at times
to give...

716
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:27,996
without upsetting them.

717
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,672
That, you can teach us.
We'll be proud to learn.

718
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:34,309
Today, though, we should
talk about practical issues.

719
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:39,273
First of all, it's only the 12 of us
and there are lots of poor people

720
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,708
- Should we take in more ladies?
- This is what I think:

721
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:46,278
I don't know why, but everybody
want to be like us.

722
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,350
Everybody's trying to copy.

723
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,784
No, I think we should stay
amongst ourselves.

724
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,855
I think we should take in
a few people.

725
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,429
- I spoke with Madame de Guemene yesterday...
- Madame de Guemene?

726
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,494
With the luxury she lives in?
If we accept her...

727
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,001
all she'll want to do is give
more than us, just to snub us!

728
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:06,400
The poor might actually like that.

729
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,974
It's not just about the poor.
It's about us too!

730
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,141
She's a friend of mine

731
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,873
but Madame
de Guemene is not a pleasant person.

732
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,945
So yesterday, this woman
comes up to me in a shop.

733
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:22,882
She said she's heard I created a charity
and so forth...

734
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,390
She is filthy rich and she was ready
to contribute 10,000 Ecus to be a member.

735
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,994
So I told her, "Madame,
there is still a world in France

736
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:34,035
where money alone
does not open doors."

737
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,830
What do you think, Monsieur Vincent?

738
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,030
I'm thinking...

739
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,400
about the 10,000 Ecus.

740
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:46,547
I have a question. I don't know what
you wear when you go to the poor.

741
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,476
I personally wear
a simple grey dress.

742
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,086
I borrow one of my daughter's dresses.
It's so much fun to dress up!

743
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:57,086
You know what I was thinking?
We could have a special dress made.

744
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,958
Some kind of uniform
we would all design.

745
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:04,462
I saw my draper. He showed me some exquisite
linen. It is grey, with some blue undertones.

746
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:07,861
- Come take a look!
- Excellent idea.

747
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,470
We'll have
to make it simple, in black.

748
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:16,377
- Grey is softer and not as prone to stains.
- It's so dirty there.

749
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:52,536
Excuse me, Father.

750
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,450
- Is anybody home?
- Who are you looking for?

751
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,284
- Monsieur de Paul.
- What do you want with him?

752
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,688
I'm a maid from Suresnes.

753
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,455
I've come...

754
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:08,062
because I heard some ladies
did charity work in hospitals.

755
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,699
- Is that true?
- It is.

756
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,623
For the most part.

757
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,768
So I'm here because...

758
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:19,234
excuse my audacity, but I wanted to tell
Monsieur Vincent something.

759
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:21,533
Tell him what?

760
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,904
The ladies are used to being served

761
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,810
and they might not know
how to serve others.

762
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:33,978
I'm a milk maid, so I'm used to doing
things they might not want to do.

763
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,848
I...

764
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,889
I could offer my help.

765
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,795
I'm not asking for money.

766
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,862
Food only.

767
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:49,002
I could do the bleedings, enemas, clean the
wounds, make the beds, empty the chamber pots.

768
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,735
All the things they don't want to do.

769
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,740
If I'm going to be a maid,

770
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,735
I'd rather serve God's poor
than my masters.

771
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,973
Am I being arrogant?

772
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,621
No, dear child.

773
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,723
Did you walk here?

774
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,521
- Did you eat this morning?
- I left before dawn.

775
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:19,258
Go to the kitchen. Tell them Monsieur
Vincent is sending you.

776
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:22,063
I'll see you later.

777
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,242
Do you think they'll take me in?

778
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,670
I have no doubt about it.

779
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:44,487
Thank you, Lord,
for sending this simple girl.

780
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,897
She is simple, but
she understood what I didn't.

781
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,422
The poor...

782
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,331
will help me save the poor.

783
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:10,009
That poor milk maid from Suresnes
was Marguerite Nazeau.

784
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:14,549
She was the first servant to our poor.

785
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:20,761
The charity work those ladies had
somewhat sugar-coated...

786
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,898
she did it, in her simplicity.

787
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,831
She worked hard,
like a poor person.

788
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:32,462
Soon enough, others joined her:

789
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:35,302
Barbe Engibouste
and Madeleine Drugeon.

790
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,502
Their lives were difficult.

791
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,476
They were exposed to bad jokes,

792
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,308
and sometimes ill-treatment.

793
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,413
Everybody was against us!

794
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:48,784
People couldn't tolerate to see nuns on
the street. They thought their place...

795
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:52,256
was at the convent.
For our girls...

796
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,321
the street was their...

797
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,120
convent.

798
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,831
Their cell...

799
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,830
was
a simple room for rent.

800
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,863
They felt extremely lonely.

801
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,699
That is why I got the idea
of bringing them together.

802
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,407
We needed a house

803
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,612
where they could feel at home,
after a hard day of work.

804
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:18,914
His Grace Lebon, in his generosity, has given
us the priory and the Saint Lazare domain.

805
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,221
But the buildings are in ruins...

806
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,187
the hospital, the pharmacy,

807
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:28,224
the room where we host
the poor during the day.

808
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,531
And we need to take care
of the demented, too.

809
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:36,566
So I need someone
who will supervise my girls.

810
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,305
Why me?

811
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:42,910
Because it is not enough
to do a little good.

812
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:46,147
You have to take on more,

813
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,147
You have...

814
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,215
to take on a little more every day.

815
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,217
What you're asking of me
is rather heavy.

816
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,354
I'm doing as much as I can.

817
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:59,360
These people are frightening.

818
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,527
I'm scared of the poor

819
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,560
Yes...

820
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,830
they're terrifying, aren't they?

821
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,806
As terrifying as God's justice
they know is without pity.

822
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:16,801
We can afford to hide behind our decent
clothes and our well-fed bodies.

823
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:20,046
But look at these awful rags,

824
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,274
the illness...

825
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:27,552
the misery, the bones,
the crazy look in their eyes.

826
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,283
They are mine, though.

827
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,192
They can be tough and unfair...

828
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:39,729
but we have to serve them
and love them...

829
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,295
like we would our masters.

830
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,433
I am scared.

831
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:51,669
I am weak, hesitant and gauche. I have
none of the qualities a supervisor needs.

832
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,779
You are my first soul.
The first person who understood me.

833
01:15:56,318 --> 01:16:00,948
Mademoiselle de Marillac, you will be
strong, firm and efficient. I need you to.

834
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,221
Father! Father!

835
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,823
We can't do it anymore!
There's only the four of us!

836
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:08,724
There're a dying man and there's no more place.
- I'm coming.

837
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,923
Come with me.
Come see how much I need you.

838
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:24,336
- Why him? Why not us?
- My legs are wounded too!

839
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:27,947
- I only got up to come here!
- But I was on bed rest!

840
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,812
- The old should go first!

841
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,613
- Let the young go first!
- What about me?

842
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,820
Will you let me go?

843
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,850
Monsieur Vincent.

844
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:58,811
- So?
- We have no bed for him.

845
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,046
Who's feeling better here?

846
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:10,151
Who can give their bed
to a sicker man?

847
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,319
You?

848
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,923
There's a spot.

849
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,761
Have the body taken out.

850
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,069
What about me?

851
01:17:58,373 --> 01:17:59,704
What about me?

852
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:06,509
I've been waiting here
for three days, waiting for him to croak.

853
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,343
This is my spot.

854
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,845
He told me before he died!-

855
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,423
I want to die in bed.

856
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,585
- I want to die in a bed.
- They're here?

857
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,118
- They're here?

858
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:22,862
I'll be back.

859
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:27,331
My dear, I have to go.
Make sure things go smoothly.

860
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,470
I want to die in a bed.

861
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,735
- I want to die in a bed.
- What about me?!

862
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:38,172
I've been waiting longer than you!

863
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:48,179
Stop it!
There is no fighting in here!

864
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,153
I'll call for Monsieur Vincent.

865
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:53,426
Madame, please make them stop.
We can't do it.

866
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,892
They demand things,
they insult us, they spit on us!

867
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:59,261
- How could I possibly love them?!
- Go back to bed!

868
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:02,198
- I'll call for Monsieur Vincent!
- There's not enough beds!

869
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:05,999
- Get some more!
- You can't treat the poor like this!

870
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:07,572
The poor are not animals.

871
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,534
- We're not animals!
- No!

872
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,676
We're not animals!

873
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,085
We're not animals!
We're not animals!

874
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,949
I can't do it!

875
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:26,521
I can't do it!
I can't! I can't do it!

876
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:34,299
- Very well, I'll do what I have to do.
- This is a copy of the eviction form.

877
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:38,701
I have 12.000 sick in Saint Lazare, serve
2.000 soups a day. Where will these people go?

878
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:43,571
I am only the messenger. My job
was to give you the eviction form.

879
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:48,640
Sir!

880
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:52,445
Sir, they've turned against us!
They fought over the dead man!

881
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:56,922
They insulted your name.
I can't do it. I can't, Sir.

882
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,888
You should go, Monsieur Portail.
I'll be right there.

883
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,860
Well, I'll manage alone, my dear.

884
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:07,726
You are trembling.
I'll walk you to your carriage.

885
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,072
Who were those men?

886
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:17,234
I thought Saint Lazare was too small, and they're
evicting me from Saint Lazare. Must be fate.

887
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:19,446
Where will you go
with these poor people?

888
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,516
I am responsible for them. I'll find them
shelter somewhere else. I am used to this.

889
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,849
We'll find an even less
suitable shelter...

890
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:55,175
These are the refugees
from Lorraine.

891
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,711
I hear that region has been
reduced to ashes.

892
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,720
There are 2,000 of them
coming to Paris.

893
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:05,550
What misery...

894
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,822
What misery...

895
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,393
2,000 more for me.

896
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:15,534
For us.

897
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:20,336
I apologize for being so weak.

898
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,174
I'm staying.

899
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,982
Monsieur Vincent,
what you accomplished is admirable.

900
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:36,486
The help you gave those refugees
was a blessing.

901
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:41,061
Where do you get the bread
and the clothing?

902
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:45,225
The finance ministry would like to know
what kind of magic tricks you do.

903
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,229
They are given to us,
Monsieur Chancellor.

904
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,461
How lucky you are!

905
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:51,602
The ministry is not
given anything!

906
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:54,842
There is no tax money,
the people are crying for mercy.

907
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:58,668
We've supposedly taken everything
from them, but we're still broke!

908
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,607
The poor are multiplying

909
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:04,979
and they've become a real threat.
Beggars everywhere!

910
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,380
And nowadays,
if you don't give them anything...

911
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:12,587
they threaten you.

912
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,190
They're hungry.

913
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:18,965
They're hungry...

914
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,926
With my job, I have other kinds of hunger
to appease! France is hungry...

915
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,372
for safety... for order.

916
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,868
Well.

917
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,609
I've requested your presence here
because I have some good news.

918
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:33,104
After your life-long
dedication to them,

919
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:37,215
you'll be happy to hear that, in two days,
there will be no more poor people!

920
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:41,787
- How?
- It's very simple. They're under arrest.

921
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,725
But, Sir...

922
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:51,493
- poverty is not a crime.
- I am afraid it very surely leads to it.

923
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,600
My job is to anticipate, and that's what
I'm doing. I have several premises...

924
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,967
La Pitie, le Refuge, la Savonnerie, Bicetre,
la Salpetriere... I'll just store them there.

925
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,505
The problem is
that they'll have to be fed.

926
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,004
We'll manage.
Public health comes first!

927
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,708
Would you like to be in charge
of the general hospital I am founding?

928
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:13,015
The poor are people.
They deserve to be free.

929
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,815
Free to bother people on the street?
To starve?

930
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,458
I'm feeding them, I'm giving them shelter.
What more would they want?

931
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,491
Charity means helping them

932
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,490
keep their humanity.

933
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,224
Charity?

934
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,436
You invented charity!

935
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,469
It used to be a quality.

936
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,905
It was good enough
for old church ladies.

937
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,438
We chatted about it,

938
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:42,808
we cried a little, we pulled out a coin,
and everybody was happy.

939
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,043
You, however,
blew things out of proportion!

940
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,014
You've put in some much effort

941
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:51,181
that the government is now
responsible for your charity!

942
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,154
We were busy enough
with finances, the Protestants,

943
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,024
the navy, international
issues and war...

944
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,731
that don't work well...

945
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:02,460
Do you think we need your charity
business on top of everything else?!

946
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,635
Before your time,
there were poor people,

947
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,168
but they didn't bother honest people.

948
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,139
Now they're everywhere!

949
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,210
It almost seems like
you're pulling them out of your hat!

950
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:24,351
Do we have the right to hold
those things against him?

951
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,585
This is not against him.
We just want to express our opinion.

952
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:31,163
What if we gave more time,

953
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,800
- more time and more money...
- We give whatever we can.

954
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,902
Nothing would be enough.

955
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:40,336
It used to be the elderly,
and that's sad. So he founded an association.

956
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,807
Prostitutes, the galley slaves,
the prisoners... fine.

957
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:47,412
We're already struggling with the hospitals.
We do as much as we can.

958
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:50,015
And now he's come up
with the refugees.

959
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:53,676
They had to come to Paris, since
their region has been turned to ashes.

960
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,082
Well...

961
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:58,350
I'm sure there are charitable people where
they live. Why not invite negroes over, too?

962
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,595
- He did mention it, Madame.
- What?

963
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:05,323
He told me once that he felt for those
barbaric people in our colonies

964
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,091
and that he wished
to send missionaries there.

965
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,161
To negroes?

966
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:12,639
See, he has to be stopped

967
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:14,672
before he takes us too far.

968
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:41,496
- It's cold tonight!
- Can't wait to be home.

969
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,733
- Look, there's another one.
- Happens every day now.

970
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:47,840
They come to Paris to have a good time.

971
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,169
- Don't be afraid.
- The fruits of their sins end up here.

972
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:53,604
- This one's dead.
- At least he won't be unhappy.

973
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,578
It's so cold out, it's no surprise.

974
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,149
- See you tomorrow!
- Tomorrow!

975
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,482
What were you going to do?

976
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:08,762
I am alone, I don't work.
I don't know who his father is.

977
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:10,758
God created him.

978
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:14,994
He is your son. One day, he'll be a man
who won't abandon you.

979
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:17,170
Show him to me.

980
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,037
You have a beautiful child.

981
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,304
Be brave.

982
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:27,012
I can't. I can't.

983
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,409
I'd rather not see him die.

984
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:32,753
Come back!

985
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,285
I'm telling you to come back!

986
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:44,496
So you found one?
He's still alive?

987
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:50,227
They usually survive longer
in the summer. The other one's dead.

988
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:54,499
He's been there for two hours.

989
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,743
He cried for a little while,
then he stopped.

990
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,541
- And you didn't move?
- I don't have any legs.

991
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,047
I walk on my hands,

992
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,385
so holding babies is hard.

993
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,914
Then what would I do with them?
People don't care.

994
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:13,417
They're cold, so they just
walk by to get their soup.

995
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:16,019
Do many babies get
dropped in that box?

996
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:20,330
Three, four a day.
Half of them die.

997
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,169
The other half is no luckier.

998
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:28,105
They get sold to beggars like me
who maim them. A baby is worth nothing,

999
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:32,739
but an infirm can
bring in lots of money.

1000
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:38,448
- Those women who abandon them know that?
- They're not the worst.

1001
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:42,686
They hope the baby can survive.

1002
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:46,552
As for the others,
they just drop them in the river.

1003
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:49,023
Such is life.

1004
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,389
Life as God made it.

1005
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:54,563
All that's not supposed to survive has to die.

1006
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,372
Monsieur Vincent,

1007
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,050
we have spoken our minds
with our deepest feeling of charity.

1008
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:16,118
And with common sense.

1009
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:24,129
Women know what is
and what is not possible.

1010
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:30,164
Among the weakness and misery, God has given them
a kingdom to run, but also that humble knowledge.

1011
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:33,401
And men wouldn't make so many mistakes
if they listened to them.

1012
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,267
Madame...

1013
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,774
I didn't mean what I said, Sir.

1014
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,880
- Please forgive me.
- No, I agree, Madame Groussault.

1015
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:44,413
I am glad I sometimes
lack some common sense.

1016
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:47,448
Common sense and folly lead us

1017
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:50,417
to as many sins.

1018
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,590
They're just different sins.

1019
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:57,861
We are waiting for your answer.

1020
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,136
What is this?

1021
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,535
My answer.

1022
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,010
You think I do too much?

1023
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:17,050
I think I'm not doing enough.

1024
01:29:17,418 --> 01:29:20,717
I just saved this child, but three
or four innocent children die

1025
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:24,555
every night on church steps.

1026
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,557
Maybe God wants them to die.

1027
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:29,652
They are children of sin.

1028
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:35,096
When God wants someone
to die to pay for sin...

1029
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:38,664
He sends His son.

1030
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:43,568
God never wanted a single
innocent child to die to pay for sin.

1031
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,639
It is the cowardly, the selfish and
the vicious...

1032
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:49,509
- who accept that idea.
- Monsieur Vincent, I respect you,

1033
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:54,216
but I won't follow you blindly.
I hate sin and vice,

1034
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:57,016
and as much as you love charity,
I won't love these children.

1035
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:00,692
I hate this child
born from sin and vice.

1036
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,789
God is listening to you, Madame.

1037
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:09,025
- God cannot possibly love him.
I won't allow you to be the judge of that!

1038
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,505
I know

1039
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:14,904
that God is asking me
to save this innocent child

1040
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:18,311
before anyone else.

1041
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,746
I will go out tomorrow
and every night.

1042
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,946
I will put more on this table!

1043
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:28,847
You will watch them fight
and ask you to let them live.

1044
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:33,685
- We'll see if you let them die.
- Monsieur Vincent...

1045
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,722
we told you we have
too much on our hands.

1046
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,957
I know you won't listen to us
because we lead a rich and idle life.

1047
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:43,069
But these girls
work day and night

1048
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:46,763
and they'll tell you
they can't do any more.

1049
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,201
If God asks them to,
they will do more.

1050
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:52,811
- We are trying to talk reasonably.
- I am the one who started that trend!

1051
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:57,047
I've told you not to go too fast,

1052
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:59,481
but tonight, I won't be saying that.

1053
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:03,451
I'm afraid

1054
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:05,922
I've gone too slow.

1055
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:09,387
Monsieur Vincent, there are institutions
that collect these children.

1056
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,690
They pay nurses to feed them.
Don't you know that?

1057
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:15,334
I don't know what they do for children, but
I know that if I hadn't been there tonight.

1058
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:19,267
this child would be lying
in a box in front of the church.

1059
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:22,669
He would be dead by now.

1060
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:32,548
We have enough enemies,
Monsieur Vincent.

1061
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:36,387
Priests and judges are
in charge of that work,

1062
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:39,151
and if we start doing their work,
they will hate us too.

1063
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,987
No, madam.

1064
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:43,453
When I appear in front
of my only judge,

1065
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:47,063
do you think I'll tell Him,
"I witnessed crimes

1066
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:50,260
but I didn't want to interfere and get
in trouble with the local institutions

1067
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:54,473
- and the judges who allow those crimes"?
- You'll do as you wish.

1068
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:56,867
But I know

1069
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:01,638
that none of these women will stain their
hands taking care of these miserable children

1070
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:04,579
and touch their own children later.

1071
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:11,246
Don't ask for more, Monsieur Vincent.
Don't ask for too much.

1072
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:13,824
What you want to do here... -

1073
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:16,991
is too repugnant.

1074
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,559
-So are you.

1075
01:32:36,817 --> 01:32:38,751
No one will look at me.

1076
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:50,860
Mademoiselle de Marillac.

1077
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:53,130
I am ashamed.

1078
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:56,968
I am ashamed,
but they do disgust me.

1079
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:20,660
- Madeleine...
- Sin is ugly. It's too ugly.

1080
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,888
You too?

1081
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,361
I'll never make it.

1082
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:30,964
I was a fool to believe

1083
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:35,008
I could move your souls,

1084
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:39,310
that I could let you out
of your repulsive solitude.

1085
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,493
I'm begging you...

1086
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,697
at least look at me.

1087
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:06,867
Grant me at least...

1088
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,106
one look.

1089
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,673
Don't leave me to my loneliness.

1090
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,553
Don't leave me to my loneliness.

1091
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:24,948
I will never make it.

1092
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:21,572
Monsieur Vincent will be sorry
he couldn't be here to welcome you.

1093
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:23,814
His position
at the moral council

1094
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:28,011
where he was appointed by his Majesty
kept him busy today.

1095
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:32,352
His Holiness the Pope very much
admires the works of your superior.

1096
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:38,231
He said to me, "go visit Saint Lazare
and tell me how it is,

1097
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,431
since I will never have
the chance to go."

1098
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:47,502
These are the elderly
we support...

1099
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:51,669
after they are too weak to work...

1100
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:53,608
and earn a living.

1101
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:57,114
Monsieur Nacquart died in Madagascar.

1102
01:35:57,318 --> 01:36:00,116
We named our foreign
missions office after him.

1103
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:04,985
- Marguerite Nazeau? I've never heard of her.
- She was our first daughter of charity.

1104
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:08,719
- She died while caring for plague victims.
- And Louise de Marillac was the first...

1105
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:12,865
- supervisor to the daughters of charity?
- Absolutely, Sir.

1106
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:16,197
We don't have enough room.

1107
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:19,133
We had to host a few of our abandoned
children over here.

1108
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:23,071
I think you've had to face many uneasy
feelings. It must have been hard.

1109
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,006
You are right.

1110
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:29,373
But with time and Monsieur Vincent's will,
we managed to do everything.

1111
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:31,118
Everything.

1112
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:36,187
Similar institutions now exist
in Italy, in Europe and around the world.

1113
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:40,421
What will people say in the future
when they learn that a single man

1114
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:45,654
had the desire to create what seems
so normal and so just today?

1115
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:52,471
Your Grace, Monsieur Vincent
should be here soon.

1116
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:54,934
I will wait.

1117
01:36:57,077 --> 01:36:59,602
He's the Reverend Father
Philippe-Emmanuel de Gondi.

1118
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,442
When the countess passed away,
he joined the order.

1119
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:05,642
Our congregation
owes him so much.

1120
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,722
Are you feeling better,
Monsieur Vincent?

1121
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:48,160
Your Majesty is too good.

1122
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:53,728
- Please forgive my poor state.
- Rest with me just a little bit longer.

1123
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:57,064
You can leave us now.

1124
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:04,973
You're doing too much.
We are old now.

1125
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:09,774
One is old when one wants to be old.
When there is time to be old.

1126
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:12,614
You have to take the time.

1127
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,117
It's good to be done.

1128
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,420
I have done so little.

1129
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:20,692
Sometimes I wonder

1130
01:38:20,961 --> 01:38:24,658
if you're not giving in to false modesty
when talking about yourself.

1131
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:28,829
I have many horrible flaws...

1132
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:32,664
monstrous flaws for which
I am begging God to forgive me...

1133
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:35,234
but false modesty...

1134
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:40,974
- But since you're mentioning it...
- You know you've done a lot.

1135
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:45,313
Very few will be able to show
for as much work as you did

1136
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:49,419
on Judgment Day.

1137
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:53,758
I did sleep.
I slept so much.

1138
01:38:54,929 --> 01:39:00,697
I had to be old to realize one could live
on four hours of sleep a night.

1139
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:04,898
I was a coward quite often.

1140
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:07,863
I gave in...

1141
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:12,769
and I closed my eyes
so I could forget about misery.

1142
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:16,139
What about us?

1143
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:20,553
We thought of our own pleasure,

1144
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:22,912
of our lust for good things.

1145
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:26,215
Without you, our eyes

1146
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:29,360
would still be closed.

1147
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:32,322
I wanted everything.

1148
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:34,764
And I got everything...

1149
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,296
gold, power...

1150
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,671
and love.

1151
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:45,370
Everything a little princess
could dream of...

1152
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,173
the most beautiful kingdom
in the world,

1153
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:50,009
the most beautiful love,

1154
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:52,742
for whom she could have
lost her kingdom,

1155
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:55,252
the most beautiful diamonds.

1156
01:39:55,522 --> 01:39:57,649
she had everything.

1157
01:39:57,925 --> 01:39:59,825
But it seems that
between the greedy little girl

1158
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:04,125
and the old powerful queen

1159
01:40:05,132 --> 01:40:07,100
dreaming aloud with you...

1160
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:14,040
there has only been
some long, empty dream.

1161
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:16,336
I haven't done anything.

1162
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:20,378
Tell me.
You've given your whole life...

1163
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:25,010
you're given up happiness
and power forever...

1164
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:30,380
you've built more
than useless palaces...

1165
01:40:30,824 --> 01:40:32,689
more than vain glory.

1166
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:36,121
Do you also feel,
now that death is near,

1167
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:41,459
that you're leaving nothing
but an empty hole behind?

1168
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:47,671
Yes, Madame.
I haven't accomplished anything.

1169
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:52,542
What is one supposed to do in life, then,
to accomplish something?

1170
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:56,410
More.

1171
01:40:57,785 --> 01:41:00,686
We are so neglecting.

1172
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:06,118
They're expecting me at Saint Lazare.
The poor are waiting.

1173
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:11,053
Does Your Majesty allow me to go?

1174
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:13,228
Go, Monsieur Vincent.

1175
01:41:13,467 --> 01:41:18,530
Tell them the Queen of France is asking for
forgiveness for stealing you from them.

1176
01:42:18,465 --> 01:42:20,695
Stop. Stop.

1177
01:42:38,218 --> 01:42:40,186
Is he sick?

1178
01:42:40,587 --> 01:42:42,248
Hunger...

1179
01:42:44,091 --> 01:42:45,820
will always exist.

1180
01:42:49,263 --> 01:42:52,027
- Help me.
- Let me do it. You can't possibly

1181
01:42:52,299 --> 01:42:54,267
Of course I can.
One always can

1182
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:09,543
See, I told you.

1183
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:12,785
It's nothing.

1184
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,849
Let's go home.

1185
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:26,757
You are too careless!

1186
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:29,698
- It's okay.
- Careless.

1187
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:31,870
Stay around, Portail,

1188
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:35,498
- and help that poor fellow to bed.
- You, too, should go to bed.

1189
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:38,072
I haven't finished my day.

1190
01:43:39,813 --> 01:43:41,280
Sir?

1191
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:43,205
Sir.

1192
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,315
I am not feeling well.

1193
01:43:51,124 --> 01:43:52,591
I can't see anyone.

1194
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:57,358
His Grace Graziani is here to see you.

1195
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:03,597
That is such an honor.

1196
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:08,898
Throw yourself at his feet
and beg for his forgiveness.

1197
01:44:09,176 --> 01:44:10,643
But...

1198
01:44:11,144 --> 01:44:12,634
I think that...

1199
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:14,573
I have to wait...

1200
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,777
for another visitor tonight.

1201
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:19,552
A more important visitor.

1202
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:23,218
Tell him I can't.

1203
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:26,349
Leave me now.

1204
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,856
- Can I ask the doctor...
- No.

1205
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:32,194
No one.

1206
01:44:35,702 --> 01:44:37,169
Yes.

1207
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:40,266
Yes, I will see someone.

1208
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:43,503
Jeanne.

1209
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:46,069
You know, the new girl

1210
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:50,539
who's helping the poor for
the first time. Send her in.

1211
01:44:51,918 --> 01:44:55,581
Sir, that is not important.
Anyone could train her.

1212
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:58,220
At the point I'm at now,

1213
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:03,094
one knows what is important
and what is not.

1214
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:07,932
Send her in
and thank everybody else.

1215
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:17,140
My God...

1216
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:21,076
will You finally
allow me to see You?

1217
01:45:21,915 --> 01:45:23,815
Will You finally...

1218
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:26,619
call me to my rest?

1219
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:32,452
Do You think I've earned my rest?

1220
01:45:34,027 --> 01:45:35,892
I've done so little.

1221
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:39,998
I am tired, it's true.

1222
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,528
Who is it?

1223
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:46,996
- It's Jeanne, Sir.
- Come over here.

1224
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:50,074
Jeanne...

1225
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:52,769
I asked to see you.

1226
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:55,811
I know you are good and brave. You'll tend...

1227
01:45:56,917 --> 01:46:00,250
- to the poor for the first time tomorrow.
- Yes, Sir.

1228
01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:03,918
I wasn't always able
to talk to all the girls

1229
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:08,223
who were tending
to the poor for the first time.

1230
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:12,288
We can't always do what we want.

1231
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,933
But with you,

1232
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:19,631
the youngest, the latest girl,
I had to do it.

1233
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:23,068
It is important.

1234
01:46:23,977 --> 01:46:25,706
Always remember...

1235
01:46:26,646 --> 01:46:29,911
- remember everything.
- Yes, Sir.

1236
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:36,678
You will soon realize
charity is a heavy load to carry.

1237
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:43,193
It is heavier than a bucket of soup
and a basket of bread.

1238
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:49,635
But you will always
keep your tenderness and your smile.

1239
01:46:51,371 --> 01:46:54,807
It is not hard
to serve soup and bread.

1240
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:57,935
Even the rich can do that.

1241
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:02,409
But you are a servant to the poor...

1242
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:05,809
a daughter of charity...

1243
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:10,581
always smiling,
always in a good mood.

1244
01:47:11,391 --> 01:47:13,382
They are your masters.

1245
01:47:16,196 --> 01:47:19,996
Touchy and demanding masters,
as you'll see.

1246
01:47:21,067 --> 01:47:26,027
The uglier and
the dirtier they are,

1247
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:31,607
the more unfair
and vulgar they are,

1248
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:36,271
the more love you'll have to give.

1249
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:39,850
Only because of your love,

1250
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:43,050
and your love only,

1251
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:49,195
will the poor forgive you
for the bread you're giving them.
