1
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,518
No!

2
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,578
No!

3
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,117
This is the English
language service

4
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,619
of Radio South Africa.

5
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,123
Here is the news,
read by Magnus Randall.

6
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,627
Police raided Crossroads,
the illegal township near Capetown,

7
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,184
early this morning,

8
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,627
after warning the squatters

9
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,164
to vacate the area

10
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,666
in the interest
of public health.

11
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,761
A number of people were
found without work permits,

12
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,271
and many are being sent

13
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,102
back to their
respective homelands.

14
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,608
There was no resistance
to the raid,

15
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,110
and many of the illegals

16
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:23,114
voluntarily presented
themselves to the police.

17
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,945
The Springboks ended their...

18
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,265
I think you ought
to have a look at him.

19
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,822
Give me his charts.

20
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,309
Were you listening
to the radio?

21
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,278
If they'd caught him,
we'd have heard.

22
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,183
Hi.

23
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,243
If the police have got Steve,

24
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,915
especially with
the posters in the car,

25
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,584
you don't think that--
Is that mine, sister?

26
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,751
Uh-huh.

27
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,295
Wouldn't that be
item one on the news?

28
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,797
No. If the people
know they have him,

29
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,299
they have to be careful

30
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,301
about the way they treat him.

31
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,802
They think he's here.

32
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,304
I must get back.

33
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,805
Let's have some coffee, Tenjy.

34
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,808
If the police had taken him,

35
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,310
that lot would be
the first to know.

36
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,606
I think he's hiding.

37
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,648
He was with Peter Jones,

38
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,150
and Peter has no pass problem.

39
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,345
If Steve was arrested,

40
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,355
Peter would have phoned me.

41
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,618
Pass the milk.

42
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,398
Finished, Mr. Woods?

43
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,934
Yes, thanks.

44
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,893
How'd you get these?

45
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,624
Ah, we have ways.

46
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,290
Do we dare print them?

47
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,890
For these, I'll risk it.

48
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,434
Ask Tony to come in.

49
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,437
I'll even give you a byline.

50
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,938
If they put me away,

51
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,440
yours'll be the first name
on my lips.

52
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,942
What about Mr. Biko?

53
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,444
Shall I use his name
in the story?

54
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,946
His picture was everywhere.

55
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,448
Do you think
there was a meeting?

56
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,451
There must have
been one recently.

57
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,985
Biko couldn't
have been there,

58
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,487
but one of his people,

59
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,988
mad enough about
black consciousness,

60
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,490
that's almost a certainty.

61
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,991
I've rejigged it a bit.

62
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,994
No. Leave him out of it.

63
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,496
I want the police
blamed for that raid.

64
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,998
I'll take care of Biko
in an editorial.

65
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,500
Yeah. Yeah, OK.

66
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,332
One bunch of lunatics saying
white supremacy justifies anything,

67
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,872
what we need is
some black nutcase

68
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,909
saying black supremacy's
going to save the world.

69
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,012
I would like to know
who's responsible for this.

70
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,521
May I ask you--

71
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,217
Dr. Ramphele.

72
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,724
Dr. Ramphele.

73
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,301
I'll leave you.

74
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,832
I've read this paper
long enough to know

75
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,344
you're not one of the worst,

76
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,849
so it's all the more baffling

77
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,352
that you would try to pass
this vicious fiction off

78
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,853
as reasoned fact.

79
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,820
Uh, well, Doctor...

80
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,326
Ramphele.

81
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,363
Ramphele.

82
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,829
I've stuck my neck out
on this paper

83
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,333
to take a stand
against white prejudice,

84
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,838
but if you think
I'm going to go soft

85
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,339
on some sensationalist
pushing black prejudice,

86
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,343
you've brought your complaint
to the wrong man.

87
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,209
Black prejudice?

88
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,306
That's not what Steve's
about at all.

89
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,318
Your Mr. Biko is building

90
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,911
a wall of black hatred
in South Africa.

91
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,422
I will fight him

92
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,425
as long as I sit
in this chair.

93
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,587
What you do in that chair

94
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,131
is put words in his mouth,

95
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,633
and you know he can't answer

96
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,930
because he's banned.

97
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,437
I believe I understand
what Mr. Biko is about.

98
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,767
Well, you believe wrong.

99
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,638
And he can't come to you.

100
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,646
If you were the honest newsman
you claim to be,

101
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,683
you ought to go and see him.

102
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,717
Look...

103
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,813
where are you from?

104
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,047
From South Africa...

105
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,294
but I was one of two

106
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,592
to be granted a scholarship

107
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,860
to natal medical school.

108
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:21,740
I'm a token of your
white paternalistic concern

109
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,776
for the natives of this land.

110
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,039
Well, I'm glad
we didn't waste our money.

111
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,477
I know you're not a fool,
Mr. Woods,

112
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,025
but you are uninformed.

113
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,027
Steve Biko is one
of the few people

114
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,292
who can still
save South Africa.

115
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,201
He's in King William's Town
right now.

116
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,170
That's his banning area.

117
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,192
Good morning.

118
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,626
Good morning.

119
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,882
Mr. Donald Woods?

120
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,018
Yes, I'm Donald Woods.

121
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,461
I'm Steve's wife.
Please, come in.

122
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,964
He's expecting you.

123
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,057
Thank you.

124
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,970
Hmm.

125
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,904
We're glad you could come.

126
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,465
Father Russell
got this for us.

127
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,943
You see,
we're trying to make

128
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,946
a kind of community center

129
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,448
where black people can meet,

130
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,950
maybe have classes.

131
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,452
The new dyes have
arrived at last.

132
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,455
Good. Tell Tsinki.

133
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,455
This way.

134
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,219
Who's this one?

135
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:24,524
Oh, he's just a little rascal
like his father

136
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,998
and even more trouble.

137
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,092
You'll find him out there.

138
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,485
Steve Biko?

139
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,048
Are you Steve Biko?

140
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,058
I am.

141
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,087
I would have met you
in the church,

142
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,588
but, as you know,

143
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,184
I can only be
with one person at a time.

144
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,161
If a third person
comes into the room,

145
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,663
even to bring coffee,

146
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,255
that breaks the ban...

147
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,225
And the system--

148
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,633
the police--

149
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,070
are just across the road.

150
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,272
But, of course,
you would approve of my banning.

151
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,140
No. I think your ideas
are dangerous,

152
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,978
but, no, I don't
approve of banning.

153
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,781
A true liberal.

154
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,918
It's not a title
I'm ashamed of,

155
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,450
though I know you regard it
with some contempt.

156
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,125
I just think
that a white liberal

157
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,364
who clings to all the advantages
of his white world--

158
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,495
jobs,

159
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,004
housing,

160
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,632
education,

161
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,676
Mercedes--

162
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,339
is perhaps not the person
best qualified

163
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:27,181
to tell blacks how they
should react to apartheid.

164
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,186
I wonder
what sort of liberal

165
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,915
you would make, Mr. Biko,

166
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,456
if you were the one

167
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,459
who had the job, the house,
and the Mercedes,

168
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,620
and the whites
lived in townships.

169
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,998
It's a charming idea.

170
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,298
It was good of you
to come, Mr. Woods.

171
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,867
I wanted to meet you
for a long time.

172
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,764
They follow you everywhere?

173
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,863
They think they do.

174
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,254
So, this is it?

175
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,259
Yes, this is it.

176
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,324
A clinic for black people,

177
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,662
staffed by black people,

178
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,168
run by a black doctor.

179
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,433
Was this her idea or yours?

180
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,875
Come on.
Let me show you around.

181
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,376
It was a collective idea,

182
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,811
but we were lucky
to have her.

183
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,313
And a white liberal doctor

184
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,882
doing the same thing

185
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,348
wouldn't serve your purpose.

186
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,353
When I was a student
trying to qualify

187
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,356
for the jobs you people
will let us have,

188
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,857
I suddenly realized

189
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,861
it wasn't just good jobs
that were white.

190
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,863
The only history we read

191
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,865
was made by the white men,

192
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,900
written by the white men.

193
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,401
Televisions, cars, medicines,

194
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,404
all invented
by the white men.

195
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,404
Even football.

196
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,407
Now, in a world like that,

197
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,908
it's not hard to believe

198
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,501
there's something inferior
about being born black.

199
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,013
We grow most
of our own food here

200
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,515
for the patients
and some of the staff.

201
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,915
The church?

202
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,953
Oh, that was here
long before us.

203
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,956
But I began to think
this idea of inferiority

204
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,458
was an even bigger
problem for us

205
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,961
than what the Afrikaners
were doing to us.

206
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,963
A black man had to believe

207
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,966
he had as much capacity
to be a doctor,

208
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,968
a leader,
as a white man,

209
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,436
so we tried
to set this place up.

210
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,440
My own mistake was to put

211
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,499
some of those ideas on paper.

212
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,941
The government banned you.

213
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,946
And the fighting liberal editor
started attacking me.

214
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,006
I attacked you
for being racist.

215
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,953
How old are you,
Mr. Woods?

216
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,489
Forty-one, if that makes
any difference.

217
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,186
Eh. A white South African,

218
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,161
41 years old,

219
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,493
a newspaperman.

220
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:30,501
Have you ever spent any time
in a black township?

221
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,002
I've been to many--

222
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,163
No. Don't be embarrassed.

223
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,672
Except for the police,

224
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:40,040
I don't think one white
South African in 10,000 has.

225
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,047
You see,
we know how you live.

226
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,050
We cut your lawns,
we cook your food,

227
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,551
clean your rubbish.

228
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,554
How would you like
to see how we live,

229
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,056
the 90 percent of
your fellow countrymen

230
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,854
who have to get off
your white streets

231
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,394
at 6:00 at night?

232
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,100
Jane.

233
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,101
Yes, Mom?

234
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,104
Put the strawberries
in the fridge.

235
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,605
Make sure Dad stays there

236
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,107
till I come down.

237
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,665
All right, dear.

238
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,647
What time did you get back?

239
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,148
I'd given up on you.

240
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,152
Half an hour ago.
I've already had a swim.

241
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,152
Mommy! Mommy!

242
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,153
Hello, sweetheart.

243
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,156
Look what Alison gave me.

244
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,657
Isn't that nice.

245
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,159
And what did you give her?

246
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,160
Nothing.

247
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,230
You terrible girl.

248
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,389
Well?

249
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,931
You were right.

250
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,661
What was he like?

251
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,203
They've built a damn clinic
up there.

252
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,204
Stop it!

253
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,205
Dillon!

254
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,206
Boys!

255
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,708
She's the doctor.

256
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,210
You should see it.
People come from miles.

257
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,213
How did they raise the money?

258
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,748
There was some local money
from the community,

259
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,250
church money from overseas,

260
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,185
and even mining companies
threw a few pennies in.

261
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,519
South African mining companies?

262
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,023
Yes. Apparently
someone important

263
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,549
heard him make a speech
that impressed him.

264
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,527
Thanks, Evalin.

265
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,426
Thanks, Evalin.

266
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,894
He is impressive.

267
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:06,896
Master?

268
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,262
Mm-hmm.

269
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,166
He hasn't talked you
into black consciousness?

270
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,568
No, but I'm
letting him take me

271
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,072
to a black township.

272
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,573
He's going to educate me.

273
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,303
He's banned. How could he?

274
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,969
I'm not sure.

275
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,147
You really think
this is worth the risk?

276
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,150
The education of
a white liberal?

277
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,153
If you get caught
out of your banning area,

278
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,655
well, all he might have to do

279
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,819
is write a letter
to his board of directors.

280
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,830
I don't want them
to get you in a jail.

281
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,696
Tell David he promised
to finish that table.

282
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,234
I won't get caught.

283
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,736
No tea till he does.

284
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,207
I need some money
from the cash box.

285
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,209
No, you won't get caught

286
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,212
if some paid informer
doesn't run to the police.

287
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,713
It's in the drawer.

288
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,181
Uh-huh.

289
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:02,185
We'll make a working man
of you yet, Steve Biko.

290
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,257
How do you want to do this?

291
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,259
Ask Thabo to come over.

292
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,261
I'll turn on the desk light.

293
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,762
Mapela will occupy the system

294
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,263
for a couple of minutes.

295
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,765
I'll slip out.

296
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,267
Thabo will sit in my seat.

297
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,236
I'm glad
I wasn't your mother.

298
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,295
You know, look. Look.

299
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,798
I was born in a tribal
homeland, Transkai.

300
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,800
My dad had a store there.

301
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,632
I'm not half as uncomfortable
as you think.

302
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,172
As a liberal,
if you had your way,

303
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,674
you'd be riding buses,
taxis, just like us.

304
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,110
You tell me my days
of white privilege are numbered,

305
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,876
so I'm enjoying them
while I can.

306
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,691
Run, son, run.

307
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,229
It's a miracle a child
survives here at all.

308
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,233
Most of the women
who have work permits

309
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,734
are domestic maids,

310
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,738
so they only get
to see their kids

311
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,741
for a couple of hours
on Sundays.

312
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,777
The place is full
of drunks and thuggery,

313
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,779
people so desperate
for anything,

314
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,280
they'll beat a kid bloody

315
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,783
if they thought he had five rand.

316
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,786
Was that kid you
a few years ago?

317
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,788
Yeah.

318
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,687
Maybe more scared.

319
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:53,160
But if you do run fast enough,

320
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,665
if you do survive,

321
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,329
you grow up in these streets,
these houses.

322
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,271
Your parents try,
but in the end,

323
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,274
you only get the education

324
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,776
the white man will give you.

325
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:10,838
Then you go to the city
to work or shop,

326
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,883
and you see their streets,

327
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,384
their cars, their houses,

328
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,580
and you begin to feel

329
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:20,648
there is something not
quite right about yourself...

330
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,385
about your humanity.

331
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,365
Something to do
with your blackness,

332
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,369
because no matter how dumb or smart
a white child is,

333
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,871
he is born into that world.

334
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,501
But, you, the black child,

335
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,978
smart or dumb,
you're born into this,

336
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,277
and smart or dumb,

337
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,317
you'll die in it.

338
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,962
I thought that most
Shebeen queens were informers.

339
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,462
Yeah. They are.

340
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,964
If they weren't,

341
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,466
the police would
close down this place.

342
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,969
But it's only some things
they inform on.

343
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,470
Others they don't bother.

344
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,005
Anyway, we're OK here.

345
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,007
This one's wild about Steve.

346
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,067
You see, he has
that way with women.

347
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,989
He's very articulate.

348
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,493
Where did he
get his education?

349
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,553
He's never been inarticulate,

350
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,497
but his father died,
and when he was 17,

351
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,559
he was taken
into a mission school.

352
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,527
You know...

353
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,071
most of these guys,

354
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,075
they're living in a bed
out there on their own.

355
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,737
No work permit,
no residence permit.

356
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,313
A man and wife

357
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,578
who can't find work
in the same white town

358
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,949
are not allowed to live together

359
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,250
in the same black township.

360
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,187
You split up black families

361
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,226
so that for thousands
of husbands and wives,

362
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,695
to see each other
once a year is lucky.

363
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,230
You keep saying you.

364
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,733
You're talking about
the Afrikana government.

365
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,793
Don't blame all the whites
for apartheid.

366
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,346
How many live-in maids
do you have, Mr. Woods?

367
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,712
One. But she doesn't--

368
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,182
Don't pick on him.
He's here to have fun.

369
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,117
Drink up. Cheers.

370
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,161
I'm not defending
what's been done,

371
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,131
but he's the one
who's against the liberals.

372
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,360
We're moving
towards integration.

373
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,901
You want to give us

374
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,403
a slightly better education

375
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,406
so that we can get
slightly better jobs.

376
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,907
At first maybe, but--

377
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,342
We don't want to be forced
into your society.

378
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,347
I'm going to be me
as I am.

379
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,350
You can beat me,
jail me, or kill me,

380
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,319
but I won't be
what you want me to be.

381
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,321
The best you want for us

382
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,721
is to be allowed
to sit at your table.

383
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,226
Using your silver and your china.

384
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,923
And if we can learn
to use it like you do,

385
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,660
then you will kindly
let us stay.

386
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,226
We want to wipe
the whole table clean.

387
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,770
It's an African table.

388
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,741
And we will sit at it
in our own right.

389
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,903
You must remember,

390
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:38,574
before you arrived
we had our own culture.

391
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,949
We had many villages...

392
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,214
small.

393
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,950
You know our language,
Mr. Woods.

394
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:51,893
The word we use for nephew
is ''my brother's son.''

395
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,431
Tenjy calls my wife,

396
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,023
not Aunt,

397
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,298
but ''mother's sister.''

398
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,634
We have no separate words

399
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,698
for members of the family.

400
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:09,645
All begin with ''brother''
and ''sister.''

401
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,581
We took care of each other.

402
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,585
We got a lot of things right

403
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,917
which your society
never solved.

404
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,923
You did have tribal wars

405
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,925
in this land of yours?

406
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,553
What do you call
World Wars I and II?

407
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,260
You use words very cleverly,

408
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,269
but there's something about it
that scares me.

409
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,134
Of course there is,
because in your world

410
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,763
anything white is normal,

411
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,364
the way the world
should be.

412
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,875
And your real genius

413
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,411
is that for years
you've managed

414
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,913
to convince most of us
of that, too.

415
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,920
Just tell him to come in.

416
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,005
Ken, this is Tenjy Mtinsto

417
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,907
and Mapetla Mahapi

418
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,411
from King William's Town

419
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,913
where we recently met.

420
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:17,913
Yes, sir?

421
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:18,948
Come in.

422
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,451
I'm glad to say that yesterday

423
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,578
the board approved
their appointments to the staff.

424
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,589
Brief them on our copy rules.

425
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,591
Take them upstairs
to see Bob.

426
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,092
Come this way, please.

427
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,593
Tell him to give them

428
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,095
their assignments
for tomorrow.

429
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,152
Thanks.

430
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,823
Teach them about our cameras.

431
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,332
I, uh, where, uh,

432
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,868
where are they going to work?

433
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,905
In the news room.

434
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,842
Does this Biko practice
black magic as well?

435
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,343
I'm not sure,

436
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,347
but I think
this is worth a try.

437
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,849
They'll cover
the real black news,

438
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,350
things we've never reported.

439
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,353
Nothing illegal.
It'll bring us new readers.

440
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,422
The white readership
will be delighted.

441
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,551
And when they start ranting on
about black consciousness...

442
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,061
Yeah, yeah.
Just remember,

443
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,063
my blue pencil still determines

444
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,031
what goes in this paper.

445
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,398
Yes, of course it does.

446
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,800
Yah, boss.

447
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,872
Ken?

448
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,270
Yeah?

449
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,571
You like football,
don't you?

450
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,440
And sure...

451
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,378
sure as hell...

452
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,882
he's paying people

453
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,748
to stir up trouble
between us.

454
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,685
Because when we fight
amongst ourselves,

455
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,224
he can say, ''See?

456
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:39,229
They're unfit
to run their own lives.''

457
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:43,324
Then he can go on
telling us where to live

458
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,164
and how to live.

459
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,501
He can pay us nothing

460
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,336
and pass his laws

461
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:54,002
without listening
to one word we say.

462
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,712
And remember...

463
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:03,550
they killed over 400
black students last year.

464
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,984
We've got to stick together.

465
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:15,499
As one people, we have
to make the white man know

466
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,999
that his free ride

467
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,866
on the back of black labor

468
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,964
is over, finished,
enklar.

469
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,678
Now...

470
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,685
now we've got
a surprise for you.

471
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,049
He's a little modest,

472
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,616
but you listen
to what he has to say.

473
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,158
Mamelan.

474
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,344
This is the biggest
illegal gathering

475
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,846
I've ever seen.

476
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,780
I've heard what the last
speaker had to say...

477
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,288
and I agree.

478
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,349
We are going
to change South Africa.

479
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,601
All we've got to decide

480
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,604
is the best way to do that.

481
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,608
And as angry
as we have the right to be,

482
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,109
let us remember

483
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,079
that we are in this struggle

484
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,140
to kill the idea
that one kind of man

485
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,210
is superior
to another kind of man.

486
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,556
And killing that idea

487
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,559
is not dependent on the white man.

488
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,061
We must stop looking to him

489
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,791
to give us something.

490
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,834
We have to fill
the black community

491
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,960
with our own pride.

492
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,507
We have to teach
our children black history...

493
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,099
tell them about
our black heroes...

494
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,778
our black culture.

495
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,781
So they don't face
the white man

496
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,612
believing they are inferior.

497
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,882
Then...
we'll stand up to him

498
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,481
any way he chooses.

499
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,460
Conflict if he likes,

500
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,021
but with an open hand, too.

501
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,102
To say that we can all

502
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,139
build a South Africa
worth living in...

503
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,904
a South Africa for equals--

504
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,945
black or white.

505
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,812
A South Africa

506
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,579
as beautiful
as this land is...

507
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,489
as beautiful as we are.

508
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,864
That's the one
who made the speech.

509
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,841
Sit down.

510
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,122
You know I don't
advocate violence, De Wet,

511
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,126
but don't make the mistake

512
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,185
of treating me
without respect.

513
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,760
Don't tell me
what to do, Kaffir.

514
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,040
Out of your banning area,

515
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,666
talking to a crowd.

516
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,678
You won't be a witness
at that trial.

517
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,715
You'll be up there
on the stand

518
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,511
with your friends,

519
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,643
inciting racial hatred.

520
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,586
On whose words, hmm?

521
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,593
What's his name?

522
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,128
Captain De Wet,

523
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,720
you're not sending me

524
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,230
to a Pretoria court

525
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,266
on the evidence
of a paid informer

526
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,268
in a cardboard box, are you?

527
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,270
Everyone knows
those kind would say

528
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,533
whatever you
wanted them to say.

529
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,374
You're a bit of poison, Biko,

530
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,348
and I'm going to see
you're put away.

531
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,476
Not on that kind of testimony,
you won't.

532
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,159
Don't.

533
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,056
Nee manne! No!

534
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,559
He has to appear

535
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:14,064
as a witness for the defense.

536
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,564
We don't want it

537
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,296
to look like
anything happened to him.

538
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,463
You're lucky, Biko...

539
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,631
Lucky.

540
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,674
I just expect to be treated

541
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,676
like you expect to be treated.

542
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,678
You and your
big-headed ideas.

543
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,179
If you're afraid of ideas,

544
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,681
you'd better quit now.

545
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,239
We'll never quit.

546
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,350
Come on!

547
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,853
What are you so afraid of?

548
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,380
Once you try, you'll see
there's nothing to fear.

549
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,418
We're just as weak
and human as you are.

550
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,869
We're going to catch you
red-handed one day.

551
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,997
Then we'll see
how human you are.

552
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:58,900
I quote,

553
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,877
''I believe that South Africa
is a country

554
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:06,110
in which black and white
should live together.''

555
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,048
Those are your words.

556
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,848
What does it mean?

557
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,056
It means that I, and
those gentlemen in the dock,

558
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:16,192
believe that South Africa
is a plural society,

559
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,194
with contributions to be made

560
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,322
by all segments
of the community.

561
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,232
Mm-hmm.

562
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,734
Are you familiar

563
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,737
with the language
in some of these documents

564
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,933
the accused have discussed
with black groups?

565
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,476
Yes, since some
of those documents

566
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,011
were drawn up by me.

567
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,980
The one ''noting
with concern and disgust

568
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,315
the naked terrorism
of the government''?

569
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,910
That is correct.

570
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,979
You say ''naked terrorism.''

571
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,584
Do you honestly think that
is a valid statement?

572
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,619
Well, I think it is
a far more valid statement

573
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,792
than the charges
against these men here.

574
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,034
Really?

575
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,969
Yes, really.

576
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,973
I'm not talking about words.

577
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,032
I'm talking
about the violence

578
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,012
in which people are baton-charged
by police, beaten up.

579
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,016
I'm talking about police
firing on unarmed people.

580
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,518
I'm talking about
the indirect violence

581
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,521
you get through starvation
in the townships.

582
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,523
I'm talking
about the hopelessness,

583
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,025
the desolation
of the transit camps.

584
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,527
That, all put together,

585
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,028
that constitutes more terrorism

586
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,065
than the words these men
have spoken here,

587
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,601
but they stand charged.

588
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,193
And white society
is not charged.

589
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,235
When you and others in
black consciousness speak,

590
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,336
you say,

591
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,847
''Our true leaders
have been banned

592
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,144
and imprisoned
on Robben Island.''

593
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,947
Who are you referring to
specifically?

594
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,624
Specifically, we referred
to people like Mandela,

595
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,182
Sobukive,

596
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,194
to people like Govan Mbeki.

597
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,559
And is it not true

598
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,224
that the common factor
with these people

599
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,267
is that they have
advocated violence

600
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,269
against the South African
government?

601
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,271
The common factor with these people

602
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,773
is that they have selflessly
pushed forward

603
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,775
the struggle of the black man.

604
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:19,910
So your answer to this
so-called naked terrorism

605
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,852
is to provoke violence
in the black community?

606
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,719
No. Our movement
seeks to avoid violence.

607
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,224
But your own words

608
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,283
call for direct confrontation!

609
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,989
That's right.
We demand confrontation.

610
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,497
Isn't that a demand
for violence?

611
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,500
You and I
are in confrontation,

612
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,365
but I see no violence.

613
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,807
But nowhere
in these documents

614
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,469
do you say that
the white government

615
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,978
is doing anything good.

616
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,981
Well, it does so little good,
my lord,

617
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,483
that it's not worth
commenting on.

618
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,461
But surely that approach

619
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:09,522
inflames racial hatred
and anti-whiteism.

620
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,869
My lord,
blacks are not unaware

621
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,872
of the hardships they endure

622
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,569
or what the government
is doing to them.

623
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:26,246
We want them to stop
accepting these hardships...

624
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,911
to confront them.

625
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:33,423
People must not just give in
to the hardships of life.

626
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,425
They must find a way--

627
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,960
even in this environment--

628
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:40,360
to...to develop hope.

629
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,756
Hope for themselves...

630
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,128
hope for this country...

631
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,211
Now I think that

632
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,246
is what black consciousness
is all about.

633
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,181
Now without any reference
to the white man,

634
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,651
to try and build up

635
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,280
a sense of our own...

636
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,121
humanity...

637
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,959
our legitimate place
in the world.

638
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,178
En die telefron ook.

639
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,624
Gann, help
hulle klaarmaak.

640
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,120
Dit sal die donders wys.

641
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,653
Yera dis warm.

642
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,168
Donald, go to Kruger.

643
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,433
He's always saying he'll
fight police illegality.

644
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,974
We'll take him up on it.

645
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,977
Kruger? He'd probably
give them a medal.

646
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,479
Now, Mampela, whatever
his personal prejudices,

647
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,278
he won't condone
this sort of thing publicly.

648
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,785
Oh, won't he? I'll bet you

649
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,980
he'll find an excuse for it.

650
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,024
You're positive it was
Captain De Wet?

651
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,889
lgin usekile
Captain De Wet?

652
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,552
Ndimbonile.

653
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,653
Where's Steve?

654
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,254
He went to the clinic

655
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,492
to draw off
the security police.

656
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,832
He didn't want anyone
seeing Dilima talking to you.

657
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,239
Donald, fly to Pretoria.

658
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,799
The local police
will only laugh at you here.

659
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,575
Ah, Mr. Woods,
you found your way.

660
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,974
Good morning, sir.

661
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,340
The minister of police,

662
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,142
and I walk right
into your grounds.

663
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,648
Not a soul in sight.

664
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,150
Perhaps not in sight.

665
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:49,651
How do you do?

666
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,120
Come in.
I'm just having a drink.

667
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,622
Will you join me?

668
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,455
Yes, thank you.
What are you having?

669
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,960
I'm on a whiskey.

670
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,495
That'll be fine.

671
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,929
Thank you for seeing me
at the weekend.

672
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,432
Ah, it's nothing, man.

673
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,492
I always like to
help the press if I can.

674
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,437
What did you want
to see me about?

675
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,438
Gesondheid.

676
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:11,701
Gesondheid.

677
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,035
Sit down.

678
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,313
Thank you. It's, um...

679
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,076
It's a matter
concerning Steve Biko.

680
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,175
Biko!

681
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:26,245
My God, man,
I know all about Steve Biko.

682
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,292
Minister, I don't understand
why he's banned.

683
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,318
You need a black leader
you can talk to.

684
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,367
Look, I don't need to tell you

685
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,369
this country has
a special kind of problem.

686
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,871
Shit, man,
do you think I like

687
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,374
banning and detaining people
without trial?

688
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,434
I'm a lawyer.
It goes against the grain.

689
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,180
Come...

690
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,442
come.

691
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,485
I want to show you something,
Mr. Woods.

692
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:59,181
We Afrikaners
came here in 1652--

693
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,121
200 years before there was

694
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,625
any such thing as a camera.

695
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,958
And yet look at this.

696
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,055
The trek across
the wilderness...

697
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,430
the homesteading,

698
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,435
the concentration camps
the English

699
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,731
put our wives and children in

700
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,806
during the Boer War,

701
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,898
the working of the land...

702
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,104
the building of the cities.

703
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,613
And any Afrikaner family

704
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,081
could show you the same thing.

705
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,813
We didn't colonize this country,
Mr. Woods.

706
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,377
We built it.

707
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,284
Grandfather Johannes,

708
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,052
a formidable drinker.

709
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,559
Do you think

710
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,893
we're going to give that all up?

711
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,296
That's what Mr. Biko wants.

712
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,302
This is a black country,
he says.

713
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,304
God, what's here was built

714
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,304
as much by Afrikaner toil

715
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:53,036
as ever it was by the blacks,

716
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,078
who came to us for work,
remember.

717
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,580
We didn't force anyone to labor.

718
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,514
They had very little alternative

719
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,519
since you'd taken over
most of the land.

720
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,620
And wouldn't you say
their cheap labor

721
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,653
And wouldn't you say
their cheap labor

722
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,815
has aided the success
of our economy?

723
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,324
I know what you're saying.

724
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,362
Don't think I don't understand
their argument.

725
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,487
I do.

726
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,532
We know there has to be a way

727
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,534
to work together
and live together.

728
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,536
We're trying to find one.

729
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,038
Maybe too slow
to suit some of them,

730
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,041
but it's no use your Mr. Biko

731
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,043
filling them
with false expectations.

732
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,080
We're not just
going to roll over

733
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,116
and give all this away.

734
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,176
Listen...trust me.

735
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,188
Let's sit in the shade.

736
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:43,192
I know much more about
Mr. Steve Biko than you do.

737
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,058
Is that what you
wanted to see me about?

738
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,562
Well, no, actually. It's--

739
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,599
But if that's
your recommendation,

740
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,759
if you think
it's really worth it,

741
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,803
I'll certainly
consider meeting him.

742
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,065
How's your drink?

743
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,196
I'm fine.

744
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,207
I really think you should.

745
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,140
You'll find him
more moderate

746
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,644
and more intelligent
than you believe.

747
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,011
But what I've
really come about

748
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,073
is an incident that occurred

749
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,550
at a sort of community center

750
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,053
Biko was putting together.

751
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,056
The place was smashed up
the other night.

752
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,058
Yeah, I know about that.

753
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,718
My police
are investigating it.

754
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:20,786
Your police are the ones
who did it.

755
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,423
What makes you say that?

756
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,805
An eyewitness saw
a security police captain

757
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,704
and some of his men

758
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,242
smashing the place up.

759
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,039
Would he testify?

760
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,814
He's afraid to.

761
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,817
But I felt it would
be more effective

762
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,353
if you took some
action internally.

763
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,854
You've always stated

764
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,586
you were against any illegality
by your officers.

765
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,150
My God, I am.

766
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,630
I appreciate your attitude,
Mr. Woods.

767
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,998
I assure you,
this is something I'll pursue.

768
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:02,163
I want no thugs in my department.

769
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,741
Don't be surprised.

770
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,743
We're not really
the monsters

771
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,008
we're sometimes
made out to be.

772
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,442
It's all right, Evalin.

773
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,953
I'll get it.

774
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,216
Get back, Charlie.

775
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,416
Mr. Donald Woods?

776
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,253
I'm Donald Woods.

777
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,823
You made a complaint
to the minister of police.

778
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,832
Yes.

779
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:31,833
That's right.

780
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,836
Come on, Charlie.

781
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:34,836
That's prompt.

782
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,839
I only saw him yesterday.

783
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,239
You had a witness
to the crime?

784
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,275
That's right.

785
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,278
I explained to Mr. Kruger

786
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,280
that I couldn't name him.

787
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,838
You reported a crime.

788
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,647
And the law states
you must name the witness.

789
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,153
You don't understand.

790
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,155
You must name the witness,

791
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,714
or you'll go to prison
until you do.

792
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,727
That is the law.

793
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:02,231
I don't want to go back
to Mr. Kruger

794
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,199
and report that two--

795
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,201
Report to whoever you like.

796
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:10,330
Our orders, Mr. Woods,
come from the very top.

797
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,180
Kruger.

798
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,178
I didn't say Mr. Kruger.

799
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,011
I said from the top.

800
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,656
Next time, you'd better
have a warrant.

801
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,458
The law's on our side.

802
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:35,997
Justice is on mine.

803
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,001
We'll see how we
make out in court.

804
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,502
And tell Mr. Kruger

805
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,562
to come to my house
for a whiskey.

806
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:16,672
Steve...

807
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,700
stay still.

808
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,746
Stay in the middle
and we'll cover you.

809
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:24,746
It's OK.

810
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,747
It's OK, boys.

811
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,512
You're a dirty player, Biko.

812
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,554
I was taught
by a Catholic priest.

813
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,953
What do you expect?

814
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,457
Are you alone?

815
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,457
Yeah.

816
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,960
Who told you I was here?

817
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,018
Your wife.

818
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,201
She didn't tell me where
the police thought you were.

819
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,203
We planted a phone call

820
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,240
saying I was going
to spend the afternoon

821
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,300
going over the books
at the clinic.

822
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,245
Got my summons today.

823
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,248
They're actually
going to prosecute.

824
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,180
Six months

825
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,481
for withholding
the name of a witness.

826
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,317
They're trying to break up
our friendship.

827
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,290
A few months in jail
might be what you need

828
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,792
to prove your credibility

829
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,295
as a budding activist.

830
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:17,732
Yeah, well, I got
my old law professor to defend me.

831
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,895
- He's the best there is.
- Want one?

832
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,097
Yeah, thanks.

833
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,801
I'm not going to name Dilima,
whatever happens,

834
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,843
but Kruger obviously
means business.

835
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:30,345
They've always meant
business against us.

836
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,847
Someday we'll be the damn system

837
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,349
in this country.

838
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,352
A lot of us
will die for nothing

839
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,911
if our system
turns into nothing

840
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,424
but black versions
of theirs.

841
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,584
I could accept that.

842
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,464
A bent policeman
is a bent policeman.

843
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:52,001
He breaks the same heads
for the same reasons.

844
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:55,504
To substitute a black one
for a white one...

845
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,506
it's not worth one child.

846
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,942
Never mind
six months in jail

847
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:14,689
for Mr. Woods.

848
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,284
Are you sure this
is the right house?

849
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,089
Ja, it is.

850
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,388
We have reason to believe
you are in possession

851
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,934
of subversive documents.

852
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,867
We're ordered to search here.

853
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,905
Do you have a warrant?

854
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,110
Good.

855
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:11,079
Well, bring it
to the window over there

856
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,580
and I'll read it.

857
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:22,823
Psst!

858
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,917
Put Mapetla's article
with them.

859
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:34,835
OK.

860
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:38,340
Could you hold it up,
please?

861
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,048
Fine.

862
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,711
Just turn the page,
please.

863
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,687
Could you read
a little faster?

864
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,794
It appears
to be in order,

865
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,695
but you won't find
such papers in my house.

866
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,257
We'll see.

867
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:09,236
All right. As soon as my wife
is properly dressed,

868
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,796
I'll let you in.

869
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,411
In there.

870
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:23,244
Stoffle.

871
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,337
Let's go.

872
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,915
I told you
you wouldn't find anything.

873
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,682
We'll be back.

874
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,767
I think we should
rescue them now.

875
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,672
Datu.

876
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:52,799
Datu.

877
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,901
Finally,
the prosecution finished,

878
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,981
and the courtroom
thought I was as good

879
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,174
as in jail.

880
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,684
Are you going to prison, Dad?

881
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,686
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

882
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,915
No, you see,
then Uncle Harold

883
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,523
began his cross-examination.

884
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,059
He began by pointing out

885
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,028
that the wording
of the charge itself

886
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,564
was not proper,

887
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,532
that the dates were inaccurate,

888
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,262
that the precedents
they'd cited all applied

889
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:21,701
to totally
different situations.

890
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,069
Quiet, Charlie!

891
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,611
We need to check your pass.

892
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,376
Just leave your door open.

893
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,382
Donald.

894
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,918
They're after Evalin.

895
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,384
It's the police.

896
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,887
They're after Evalin.

897
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,388
What are you doing?

898
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,925
Jane,
go upstairs to Mary.

899
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,087
Charlie!

900
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,128
Donald!

901
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:47,094
Dad!

902
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,631
Why the hell are you here?

903
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:52,133
We want to see her passbook.

904
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,669
At this hour?

905
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,466
That's when they
have their boyfriends in.

906
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,702
You're talking to a married woman,
and I resent--

907
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,073
I'll find it.

908
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,612
We've asked this
Bantu female to--

909
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,612
Woman!

910
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,670
Bastard.

911
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,079
She's a woman,

912
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,946
not a Bantu female.

913
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,179
We can question Bantu anytime.

914
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:14,849
There may be
an illegal male in there.

915
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,382
You're on my property.

916
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,428
Yeah.

917
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,930
You think you're a big editor

918
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,626
who can get away
with anything.

919
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,668
I think I'm a man

920
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,931
who's found two intruders
in his back yard.

921
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,599
Master.

922
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,144
Come, Kobus.

923
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,680
We'll see about this.

924
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,238
Go on, piss off.

925
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,419
Are you all right?

926
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:45,886
Yes, master, thank you.

927
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,890
Tell Sipo to bring
the children here

928
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,483
whenever you
want to see them.

929
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,756
You're mad, Donald Woods.

930
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,136
I'm also shaking
like a leaf.

931
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,407
Why didn't you get
your own strawberry?

932
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,909
Because if I did,

933
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,946
you wouldn't be able
to taste my chocolate.

934
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,914
I was just being considerate.

935
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,416
You have a little of mine.

936
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,953
I'll have a little of yours.

937
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,511
What's the matter?

938
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,022
Ken!

939
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,922
Ken, be careful!

940
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:37,072
They may just beat him up

941
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,574
to try and scare him
off the paper,

942
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:42,577
but it's more pressure
they're putting on.

943
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:44,078
I'm afraid they might try

944
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,775
and use him as an example--

945
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,860
God, Steve,
what are you doing?

946
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,094
I want to know about Mapetla.

947
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,761
Coming into a white area?

948
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:11,068
This is my country.
I go where I like.

949
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,175
He's heard about Mapetla.

950
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,141
Oh, yes.

951
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,212
Did you drive yourself here?

952
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,043
Peter's driving.

953
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,549
I put Harold Levy on it.

954
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,051
They told him nothing.

955
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,051
Sit down.

956
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,553
All being well,

957
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,557
I'm going to Capetown
in a couple of days.

958
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,287
When I come through,
I'll drop off something

959
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,794
about the arrest.

960
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,625
Maybe you'll publish it.

961
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,064
Capetown, Steve.

962
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,035
You must be out of your mind.

963
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:42,969
Well, it's...

964
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,940
it's a meeting
of black students there.

965
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,476
An important one.

966
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,943
And before they take a stand,

967
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:54,074
I want them to hear
what I have to say.

968
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,301
We'll print the news
of Tenjy's arrest.

969
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,362
We'll put it
on the front page.

970
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,439
What's up, boss?

971
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,712
Mapetla's dead.

972
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:35,089
They claim he hanged himself

973
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,682
in his cell.

974
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:41,420
We're going to remake
the front page.

975
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,212
Donald Woods.

976
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,838
Hello, Donald.

977
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,246
A piece of news.

978
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:04,309
The day before Mapetla died,

979
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,378
the police showed another prisoner

980
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:12,019
a puppet of Mapetla
hanging from a string.

981
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,170
Steve, I don't know
what to say.

982
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,675
Just say that someday
justice will be done.

983
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:31,737
And let's hope it will not
be visited on the innocent.

984
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,454
You shouldn't go to Capetown.

985
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,290
It's too dangerous.

986
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,376
It's a dangerous country.

987
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,861
Keys and papers, hey.

988
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,648
I can't get
the bloody thing open.

989
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:50,021
What you got in there?

990
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,081
Nothing.

991
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,163
Wat makeer?

992
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:57,028
I think they got
something in here.

993
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:03,727
Out.

994
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,041
Papers.

995
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,590
What's your name,
Kaffir?

996
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,567
It's there in the book.

997
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:34,728
Say it!

998
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,805
Say your name!

999
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,872
Bantu Steven Biko.

1000
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,024
I think...

1001
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:45,090
I think he should
see a specialist.

1002
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,964
Could he be shamming?

1003
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:51,133
The extensor plantar reflex

1004
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,506
indicates a possible
lesion on the brain.

1005
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,772
Could he be shamming?

1006
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:00,839
You can't sham a reflex, sir.

1007
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:05,687
And the lumbar puncture
that Dr. Hersch took

1008
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,690
revealed an excess
of red blood cells

1009
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,453
in the spinal fluid.

1010
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,120
Well, that also points to...

1011
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,131
Well, it's a possible sign

1012
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,667
of serious brain damage.

1013
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,305
Has he eaten, Sergeant?

1014
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,372
Gone to the toilet?

1015
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,377
No, not today.

1016
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,893
He must be seen
by a specialist.

1017
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:57,129
We'll take him to the police
hospital in Pretoria.

1018
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:00,073
But that's 700 miles.

1019
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:03,043
He might escape
from the hospital here.

1020
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,410
I want him
in a police hospital.

1021
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,073
Maak oop.

1022
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,925
Go by way of Soweto.

1023
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:53,962
And when you take breaks,

1024
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,998
one man stays
with Biko all the time.

1025
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,556
Goodbye.

1026
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,772
So Biko's death leaves me cold.

1027
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:01,145
He died after a hunger strike.

1028
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,891
Mr. Chairman?

1029
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,984
Mr. Chairman?

1030
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,029
Mr. Chairman...

1031
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,931
I commend the minister
for being so democratic

1032
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,764
that he gives prisoners

1033
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:17,135
the democratic right
to starve themselves.

1034
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:24,443
I suppose one feels sorry
for any death.

1035
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,848
I suppose
I would feel sorry

1036
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,679
about my own death.

1037
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,552
How did you get permission?

1038
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:40,554
I didn't.
It would tip them off

1039
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,522
and they might move him.

1040
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:43,990
I checked the law.

1041
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,085
I don't think
they'll dare stop us.

1042
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,305
This is a special case.

1043
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,739
There's been no inquest yet.

1044
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,139
There's no possibility--

1045
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,768
Not special at all.

1046
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,642
The law is quite clear.

1047
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:07,181
Next of kin have a right

1048
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,410
to see the deceased.

1049
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:12,454
Now, Mr. Biko's death
has caused enough uproar

1050
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:13,988
in the press already.

1051
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,956
If you'd like to create

1052
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,457
another front page issue,

1053
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,517
I'll be happy to comply.

1054
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,060
Steve...

1055
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,296
Steve...

1056
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:48,506
What have they done to you?

1057
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:04,864
We must hurry, Ntsiki,

1058
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:07,458
before he
notifies the police.

1059
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,970
Don't let them
frighten you, Mr. Woods.

1060
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,020
All right.

1061
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,092
From every angle.

1062
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,200
His whole body.

1063
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,951
You and Wendy will come

1064
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,249
to the funeral, won't you?

1065
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,085
Well...

1066
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:05,056
would his other friends...

1067
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,818
Would we be welcome?

1068
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,695
Yes, Donald.

1069
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,997
You and Wendy
are our brother and sister.

1070
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,700
We are here to mourn

1071
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:04,261
one of the great men
of Africa...

1072
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:05,601
Amandla!

1073
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,232
Amandla!

1074
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,208
I loved Steve Biko,

1075
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:13,213
but I hate the system
that killed him.

1076
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:16,182
- Pasina!
- Pasina!

1077
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,914
Even today, the day
of Steve Biko's funeral,

1078
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:21,421
in their white arrogance,

1079
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,458
they have turned back thousands

1080
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:24,924
who sought to come

1081
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:27,928
simply to pay
their respects to him.

1082
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,257
But we are here!

1083
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,745
I hate the system.

1084
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,744
But I welcome
all South Africans

1085
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,786
who join with us today

1086
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,789
in mourning the man
who gave us faith

1087
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,950
in the kind of country
South Africa could be.

1088
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:01,621
The kind of country
South Africa will be

1089
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:05,132
when all men are judged
as human beings,

1090
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,636
as equal members of God's family.

1091
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,602
And towards this day...

1092
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:16,606
when the isolation
that creates hostility

1093
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:19,146
becomes the closeness
that permits

1094
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,705
friendship and love,

1095
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:26,584
let us all join
in the song of Africa

1096
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:31,251
that Steve Biko
cherished as we do.

1097
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,414
Do you understand the words?

1098
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:02,179
Yeah, it's...

1099
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,983
God bless Africa,
raise up her name,

1100
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:09,963
hear our prayers,
and bless us.

1101
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,020
Amandla!

1102
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,332
The fact is that

1103
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,461
Biko had gone on a hunger strike.

1104
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,733
We tried to feed him
by intravenous drip

1105
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,367
with a tube in his arm.

1106
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,877
I don't know about these things.

1107
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,311
I'm not a doctor.

1108
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:36,449
That was the minister of police

1109
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,213
Mr. J.T. Kruger...

1110
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,810
Yes, hello.

1111
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,983
Is that you, Donald?

1112
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:44,922
All right, you traitor,

1113
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:46,426
you black-loving bitch.

1114
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:49,395
We know you're alone.
We're coming to get you.

1115
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,139
Mom...

1116
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,905
I can't sleep.

1117
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,572
Was that Dad?

1118
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,674
No.

1119
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:11,412
More threats.

1120
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,387
Police?

1121
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:17,323
They're the only ones
we know are doing it.

1122
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,325
When Daddy returns
from Johannesburg,

1123
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:22,295
we should put a tape recorder
on the telephone

1124
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,231
and print what
they say in the paper.

1125
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,469
There'd have to be
a lot of blanks and dashes.

1126
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,967
Well, I'm going downstairs
to make some coffee.

1127
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,480
No, don't go!

1128
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,096
Yeah, until 9:00.

1129
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:56,926
Mom.

1130
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,694
What is it?

1131
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,098
Mom, shall we call--

1132
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:02,329
You just stay up here.

1133
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:30,926
Believe me, 30 years
in the police force,

1134
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,796
and you know one
when you see one.

1135
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:34,960
Tell Donald--

1136
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:36,401
Here's another one.

1137
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:37,733
All from a.32.

1138
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,774
One of us will stay here.

1139
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,139
I'll prove
my ex-colleagues did this.

1140
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,075
What good will that do?

1141
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:47,080
None. But it'll make me feel better
that they know we know.

1142
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,276
Look, Mom, one went
right through your window.

1143
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,927
Dead right, me old mate.

1144
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,895
They're mad enough about
the speeches you're making here.

1145
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,261
Read the Afrikaans
press in Capetown.

1146
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:07,824
You start stirring up
trouble overseas,

1147
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:11,599
they'll come down on you
like a ton of bricks.

1148
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:14,073
You know my opinion--
It's madness.

1149
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,940
And even if they do let you out,

1150
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:19,775
they'll arrest you
the minute you get back.

1151
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,178
I would have, Don.

1152
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:22,375
Look,

1153
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,884
we'll force them
into an inquest.

1154
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,352
They can't arrest me there.

1155
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,356
A U.S. lecture tour
will stir up pressure

1156
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:30,857
they can't ignore.

1157
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,859
If you were a lawyer

1158
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:35,862
getting support for the law,
that's one thing.

1159
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,899
But you're going
to talk about Biko,

1160
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,435
and they won't stop
at niceties.

1161
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:42,868
Look...

1162
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,236
Kruger lied.

1163
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,641
If we expose it,

1164
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:52,237
they'll have to admit
how Steve really died.

1165
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:55,407
I'm going.

1166
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,486
If you'll stay with
Wendy and the kids,

1167
01:25:58,553 --> 01:25:59,952
I'm not worried.

1168
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:02,956
In fact,
the more publicity I get,

1169
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:04,924
the safer I'll be.

1170
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,540
Phone you when I get there.

1171
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:35,988
Donald Woods?

1172
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:36,989
That's right.

1173
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:38,491
We're from security.

1174
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,027
Come with us, please.

1175
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,994
This is the final call

1176
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:44,497
for passengers traveling
on British Airways.

1177
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:47,535
Don't worry.
You won't be on the flight.

1178
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,001
But my cases are--

1179
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,765
We've taken them off.

1180
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:58,711
You, Donald James Woods,

1181
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,977
are declared a banned person

1182
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,076
in terms of
the internal security act.

1183
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:09,623
Henceforth,
for a period of five years,

1184
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:11,682
you are forbidden to associate

1185
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,557
with more
than one person at a time

1186
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,654
or be in a room

1187
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,666
with more
than one person at a time,

1188
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,669
except for the members
of your immediate family.

1189
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:26,366
You are forbidden
to write anything,

1190
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:28,909
whether privately
or for publication.

1191
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,946
You are forbidden
to enter any printing

1192
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,413
or publishing premises
of any kind.

1193
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:37,417
You are restricted
for that five years

1194
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:42,115
to the magisterial district
of East London.

1195
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,786
Kruger's really gone crazy.

1196
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,167
You reckon you know
what happened

1197
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:05,644
to Steve Biko, eh?

1198
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:07,271
I saw his body.

1199
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:10,783
And those pictures
you've confiscated--

1200
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:13,286
Fourteen sets have already
been released

1201
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:14,821
to the world press.

1202
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:18,791
Arresting and banning me
is a stupid thing to do.

1203
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,794
Now your minister of police

1204
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:24,764
has guaranteed a world spotlight
on the Biko inquest.

1205
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:29,168
I have two small children,
Mr. Woods,

1206
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,671
and I think about the future.

1207
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,708
So tell me,
what would you do?

1208
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:37,267
I have children, too.

1209
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,681
But the days of a few whites

1210
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:44,217
running a black country
are over.

1211
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,810
It's going to change.

1212
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,222
In partnership or bloodshed.

1213
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,724
For your white children
and mine,

1214
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:54,728
I hope it's in partnership.

1215
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:58,061
Huh, with the likes of Biko?

1216
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:03,237
God, I hope
with the likes of Biko.

1217
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:07,263
I would have met you
in the church,

1218
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,937
but I can only be
with one person at a time.

1219
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:13,606
And the system-- the police--

1220
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,241
are just across the road.

1221
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,794
You're playing with fire.

1222
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,296
You know
the house is bugged.

1223
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,265
One slip of the tongue,

1224
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,301
a surprise raid and then--

1225
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,805
What you've written
about Steve is treason.

1226
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:41,842
If I get caught
smuggling it out,

1227
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,844
we both get what
Nelson Mandela got

1228
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,311
or what, you know,

1229
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,848
what happened to Steve,

1230
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:50,349
and no one would ever know.

1231
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,818
You think I've
done it for nothing.

1232
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,856
I think you should destroy

1233
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:57,857
what you've written now

1234
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:00,860
or get yourself out
of South Africa

1235
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:02,361
with that manuscript.

1236
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:06,867
Not just for, well...
for their sakes, too.

1237
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:08,902
Leave here...

1238
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:10,028
permanently.

1239
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:12,401
In actual fact...

1240
01:30:12,436 --> 01:30:13,331
In actual fact...

1241
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:18,502
one or the other.

1242
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,183
What do you mean,
we got to leave?

1243
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,742
Bruce contacted
a publisher in England.

1244
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,118
They want my book.

1245
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:30,157
Father Kani is right.

1246
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:32,158
When it comes out,

1247
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:34,751
the government
will see it as treason.

1248
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:38,795
We can't stay.

1249
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:40,993
I don't believe this.

1250
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,938
Because you want
a book published,

1251
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,940
you're going to rip the kids

1252
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,498
from their schools...

1253
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:52,204
their grandparents,
their whole life.

1254
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:56,916
Don't you even bother

1255
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,953
to find out what I'd like to do?

1256
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,717
We may hate the bastards
that run this country,

1257
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,917
but this is still our home.

1258
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:08,427
Do you want me to
just accept Steve's death,

1259
01:31:08,496 --> 01:31:09,929
what this
government's doing,

1260
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:11,988
is going to go on doing?

1261
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:13,499
What do you want?

1262
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:16,036
You forced the inquest.
You're banned.

1263
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:17,502
Are you so grand

1264
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:19,540
you can change them alone?

1265
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:22,542
I won't sit home bound and gagged

1266
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:24,544
for five years and do nothing!

1267
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,079
Where do we go?

1268
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:27,580
We've got five children.

1269
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:30,549
We couldn't take a penny
out of here.

1270
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,051
I know you.

1271
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:35,088
You're willing
to tear our lives apart

1272
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:38,557
just to see ''Donald Woods''
on a book cover.

1273
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,488
And you're using Steve's death
as an excuse.

1274
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:46,559
Bloody hell.

1275
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:55,572
Jane, can I go in again?

1276
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,440
Mary, go and get dry.

1277
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:25,872
Could we talk about this?

1278
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:29,501
I'm sorry I was so cruel.

1279
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:32,412
No, you were right.

1280
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,449
I want a book published.

1281
01:32:36,984 --> 01:32:38,178
I do.

1282
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,957
But if Steve...

1283
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:47,859
if Steve died for nothing...

1284
01:32:49,871 --> 01:32:52,772
if we let them
just bury his name--

1285
01:32:52,874 --> 01:32:56,241
Who do you think
you are, God?

1286
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,747
No, but there's
just no other writer

1287
01:33:01,816 --> 01:33:04,751
who knows Steve's story
like I do.

1288
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:06,252
It's just a fact.

1289
01:33:06,321 --> 01:33:08,346
There are seven of us.

1290
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:12,793
Donald,
you're 43 years old.

1291
01:33:12,861 --> 01:33:15,295
What will one book do?

1292
01:33:15,363 --> 01:33:19,299
Do you think they're
going to let us walk out?

1293
01:33:19,367 --> 01:33:22,302
We could get killed
even trying to escape

1294
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:23,837
or thrown into prison

1295
01:33:23,905 --> 01:33:26,806
and still you wouldn't
get your book printed.

1296
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:29,901
The kids will
be worried about us.

1297
01:33:39,654 --> 01:33:41,281
I'm not God...

1298
01:33:42,958 --> 01:33:45,859
but we know what
this country's like now,

1299
01:33:45,927 --> 01:33:47,918
and we can't accept it,

1300
01:33:47,996 --> 01:33:50,430
and we can't wait for God

1301
01:33:50,498 --> 01:33:52,466
to come and change it.

1302
01:33:54,469 --> 01:33:56,903
We have to do what we can,

1303
01:33:56,972 --> 01:34:00,169
and this book is what I can do.

1304
01:34:15,423 --> 01:34:16,321
Morning.

1305
01:34:16,391 --> 01:34:17,358
Thanks.

1306
01:34:17,425 --> 01:34:18,824
It's for us!

1307
01:34:18,893 --> 01:34:20,827
Mommy, Daddy, it's a present.

1308
01:34:20,895 --> 01:34:22,328
Can we open it?

1309
01:34:22,397 --> 01:34:24,331
If it's addressed to you.

1310
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:26,867
What's all this noise?

1311
01:34:26,935 --> 01:34:29,369
It's got a picture of Steve.

1312
01:34:29,437 --> 01:34:31,371
What is it, T-shirt?

1313
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:32,406
Here, Mary.

1314
01:34:32,474 --> 01:34:33,907
I bet it fits.

1315
01:34:33,975 --> 01:34:35,272
Wendy...

1316
01:34:36,444 --> 01:34:38,912
is there a return address
on there?

1317
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,878
No, Dad.

1318
01:34:39,948 --> 01:34:41,040
He's becoming a legend.

1319
01:34:41,116 --> 01:34:42,048
Aah! Aah!

1320
01:34:42,117 --> 01:34:43,049
Mommy! Daddy!

1321
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:44,585
What is it?

1322
01:34:44,652 --> 01:34:46,119
Get it off her!

1323
01:34:46,187 --> 01:34:47,586
My eyes!

1324
01:34:47,655 --> 01:34:49,122
Call Dr. James.

1325
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:50,122
Yes.

1326
01:34:50,191 --> 01:34:51,123
Quick.

1327
01:34:51,192 --> 01:34:52,159
It's OK.

1328
01:34:52,227 --> 01:34:54,354
Mom, my hands are itching.

1329
01:34:54,429 --> 01:34:55,919
Aah!

1330
01:34:55,997 --> 01:34:58,431
It's all right.
It's all right.

1331
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,933
What is it?

1332
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:02,902
Some kind of burn.
I don't know.

1333
01:35:02,971 --> 01:35:05,201
Get it off.
Get it off.

1334
01:35:05,273 --> 01:35:06,900
My hands are burning.

1335
01:35:06,975 --> 01:35:09,341
Duncan, go upstairs
and rinse them!

1336
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:10,435
lzandla baleka bhuti.

1337
01:35:10,512 --> 01:35:13,970
You heard what Evalina said.
Now go!

1338
01:35:14,049 --> 01:35:15,016
Aah!

1339
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,778
Aah!

1340
01:35:21,022 --> 01:35:23,513
That was Don on the phone.

1341
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,495
He says he has proof
beyond doubt

1342
01:35:28,563 --> 01:35:31,555
that the security police
sent those T-shirts.

1343
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:49,607
How could they do this to her?

1344
01:35:56,091 --> 01:35:59,117
I think that book
should be published.

1345
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:29,548
Bruce!

1346
01:36:29,657 --> 01:36:31,090
God, you scared me.

1347
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:34,128
I was expecting you
the other way.

1348
01:36:34,195 --> 01:36:35,628
If I go there,

1349
01:36:35,697 --> 01:36:37,597
they'll know where I am

1350
01:36:37,665 --> 01:36:39,098
and who I'm with.

1351
01:36:39,167 --> 01:36:40,634
They didn't see me.

1352
01:36:40,702 --> 01:36:43,603
You ought to report them
for neglect of duty.

1353
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:46,504
You're cheerful.
You've got good news?

1354
01:36:46,574 --> 01:36:48,508
Yeah. It's out of date,

1355
01:36:48,576 --> 01:36:50,009
but we doctored that.

1356
01:36:50,078 --> 01:36:51,739
It wouldn't get you
out of Jo'burg.

1357
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:53,906
In the sticks,
it ought to work

1358
01:36:53,948 --> 01:36:56,314
as identification.

1359
01:36:56,384 --> 01:36:58,011
''Father David C. Curren.''

1360
01:36:58,987 --> 01:37:00,181
Irishman.

1361
01:37:01,156 --> 01:37:03,124
How did you get it?

1362
01:37:03,191 --> 01:37:04,624
Father Kani lifted it.

1363
01:37:04,692 --> 01:37:07,752
He said he felt sure
Father Curren would agree,

1364
01:37:07,862 --> 01:37:09,625
but for safety's sake,

1365
01:37:09,697 --> 01:37:11,631
he'd explain to him later.

1366
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:12,666
''Black hair.''

1367
01:37:12,734 --> 01:37:15,168
If the light wasn't too good,

1368
01:37:15,236 --> 01:37:17,136
I suppose it could work.

1369
01:37:17,205 --> 01:37:20,140
You sure those buggers
aren't behind us?

1370
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:21,641
Yeah. It's all right.

1371
01:37:21,709 --> 01:37:23,199
Good.

1372
01:37:23,278 --> 01:37:26,679
This looks like a logical place
to get lost.

1373
01:37:27,749 --> 01:37:29,774
Let's look at the map.

1374
01:37:35,757 --> 01:37:38,191
Flying you to Botswana is out.

1375
01:37:38,259 --> 01:37:39,726
But we have to.

1376
01:37:39,794 --> 01:37:41,694
We can't get a plane

1377
01:37:41,763 --> 01:37:44,231
with the amount of fuel needed

1378
01:37:44,299 --> 01:37:45,732
without tipping our hand.

1379
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,268
We're going to take you out

1380
01:37:48,336 --> 01:37:49,735
via Lesotho instead.

1381
01:37:49,804 --> 01:37:53,262
We think New Year's Eve
is the best time.

1382
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:54,239
Everybody's drunk.

1383
01:37:54,309 --> 01:37:56,607
You turn yourself
into Father Curren

1384
01:37:56,678 --> 01:37:57,975
and get up here,

1385
01:37:58,046 --> 01:37:59,479
north of Queenstown.

1386
01:37:59,547 --> 01:38:00,912
Kani will meet you

1387
01:38:00,982 --> 01:38:03,951
and drive you toward
St. Theresa's Mission.

1388
01:38:04,018 --> 01:38:06,919
That's a bunch of nuns
on Lesotho's border.

1389
01:38:06,988 --> 01:38:08,751
Two priests-- It's perfect.

1390
01:38:08,823 --> 01:38:10,051
Once you're there,

1391
01:38:10,124 --> 01:38:12,058
the border's only a river.

1392
01:38:12,126 --> 01:38:14,094
You can wade across it.

1393
01:38:14,162 --> 01:38:16,062
I'm a priest wading
across the border?

1394
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,064
You do it at night,

1395
01:38:18,132 --> 01:38:19,895
and once you're across,

1396
01:38:20,001 --> 01:38:22,902
I'll be here
to drive you to Maseru

1397
01:38:22,971 --> 01:38:25,405
before the police
know what's going on.

1398
01:38:25,473 --> 01:38:28,909
From there, you can
fly out to Botswana.

1399
01:38:28,977 --> 01:38:31,445
The airline
is run by a Canadian

1400
01:38:31,512 --> 01:38:32,774
with an Aussie

1401
01:38:32,847 --> 01:38:35,543
and two New Zealanders
as pilots.

1402
01:38:35,617 --> 01:38:36,777
If I get out,

1403
01:38:36,851 --> 01:38:40,309
I'll regret giving you
your biggest scoop.

1404
01:38:40,421 --> 01:38:43,879
I've had bigger scoops
on an ice-cream cone.

1405
01:38:46,194 --> 01:38:48,321
Why do I have
to go so far north

1406
01:38:48,396 --> 01:38:50,023
before I meet Father Kani?

1407
01:38:50,098 --> 01:38:53,431
Arms are arriving
on roads near the border.

1408
01:38:53,501 --> 01:38:55,264
Don't worry about them.

1409
01:38:55,336 --> 01:38:57,463
Any car registered
out of district

1410
01:38:57,572 --> 01:38:59,164
is automatically checked.

1411
01:38:59,274 --> 01:39:01,674
He's going there
to get a local car.

1412
01:39:01,743 --> 01:39:04,075
He's a hell of a bloke, Kani.

1413
01:39:04,145 --> 01:39:05,942
For a black guy to do this...

1414
01:39:06,014 --> 01:39:08,744
I know the risk he's taking.

1415
01:39:08,816 --> 01:39:11,284
How do I get past Queenstown?

1416
01:39:11,352 --> 01:39:12,979
It's a long way.

1417
01:39:13,054 --> 01:39:15,386
You hitchhike, Father Curren.

1418
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:17,424
You bloody hitchhike.

1419
01:39:17,492 --> 01:39:19,756
That way,
if you do get caught,

1420
01:39:19,827 --> 01:39:23,627
you won't take Wendy
and Kani down with you.

1421
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,770
By 5:00, New Year's Eve,

1422
01:39:34,876 --> 01:39:38,039
all the white police
will be off for parties.

1423
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,548
You hitchhike
to the rendezvous point.

1424
01:39:41,616 --> 01:39:43,311
It should be easy

1425
01:39:43,384 --> 01:39:45,477
if you don't leave too late.

1426
01:39:46,621 --> 01:39:48,282
What if someone phones me,

1427
01:39:48,356 --> 01:39:49,516
and I'm not there?

1428
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,750
The plan's--

1429
01:39:50,825 --> 01:39:52,486
In actual fact,

1430
01:39:52,593 --> 01:39:55,255
New Year's Eve you've
gone to bed quite drunk.

1431
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:58,791
Nobody will question that.

1432
01:39:58,866 --> 01:40:02,131
The next morning,
Wendy drives off to the beach,

1433
01:40:02,203 --> 01:40:05,764
only she really goes
to her parents in Umtata.

1434
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,808
If you make it,

1435
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:11,140
you phone her the minute
you are in Lesotho--

1436
01:40:11,245 --> 01:40:13,975
you've arranged.

1437
01:40:14,048 --> 01:40:16,983
She takes the children
north to the border

1438
01:40:17,051 --> 01:40:19,178
before they have time
to pick her up.

1439
01:40:19,253 --> 01:40:20,880
If you don't make it,

1440
01:40:20,955 --> 01:40:22,923
and there's no phone call,

1441
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,821
she turns right around

1442
01:40:24,892 --> 01:40:26,621
and goes straight back home.

1443
01:40:26,694 --> 01:40:29,026
So that she can't be accused

1444
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:31,496
of being a party to it.

1445
01:40:31,566 --> 01:40:33,295
If I make it,

1446
01:40:33,368 --> 01:40:36,132
they're going to suspect
your involvement.

1447
01:40:36,204 --> 01:40:38,104
Oh, probably.

1448
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:40,163
But as a man of the cloth,

1449
01:40:40,241 --> 01:40:42,675
it's proof they'll be missing.

1450
01:40:42,744 --> 01:40:44,939
In my case,

1451
01:40:45,012 --> 01:40:47,378
I think they'll want it.

1452
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:14,107
Can we stay up tonight?

1453
01:41:14,175 --> 01:41:16,006
Why don't you ask Mom?

1454
01:41:16,077 --> 01:41:18,068
Mary, come on!

1455
01:41:18,146 --> 01:41:20,546
Can we stay up
on New Year's Eve?

1456
01:41:20,615 --> 01:41:22,412
We'll get undressed first.

1457
01:41:22,483 --> 01:41:23,745
Just wait and see.

1458
01:41:23,818 --> 01:41:25,752
Let's all get
in the car first.

1459
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:26,787
In you go, Charlie.

1460
01:41:26,888 --> 01:41:28,412
Get in?

1461
01:41:28,523 --> 01:41:30,718
Duncan,
your ice cream's melting.

1462
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:32,419
Charlie, don't lick me.

1463
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:35,026
If you do get ready,

1464
01:41:35,096 --> 01:41:37,291
I've rented a film
and some cartoons,

1465
01:41:37,365 --> 01:41:40,129
and you can watch
till midnight.

1466
01:41:40,201 --> 01:41:42,863
Is Dad going
to watch with us?

1467
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:45,803
I thought you'd like
to ask Alan and Greg.

1468
01:41:45,873 --> 01:41:48,967
So Dad will have to skip it.

1469
01:41:49,043 --> 01:41:52,342
You know his thoughts
on your movie choices.

1470
01:41:52,413 --> 01:41:55,007
Daddy doesn't know
what good movies are.

1471
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:57,607
Yeah.

1472
01:42:01,823 --> 01:42:03,518
We're home.

1473
01:42:03,624 --> 01:42:05,182
We're home.
We have ice cream.

1474
01:42:05,293 --> 01:42:07,318
Take off your jacket.

1475
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:19,333
I saw Alice and Larry
at the beach.

1476
01:42:19,407 --> 01:42:20,339
I must phone him.

1477
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:21,931
Maybe he'd come over

1478
01:42:22,043 --> 01:42:25,308
and play chess with me
next week.

1479
01:42:27,348 --> 01:42:30,112
Did you, uh,
pick up the projector?

1480
01:42:30,184 --> 01:42:33,847
Damn. The kids
wanted ice cream,

1481
01:42:33,921 --> 01:42:35,786
so I came home the other way.

1482
01:42:35,857 --> 01:42:38,690
We even talked about it.

1483
01:42:38,793 --> 01:42:41,785
I'll have to pick it up later.

1484
01:42:41,896 --> 01:42:44,831
Stupid.

1485
01:43:18,232 --> 01:43:20,427
Happy New Year.

1486
01:43:32,446 --> 01:43:34,744
Donald?

1487
01:43:39,487 --> 01:43:42,081
God, they're so predictable.

1488
01:43:52,433 --> 01:43:53,923
Gavin, it's my turn.

1489
01:43:54,035 --> 01:43:55,502
No, it's not.

1490
01:43:55,603 --> 01:43:57,571
Come on, Duncan.

1491
01:43:59,407 --> 01:44:00,305
Ahem.

1492
01:44:01,142 --> 01:44:02,871
No, no, no, Duncan.

1493
01:44:02,944 --> 01:44:04,775
I keep telling you all.

1494
01:44:04,845 --> 01:44:08,303
Now watch-- watch this,
Gavin, Mary.

1495
01:44:08,382 --> 01:44:10,680
You bend the back
low on the table,

1496
01:44:10,785 --> 01:44:12,446
your hand flat.

1497
01:44:16,157 --> 01:44:18,717
If they see you
and say one word...

1498
01:44:18,793 --> 01:44:21,455
I can't do that.

1499
01:44:25,232 --> 01:44:27,632
Where's Evalin?
Is she in her room?

1500
01:44:27,702 --> 01:44:30,728
No. I sent her
over the road

1501
01:44:30,838 --> 01:44:32,772
to get hamburger buns.

1502
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,774
She wasn't too pleased.

1503
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,074
Well, if I've got to pick up
that damned projector

1504
01:45:15,182 --> 01:45:17,673
I might as well do it now.

1505
01:47:04,425 --> 01:47:07,360
Any chance of a lift
to King William's Town?

1506
01:47:07,428 --> 01:47:10,090
I'm just dropping him.

1507
01:47:10,164 --> 01:47:11,495
Thanks.

1508
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:16,201
No goodbyes, Father Curren.
Off you go.

1509
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:18,238
And take care of yourself.

1510
01:47:18,305 --> 01:47:21,297
Thank you for the ride,
Mrs. Woods.

1511
01:47:28,582 --> 01:47:30,573
Wendy...

1512
01:47:30,651 --> 01:47:32,778
don't forget to pick up
the projector.

1513
01:47:32,853 --> 01:47:33,945
The what?

1514
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:35,750
The projector.

1515
01:47:35,823 --> 01:47:37,723
Oh, my God.

1516
01:47:37,792 --> 01:47:39,191
Thank God you reminded me.

1517
01:47:39,293 --> 01:47:40,385
I had completely forgotten.

1518
01:47:40,494 --> 01:47:43,327
I'll see you soon, eh?

1519
01:47:57,444 --> 01:47:59,412
The military, the police,

1520
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,380
yes, of course, I take risks...

1521
01:48:01,482 --> 01:48:02,949
all the time.

1522
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:05,018
But that's only unusual

1523
01:48:05,085 --> 01:48:07,485
if you think
we're a land at peace.

1524
01:48:07,555 --> 01:48:10,649
You see, in a war,
people take great risks

1525
01:48:10,724 --> 01:48:12,658
as a part of life.

1526
01:48:14,428 --> 01:48:16,419
Well...

1527
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:18,464
we're at war.

1528
01:48:21,402 --> 01:48:22,960
You need a ride?

1529
01:48:23,037 --> 01:48:24,402
Dankie, Meneer.

1530
01:48:24,471 --> 01:48:26,336
Maar hoever gaan jy?

1531
01:48:26,407 --> 01:48:28,466
Ampter tot
King William's Town.

1532
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:31,739
This side of King William's Town
is fine.

1533
01:49:05,112 --> 01:49:07,808
I'm going towards Queenstown.

1534
01:49:08,849 --> 01:49:10,783
Oh, don't mind him.

1535
01:49:10,885 --> 01:49:12,318
He just makes noise.

1536
01:49:12,386 --> 01:49:13,853
He doesn't do nothing.

1537
01:49:27,101 --> 01:49:28,534
I tell you, Father,

1538
01:49:28,602 --> 01:49:32,060
it's very hard to see you
in those dark clothes.

1539
01:49:32,139 --> 01:49:34,903
I couldn't tell
what you are at first.

1540
01:49:34,975 --> 01:49:37,739
I should stand under a light
next time.

1541
01:49:37,811 --> 01:49:40,279
Maybe you could let me off
in Stutterheim.

1542
01:49:40,347 --> 01:49:44,306
As long as you ride with me
through King William's Town.

1543
01:49:44,385 --> 01:49:47,183
Those white kids
will be drunk tonight.

1544
01:49:47,254 --> 01:49:51,088
Maybe they give me trouble,
but with a white father...

1545
01:49:51,158 --> 01:49:55,117
Certainly when it's not
New Year's Eve, it's a fine town.

1546
01:49:55,195 --> 01:49:58,631
I've met some good people
from King William's Town.

1547
01:49:58,699 --> 01:50:01,827
Yes, so have I.

1548
01:50:01,902 --> 01:50:04,837
The findings of the court
are as follows.

1549
01:50:04,905 --> 01:50:09,501
One-- that the deceased,
Bantu Steven Biko,

1550
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:12,443
a black man, aged 30,

1551
01:50:12,513 --> 01:50:14,640
died on September 12th,

1552
01:50:14,715 --> 01:50:16,649
and the cause of death
was brain injury,

1553
01:50:16,717 --> 01:50:19,686
which led to renal failure
and other complications.

1554
01:50:20,788 --> 01:50:22,881
Two-- that on
the available evidence,

1555
01:50:22,957 --> 01:50:25,858
the death cannot
be attributed to any act

1556
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,952
or omission amounting
to a criminal offense

1557
01:50:29,063 --> 01:50:31,588
on the part of any person.

1558
01:50:45,112 --> 01:50:46,579
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1559
01:50:48,449 --> 01:50:50,417
Hey, hey, I'm a priest.

1560
01:50:50,484 --> 01:50:52,418
Get away from this truck.

1561
01:50:52,486 --> 01:50:53,544
Get off.

1562
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:55,588
Get off,
you stupid bastard.

1563
01:50:55,656 --> 01:50:57,783
I'll break your goddamn neck.

1564
01:51:02,563 --> 01:51:06,021
I'll have to say some penance
for that outburst.

1565
01:51:06,133 --> 01:51:09,830
Oh, yes, sir, you're going to.

1566
01:51:09,903 --> 01:51:12,838
But you got me through
King William's Town,

1567
01:51:12,906 --> 01:51:15,898
so I think
God must be with us.

1568
01:51:22,082 --> 01:51:24,744
Oh, look at those red balloons!

1569
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,260
Mind them bubbles, Evalina.

1570
01:51:35,329 --> 01:51:36,796
You're having champagne?

1571
01:51:36,864 --> 01:51:38,263
Look at that lady.

1572
01:51:38,332 --> 01:51:40,061
Twelve seconds to go.

1573
01:51:40,167 --> 01:51:43,500
Mum, can Daddy come sit
in the other room?

1574
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:45,003
No. He's upstairs asleep

1575
01:51:45,072 --> 01:51:47,836
where you should be
in 15 minutes.

1576
01:51:47,908 --> 01:51:48,840
- Seven...
- Seven...

1577
01:51:48,909 --> 01:51:49,841
- six...
- six...

1578
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:50,842
- five...
- five...

1579
01:51:50,911 --> 01:51:51,843
- four...
- four...

1580
01:51:51,912 --> 01:51:52,844
- three...
- three...

1581
01:51:52,913 --> 01:51:53,902
- two...
- two...

1582
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:54,879
- one...
- one...

1583
01:51:54,948 --> 01:51:57,075
Happy New Year!

1584
01:51:58,352 --> 01:51:59,751
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1585
01:52:00,687 --> 01:52:02,086
There you are.

1586
01:52:02,156 --> 01:52:04,358
Happy New Year, Evalina.

1587
01:52:04,393 --> 01:52:05,916
Happy New Year.

1588
01:52:05,993 --> 01:52:07,358
Happy New Year.

1589
01:52:07,428 --> 01:52:09,362
Happy New Year.

1590
01:52:38,759 --> 01:52:40,192
In you go, Father.

1591
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,194
But why? I was just--

1592
01:52:42,262 --> 01:52:45,197
The locals told us
you were going to Queenstown.

1593
01:52:45,265 --> 01:52:46,664
We're covering that road.

1594
01:52:46,733 --> 01:52:48,667
If we don't run into trouble,

1595
01:52:48,735 --> 01:52:51,203
you'll get there in two hours.

1596
01:52:51,271 --> 01:52:52,670
Well, great. Bless you.

1597
01:52:52,773 --> 01:52:54,707
You're going to the mission?

1598
01:52:54,775 --> 01:52:55,707
That's right.

1599
01:52:55,776 --> 01:52:57,710
If it's not an emergency,

1600
01:52:57,778 --> 01:53:00,246
I'd spend the night
in Queenstown.

1601
01:53:00,314 --> 01:53:02,646
I'm sure I can
find a lift there.

1602
01:53:02,716 --> 01:53:05,708
You might find some
black terrorists, too.

1603
01:53:05,786 --> 01:53:07,185
Here?
In the Eastern Cape?

1604
01:53:07,254 --> 01:53:08,414
Of course.

1605
01:53:12,659 --> 01:53:14,286
Charlie, be quiet.

1606
01:53:14,361 --> 01:53:15,328
Shh.

1607
01:53:30,144 --> 01:53:31,202
Get in.

1608
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:33,302
Move over, Father,
will you?

1609
01:53:43,357 --> 01:53:45,848
Still want to go
past Queenstown?

1610
01:53:55,669 --> 01:53:58,570
But why do you use a phrase

1611
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,766
like ''black is beautiful''?

1612
01:54:00,841 --> 01:54:04,777
Because black is commonly
associated with negatives--

1613
01:54:04,845 --> 01:54:06,335
the black market,

1614
01:54:06,413 --> 01:54:08,779
the black sheep
of the family,

1615
01:54:08,849 --> 01:54:11,818
anything which is
supposed to be bad.

1616
01:54:11,885 --> 01:54:14,786
Then why do you use the word?

1617
01:54:14,855 --> 01:54:16,322
Why call yourselves black?

1618
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:19,518
I mean, you people are
more brown than black.

1619
01:54:20,627 --> 01:54:22,959
Why do you
call yourselves white?

1620
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:25,931
You people are
more pink than white.

1621
01:54:30,704 --> 01:54:32,035
Precisely.

1622
01:55:03,203 --> 01:55:05,137
Ufunuk' blika ap' mfundis?

1623
01:55:05,205 --> 01:55:06,672
This is fine.

1624
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:08,901
Nkoskakuku undincedile.

1625
01:55:17,251 --> 01:55:19,651
I expected you
three hours ago.

1626
01:55:19,753 --> 01:55:21,687
Hurry up. Get in, man.

1627
01:55:21,755 --> 01:55:23,746
It will be light soon.

1628
01:55:25,092 --> 01:55:27,856
In actual fact,
it does change you.

1629
01:55:27,928 --> 01:55:30,192
What's changed me
is getting here.

1630
01:55:30,264 --> 01:55:32,027
When I wasn't shit-scared,

1631
01:55:32,099 --> 01:55:33,999
I was waiting to be.

1632
01:55:34,067 --> 01:55:36,035
Well, come on.

1633
01:56:00,527 --> 01:56:03,724
When do you
have to make the call?

1634
01:56:03,797 --> 01:56:06,789
she'll go back.

1635
01:56:06,867 --> 01:56:09,734
You'll get ten years in jail
if you're seen,

1636
01:56:09,803 --> 01:56:11,236
so get out.

1637
01:56:11,305 --> 01:56:12,772
Hayibo!
I didn't come--

1638
01:56:12,839 --> 01:56:15,239
OK. There's Lesotho.
I'll get across.

1639
01:56:15,342 --> 01:56:16,809
Go before we're seen.

1640
01:56:16,877 --> 01:56:19,141
Easy!
Don't get me nervous.

1641
01:56:19,212 --> 01:56:21,373
Shit! The bag's split.

1642
01:56:22,382 --> 01:56:23,713
In actual fact,

1643
01:56:23,784 --> 01:56:27,083
it's turned out to be
a balls-up, hasn't it?

1644
01:56:27,154 --> 01:56:28,587
You've done all right.

1645
01:56:28,655 --> 01:56:31,647
There must be some way across.
Just go.

1646
01:56:31,725 --> 01:56:33,022
When you get desperate,

1647
01:56:33,093 --> 01:56:36,085
go to one of us.
Use Steve's name.

1648
01:56:36,163 --> 01:56:37,994
Amandla!

1649
01:58:03,483 --> 01:58:05,974
If there is no more rain,

1650
01:58:06,086 --> 01:58:08,953
there'll be places
to cross tonight.

1651
01:58:09,022 --> 01:58:11,115
I can't wait till tonight.

1652
01:58:11,191 --> 01:58:13,125
I've got to go now.

1653
01:58:13,193 --> 01:58:15,525
How far is the Telle Bridge?

1654
01:58:15,595 --> 01:58:18,826
Likude. Nine, ten miles.

1655
01:58:18,899 --> 01:58:20,457
You cannot cross there.

1656
01:58:20,534 --> 01:58:22,900
I have a false passport.
Maybe I can.

1657
01:58:22,969 --> 01:58:26,564
Is there someone we trust
who's got a car?

1658
01:58:26,673 --> 01:58:29,005
I trust me.

1659
01:58:29,075 --> 01:58:31,100
And I have a car.

1660
01:58:32,946 --> 01:58:34,345
You...

1661
01:58:34,414 --> 01:58:37,508
Master Editor
Donald Woods...

1662
01:58:37,584 --> 01:58:39,245
escaping.

1663
01:58:40,587 --> 01:58:44,489
Ama-bhula azakunya!

1664
01:58:50,464 --> 01:58:52,989
The boers will shit themselves.

1665
01:58:58,638 --> 01:59:00,503
You're going to make it.

1666
01:59:00,574 --> 01:59:03,543
The boers
will shit themselves.

1667
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:06,738
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1668
01:59:06,813 --> 01:59:09,543
Kruger will shit himself.

1669
01:59:09,616 --> 01:59:11,550
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1670
01:59:11,618 --> 01:59:16,078
Vorster will shit himself.

1671
01:59:16,156 --> 01:59:17,555
Ha ha ha ha!

1672
01:59:17,624 --> 01:59:20,593
Botha will shit himself.

1673
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,127
Ha ha ha!

1674
01:59:44,217 --> 01:59:46,151
Well, I got you here.

1675
01:59:46,219 --> 01:59:47,686
Where's the border?

1676
01:59:47,754 --> 01:59:49,654
It's down there.

1677
01:59:53,226 --> 01:59:55,160
This will help.

1678
01:59:55,228 --> 01:59:56,388
Thanks.

1679
01:59:56,496 --> 01:59:59,556
You must not lose one page.

1680
02:00:05,772 --> 02:00:08,741
Someday, when things have changed,
I'll come back.

1681
02:00:08,808 --> 02:00:10,644
We'll have a beer together.

1682
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:12,771
I'll wait for you.

1683
02:01:13,073 --> 02:01:15,041
It's locked.

1684
02:01:16,409 --> 02:01:17,899
Yes.

1685
02:01:18,011 --> 02:01:19,444
It should be open.

1686
02:01:19,512 --> 02:01:21,412
It's 7:00.

1687
02:01:21,481 --> 02:01:23,142
Well, not quite.

1688
02:01:23,216 --> 02:01:25,047
Jesus.

1689
02:01:26,119 --> 02:01:28,610
Oh. Sorry, Father.

1690
02:01:28,688 --> 02:01:30,815
Oh, that's all right.

1691
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:34,291
What are you doing
on foot, Father?

1692
02:01:34,361 --> 02:01:36,727
Well, a friend
brought me here,

1693
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:39,799
and another's picking me up
across the river.

1694
02:01:39,866 --> 02:01:42,835
I'm going to Maseru
for 10:00 mass.

1695
02:01:42,902 --> 02:01:44,267
You'll be lucky.

1696
02:01:44,337 --> 02:01:47,397
The rain's ruined
the roads there very bad.

1697
02:01:50,944 --> 02:01:53,344
Put your bag in the cab.

1698
02:01:53,446 --> 02:01:55,914
I'll give you a ride across.

1699
02:01:55,982 --> 02:01:57,313
Thank you.

1700
02:01:57,384 --> 02:01:59,318
It's very kind of you.

1701
02:01:59,386 --> 02:02:01,650
I'm Father Wo-- Curren.

1702
02:02:01,721 --> 02:02:03,655
My name's Moses.

1703
02:02:03,723 --> 02:02:05,384
Moses.

1704
02:02:07,994 --> 02:02:11,020
Yes, of course,
it would be, wouldn't it?

1705
02:02:13,166 --> 02:02:14,633
Say goodbye to Evalin.

1706
02:02:14,701 --> 02:02:15,929
But why?

1707
02:02:16,002 --> 02:02:17,435
To be polite.

1708
02:02:17,504 --> 02:02:18,971
Bye, Evalina.

1709
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:19,971
Be good.

1710
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,941
If that dog stays
away from me today,

1711
02:02:23,009 --> 02:02:25,944
I may make a cake for you.

1712
02:02:26,012 --> 02:02:27,138
Thanks.

1713
02:02:27,213 --> 02:02:28,373
Gavin.

1714
02:02:28,448 --> 02:02:29,881
I've told you--

1715
02:02:29,949 --> 02:02:31,917
Why can't we take Charlie?

1716
02:02:31,985 --> 02:02:33,418
Because I say so.

1717
02:02:33,486 --> 02:02:34,919
Come on, boy.

1718
02:02:34,988 --> 02:02:36,455
So long, Evalina.

1719
02:02:36,523 --> 02:02:37,751
Bye-bye.

1720
02:02:37,824 --> 02:02:39,382
Like the Americans say,

1721
02:02:39,459 --> 02:02:40,858
''Have a nice day.''

1722
02:02:40,927 --> 02:02:42,155
Hlamba.

1723
02:02:42,228 --> 02:02:43,490
Get out.

1724
02:02:43,563 --> 02:02:45,997
If I do make a cake,

1725
02:02:46,066 --> 02:02:48,000
I'll put marzipan on it

1726
02:02:48,068 --> 02:02:51,060
so you won't eat any of it.

1727
02:02:52,305 --> 02:02:53,738
You OK, Mum?

1728
02:02:53,807 --> 02:02:54,705
Yes, fine.

1729
02:02:54,774 --> 02:02:56,742
What sandwiches have we got?

1730
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:58,209
Cheese and tomato.

1731
02:02:58,278 --> 02:02:59,745
Bye-bye, Evalina.

1732
02:02:59,813 --> 02:03:00,973
Bye-bye.

1733
02:03:01,047 --> 02:03:03,572
See you when we get back.

1734
02:03:06,653 --> 02:03:08,211
Evalina.

1735
02:03:08,321 --> 02:03:10,585
I can't find my bat.

1736
02:03:10,657 --> 02:03:12,522
You looked
behind the television?

1737
02:03:12,592 --> 02:03:14,492
No.

1738
02:03:14,561 --> 02:03:15,994
Give Evalin a kiss

1739
02:03:16,062 --> 02:03:19,054
and tell Dillon to open
the garage door.

1740
02:03:20,934 --> 02:03:22,401
Don't get sunburned.

1741
02:03:22,469 --> 02:03:23,936
Yes, Evalina.

1742
02:03:24,003 --> 02:03:25,231
Come, Charlie.

1743
02:03:25,305 --> 02:03:26,795
Charlie's staying here.

1744
02:03:26,873 --> 02:03:29,865
Tell Dillon
to open the garage door.

1745
02:03:31,144 --> 02:03:33,942
Charlie, sit. Sit.

1746
02:03:34,013 --> 02:03:36,948
Dillon, you got to open
the garage door!

1747
02:03:37,016 --> 02:03:38,449
The master's still sleeping.

1748
02:03:38,518 --> 02:03:41,487
He had too much
to drink last night.

1749
02:03:41,554 --> 02:03:43,454
If there are any calls,

1750
02:03:43,523 --> 02:03:45,252
just take the number.

1751
02:03:45,358 --> 02:03:47,826
And he's not
to be disturbed.

1752
02:03:51,397 --> 02:03:54,264
Evalin, don't be cross
with me about Charlie.

1753
02:03:54,334 --> 02:03:57,303
He's just such a nuisance
on the beach.

1754
02:03:57,370 --> 02:03:59,702
I can't read or do anything.

1755
02:03:59,773 --> 02:04:02,264
He's always gone before.

1756
02:04:02,375 --> 02:04:05,105
Well, I'd just like a day
without him,

1757
02:04:05,211 --> 02:04:06,337
that's all.

1758
02:04:09,282 --> 02:04:11,147
I'm sure he'll be good.

1759
02:04:11,217 --> 02:04:12,684
Won't you, Charlie?

1760
02:04:29,435 --> 02:04:30,993
Goodbye, Evalin.

1761
02:04:32,739 --> 02:04:34,604
See you later.

1762
02:04:41,614 --> 02:04:43,081
Let me have it!

1763
02:04:43,149 --> 02:04:44,047
Come on!

1764
02:04:44,117 --> 02:04:46,642
Give it here.
It's not yours.

1765
02:04:49,923 --> 02:04:51,390
Let me have it!

1766
02:04:51,457 --> 02:04:52,685
Come on!

1767
02:04:52,759 --> 02:04:54,192
Give it here!

1768
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:55,192
No!

1769
02:04:55,261 --> 02:04:56,785
Give it here!

1770
02:05:10,944 --> 02:05:15,472
Die muder en kinders
het die huis per motor...

1771
02:05:15,548 --> 02:05:18,016
Take the father here first, sir.

1772
02:05:18,084 --> 02:05:21,019
Hey, we are both in a hurry.

1773
02:05:21,087 --> 02:05:23,555
You're always in a hurry, Moses.

1774
02:05:23,623 --> 02:05:25,056
Fill in this form.

1775
02:05:25,124 --> 02:05:27,524
It takes a letter four days

1776
02:05:27,594 --> 02:05:30,563
to get from Queenstown
to Maseru.

1777
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:33,531
You got to spend
so much time

1778
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:35,033
sitting outside your gate.

1779
02:05:35,134 --> 02:05:37,568
The telex is working again, Jan.

1780
02:05:37,637 --> 02:05:38,604
Good.

1781
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:40,070
According to Fenton,

1782
02:05:40,139 --> 02:05:42,664
there's more rain
heading our way.

1783
02:05:44,077 --> 02:05:46,978
We've got to check
our instructions, Moses.

1784
02:05:47,046 --> 02:05:49,480
The security police
might be looking

1785
02:05:49,549 --> 02:05:52,484
for a certain Lesotho
postal inspector.

1786
02:05:52,552 --> 02:05:55,521
That's what takes
the mail so long.

1787
02:05:55,588 --> 02:05:59,024
Your security police
got to read half of it first.

1788
02:05:59,092 --> 02:06:00,992
We know what's going on.

1789
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,152
We know.

1790
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:16,340
Father.

1791
02:06:17,877 --> 02:06:20,971
You're a brave man
to drive with him.

1792
02:06:34,761 --> 02:06:37,025
Is this your bag, Father?

1793
02:06:37,096 --> 02:06:38,290
Yes.

1794
02:06:38,364 --> 02:06:41,162
It-- lt's just some clothes,

1795
02:06:41,234 --> 02:06:43,168
shaving things, and a Bible.

1796
02:06:43,236 --> 02:06:47,263
Yes, I thought I felt
a book of some kind.

1797
02:06:50,476 --> 02:06:52,410
Bless you.

1798
02:07:02,689 --> 02:07:04,316
Hello, Moses.

1799
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:08,357
Ja reg.

1800
02:07:39,792 --> 02:07:41,760
Hey, Moses! Moses!

1801
02:07:41,828 --> 02:07:43,420
Stop!

1802
02:07:45,465 --> 02:07:46,864
I won't be long.

1803
02:07:46,933 --> 02:07:49,902
There's been some trouble
with the roads.

1804
02:07:49,969 --> 02:07:52,563
Here's a message for you.

1805
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:05,516
Donald, the important thing

1806
02:08:05,585 --> 02:08:08,053
is not to accept
their restrictions.

1807
02:08:08,154 --> 02:08:10,588
That's why those kids in Soweto

1808
02:08:10,656 --> 02:08:13,090
refusing to be taught
in Afrikaans

1809
02:08:13,159 --> 02:08:15,593
are taking chains off their minds

1810
02:08:15,661 --> 02:08:18,687
that no one can ever put back.

1811
02:08:21,834 --> 02:08:23,699
I made it.

1812
02:08:42,188 --> 02:08:45,419
I learned it as a boy.

1813
02:08:50,196 --> 02:08:52,096
Daddy's been
traveling all night.

1814
02:08:52,165 --> 02:08:55,100
But why are we going
to Granny's, Mommy?

1815
02:08:55,168 --> 02:08:57,500
I haven't got my pajamas.

1816
02:08:57,570 --> 02:08:58,969
They're in the boat.

1817
02:08:59,038 --> 02:09:00,403
If he crosses safely,

1818
02:09:00,473 --> 02:09:01,906
he'll phone us there,

1819
02:09:01,974 --> 02:09:05,569
and we'll join him
and fly to England.

1820
02:09:05,678 --> 02:09:07,805
What will happen to Charlie?

1821
02:09:07,914 --> 02:09:10,178
I've left a note for Evalin.

1822
02:09:10,249 --> 02:09:12,683
She'll take him
to the Bricelands.

1823
02:09:12,752 --> 02:09:15,277
But what will happen
to Evalina?

1824
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:19,157
I don't know.

1825
02:09:19,225 --> 02:09:22,717
Daddy left her
all the money he could find.

1826
02:09:33,806 --> 02:09:35,103
Niks nie?

1827
02:09:35,174 --> 02:09:36,402
Nee man.

1828
02:09:36,476 --> 02:09:37,909
Charlie, come on.

1829
02:09:45,952 --> 02:09:47,476
Hey. Hey.

1830
02:09:47,553 --> 02:09:49,384
Bless you, my son.

1831
02:09:49,455 --> 02:09:52,288
Wake up,
you sleepy Aussie bastard.

1832
02:09:52,358 --> 02:09:54,189
Jesus Christ.

1833
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:55,727
I'd given you up.

1834
02:09:55,795 --> 02:09:57,057
What happened?

1835
02:09:57,130 --> 02:09:58,563
It's all right, Moses.

1836
02:09:58,631 --> 02:10:00,030
Good luck, Father.

1837
02:10:00,099 --> 02:10:01,589
Hope you make it.

1838
02:10:01,667 --> 02:10:03,066
Shit. It's 8:30.

1839
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:04,603
Yeah. Let's move.

1840
02:10:04,670 --> 02:10:07,639
It took me two hours
coming down yesterday.

1841
02:10:07,707 --> 02:10:09,675
I really pushed this thing.

1842
02:10:28,294 --> 02:10:30,728
Now, where
is that child's doll?

1843
02:10:30,796 --> 02:10:32,263
She'll never sleep tonight

1844
02:10:32,331 --> 02:10:35,323
if she doesn't find it,
will she?

1845
02:10:46,445 --> 02:10:48,913
We're never
going to make it.

1846
02:10:48,981 --> 02:10:51,779
We can't get stopped
by the police.

1847
02:11:04,297 --> 02:11:06,765
Something very wrong here,
Charlie.

1848
02:11:27,086 --> 02:11:28,018
It's 9:15.

1849
02:11:28,087 --> 02:11:29,816
I haven't gone this far

1850
02:11:29,889 --> 02:11:32,357
just to turn around
and go back.

1851
02:11:40,066 --> 02:11:42,591
For God's sake,
move them out of the way!

1852
02:11:42,668 --> 02:11:44,067
Please! Move them.

1853
02:11:44,136 --> 02:11:47,628
Come on! Soo! Soo! Soo!

1854
02:12:14,967 --> 02:12:16,400
Excuse me, sir.

1855
02:12:16,469 --> 02:12:19,404
Which is nearer,
the British or American embassy?

1856
02:12:19,472 --> 02:12:21,736
We are a commonwealth country,
Father.

1857
02:12:21,807 --> 02:12:24,605
It's the American embassy
and the British high commission.

1858
02:12:24,677 --> 02:12:26,076
But which is nearer?

1859
02:12:26,145 --> 02:12:29,603
The British high commission
is there on the right.

1860
02:12:29,682 --> 02:12:31,172
Thank you. Thanks!

1861
02:12:39,692 --> 02:12:43,628
Excuse me. I have to see
the high commissioner immediately.

1862
02:12:43,696 --> 02:12:45,755
My name is Donald Woods.

1863
02:12:45,831 --> 02:12:49,562
I'm editor of the Daily Dispatch
in South Africa.

1864
02:12:57,710 --> 02:13:01,111
There's a Father Donald Woods--

1865
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:04,013
No, no, no.
I'm not a father.

1866
02:13:04,083 --> 02:13:07,712
An editor to see
the high commissioner.

1867
02:13:10,222 --> 02:13:11,314
Yes, sir.

1868
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:13,483
The high commissioner
is in London,

1869
02:13:13,559 --> 02:13:16,357
but the acting high commissioner
will see you.

1870
02:13:16,429 --> 02:13:17,418
Thank you.

1871
02:13:21,233 --> 02:13:23,531
I had no idea
you were a priest.

1872
02:13:23,636 --> 02:13:24,500
I'm not,

1873
02:13:24,603 --> 02:13:26,662
but I desperately
need your phone.

1874
02:13:26,772 --> 02:13:27,704
Please.

1875
02:13:27,773 --> 02:13:29,570
We understood you were banned.

1876
02:13:29,642 --> 02:13:30,734
I was.

1877
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:32,209
Is there a code?

1878
02:13:32,278 --> 02:13:33,472
No, no. Dial direct.

1879
02:13:33,546 --> 02:13:36,208
Would you care
for a cup of tea?

1880
02:13:36,282 --> 02:13:37,715
Ha ha ha.

1881
02:13:37,783 --> 02:13:39,717
I've come to ask
your government

1882
02:13:39,785 --> 02:13:41,218
for political asylum.

1883
02:13:41,287 --> 02:13:42,845
Our pleasure.

1884
02:13:55,201 --> 02:13:56,099
Hello?

1885
02:13:56,168 --> 02:13:57,965
Oh, Donald.

1886
02:13:58,037 --> 02:13:59,937
Yeah.
That was good timing.

1887
02:14:00,005 --> 02:14:01,370
She's just arrived.

1888
02:14:01,474 --> 02:14:04,773
She's just pulled
into the driveway, dear.

1889
02:14:04,844 --> 02:14:06,607
Wendy.

1890
02:14:06,679 --> 02:14:08,579
Wendy.

1891
02:14:08,647 --> 02:14:11,582
Donald, you haven't quarreled,
have you, dear?

1892
02:14:11,650 --> 02:14:13,743
She's got all the children.

1893
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:16,287
No. You better
not say anything.

1894
02:14:16,355 --> 02:14:17,788
She's just coming.

1895
02:14:17,857 --> 02:14:18,755
Oh, darling!

1896
02:14:18,858 --> 02:14:19,756
Hi, Granny.

1897
02:14:19,859 --> 02:14:21,121
Dear!

1898
02:14:21,227 --> 02:14:22,159
It's Donald.

1899
02:14:22,228 --> 02:14:24,196
Isn't that a coincidence?

1900
02:14:26,031 --> 02:14:27,760
Well, go on, Mom.

1901
02:14:27,833 --> 02:14:29,391
Answer it.

1902
02:14:35,408 --> 02:14:36,807
Hello, Donald?

1903
02:14:36,876 --> 02:14:38,434
Wendy, I'm...

1904
02:14:38,544 --> 02:14:41,012
I'm where I expected to be.

1905
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:43,344
Come as quick as you can.

1906
02:14:43,416 --> 02:14:44,974
He's there.

1907
02:14:46,118 --> 02:14:47,210
Hello, Donald?

1908
02:14:47,286 --> 02:14:48,412
Yes.

1909
02:14:48,487 --> 02:14:51,752
Shall we still make for
the Telle Bridge crossing?

1910
02:14:51,824 --> 02:14:55,692
Yes. From where you are,
you should have good roads.

1911
02:14:55,761 --> 02:14:57,228
But just hurry, before...

1912
02:14:57,296 --> 02:14:58,228
Just hurry.

1913
02:14:58,297 --> 02:14:59,662
We're on our way.

1914
02:15:00,566 --> 02:15:02,397
I love you.

1915
02:15:02,468 --> 02:15:05,266
I'm a priest.
You can't speak like that.

1916
02:15:05,337 --> 02:15:06,599
Just hurry.

1917
02:15:10,576 --> 02:15:13,545
All you kids go to the toilet.

1918
02:15:13,612 --> 02:15:15,341
Have you got biscuits, fruit?

1919
02:15:15,448 --> 02:15:16,745
Regina, come along quick.

1920
02:15:16,816 --> 02:15:19,910
I don't know what's happening,
but help's needed.

1921
02:15:19,985 --> 02:15:21,885
I'll drive you, dear.

1922
02:15:21,954 --> 02:15:23,819
Thanks.

1923
02:15:44,043 --> 02:15:47,137
You'll have to overfly
South African territory.

1924
02:15:47,213 --> 02:15:50,148
They demand all planes
land in South Africa

1925
02:15:50,216 --> 02:15:51,649
before going on.

1926
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:53,149
They can't stay here.

1927
02:15:53,219 --> 02:15:54,846
They'd never be safe

1928
02:15:54,954 --> 02:15:56,888
from the South African police.

1929
02:15:57,723 --> 02:15:58,655
Look.

1930
02:15:58,724 --> 02:16:01,420
We had hoped
to fly to Botswana.

1931
02:16:01,494 --> 02:16:02,756
The sooner the better.

1932
02:16:02,828 --> 02:16:04,295
Two-and-a-half hours flying?

1933
02:16:04,363 --> 02:16:05,955
Would they force a landing?

1934
02:16:06,031 --> 02:16:09,023
They have no shortage
of military planes.

1935
02:16:10,536 --> 02:16:12,504
Anyway,
my wife and children

1936
02:16:12,571 --> 02:16:15,506
will be at the Telle Bridge
in two hours.

1937
02:16:15,574 --> 02:16:16,632
We should meet--

1938
02:16:16,709 --> 02:16:18,142
In this rain? lmpossible.

1939
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:20,974
They'll have to stay
in a hotel overnight.

1940
02:16:21,046 --> 02:16:31,590
We'll have them met
at Telle Bridge.

1941
02:16:31,625 --> 02:16:33,558
Yiess?
Wat gaan hier ann?

1942
02:16:33,626 --> 02:16:35,025
I can't see.

1943
02:16:35,094 --> 02:16:37,528
I'm just taking the children over

1944
02:16:37,596 --> 02:16:39,723
for a little holiday.

1945
02:16:39,798 --> 02:16:41,129
They all under 18?

1946
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,189
Yes.

1947
02:16:42,268 --> 02:16:45,533
You can put their names
on your form.

1948
02:16:46,839 --> 02:16:49,307
You picked good weather
for a holiday.

1949
02:16:49,375 --> 02:16:51,104
They say the weather changes

1950
02:16:51,176 --> 02:16:52,575
every half hour.

1951
02:16:52,645 --> 02:16:56,479
By the time we cross,
it might be fine.

1952
02:16:56,549 --> 02:16:58,176
That's for sure.

1953
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:00,841
You've got
my birthday wrong.

1954
02:17:00,953 --> 02:17:01,977
Never mind.

1955
02:17:11,263 --> 02:17:14,255
You haven't put down
your husband's name.

1956
02:17:14,333 --> 02:17:15,493
James.

1957
02:17:17,803 --> 02:17:19,361
Middle initial?

1958
02:17:20,406 --> 02:17:21,771
D.

1959
02:17:34,887 --> 02:17:36,320
Have a good holiday.

1960
02:17:36,388 --> 02:17:37,320
Thank you.

1961
02:17:37,423 --> 02:17:38,788
Come on, boys.

1962
02:17:38,857 --> 02:17:41,826
I wish they'd get
the bloody signal straight.

1963
02:17:41,894 --> 02:17:44,954
They're trying to
tell us something.

1964
02:17:45,030 --> 02:17:46,019
Got it.

1965
02:17:46,098 --> 02:17:47,065
Wonderful.

1966
02:17:47,132 --> 02:17:49,327
Don't leave anything in the car.

1967
02:17:49,401 --> 02:17:50,834
Here. I found this.

1968
02:17:50,903 --> 02:17:52,871
I wasn't prepared for rain.

1969
02:17:52,938 --> 02:17:54,667
Take this. It's not much.

1970
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:57,368
You can't arrive in England
with no money.

1971
02:17:57,476 --> 02:17:58,443
Oh, Mum.

1972
02:18:09,421 --> 02:18:11,116
We must hurry.

1973
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:13,158
Write to us, my darling.

1974
02:18:13,225 --> 02:18:14,157
Bye, Mum.

1975
02:18:14,259 --> 02:18:16,352
Be careful, my dear.

1976
02:18:16,462 --> 02:18:17,656
We love you.

1977
02:18:17,763 --> 02:18:18,923
Goodbye, Grandpa.

1978
02:18:19,898 --> 02:18:21,229
See you soon, Granny.

1979
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:22,699
It suits you, Janey.

1980
02:18:22,768 --> 02:18:24,633
Look after yourself,
Granny.

1981
02:18:46,191 --> 02:18:47,681
God bless you.

1982
02:19:02,307 --> 02:19:05,174
Mummy, it's running
down my neck.

1983
02:19:14,053 --> 02:19:15,315
Are you all right?

1984
02:19:15,387 --> 02:19:16,547
Yes, I'm fine.

1985
02:19:16,622 --> 02:19:17,816
Is that too heavy?

1986
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:18,879
I'll manage.

1987
02:19:21,226 --> 02:19:22,386
Mummy...

1988
02:19:50,989 --> 02:19:52,149
Bruce!

1989
02:19:56,662 --> 02:19:57,594
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

1990
02:19:57,663 --> 02:19:58,595
Hello!

1991
02:19:58,664 --> 02:19:59,995
Daddy!

1992
02:20:08,574 --> 02:20:10,735
I thought you'd never get here.

1993
02:20:10,809 --> 02:20:13,710
Daddy, are we
going in the plane?

1994
02:20:18,517 --> 02:20:20,212
Welcome to exile.

1995
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:27,988
I've got to go phone in
that scoop now.

1996
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:29,618
Make you a hero.

1997
02:20:29,695 --> 02:20:31,424
I'll pay you later.

1998
02:20:31,497 --> 02:20:33,829
Ha! What with?

1999
02:20:36,735 --> 02:20:39,169
An Australian
news report has stated

2000
02:20:39,238 --> 02:20:42,173
that the banned editor
of the Daily Dispatch,

2001
02:20:42,274 --> 02:20:44,708
Donald Woods,
has escaped into Lesotho

2002
02:20:44,777 --> 02:20:48,213
by swimming the flooded
Telle River by night.

2003
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:50,214
His family had preceded him,

2004
02:20:50,282 --> 02:20:52,716
crossing into Maseru,
the Lesotho capital...

2005
02:21:11,837 --> 02:21:14,237
This is a moment
you'll want to remember.

2006
02:21:14,306 --> 02:21:16,206
So look happy!

2007
02:21:17,209 --> 02:21:19,177
Now get out of here.

2008
02:21:19,244 --> 02:21:20,108
Mr. Woods.

2009
02:21:20,212 --> 02:21:21,144
Donald.

2010
02:21:21,213 --> 02:21:23,078
Make sure my bag's safe.

2011
02:21:23,148 --> 02:21:24,172
Mr. Woods!

2012
02:21:26,819 --> 02:21:29,083
South Africa's told
the Lesotho government

2013
02:21:29,154 --> 02:21:31,418
they refuse transit
for the plane.

2014
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:33,355
They'll force it down

2015
02:21:33,425 --> 02:21:34,756
if you fly anyway.

2016
02:21:34,827 --> 02:21:36,556
I think they're bluffing.

2017
02:21:36,628 --> 02:21:39,256
With the media attention,
they'd look very bad.

2018
02:21:39,364 --> 02:21:41,298
They don't care about the press.

2019
02:21:41,366 --> 02:21:42,628
They've shown that.

2020
02:21:43,602 --> 02:21:45,069
Have we got a chance?

2021
02:21:45,137 --> 02:21:46,035
With clouds,

2022
02:21:46,104 --> 02:21:47,401
Ritchie's a clever pilot.

2023
02:21:47,472 --> 02:21:48,803
I'd say a chance,

2024
02:21:48,874 --> 02:21:50,466
but the longer you wait,

2025
02:21:50,542 --> 02:21:52,772
the longer they
can plan something.

2026
02:21:57,583 --> 02:21:59,346
If Ritchie goes,
we'll go.

2027
02:21:59,418 --> 02:22:00,476
Oh, shit.

2028
02:22:00,552 --> 02:22:02,144
Trouble.

2029
02:22:06,358 --> 02:22:07,290
Good afternoon.

2030
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:10,487
Mrs. Woods, Mr. Woods...

2031
02:22:10,562 --> 02:22:13,497
we arranged to get
United Nations passports for you.

2032
02:22:13,599 --> 02:22:16,659
The prime minister has decided
I should accompany you.

2033
02:22:16,768 --> 02:22:18,827
We must get aboard at once.

2034
02:22:18,937 --> 02:22:19,835
Good luck.

2035
02:22:19,905 --> 02:22:21,338
Bye-bye, Bruce.
Take care.

2036
02:22:21,406 --> 02:22:23,271
Send us a postcard!

2037
02:22:26,912 --> 02:22:29,710
We hope these passports
and my being here

2038
02:22:29,781 --> 02:22:32,011
might make
the South Africans hesitate,

2039
02:22:32,117 --> 02:22:33,345
but we're not sure.

2040
02:22:33,452 --> 02:22:35,443
It's the best we can offer.

2041
02:22:35,554 --> 02:22:36,452
Strapped in?

2042
02:22:36,521 --> 02:22:38,819
A friend of Steve Biko's

2043
02:22:38,891 --> 02:22:40,916
is a friend of ours.

2044
02:23:19,031 --> 02:23:20,589
How long before we're--

2045
02:23:20,666 --> 02:23:23,601
How long before we're over
South African territory?

2046
02:23:23,669 --> 02:23:25,694
About 30 seconds.

2047
02:23:26,738 --> 02:23:29,263
I won't be going
where they expect,

2048
02:23:29,374 --> 02:23:31,365
but they'll expect that, too.

2049
02:23:42,387 --> 02:23:43,820
Roger, hang on.

2050
02:23:43,889 --> 02:23:45,652
They've picked up
the flight.

2051
02:23:45,724 --> 02:23:47,988
They're demanding
to know who's aboard.

2052
02:23:48,093 --> 02:23:51,085
McElrea thinks we
must give some answer.

2053
02:23:53,932 --> 02:23:57,265
Tell them one Lesotho official

2054
02:23:57,336 --> 02:24:00,362
and seven holders
of United Nations passports.

2055
02:24:02,441 --> 02:24:32,469
Mac...

2056
02:24:32,504 --> 02:24:34,438
Have you heard the news?

2057
02:24:34,506 --> 02:24:36,667
Yes. Remember you're
on the telephone.

2058
02:24:36,742 --> 02:24:38,437
I know. But tell me,

2059
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:40,774
what are your sources
telling you?

2060
02:24:40,846 --> 02:24:43,815
The schoolchildren
in Soweto are on strike...

2061
02:24:43,882 --> 02:24:45,406
Hmm.

2062
02:24:45,484 --> 02:24:49,113
Citing something
called black consciousness.

2063
02:24:49,187 --> 02:24:52,486
They have refused
to study Afrikaans,

2064
02:24:52,557 --> 02:24:54,354
refused to be trained

2065
02:24:54,426 --> 02:24:59,022
simply as servants
to the system.

2066
02:24:59,097 --> 02:25:01,930
The name Biko...

2067
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,403
has been uttered
here and there.

2068
02:25:06,471 --> 02:25:08,496
Beginning of the end,
Donald.

2069
02:25:08,607 --> 02:25:10,973
Change the way
people think,

2070
02:25:11,043 --> 02:25:14,979
and things will
never be the same.

2071
02:25:15,047 --> 02:25:17,208
What's the government's
reaction?

2072
02:25:17,282 --> 02:25:21,150
Tense.
Troops have been sent in

2073
02:25:21,219 --> 02:25:22,618
to restore order.

2074
02:25:22,687 --> 02:25:23,619
Hell.

2075
02:25:23,688 --> 02:25:24,916
They're kids.

2076
02:25:26,391 --> 02:25:29,849
They may shout a bit,
break a few windows,

2077
02:25:29,961 --> 02:25:31,121
but...

2078
02:27:16,067 --> 02:27:16,999
Now stop!

2079
02:27:17,068 --> 02:27:19,002
Stop right there!

2080
02:27:19,070 --> 02:27:22,233
This is an illegal gathering.

2081
02:27:22,307 --> 02:27:24,901
I'm giving you
three minutes to disperse.

2082
02:27:25,977 --> 02:27:27,877
Go home!

2083
02:27:27,946 --> 02:27:29,345
I'm warning you!

2084
02:27:35,053 --> 02:27:36,077
Sergeant.

2085
02:27:36,188 --> 02:27:38,122
Get ready to fire!

2086
02:27:38,190 --> 02:27:39,657
I'm warning you.

2087
02:27:42,527 --> 02:27:43,892
I'm warning you!

2088
02:27:44,863 --> 02:27:45,795
Sergeant!

2089
02:27:45,864 --> 02:27:46,888
Fire!

2090
02:29:54,225 --> 02:29:57,194
But you, the black child,

2091
02:29:57,262 --> 02:29:59,162
smart or dumb,

2092
02:29:59,230 --> 02:30:01,357
you are born into this,

2093
02:30:01,433 --> 02:30:03,594
and smart or dumb...

2094
02:30:05,270 --> 02:30:07,261
you'll die in it.
