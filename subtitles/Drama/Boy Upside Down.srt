1
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:25,276
The universe: so full of wonders.

2
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:30,031
I can spend hours
and hours looking up at the sky.

3
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:35,077
So many stars, so many mysteries.

4
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,622
And there's one very special star

5
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:42,501
that makes me think of
one very special person.

6
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,505
Let me tell you my story.

7
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:54,597
At the dawn of time,
from the chaos came an exception.

8
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:59,143
One of the most mysterious secrets
of the universe.

9
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,482
You see, I come from that
very mysterious and unique place,

10
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:09,945
we are the only known
solar system with double gravity.

11
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,825
Two twin planets whirling together
around one sun,

12
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,704
but each with its own
and opposite gravity.

13
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:26,128
In our world, it's possible
to fall up and to rise down.

14
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,758
But, my story it's about love.

15
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,969
Some people say that true lovers

16
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,723
are one soul that is separated
when it's born,

17
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:42,853
and those two halves will always yearn
to find their way back together.

18
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,398
Well, to understand my story,

19
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:51,237
you need to know the Three Laws
of Double Gravity.

20
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:57,409
All matter, every single object
is pulled by the gravity of the world

21
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:00,454
that it comes from, and not the other.

22
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,707
An object's weight
can be offset using matter

23
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,378
from the opposite world
- inverse matter.

24
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:12,216
But the problem is,
after a few hours of contact,

25
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,595
matter in contact
with inverse matter burns.

26
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,935
These laws are as old as
the universe itself.

27
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,106
They are unchangeable,
and there are no exceptions.

28
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,400
Gravity.

29
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,362
They say you can't fight it.

30
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,698
Well, I disagree.

31
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:39,785
What if love was stronger than gravity?

32
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,707
Let's go back to the dark times

33
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,084
when any contact between worlds

34
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,089
was extremely dangerous
and totally forbidden.

35
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:59,013
Up Top had grown rich and prosperous,

36
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,473
while here, Down Below,

37
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,271
we stole inverse matter from Up Top
to heat our homes and to survive,

38
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:11,525
risking everything even our own lives.

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,152
I think he's there.

40
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,408
Hey! You! Come here!

41
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,498
Hey!

42
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,173
The only authorized
contact between worlds

43
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,425
was through Transworld,

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,094
a giant corporation Up Top,

45
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,139
created to take cheap oil
from Down Below,

46
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,768
and to sell back to us,
overpriced electricity

47
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,645
that we couldn't afford.

48
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,237
Because of Transworld,

49
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,364
I grew up in an orphanage.

50
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,492
You see, my parents
died in the Big Blast.

51
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:06,997
A Transworld oil refinery explosion
that destroyed much of the city.

52
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,086
Fortunately, there were the weekends.

53
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,256
They let me visit
my great aunt Becky,

54
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,508
my only surviving relative.

55
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,322
As well as Becky,

56
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,034
there were 2 things that I truly loved:

57
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,373
model airplanes
and Becky's flying pancakes.

58
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,127
You're going to have to get me
some more pink pollen tomorrow,

59
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,044
okay, sweetie?

60
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,382
Becky also initiated me
into an ancient knowledge

61
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:02,511
passed down over the generations through
the women of our family.

62
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,846
Now catch.

63
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:09,476
The secret of the pink bees.

64
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,907
Becky, how do they do that?

65
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,166
It's all in this book.

66
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,963
It was passed down to
my mother from hers

67
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,924
and, of course,
I would have given it to your mother.

68
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,888
One day,
when you grow up it'll be yours.

69
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,022
Becky would often send me
to gather pink pollen

70
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,358
from the Sage Mountains.

71
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:02,654
This was the only place,
and a forbidden place,

72
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,199
where pink bees could be found.

73
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,662
Bees that fed off flowers
from both worlds -

74
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,958
and without whom this story
could never have happened.

75
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,962
But, I have a little secret of my own.

76
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,634
I used to go chase
inverse rain from Up Top.

77
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,559
One day, I went much farther than usual,

78
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:37,147
climbing higher and higher
above the cloud line.

79
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:47,908
And that day,
that day changed my life forever.

80
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,748
Hey!

81
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,586
Hi!

82
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,709
Hey!

83
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,713
Hey!

84
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,092
Hey, where have you been?

85
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,928
I've been waiting ages for you...

86
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,596
Our neighbors got robbed.

87
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,390
They're saying it was
a thief from Down Below...

88
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,019
There's hunters with guns,
and border patrol trucks...

89
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,604
Are you serious?

90
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,648
Don't make that face.

91
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,361
I made it here, right?

92
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,363
Yeah.

93
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,115
Well, look... As long as you're okay.

94
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,368
Hey, look, I'll throw it up.

95
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:57,871
All right, ready?

96
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,206
All right, Adam.

97
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,430
Are you tied on?

98
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,223
I'm good.

99
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,142
Yeah? Okay. I'll pull in now.

100
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,038
Don't drop me!

101
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,546
Man, these ones from
Up Top are so good.

102
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,965
- They're the best.
- No, they are... They're amazing.

103
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,014
Wait, I got something for you too.

104
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,600
This is from both worlds.

105
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,643
What is it?

106
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,978
I can't tell you,
you got to close your eyes.

107
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,399
Close your eyes, come on.

108
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,652
- Like, closed, closed.
- They're closed.

109
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,196
All right. Are they closed?

110
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,788
Okay, open your mouth.

111
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,498
I can't reach.

112
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,502
Mmm...

113
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,927
How is that from both worlds?

114
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,429
I don't know,
you should probably ask the bees.

115
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,932
I don't know.

116
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:29,272
Imagine if we could go anywhere
we wanted to.

117
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,567
I mean really...

118
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,196
Hmm, can you imagine that?

119
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,658
Hey you know what?

120
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,410
- What?
- We can.

121
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:42,953
Come on. Let's imagine we can.

122
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,371
Let's go down.

123
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,255
Whoa! You're holding on?

124
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,633
- I'm ready!
- Okay, 3, 2, 1, go!

125
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,052
Aaah! Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

126
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,680
Whoo! Whoo!

127
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,893
I gotta go down! I gotta go down!

128
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,855
Whoo!

129
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,398
Oh! Oh, you're holding on?

130
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,983
Yeah! Oh my God!

131
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,818
Pull my legs down!

132
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,403
I got it! I got it!

133
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,783
Okay, spin! Okay, just spin!

134
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,326
Just spin!

135
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,457
Look at the branch!

136
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,625
- You good?
- Uh-huh!

137
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,585
Okay, it's the biggest one ever,

138
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,920
-all right?
- All right, I'm ready.

139
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,346
Can you hold on?

140
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,474
All right. You good?

141
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,517
Okay, you want to do another spin?

142
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,643
Yeah, let's get really high.

143
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,478
Let's see
if we can get higher this time.

144
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,437
All right, this is the one.

145
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,731
Okay, three... oh!

146
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,777
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

147
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,701
You know, we should go.

148
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:36,525
He's there!

149
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,943
Let's get 'em!

150
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,783
Quick, Adam! Ah!

151
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,214
- Ah!
- Adam!

152
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,802
EDEN!! EDEN!!

153
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,514
No! No!

154
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,945
No! No, please! Please, no!

155
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,821
No!

156
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,366
- Becky! Becky! Becky, I'm sorry!
- No! Adam! No!

157
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,909
I'm so sorry!

158
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,162
No! No! Adam!

159
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:35,959
- Becky!
- Adam! NO! NO!

160
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,171
- Becky!
- Adam! You did nothing wrong!

161
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,464
Nothing!

162
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:50,056
Becky! No! Becky!

163
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,351
Please, no! No!

164
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,021
Becky!

165
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,144
Adam, come on, stop!

166
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,354
Make us a plane! Adam, stop!

167
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,022
Adam, come on! Make us a plane!

168
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,983
Come on. I can't.

169
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,567
No, I've got to go to work!

170
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,986
No, come on, I've got to go to work.

171
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,988
- Please!
- I'll do it later.

172
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,517
Hey, Mr Jones!

173
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,415
Transworld!

174
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,209
Only one week left
to submit your application.

175
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,670
You've got to play to win!

176
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,423
Hello, Albert.

177
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,425
Mrs. Nathanson...

178
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,510
What do you got for me?

179
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,471
Inverse matter to pay my debt.

180
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,641
Will this cover it?

181
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,268
Mmm...

182
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,937
My husband says it's stainless steel...

183
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,814
from the main pipeline.

184
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,693
Pablo, it's ready!

185
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,405
Okay, don't start it
until it's fully applied.

186
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,740
Okay.

187
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,534
Okay, go!

188
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,462
Wow! That stuff is amazing!

189
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,089
Is it for sale?

190
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:15,804
Well, not quite yet. Nah...

191
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,848
We're all settled.

192
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,642
Thank you, and...

193
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,977
Can you keep me posted
on that beauty cream!

194
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,229
Will do.

195
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,772
You take care now.

196
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,734
You hear that, Adam?

197
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,154
We have got to finish this cream!

198
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,031
Yeah, well, I would love to,
Albert, you know,

199
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,867
but, with this equipment, you know,

200
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:38,868
it could take years..

201
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,621
A chance to fulfill
everyone's dream,

202
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:45,750
and transform his life
working for Transworld!

203
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,210
...And we're live Down Below

204
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:51,631
with our nine finalists feverishly
awaiting the results...

205
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,300
I'd like to welcome Miss Eden Moore

206
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,679
from Transpublicity,
a division of Transworld.

207
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,930
Hi! How are you?

208
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,640
- Hi!
- Welcome!

209
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,100
Thank you.

210
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,477
Now, she'll tell us
more about what she does,

211
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,937
but more importantly,

212
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,773
let's hear about our winner's new job.

213
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,650
Well, our division handles

214
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,361
all of Transworld's
graphic design needs.

215
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,613
Right now I'm working
with origami specifically...

216
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,532
That sounds fascinating,

217
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,076
but our audience is dying to know:

218
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,079
just what job
will our winner be getting?

219
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,541
Well, today we're offering
the winner a job in our department...

220
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,835
Here we go!

221
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,713
- Let's choose our lucky winner...
- I can't believe it.

222
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,131
What?

223
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,384
That's her.

224
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,594
- Number two.
- Pablo

225
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,137
- That's Eden.
- Number two!

226
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,430
Are you sure?

227
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,515
I'm totally sure. Pablo!

228
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,227
She's alive! I can't believe it!

229
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,353
I can find her, man!

230
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,355
I mean... she works at Transworld!

231
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,140
Attention! This is a final call.

232
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,143
Doors will be closing in five minutes.

233
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,440
Stay in line.

234
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,569
Prepare jackets
and personal objects for weigh-in.

235
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,572
Please remove jackets
and empty your pockets

236
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,699
of personal belongings for weigh-in.

237
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,785
Put your jacket in the bin as well.

238
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:56,125
Stay in line. Prepare jackets
and personal objects for weigh-in.

239
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,670
- Please remove jackets...
-165 pounds.

240
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,006
- And empty your pockets...
- Don't move.

241
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,301
New?

242
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,719
- Yeah...
- What floor?

243
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:07,595
Floor Zero.

244
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,763
Your name?

245
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,515
Adam Kirk.

246
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,351
Thanks.

247
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,447
Need some help?

248
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,489
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,909
I'm looking for a Station 15, Sector 8.

250
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,619
Third aisle down.

251
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:14,829
Thank you.

252
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:38,811
Hey!

253
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,369
Welcome aboard, newbie!

254
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,121
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

255
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,547
God! Damn it!

256
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,841
God... I'm so, so sorry!

257
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,843
Like, I had no idea
it was gonna do that.

258
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,681
Don't worry, my friend,
they do that to all the newbies...

259
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,267
Oh, great. Good start.

260
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,727
Name's Bob.

261
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,479
Bob Boruchowitz.

262
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,147
And you are?

263
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,067
I'm Adam. Adam Kirk.

264
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,527
Mr. Kirk?

265
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:29,445
Please follow me.

266
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,031
The Managing Director
is waiting to see you.

267
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,243
Right, sure, okay.

268
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:39,247
Psst. Hey, hey! Your back.

269
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,415
Your back, check it out.

270
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,963
Oh, right, that's...

271
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,506
That's pretty funny.

272
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,716
- Ho,ho.
- Mr Kirk!

273
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,510
We don't have much time!

274
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,430
Come see me on your way out

275
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,350
with a list of materials
you'll require for your work.

276
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,020
I need you to complete
your security clearance form.

277
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,483
I'll also give you your various access
badges and meal vouchers...

278
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,030
Come in, Mr. Kirk.

279
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,202
Come in, come in...

280
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:26,794
This anti-aging cream idea of yours
seems to be quite promising.

281
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,922
Your application has been approved,

282
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,509
but this is strictly on a trial basis,
you understand.

283
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,386
Well, of course.

284
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,513
Have a seat please.

285
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,806
Thanks.

286
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,393
Fasten your seat belt, Mr. Kirk.

287
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,228
L-- I'm sorry?

288
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,479
Your seatbelt?

289
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,607
Seatbelt... Oh, right.

290
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,530
Are there any questions, Mr Kirk?

291
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,491
Well yeah, I was just wondering what

292
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,328
all these people on my side do?

293
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,206
They're merely "adapters".

294
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,917
They adapt our products to your world.

295
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,422
You, on the other hand,
have a real opportunity here.

296
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,633
Company policy doesn't normally allow

297
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,427
for someone from Down Below

298
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,179
to hold such an important position,

299
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,015
but we're making
an exception in your case.

300
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,101
Sign here please...

301
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,536
Now then, a word of warning.

302
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,289
We scrupulously observe

303
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,875
a full separation
between worlds here.

304
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,585
That means there is to be no

305
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,505
unnecessary contact
with those Up Top.

306
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,549
Just stick to your job
and all will be well.

307
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,259
One last thing...

308
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,345
The rules are quite strict here.

309
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,513
As you know, you'll be working

310
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,139
with upper world materials.

311
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,685
This means that you'll be thoroughly
searched and weighed every time

312
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,603
that you leave the premises.

313
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,398
If they find any inverse matter on you,

314
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,776
you'll be fired and jailed on the spot.

315
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:18,614
But I have a feeling
that this won't happen in your case,

316
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,575
will it, Mr. Kirk?

317
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,371
No, sir.

318
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,790
Try not to prove me wrong.

319
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,462
Right then, dismissed!

320
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,049
Another massive oil leak
has developed,

321
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,510
following a metal robbery
from the main pipeline,

322
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,304
forcing Transworld
to double their security.

323
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,056
The three thieves from Down Below

324
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,766
arrested last week were hanged

325
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,894
this morning at dawn,
raising interworld tensions.

326
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,731
Here is a senior Transworld
executive with a statement:

327
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,107
They got what they deserved.

328
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,483
We don't go down to their world,

329
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,236
we certainly don't want them
coming up to ours.

330
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,112
That was Mr Lagavulin...

331
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,072
...Director of floor zero.
- Nice boss you got there.

332
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,242
And that's tonight's news on TTW7.

333
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,119
Thank you for watching us.

334
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,122
Adam, you did not have to do this.

335
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,791
I could've gotten you that patent
Transworld!

336
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,210
Transworld is the worst thing
that ever happened to us!

337
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,129
And what, now you're one of them!

338
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,257
- Come on, Albert
- Those people are vultures!

339
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,010
And you're gonna give them
your golden goose for peanuts?

340
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,887
I mean, we have nothing.

341
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,848
Yeah, we're from Down Below,
I mean, that's just the way it is.

342
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,267
I mean, we have nothing.

343
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,312
Don't you tell me I'm nothing!

344
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,064
This isn't nothing, this is everything!

345
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,776
And I gave you everything!

346
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,820
I treated you like
you were my own son.

347
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,238
And you know what you're gonna do?

348
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,616
You're gonna go up there
and you're gonna get yourself killed,

349
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:46,452
that's all you're gonna do,
is get yourself killed!

350
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,291
What?

351
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,590
Albert! Albert! Albert, come on...

352
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,383
Look, I didn't mean it like that.

353
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,512
Albert please, come on...

354
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,515
All right, all right...

355
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,266
don't you dare think that I've forgotten

356
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,478
that Transworld
took away my entire family.

357
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,230
All right?

358
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:24,490
Look, if I could use Transworld

359
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,910
and Aunt Becky's
pink powder just to

360
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,163
I don't know, just give my life
some kind of hope...

361
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,959
then I'm gonna do it.

362
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,087
Come on Albert, please.

363
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,510
Come on,
I need your help Albert please...

364
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,637
Come on.

365
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,436
All right, all right.

366
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,105
Thanks, man.

367
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,368
Okay, today we have someone joining us
for the first time.

368
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,370
Hello, Eden.

369
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,455
Hi.

370
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,624
Hi, I'm Eden.

371
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,334
Eden Moore.

372
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:21,839
Um, I had an accident
when I was a teenager.

373
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,342
Uh, everything before that is gone.

374
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,847
Sometimes, things
come back to me in dreams,

375
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,932
but I'm never sure if they're real

376
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,476
or if I'm making them up.

377
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,354
It's frustrating.

378
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,316
You know,
I know that whatever's missing...

379
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,817
It's in there.

380
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,071
But it scares me.

381
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:51,702
Um, mostly it just feels like
something's missing.

382
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,455
Mr. Kirk?

383
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,789
Yes.

384
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,376
Here is the key to your personal
refrigeration system.

385
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:08,344
And here's your very first
allocation of inverse matter.

386
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,470
Okay, great.

387
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,598
Be careful. Without cooling,
it gets hot very fast.

388
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:16,852
Thank you.

389
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,229
Hey!

390
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,982
Not exactly a charmer, is he?

391
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:24,944
Oh!

392
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:25,861
One o'clock.

393
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,321
Lunch time!

394
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,074
I usually go to the smoking room
after I've eaten.

395
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,992
Why don't you drop by?

396
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,703
We'll have a little conversation.

397
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,498
Okay, sure.

398
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:48,926
'Hey Bob?
'Mmm?

399
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,177
You mind if I come in?

400
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:51,971
Come in, come in!

401
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,347
Sit down. Hey!

402
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,348
You want a cigar?

403
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,349
- You smoke?
- No, no, no!

404
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,976
No thanks, I don't smoke.

405
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:59,853
Okay, fine, sit down.

406
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,407
See. empty!

407
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,743
"No one smokes
in Transworld any more."

408
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,246
Yeah, well I do so...pbblt!

409
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,419
You know, people have a funny way
of seeing things here.

410
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:27,840
Anything or anyone different is,

411
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,968
well, let's say, frowned upon.

412
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,680
Can I ask you a favour?

413
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,642
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

414
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,278
Could you get me some stamps?

415
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,531
Some stamps?

416
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,576
Yeah, stamps.

417
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,246
I, uh, I don't like to boast, but

418
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:03,500
I've got one of the largest-known
stamp collections Up Top.

419
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,420
And if you can get me some
from your side...

420
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,422
Oh boy...

421
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,758
Right, yeah.

422
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,719
I mean, sure, I guess...

423
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,263
Great!

424
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,142
So you were saying... Antigravity?

425
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,063
Yeah, you know,
I've been working on this...

426
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,648
It's an anti-aging cream.

427
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:27,649
Mmm-hmm...

428
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,610
Well, I'm here if you need me.

429
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,071
Expert in conductivity
and computer programming.

430
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,406
Anything you need,
anything, just ask.

431
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:41,330
Well then, I guess there could be
something you could help me with...

432
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:44,875
I was wondering
if you might be able to

433
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,630
get me in touch
with an employee Up Top?

434
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:52,299
Up Top?

435
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,428
Yeah. Her name's, uh,

436
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,640
Eden Moore...

437
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,647
Sure. Sure.

438
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,173
So what's your plan?

439
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,093
I don't know yet...

440
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,971
I'm working on that.

441
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,808
I mean... But you've seen
her though, right?

442
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:47,271
No. I mean,
I haven't actually seen her but...

443
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,273
But she's there, Pablo,

444
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,984
I mean she's
just like a few floors above.

445
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,115
Are you sure this is worth it?

446
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,410
I mean, it's been, like,

447
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,954
ten years since you last saw her...

448
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,916
Yeah, it's worth it.

449
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,246
It's amazing!

450
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,373
Oh man-- The man with no head!

451
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,083
I can't believe it...

452
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,004
Move please!

453
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,348
So what kind of shirt do you want?

454
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,016
Do you want, like, a sport shirt...

455
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:06,975
- No, no...
-... a T-shirt?

456
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,935
You want a button-down collar?

457
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,686
Yeah, just, like,
a normal button-down shirt.

458
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:10,854
Yeah, you want a jacket?

459
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,106
Yeah, like, I don't know, a suit jacket

460
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,658
Stay in line!

461
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,506
You may proceed, Mr. Kirk.

462
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,258
Thank you.

463
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,818
Now, this should be happening
any moment now.

464
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,071
If you watch carefully...

465
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,240
Here it comes.

466
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,288
How long does the effect last?

467
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:54,166
Well, right now, really only,
like, a few minutes.

468
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,543
- But we've been working on...
- Clearly not long enough.

469
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,338
Soon we'll begin clinical trials
on human subjects.

470
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:02,466
Obviously, we'll start with a sample
of women from Down Below.

471
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,093
I need quick results.
I'm counting on you!

472
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,221
Oh! Is that beauty cream for Halloween?

473
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,266
No, they've got different standards
of beauty Down Below!

474
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,352
The uglier the better!

475
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,441
Hey! Don't let those guys get to you.

476
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,693
They're just jealous, that's all.

477
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,738
You, uh... You're staying late?

478
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,739
Yeah, you know, I thought I'd stay

479
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,824
and just finish up
a few things, you know...

480
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,952
Right, okay.Well I'll take her back
to the kennel for you.

481
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,954
Come on girl!

482
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,581
Hey, you, uh...

483
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,875
You realize they don't
pay overtime, right?

484
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,210
Yeah, I know.

485
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,795
Okay, right.

486
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,630
See you tomorrow.

487
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,465
Don't work too hard!

488
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,800
I won't.

489
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,023
Hello?

490
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,192
Yes, it is...

491
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,945
No, I'm sorry,
she's gone home for the night.

492
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,448
Yeah, you can come by tomorrow.

493
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,617
Okay, what's your name again?

494
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,371
Bo-ru-chowitz...

495
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,415
Thank you.

496
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,375
Okay. See you tomorrow.

497
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,676
Believe me, Adam, it's gonna burn.

498
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:32,305
In a pinch, just use a little water
to cool down.

499
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,475
Please remember,
you won't last an hour

500
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,601
with these counterweights on.

501
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know...

502
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,942
What, Pablo, what?

503
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,444
What is it?

504
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,654
All right. What's your plan?!

505
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,698
Huh? You dress up in disguise,

506
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,491
you show up to meet her, and then what?

507
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,785
Then what? I don't know...

508
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,287
- You don't know...
- No, I don't know.

509
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,581
Alright, let me get this straight, okay?

510
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,708
She sees you, all right,

511
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,209
she throws herself in your arms,

512
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,795
says she loves you
and she never forgot about you.

513
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,838
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

514
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,299
Okay, then,
since you're starting to burn up,

515
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:09,926
you tell her you love her too,
but you really have to go,

516
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,636
and if you don't get caught or shot,

517
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,097
maybe you'll see her again in 10 years.

518
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,100
Besides, what...

519
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,145
You really think she, uh,
she just waited for you?

520
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,146
- Yeah, I do.
- You do?

521
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:21,938
Yeah, actually, I do.

522
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,232
Adam, we're from Down Below!

523
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,151
Okay, don't you get that?

524
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,570
Besides, you know what?

525
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,490
I bet she calls the cops
the second she sees you!

526
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,575
Come on, all right?
She's not gonna call the cops.

527
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,076
Adam, you're so delusional.

528
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:39,164
Why--why are you so obsessed with
those people anyway, huh?

529
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,668
You know, my brother was the same way.

530
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,881
Yeah, he went up there and...

531
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,051
Well, he never came back.

532
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,138
You wanna end up like him?

533
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,240
God...

534
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:50,879
Hey, Eden... It's... It's Adam.

535
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,423
It's Adam.

536
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,175
Oh God.

537
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,680
All clear.

538
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,267
Who's there?

539
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,062
Possible breach.

540
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:26,307
Eden!

541
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,231
Eden, it's me!

542
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,192
Oh yes, Mr. Boruchowitz, right?

543
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,902
I'll be with you, one second.

544
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,405
Wait! Come on, Eden.

545
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,369
Hi. I'm Paula,
we spoke on the phone yesterday.

546
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,830
I didn't realize
you guys knew each other.

547
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,665
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we do.

548
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,793
I mean, I can't believe
she would just ignore me like that...

549
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,338
No! No, she just forgets things.

550
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:58,631
What do you mean?

551
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,300
It's her amnesia.

552
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,137
Wait. She has amnesia?

553
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,306
Yes, since her accident.

554
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,141
- Will you cut these too?
- Yeah.

555
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,146
You wanted to see me?

556
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:19,152
Yeah, yeah, no, I did. Look Eden...

557
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,404
I thought that we...

558
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,952
I thought that... that, uh,

559
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:32,248
that this product
that I've been working on...

560
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:36,169
I thought it might
be of some interest to you,

561
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,797
professionally speaking.

562
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,925
Yeah, oh would you...

563
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,135
Can I-- Can I show you?

564
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,262
Yeah, sure. It's just a mock-up...

565
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,029
It takes a second to work so...

566
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,573
Okay.

567
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:12,956
You know, I've been working
with this young man

568
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:15,708
who's just recently started here
at Transworld.

569
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:18,837
But he had like a troubled childhood.

570
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:21,339
Yeah, he grew up in a,
like, an orphanage.

571
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,924
Oh, that's terrible.

572
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:26,636
Yeah, you know, his aunt Becky

573
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,556
was, like, his only real family.

574
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,599
Well, you should have brought him.

575
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,519
Yeah, well, um,

576
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:38,606
the truth is that he couldn't come.

577
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,441
Why not?

578
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:45,405
Well cause, uh, he's from Down Below.

579
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,329
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

580
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,041
I just don't know
why you're telling me this.

581
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,587
Right. Anyway, I thought the product
might be of some use...

582
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:01,796
Oh! That's amazing!

583
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,131
Yeah...

584
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:03,965
It's perfectly straight.

585
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,049
What is this stuff?

586
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,176
It's top secret actually.

587
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,680
- I like secrets.
- Yeah?

588
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:15,476
Are you okay?

589
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:16,936
Yeah. No, I'm good.

590
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,605
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah.

591
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,939
- I'm pretty good.
- Wait. You're sweating...

592
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,900
Oh really? God. Look at that.

593
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:22,775
Do you want a Translenol?

594
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:25,194
No, no really, I'm good.
Doing pretty good.

595
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:25,904
Okay.

596
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:29,449
You know what, can you just
excuse me for like, just one second?

597
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,075
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

598
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,869
I'll be right back.

599
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,251
That was funny.

600
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,818
Hey! Hey you!

601
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:53,491
He's not coming back!

602
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,368
Do you believe it?

603
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,328
No, I don't.

604
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:00,707
But he is cute though...

605
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,086
- I know...
- Mmm-hmm...

606
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:10,466
You know, I hate to say it,

607
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,010
but I told you
she wouldn't remember you.

608
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,970
Pablo, please!

609
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:17,473
She's got amnesia. After all that?

610
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,601
Boy, you sure know how to pick 'em!

611
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,980
You burned yourself
pretty good there too...

612
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,693
Put some more of that
on tonight when you go to bed.

613
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,069
Okay.

614
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,174
Everything all right, Mr. Kirk?

615
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,718
Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

616
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,219
Everything's... everything's fine.

617
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,181
Just, you know,
cleaning up a few things.

618
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,851
Here's the list of candidates
for your clinical trials.

619
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,729
Oh! Oh, great, thank you.

620
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,859
I'll come by at the end of the day
for your selections.

621
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:17,033
- Psst! Hey! May I see?
- Sure.

622
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:24,248
Ooh! Man! Jeez, with models like that,

623
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,125
your goose is cooked man!

624
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,668
What are they trying to do,
get you fired or what?!

625
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,462
I don't know, maybe.

626
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,047
Showtime...

627
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,802
What do you mean, showtime?
What's that?

628
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:38,012
Oh, you'll see, you know...

629
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,598
You just started here.

630
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,267
- You'll be out of the line of fire...
- Your attention please...

631
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,854
Before we begin
handing out the bonuses,

632
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,107
we have a list
of individuals whose services

633
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:51,484
will no longer be required.

634
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:59,909
Albert Midwall, Susan Gonzales,

635
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,620
- John Phelps...
- Believe me, my friend,

636
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,038
-if your thing works out,
- Juan Solanas...

637
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:05,706
you've got nothing to worry about.

638
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:07,583
- You'll be great, believe me.
- Jimmy Scotch...

639
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:12,672
Beatrice Amuchastegue,
Bob Boruchowitz...

640
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,842
- Mistake...
- Alexis Vonarb...

641
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,928
- That's a mistake.
- Aton Soumache

642
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:22,765
Um, excuse me, I'm sorry.

643
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,767
Did you say Bob Boruchowitz?

644
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:28,396
Well, I think that's a mistake, yeah?

645
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,529
There is no mistake, Mr Boruchowitz.

646
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:41,492
In light of your seniority,
you will be given a retirement package.

647
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,288
But your Transworld contract
has been terminated.

648
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,842
Jeff Duhaim, Emiliano Grassi,

649
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:03,723
Dimitri Rassam, Oscar Lopez...

650
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,143
Steven Craig...

651
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:09,437
Don't ever trust anyone here, Adam.

652
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,355
They're all a bunch of snakes!

653
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,358
That's it? I mean, you just pack up
your things and leave?

654
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,695
31 years!

655
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,114
They toss you out like a bag of garbage.

656
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,326
Yep! That's the Transworld way.

657
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:29,373
Now, this is for your collection.

658
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,376
Some things in here may come in handy.

659
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,712
You're ready?

660
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,088
Yeah.

661
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:37,465
Okay and...

662
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,760
I got it. I got it.

663
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,728
Hey, Bob... I'm really sorry.

664
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:54,440
Don't worry about me, my friend.

665
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,525
It's their loss.

666
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,237
Right.

667
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:03,241
Take care of yourself, all right?

668
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:04,742
Right!

669
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,119
Come on, old girl, we're outta here.

670
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:08,496
You're coming with me.

671
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:12,250
Knowing these jerks,
you'd probably end up in a tin can!

672
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,628
Come on girl, come on!

673
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:20,800
Hey, Bob! Thank you!

674
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:58,796
Out of office. Leave your message.

675
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:01,340
Hi, Bob. It's Eden Moore calling you.

676
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,467
I was just wondering
what happened the other day,

677
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,219
you just rushed out of here so quickly.

678
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,345
- Eden!Eden!
- Hi!

679
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,389
Hi! Hi! Hey, it's Bob...

680
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,016
What happened to you?

681
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:13,686
Listen, I'm so, so sorry for
disappearing on you like that.

682
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,479
Uh, you know what?

683
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:19,442
An alarm went off and the security
had everything blocked, so...

684
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,444
- I was stuck there for hours.
- Uh-huh.

685
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:24,238
No, no really! I mean,
I've been desperate to call you...

686
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:28,117
I've been meaning to call you.

687
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,287
All right,
well I'll let you make it up to me.

688
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,955
Take me to lunch?

689
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,707
What?

690
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,293
Yeah, you can come up with
a better story by then.

691
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,421
You want to go to the cafeteria?

692
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,965
No, I thought we could eat out.

693
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:45,926
Eat out?

694
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:48,596
- Shit!
- Yeah. You don't want to?

695
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:52,391
No, no, no! I'd love to.

696
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:53,851
Okay, great.

697
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,978
How about Cafe dos Mundos.

698
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:59,940
- You know it?
- Yes, of course.

699
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:03,194
Wow! The Cafe dos Mundos...

700
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,614
Is that a problem?

701
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:09,408
No, no! No problem at all!

702
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,161
Okay, great!
I'll see you tomorrow at noon.

703
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,538
- Okay, great.
- All right. See you then!

704
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,207
- Bye.
- Bye.

705
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,694
Welcome to Transworld.

706
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,863
Today, it's 21 degrees,

707
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:32,074
a beautiful and sunny day in Transcity.

708
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:35,578
Transworld wishes you a very lovely day.

709
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,362
Transoil : Energy for a better life.

710
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,406
We're building your future.

711
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,645
<i>“Hi!</i>

712
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:27,815
- Hi, Bob.
- Hey! How are you?

713
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,024
Good.

714
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:31,318
Look, I'm so sorry I'm late...

715
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,820
Oh, don't worry about it,
I just got here.

716
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:34,989
Oh, you did? Oh good.

717
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:38,701
So how come I've never seen you
around Transworld before?

718
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,913
Well, I mean, it's a pretty big company.

719
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,249
- I don't know, maybe that's why.
- That's true.

720
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:46,875
Do you live nearby?

721
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:48,961
Me? No! No. God, no.

722
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:52,590
I have a really long commute...

723
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,274
You know, I'm sorry, like...

724
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,317
You really...

725
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,027
You really don't remember me?

726
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,654
I mean, you know, if you look at me,

727
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,532
I mean like, really, really look at me.

728
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:23,829
You don't remember me at all? No?

729
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,082
Come on, Eden!

730
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,209
Eden, we know each other.

731
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,545
- What are you doing?
- No, like, we really know each other,

732
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,756
- I mean...
- Why are you doing this to me?

733
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,551
What? No, Eden! Eden please!

734
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,765
Eden, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

735
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:43,766
Come on. Sorry! Please!

736
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,100
Please don't leave.

737
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,977
Look, it was just a misunderstanding.

738
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,021
I just meant that we met before.

739
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,983
You know,
it was at the elevator at work?

740
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,736
You dropped your papers
and I helped you pick them up.

741
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,613
- You don't remember that?
- No, I don't.

742
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,159
Yeah, why--why would you, I guess.

743
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,619
Look, I'm sorry.

744
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,413
I'm kind of just
a little nervous, that's all.

745
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:09,166
You know, I didn't
mean to come at you like that.

746
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,585
I'm really sorry.

747
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,546
Look, can you forgive me?

748
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:17,049
I should get back to work, I think.

749
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,301
Can we just stay for one drink?

750
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,595
You can't stay for one drink?

751
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,305
We don't even have to eat.

752
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,974
You know, I'm not even hungry.

753
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,395
Unless of course you're hungry,
in which case I'm starving.

754
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,605
Yeah, I mean
I'll eat the whole menu twice,

755
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,483
if you just sit down
and have dinner with me.

756
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:37,569
- I'm starving, actually.
- Yeah? Good.

757
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:38,987
You wanna sit down?

758
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,787
This is an Upside Down?

759
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,205
I have to teach you
how to drink this now, ready?

760
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,790
I don't even know...
I don't even know what that is.

761
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:50,833
So...

762
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,209
What am I supposed to do?

763
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,712
You're gonna have to put it
to your lips like this...

764
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:56,463
Okay.

765
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:57,756
And just tilt it down.

766
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,176
- What?
- That's it.

767
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,726
- How could you not know?
- For a year!

768
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,686
Exactly, let's do it again.

769
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,104
Okay.

770
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,150
- These are good.
- Yeah.

771
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:17,651
- They are good.
- You got to take it easy though.

772
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,527
All right!

773
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,445
They're strong.

774
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,155
Hey, you know,
I want to show you something.

775
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,281
Sure.

776
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,534
It's a personal project of mine but...

777
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:27,453
I want to do it on a much larger scale,

778
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:30,164
but I thought your invention
could come in handy.

779
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,041
Wow! Wow, that's...
That's amazing, really.

780
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:34,460
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's amazing.

781
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:37,671
I mean, I'd love to help. Yeah.

782
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,840
That's the Sage Mountains right?

783
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:43,719
Yeah... I grew up there.

784
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,637
We still have our old house there.

785
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:46,388
Yeah, no, God.

786
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:47,431
We used to go there all the time,

787
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:51,351
and we used to go
and pick the pomegranates.

788
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:52,394
Yeah! Me too!

789
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:53,437
- There you go.
- They're the best.

790
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:54,980
They're the best.

791
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,651
Are you okay?

792
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,987
Huh? Yeah, no, I'm good.

793
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,491
I'm fine, no really.

794
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,075
- All right.
- It's just getting a little...

795
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,410
a little warm in here, don't you think?

796
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,578
Let's get outta here.

797
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:10,704
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

798
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,372
Yeah sure, we'll get the check.

799
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:13,999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

800
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:25,928
So there's this great orchestra
from Down Below.

801
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:27,346
They play here Friday nights.

802
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,431
They're incredible, you have to hear it!

803
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,266
Wow, that sounds great.

804
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,477
Okay, so I'll see you Friday, maybe?

805
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,730
- Yeah, sure. Okay.
- Okay.

806
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:37,523
- Bye!
- Bye!

807
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,608
- Thanks for lunch.
- All right. Take care.

808
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,859
Thanks.

809
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:39,162
Eden!

810
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,841
Eden, it's me.

811
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:13,989
Our demonstrator will
apply the full product line.

812
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:18,076
We'll be selling five separate creams,

813
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,454
and be increasing the strength

814
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:24,916
according to the concentration
of the active ingredient,

815
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,794
five being the most potent.

816
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:32,507
The goal is to tailor the lift

817
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:36,803
to the condition
of the various facial regions.

818
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,598
And as you see, a range of strengths

819
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,476
allows the consumer
to apply what's needed,

820
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:44,019
where needed!

821
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:47,564
For a general purpose product,
I think the Level Two will provide

822
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:52,110
visible all-around improvement
without any adverse effects.

823
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:55,655
But number five, being the strongest,
can work miracles.

824
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:57,240
And speaking of miracles...

825
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:01,453
Now, we are also developing a product
for the breasts and the buttocks.

826
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:06,166
Oh! I think it's ready.

827
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,544
Bravo! Bravo!

828
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,678
Any questions before we continue?

829
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:21,890
Yes. Couldn't we
market a cheaper version

830
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,935
for Down Below with only one product?

831
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,855
Yes, we could,
at the very lightest concentration.

832
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,734
The product doesn't hold up well
at very high doses.

833
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:36,738
Let's see what happens
with excessive application...

834
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:45,997
She had our product applied
about ten minutes ago, so...

835
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,472
I have a question for the demonstrator.

836
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,891
Mr. Boruchowitz, right?

837
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,659
Uh, I'm--I'm sorry.

838
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:25,829
You must have me confused
with somebody else.

839
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:32,794
My name's Adam, Adam Kirk.

840
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,111
Excuse me, I'm looking for Eden Moore.

841
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,154
Have you seen her?

842
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,488
Yeah, she just left.

843
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:05,660
No!

844
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:11,208
Damn it! Come on! Come on!

845
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,845
Hey! Stop!

846
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,015
Security breach, tower two.

847
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:31,645
Transworld:
for a better, brighter tomorrow.

848
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:36,233
Stop him!

849
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:39,004
Gravity: a revolution about to begin.

850
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,673
New, from Transcosmetics.

851
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,925
Uplift yourself today.

852
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:39,439
Hey!

853
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:43,610
What are you doing here?

854
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,653
I'm looking for my dog.

855
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:47,530
What's your name?

856
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,449
I can't talk to you.

857
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,118
Why not?

858
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,830
You're from Down Below...

859
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,959
I'm Adam!

860
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,440
You son of a gun!

861
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,567
I knew you were up to something...

862
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,778
Bob, can I come in?

863
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,238
Of course, that's what I'm here for.

864
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:29,531
Come on, come on!

865
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:38,456
Right, right.

866
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:42,335
Well I'm adding maximum weight
to the exterior layer

867
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,254
to counteract the heating problem.

868
01:13:44,379 --> 01:13:46,714
Now, my friend, try this for size.

869
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,718
If it fits, you are
through with overheating.

870
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:53,096
This is nice!

871
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,014
Bob, wow, this is nice!

872
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,517
Oh boy, oh boy!

873
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:01,104
Transworld are gonna curse
the day they fired me!

874
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:04,941
Yeah, look at that...

875
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,359
You got it?

876
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:13,199
- That's a pretty good fit.
- Good, good!

877
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,368
Right, well I'm gonna get back
to the outer layer,

878
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,078
the icing on the cake.

879
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:19,873
I don't get it.

880
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:23,084
It's impossible
to change gravity's status.

881
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,419
Are you sure?

882
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,796
Yeah. Absolutely.

883
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,799
Look, So now, all we have to do

884
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:35,263
is carefully mix the two
opposing solutions

885
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,730
and wait a second to stabilize gravity.

886
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:47,942
Yeah, and then...

887
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:52,405
Voila!

888
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:57,744
No! God!

889
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:02,749
That is better than
a good idea, my friend...

890
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:07,629
That is revolutionary!

891
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,842
But don't they have the formula, now?

892
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:17,972
No! No, I gave them everything
but the main ingredient.

893
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:23,228
Oh! I would give good money

894
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:27,232
just to see the look on
Lagavulin's face right now...

895
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:31,444
So are you telling me
we don't have the formula?

896
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,613
We, um...

897
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:37,951
Well, we tried to recreate it
several times, but the thing is...

898
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:39,536
We're missing an ingredient.

899
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:41,371
A pink powder...

900
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,665
We found traces in his office.

901
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:45,708
Without it, there is no cream.

902
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,336
Unacceptable

903
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,130
you better find him before the police get it

904
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:52,423
No.

905
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,154
You remember?

906
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:57,530
I'm starting to.

907
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,405
Border police

908
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:40,907
everybody out against the wall

909
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:42,408
Mam this way please!

910
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,035
- Calm down! Don't move!
- Damn it!

911
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:44,786
Let's see some ID!

912
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,913
- Listen... I gotta go...
- No!

913
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:51,000
- Identification!
- I'll find you.

914
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,252
- Hey. You!
- There he is!

915
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:01,844
Come back here! Stop! Stop!

916
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,221
What's he doing?

917
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,432
Don't let them get away!

918
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,809
I'm going to the left!

919
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:10,853
I spot him!

920
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:11,729
Stay where you are!

921
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,981
Go, go, go!

922
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,322
Breaking news coming in live!

923
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,533
Border police have launched
a massive manhunt

924
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,953
for the fugitive who just escaped from
the Cafe dos Mundos.

925
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:29,831
All national law enforcement agencies
have been alerted

926
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:32,542
and we will keep you updated
as the story develops.

927
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:40,419
Come on! Let's go!

928
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,261
Wait, wait, wait!

929
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,555
What?

930
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,599
I just thought I heard something.

931
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,479
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

932
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:08,823
There's somebody there! Go, go, go!

933
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,202
Hey you! Stop!

934
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,247
Eden, come on, Eden, come on!

935
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,963
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Don't let them get away!

936
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,381
Go, go, go, go!

937
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,642
Eden, the weights!

938
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,228
Come on, take off my weights!

939
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,234
Okay!

940
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,258
Eden! Eden, take this arm.

941
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:02,728
God...

942
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,065
Hold on! Hold on!

943
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,650
Eden, hold on!

944
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:09,735
Please hold on...

945
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,113
Hold on!

946
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,951
Don't let go! I'm holding you!

947
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,953
Don't let go!

948
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:27,545
Hold on! Hold on!

949
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,672
- Let go of me!
- No!

950
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:32,591
- Please...
- No, don't.

951
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:36,137
- I'm so sorry...
- No!

952
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:39,724
- I'm so sorry.
- No! No!

953
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:25,538
Wait! No, no, wait!

954
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:30,751
No! I haven't done anything.

955
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,797
- Get in the car!
- No! Please!

956
01:25:37,675 --> 01:25:40,427
I haven't done anything!

957
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:41,095
Here's the deal,

958
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:44,181
You give us the complete
anti-aging cream formula

959
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:46,767
and if you attempt to
contact Miss Moore,

960
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,687
the charges against her
will be reinstated.

961
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:52,148
Do I make myself clear, Mr. Kirk?

962
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,342
So that's it.

963
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:24,388
They won, and I've lost.

964
01:26:25,598 --> 01:26:28,601
I just lost everything.

965
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:34,273
They took aunt Becky
and they took Eden from me.

966
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:39,570
Oh. It's hard to accept
that I will never see Eden again...

967
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:48,370
I was naive, to think
that I could change the world.

968
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:53,500
You know up there, they always win.

969
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,672
And down here, well we always lose.

970
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:06,388
So I guess I just go back to
my life, to my world.

971
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:10,226
And I'll try here,
Down Below, to do my best.

972
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:19,985
I will never, ever forget her.

973
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,662
Gently does it.

974
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,973
Victory...

975
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,738
So... Is it true everyone's rich Up Top?

976
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,157
Don't you know?

977
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:50,075
It's total paradise up there!

978
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:52,536
Paradise?

979
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:55,581
Guys, I don't think so.

980
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:58,042
You know, I mean,
they might be rich, sure,

981
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:01,837
but... It's definitely not paradise.

982
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,220
Hey, let me look at that, huh?

983
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,182
What do you think, we should...

984
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:14,475
You think we should make this fly?

985
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,434
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

986
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:16,977
Yeah, yeah? We'll give it a boost?

987
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,562
All right, hold on to that.

988
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:23,817
All right, here we go...

989
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:34,119
All right... now try it.

990
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,038
Come on, throw it.

991
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:49,968
Hey, Eden. It's Paula.

992
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,637
Are you still sick?

993
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,014
You haven't shown up four days.

994
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:57,643
Did you get those strange
flowers we sent over?

995
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,978
I think they came from floor zero.

996
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,814
Let me know, okay?

997
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:04,483
I hope you're all right! Bye!

998
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:16,203
Bob Boruchowitz?

999
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:20,082
- Yeah?
- I'm Eden Moore.

1000
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:21,542
I need your help...

1001
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:57,911
Yeah, fantastic!

1002
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,331
Bob".Bob?

1003
01:31:01,457 --> 01:31:02,541
What?

1004
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,002
You think you're the only one
who can go upside down?

1005
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:08,589
You won't get rid of me
easy as that, old buddy!

1006
01:31:08,714 --> 01:31:09,965
I can't believe this.

1007
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,717
How did you do it?

1008
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:13,302
He)'. hey, hey, hey!

1009
01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:15,804
Check this out!

1010
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:21,894
And...

1011
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:24,021
No, no, no!

1012
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:27,357
Did you make a vest or what?

1013
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:28,984
I can't believe this!

1014
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,738
Oh! Oh! Put me down, sweetie!

1015
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,243
You're not even wearing a vest!

1016
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,286
- No, no, no!
- Where's the weights?

1017
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,580
No, no, no, no!
We're 90 percent water, right?

1018
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:43,832
So I combine upper and lower inversion

1019
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:45,584
with a hyper infusion, yeah?

1020
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,336
Yeah, now,
you know this better than I do,

1021
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:49,588
but the breakthrough man, the break...

1022
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:50,839
Oh man, I'm jabbering...

1023
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:53,425
the problem is, right,

1024
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,801
the effect only lasts an hour, right?

1025
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:55,886
I'll improve it, now, but...

1026
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,262
Hey, and you...

1027
01:31:57,387 --> 01:32:02,392
You my friend,
hey, you have a rendezvous.

1028
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,144
What's this?

1029
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,193
No...

1030
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:15,948
You better not go dressed like that!

1031
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:18,825
Hey, did you tell him?

1032
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:20,369
Hey! Another thing!

1033
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:23,830
The cream, well, thanks to your stamps,

1034
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:26,041
I bought the patent under the name

1035
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:29,419
Albert & Co, before Transworld.

1036
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:34,633
Nice! Nice!

1037
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:16,466
Adam!

1038
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:19,219
Eden!

1039
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:21,805
I can't believe it!

1040
01:33:22,556 --> 01:33:24,474
How did you get down here?

1041
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,727
Bob found a way to bring me down.

1042
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:28,812
I can't believe it!

1043
01:33:33,984 --> 01:33:35,152
But you're with me now.

1044
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:38,572
Really. I... I didn't know
what happen to you...

1045
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:40,824
Are you okay?

1046
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:49,499
I'm pregnant.

1047
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,627
We're having twins.

1048
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:52,919
Oh my God!

1049
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:01,011
I can't believe it!

1050
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,142
I can't believe it!

1051
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:11,438
How long can you stay down here for?

1052
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:13,482
Forever, maybe.

1053
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,942
Bob said it's because I'm pregnant.

1054
01:34:16,068 --> 01:34:20,072
He said you'd understand
how this makes me different.

1055
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:26,953
I love you.

1056
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,373
I love you.

1057
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:15,711
We didn't realize yet the repercussions
of what we had done.

1058
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:20,632
Our love would forever alter
the course of history.

1059
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:24,469
But that's another story.
