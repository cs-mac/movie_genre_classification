1
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,349
Don't make us worry, Cemal. Write soon.

2
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,029
Yes. And don't wait too long yourself.

3
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,754
How did you get a Swiss visa?

4
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,509
The man said it does not matter.

5
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,949
But is he reliable?

6
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,798
Without a risk

7
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,832
you can't even cross a river.

8
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,994
Mama Papa!

9
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,029
The children are running to the train!

10
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,591
Mehmet Ali went to the train!

11
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,311
Come away! - No, you go away!

12
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,949
You call this looking after each other?

13
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,390
And you look at your mother!

14
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,349
What's going on, scaring us like that!

15
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,989
Papa, did you bring us something?

16
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,038
Give the horse some water.

17
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,595
You yell at the children too often.

18
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,952
The man said it's better

19
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,071
if I take you along.

20
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,114
Already now?

21
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,994
Apparently they accept families easier.

22
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,073
So we will all go.

23
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,794
Are you crazy? How can we afford that?

24
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,989
Should we leave the children here alone?

25
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,396
Why alone? Mustafa is almost grown up,

26
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,796
Fatma is old enough to get married,

27
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,071
and then there are still my parents.

28
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,109
But when can we let them come?

29
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,911
How do I know?

30
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,589
Maybe soon or a little later.

31
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,110
I'm not leaving the children behind.

32
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,550
And what will I do there all alone?

33
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,549
You'll work, like Miisliim's wife.

34
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,197
The children here, me there?

35
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,478
No, I won't come with you.

36
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,349
You always throw stones on the path!

37
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,877
Papa, look what arrived!

38
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,995
A postcard

39
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,429
from Uncle Cemal.

40
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,194
Well, read it.

41
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,949
"Dear Ali Haydar. We have arrived safely.

42
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,074
Miisliim and his wife have found work.

43
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,515
We still have to wait.

44
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,151
It's true, this really is paradise.

45
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,591
Butter would flow from the udders

46
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,348
of your goats. The yoghurt would be firm

47
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,710
like ice cream from Maras. Once you've

48
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,116
crossed the mountain, everything's okay.

49
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,277
God be with you. Cemal."

50
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,119
Did he find work?

51
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,833
They will start soon.

52
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,759
Is his wife working, too?

53
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,429
Sure, why not? Give the horse some water.

54
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She works with

55
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,275
her big belly?

56
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Don't I work

57
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,034
with a big belly?

58
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,470
Working in a factory makes you dead tired

59
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,671
and grow old before your time.

60
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,792
And how do you know?

61
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,629
I see their faces when they come back.

62
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,990
But they come back as rich people.

63
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
With cars.

64
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,118
You're putting that into your

65
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,197
children's heads, and about going away...

66
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,158
They can see it for themselves.

67
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,589
Are we missing anything?

68
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,958
Nothing and everything.

69
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,355
Papa, are we going away?

70
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,119
No one is going anywhere.

71
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,669
And anyway.

72
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,394
With what money do you want to leave?

73
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,436
I would sell the horse and the cows.

74
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,597
And put your sons before the thresher?

75
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,235
If it works there, who needs a thresher!

76
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,551
You think it's all that easy.

77
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Is it easy

78
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,638
anywhere for people like us?

79
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,034
Even grass comes out with all its roots.

80
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,953
Once you've sold everything,

81
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,196
you're worth less than this grass.

82
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,835
You'll be without roots, a nothing.

83
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,274
My father will be going there. If you eat

84
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,199
this grass, butter will flow from your

85
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,755
udder, says Uncle Cemal. Maybe that will

86
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,837
be your stable. Nice, isn't it?

87
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,108
What are you up to? Nothing but nonsense

88
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,470
in your head. What's to become of you?

89
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,079
You're a good for nothing.

90
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,515
At least don't sell too cheap, son.

91
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,916
How much is the Swiss chocolate?

92
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,509
20,000. We also have this one here.

93
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,670
I would like 150 gr. of this one here.

94
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,229
Be a good substitute for your mother.

95
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,914
Thank you, Papa.

96
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,589
Look after your brothers and sisters.

97
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,071
Leave the goat alone! Let it go!

98
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,189
Leave her here, mind your own business.

99
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,549
That's enough! I have visitors.

100
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,399
Welcome, Haydar.

101
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,630
So you've brought your wife. Well done.

102
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,989
Is everything ready?

103
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,918
Everyone is going abroad.

104
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,111
If this goes on, for whom will

105
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,789
our government reign? - We're still here.

106
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Certainly.

107
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,874
How much did you bring?

108
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,673
Two million, as you said.

109
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,229
I believe you.

110
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,191
We must trust each other.

111
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,476
They've turned out fine.

112
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,958
Are there no political problems?

113
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,037
No, nothing. - That's fine then.

114
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,636
This man will give you passports and

115
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,036
tickets. He'll take you aboard the ship.

116
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,830
He will also exchange your money.

117
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,156
Our money is worthless there.

118
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,152
Take care of this piece of paper.

119
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,715
Don't worry, he's a reliable man.

120
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,754
In 2 weeks you will be in Istanbul.

121
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,917
He will expect you at dawn.

122
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,596
Have a good trip. - Thank you.

123
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,759
May God reward you.

124
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,118
Oh, before I forget.

125
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,269
If I were you, I'd take along more money.

126
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,913
One or two million.

127
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,713
Prices got higher there.

128
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,956
As if it were different here.

129
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,673
Anyway, good luck.

130
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,796
The man did not look very reliable.

131
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,072
Cemal said he is reliable.

132
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,830
Why keep the bad news for the end?

133
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,439
It's not his fault.

134
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,676
Do things get cheaper here?

135
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,589
I don't know how we're going to manage.

136
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,389
Suggest something instead of complaining.

137
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,115
I want you to buy this field.

138
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,789
Too small. What could I do with it?

139
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,396
There won't be enough money for the trip.

140
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,235
All right, I will buy it. For your sake.

141
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,919
You're my neighbor.

142
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,479
Thank you. - You're welcome.

143
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,035
I hope my money will bring you luck.

144
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,199
What's wrong?

145
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,993
I won't come.

146
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,474
But everything is ready.

147
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,077
I won't leave the children behind.

148
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,558
Again?! We can't take any

149
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,637
children along. We've decided

150
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,239
and that's it.

151
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,671
Without the children I won't move.

152
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,599
I'll also take the baby.

153
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,752
How can you work

154
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,758
if you take the baby?

155
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,831
They have day care for babies.

156
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,269
They have what?

157
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,349
It's better to leave our children here

158
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,312
with my parents.

159
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,269
They aren't registered in our passports.

160
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,278
A baby doesn't need a passport.

161
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,357
Meryem, be realistic.

162
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,675
Everything is arranged, we're going.

163
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,996
We gave our savings for this journey.

164
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,633
All you speak about

165
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,955
is money.

166
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,553
We sold everything.

167
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,478
Now we only have

168
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,876
this house and this money.

169
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,918
The daughter-in-law is right.

170
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,278
You have already sold everything,

171
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,391
at least take a boy with you.

172
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,229
Send him to school, let him become a man.

173
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,670
You have pulled out your roots. Now we

174
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,030
need a boy who can grow new roots.

175
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,550
Maybe then he will save the family.

176
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,799
Whom should I choose?

177
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,469
They all mean the same to me.

178
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,709
I'm old and with one foot in the grave.

179
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,550
You are not too young anymore yourself.

180
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,876
Kids get accustomed easier.

181
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,549
Only they can change things, not us.

182
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,349
Slowly, slowly.

183
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,758
Slowly, or it will spill over.

184
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,351
Mama, buy me a Pepsi too.

185
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,549
That man is staring at me. Who can he be?

186
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,833
What are you up to?

187
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,153
Let me have some too.

188
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
No, no.

189
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,352
You can't drink all of it alone.

190
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,155
What will the man say about Mehmet Ali?

191
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,230
I hope he won't make any trouble.

192
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,069
"We are three, understand?" I'll say.

193
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,749
That's what I'll tell him. After all,

194
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,270
we pay for the trip, don't we?

195
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,268
I have to pee.

196
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,152
Wait. He will stop soon.

197
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,749
But I - What can I do? Wait.

198
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,952
I have to pee now.

199
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,436
He has to pee. What shall we do?

200
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,199
He has to hold it back.

201
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,708
I have to now!

202
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,991
Now is not the right moment.

203
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,391
You must have drunk a whole barrel.

204
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,349
Papa, is that the sea? - No.

205
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,669
If you continue it will become the sea.

206
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,035
There, my So...

207
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,469
that is the sea.

208
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,988
How nice.

209
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,276
Let's go and find Yasar.

210
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,638
I'm looking for Yasar.

211
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,069
He's inside.

212
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,713
The passports are ready.

213
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,593
Where is your wife?

214
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,836
Outside. There is something else.

215
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,436
Your tickets are also ready,

216
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,358
and the 1,000 marks.

217
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,959
No Swiss francs?

218
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,753
Aren't you happy

219
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,474
with marks? That's 1.5 million liras.

220
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,719
1 million, lthought.

221
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,116
The mark has become more expensive.

222
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,879
Do you want them?

223
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,919
All right, I want them.

224
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,319
Here, one million.

225
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,275
Something else

226
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
You get good seats.

227
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,512
When you get to Milan,

228
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,155
go to the train station and do exactly

229
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,158
what it says on this paper.

230
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,749
Then throw it away, that's important.

231
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,231
Do you see the boat over there?

232
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,870
That's where you'll go on board.

233
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,558
Okay have a good trip.

234
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,319
Are we leaving now?

235
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,955
Who's he? Are you taking him along?

236
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,629
How can he go on board without a ticket

237
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,309
or a passport? That's impossible!

238
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,915
You idiots!

239
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,193
Didn't you tell him?

240
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,072
The boy has to stay behind.

241
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,839
Then I'll stay too.

242
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,509
The boat is about to leave, it won't wait

243
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,718
Think of something. It's your fault

244
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,752
that things are the way they are.

245
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
My God!

246
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,719
You were afraid to tell him.

247
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,272
God, give me patience.

248
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,319
It's your decision.

249
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,872
Maybe there is a way,

250
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,151
but it's a risk.

251
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,152
Are you aware of that?

252
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,710
We cannot go back any more.

253
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,993
All right, let's try.

254
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,274
Thank you, Yasar.

255
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,791
Good luck and have a good trip.

256
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,952
I hope they won't forget us in here.

257
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,798
They won't forget us.

258
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,479
Hurry up Hurry!

259
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,756
Come, this is my cabin.

260
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,109
It's warm here, and you are safe.

261
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,234
Sit down here.

262
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,309
We can sit here.

263
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,272
No, no. Here. Me, there.

264
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,758
Thank you for saving our lives.

265
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,395
We're not used to being locked in.

266
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,509
In two days we will be in Naples.

267
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
O Kay?

268
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,790
I want to look out at the sea.

269
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,679
Take off your shoes.

270
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,673
Wait for me here.

271
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,635
Wait here. I will look for someone

272
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,115
who will bring you to Milan.

273
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,998
Come and sit down here.

274
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,433
We've made it.

275
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,469
This is where a new life starts for us.

276
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,557
Papa, it's so nice here.

277
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,837
100? Forget it! 100 each.

278
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,758
300 for the three of them.

279
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,439
200, okay? 200.

280
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,075
300. We don't argue about prices.

281
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,958
Switzerland is expensive.

282
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,397
Do you have 300 marks?

283
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,833
Don't be rude.

284
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,190
That's okay. That's all right.

285
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,989
That's right. Milan. Schaffhausen.

286
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,393
Me, Schaffhausen, Switzerland.

287
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,195
You? From where in Turkey? From where?

288
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,595
Yes, Turkey.

289
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,677
Yes, but from where?

290
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,269
Not bad.

291
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,238
Stop, another one for me.

292
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,393
Let me see.

293
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,472
Did you see how nice? See?

294
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,351
Madam, did you see how nice you are?

295
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,631
How much? - Two, 10,000 lire.

296
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,433
Now three. 15,000 lire.

297
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,516
Here, my family. My women.

298
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Oh, yours.

299
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,271
7 children.

300
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Exactly seven.

301
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,431
Don't you have any condoms?

302
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,194
Bravo. Me two, and that's it.

303
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,796
What, Switzerland? That's Switzerland.

304
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,635
Me Switzerland.

305
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,989
No. Me Switzerland, you Maras.

306
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,869
Me, mother, father, Switzerland.

307
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,509
You you .. you Switzerland?

308
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,679
We go to Switzerland.

309
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,869
Into paradise behind the mountain.

310
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,235
Me Switzerland, you Switzerland.

311
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,711
So you want to go to Switzerland.

312
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,511
Well, then come with me.

313
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,710
You, with me to Switzerland.

314
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,074
Yes, Switzerland. Do you have a passport?

315
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,479
Switzerland over there.

316
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,792
Paradise they say.

317
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,478
Is something wrong?

318
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
No idea.

319
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,314
Why police?

320
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,109
They have no right to enter our country.

321
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,909
You want to make them enter illegally.

322
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,111
And you know you are not allowed

323
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,072
to carry more than 3 people.

324
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,353
That's not my fault.

325
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,508
I don't want any trouble

326
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,199
because of them.

327
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,875
Hey, friend,

328
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,955
let's send them back to Italy,

329
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,029
to Milan.

330
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,314
And we take care of the rest together.

331
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,515
All right?

332
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,433
I'm a Swiss customs officer,

333
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,517
not a businessman. Understand?

334
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,356
There, central station Como.

335
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,035
Como. There.

336
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,596
Then direction Milan.

337
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,274
Here, that's for the train.

338
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,994
For the train.

339
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,551
I'm sorry. All the best. Bye.

340
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,989
Thank you.

341
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,316
Maybe we'll meet again.

342
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,989
Show them the way to the station, please.

343
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,828
Bye-bye.

344
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,912
What does it say?

345
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,435
In the big bar in the main hall

346
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,278
a man will come up to you.

347
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,271
Over there is something like that.

348
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,833
Get out, hurry!

349
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,039
What about our suitcases?

350
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,709
Leave them in the car. Come on, hurry.

351
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,876
Look, I'll tell you the real price.

352
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,912
Amongst friends, of course.

353
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,070
1.5 times 3 is 4.5.

354
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,752
That is 4,500 marks.

355
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,475
Let's say that you have 2,200,

356
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,271
so you still need 2,300.

357
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,075
How are you going to find that money?

358
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,709
Not even two people can travel with that.

359
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,358
I got them hooked,

360
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,633
leave them to me.

361
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,235
Well did you find a solution?

362
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,672
That's all we own.

363
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,958
A lot of money, but with that

364
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,310
you can start your trip back home.

365
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,469
We can't go back impossible.

366
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,113
Do you have passports?

367
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Yes, two.

368
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,949
They bring something. Not much, but

369
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,514
What's that?

370
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,234
From my cousin. He's over there.

371
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,828
What happened to it?

372
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,712
The goat chewed on it.

373
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,718
Goats are clever animals.

374
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,954
Listen, your cousin Cemal,

375
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,470
can't he send you something?

376
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,677
We don't know where he lives.

377
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,394
He was with you - at least I thought.

378
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,159
I Will find him.

379
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,873
Here. Take this and go.

380
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,033
Come back tomorrow.

381
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,390
Till then I'll have found him.

382
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,751
Haydar, take the passports.

383
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,915
Go on. Don't worry, nothing will happen

384
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,599
to your money. Leave it here.

385
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,189
Go now and come back tomorrow.

386
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,437
Bring them back to the station.

387
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,115
Find a way to get the money.

388
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,594
Shit, we are not fit for this world.

389
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,031
If my father could see us now

390
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,918
There must be a solution.

391
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,549
Those men seemed reliable to me.

392
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,559
Them? Reliable?

393
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,477
We mustn't give up hope.

394
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,238
Look who's coming.

395
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,397
Haydar, look who's coming.

396
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Hello.

397
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,834
Are we on the same route, heading north?

398
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,589
One gets closer in foreign countries.

399
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,991
You are still missing 2,100.

400
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,633
In marks.

401
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,914
And what about Cemal?

402
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,790
We've found him, he's fine.

403
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,990
He's in a home for refugees.

404
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,756
He doesn't have a work permit,

405
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,871
but he's fine.

406
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,749
But he wrote he would start to work soon.

407
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,349
If not today, then tomorrow or later.

408
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,868
Just a moment.

409
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
Thank you.

410
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Bravo.

411
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,593
Our people are like that.

412
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,397
In difficult situations we help each

413
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,716
other out, isn't that so?

414
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,478
Aldo, bring them to the villa.

415
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,557
I'm not thirsty, thank you.

416
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,912
I don't want to drink either.

417
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,670
It's not to drink, but for washing.

418
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,598
It's time to pray.

419
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,592
Let's not waste drinking water.

420
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,589
<i>Waste'?! What do you mean, waste'!?</i>

421
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,555
When traveling, praying is not mandatory.

422
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,558
What? God should forgive.

423
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,876
Have you become unfaithful, just because

424
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,515
we are in the country of the unfaithful?

425
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,870
God have mercy and stand by us.

426
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,355
In which direction is Mekka?

427
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,158
God forgive us!

428
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,389
Anybody not happy can get out, okay?

429
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,671
Who else has something to fuss about?

430
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,271
You want to start a new life

431
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,755
and carry your whole past with you.

432
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,469
You can't cross the mountain with that.

433
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,359
Do I look weak?

434
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,278
What's wrong? - Just a moment.

435
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,039
Since Istanbul

436
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,515
you've been making trouble for us.

437
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,992
You have a healthy son,

438
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,991
but life doesn't consist only of that.

439
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,636
One has to earn money.

440
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,189
I also have a wife and three children.

441
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,234
I have seven.

442
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,272
I found a job for you.

443
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,915
Soon you will earn lots of money over

444
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,589
there where the chocolate factories are.

445
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,318
You like that, don't you?

446
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,749
You only have to sign here that you will

447
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,395
give us a part of your salary

448
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,752
in exchange for our help.

449
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,512
How much? - Half of it.

450
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,830
I have a family, it won't be enough.

451
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,509
Half is enough. Do you have a pen?

452
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,840
Come on.

453
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,032
Sign here. Sign.

454
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,271
You will start a new life.

455
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,994
Don't make such a face Come on.

456
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,993
Now listen, everyone.

457
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,073
If anything goes wrong

458
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,715
and the immigration officers catch you,

459
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,116
then you know what to say, don't you?

460
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,955
Everything about me, nothing about you.

461
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,910
And what will you tell the police?

462
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,079
When you're over there

463
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,635
you have to ask for the Polizei.

464
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,633
If you turn yourself in,

465
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,672
they will keep you.

466
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,429
If you get caught, they'll send you back.

467
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,519
When registering

468
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,438
at the police station

469
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,358
ask for "political asylum".

470
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,950
You are all political cases.

471
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,514
Do you understand?

472
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,308
How do they distinguish

473
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,431
between real refugees and others?

474
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,676
For God's sake. I'm not a refugee

475
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,552
nor a political case.

476
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,956
They will realize that I'm not

477
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,231
so unfaithful as you all are.

478
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,511
You are incredible, Uncle Haci.

479
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,631
What? - You're incredible.

480
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,438
The weather is against us.

481
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,389
Don't worry, these people are not

482
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,114
looked for, they are country folks.

483
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,115
That may be so,

484
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,356
but that doesn't change the weather.

485
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,789
Come on, get ready. Come on

486
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,836
Hurry up, grandfather. Hurry up!

487
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,669
How do you want to carry all this stuff?

488
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,109
There is no sense. This is pure suicide.

489
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,996
With all this stuff, I'm not going.

490
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,429
What do you mean?

491
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,918
The weather is against us.

492
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,872
I can't change it. Ciao.

493
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,639
What's happening?

494
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,631
Massimo doesn't want to do it.

495
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,995
They must cross the mountain today,

496
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,635
tomorrow there will be others.

497
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,313
If you want to stay alive,

498
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,318
get rid of these people quickly.

499
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,953
But the weather

500
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,231
It's great. The immigration officers

501
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,795
will stay inside warming their asses.

502
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,549
I can't take the responsibility.

503
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,070
Leave the responsibility to us.

504
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,271
If you don't like the weather,

505
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,676
they will find the way by themselves.

506
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,234
The group is too large.

507
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,669
We'll divide them.

508
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,076
Tell them where to go, and they'll go.

509
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,749
They don't have to follow each other.

510
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,068
Go over there. You too.

511
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,634
My son is coming with me.

512
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,751
Okay, take him and go over there.

513
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,156
Why is this man not coming with us?

514
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,829
Didn't we bring you here comfortably?

515
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,749
You can go the rest of the way alone.

516
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,996
Shall we carry you on our backs?

517
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,114
Take the path Massimo described to you.

518
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,195
Keep together. At the first deviation

519
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,630
split up. One group to the right,

520
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,195
one to the left of the mountain.

521
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,914
As long as you walk up, you're in Italy.

522
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,709
When it goes down, you're in Switzerland.

523
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,518
I'll wait for you over there.

524
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,475
If nothing happens, I'll find you.

525
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,271
If something goes wrong,

526
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,269
you'll have to look for yourselves.

527
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,069
You were supposed to take us to paradise.

528
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,469
You're supposed not to cause any trouble

529
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,149
and not to be weak. Come on, come on.

530
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,631
Hurry up, don't leave the path.

531
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,949
If he lies this way he won't suffocate.

532
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,751
He will regain consciousness soon.

533
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,837
You will get us into trouble!

534
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,469
I think this is the place the man said.

535
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,711
According to the sign this must be it.

536
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,036
Mama, like the ice cream from Maras.

537
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,873
This way or that way?

538
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,754
Didn't you hear what the man said?

539
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,073
I don't care about the man.

540
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,396
God is my only leader.

541
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,159
I'll go where I want to.

542
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,078
Does anyone want to join me?

543
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,749
Don't you think you could endanger us?

544
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,396
How should we know the right way?

545
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,271
Let's go the way Haci Baba said.

546
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,512
Sit down here. Don't move.

547
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,354
Leave that suitcase.

548
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,471
Why do you always walk downwards?

549
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,716
There are important things in there.

550
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,475
Main thing is, we get over the mountain.

551
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,430
Forget the suitcase! Go on!

552
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,875
Meryem, forget the suitcase! Go on!

553
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,395
I told you he was nothing but trouble.

554
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,033
What's wrong, Haci Baba?

555
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,878
A cramp in your legs?

556
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,110
Fetch water. - I'll give him a massage.

557
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,038
What are you carrying around?

558
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,436
Are you smuggling gold? - Books, books.

559
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,472
Books?! Do you think I'll carry

560
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,910
your goddamn books over the mountain?

561
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,712
Stop! Stop, don't sin! Stop!

562
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,195
Leave the books

563
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,674
and drink this.

564
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,030
Down there. Looks like a tunnel.

565
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,510
Eat something. Here, have this.

566
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,150
It will be over soon, my son.

567
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,917
Mehmet Ali, eat. - No.

568
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,479
Friends, let's go on.

569
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,671
Othenlvise we'll freeze here.

570
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,952
We'd better split up.

571
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,873
Who goes first?

572
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,160
Me.

573
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,633
Are you serious? - Yes.

574
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,629
Till now we have helped each other

575
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,638
as much as possible.

576
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,149
Our goal is right over there. I'm going.

577
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,670
Is anyone coming with me?

578
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,836
Ekrem, go with him, take care of him.

579
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,395
The men and I will take the steep path,

580
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,069
Haydar and the women go on the easy path.

581
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,635
I'll leave these goddamn things here.

582
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,149
We'll wait for you across the border.

583
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,668
Good luck.

584
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,114
Tasso, keep quiet!

585
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,675
Have you finished?

586
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,916
Yes. And are you going to work all night?

587
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,792
I will close soon.

588
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,116
Let's go inside, Tasso. Come on.

589
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,794
Grazer, come on out, somethings wrong!

590
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,233
Disperse!

591
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,509
Where is Mama?

592
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,119
We'll find her.

593
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,158
Hurry, Meryem fell.

594
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,789
My leg

595
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,870
Calm yourself. - Easy

596
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,033
Stop! Stand still!

597
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,870
Political asylum! Political

598
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,755
We will take a look at that tomorrow.

599
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,349
You come with us now. Go on, walk!

600
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,469
Is my leg broken? My shoe!

601
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,109
Wait here. I'll go and look for Mama.

602
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,994
Be very quiet and don't go away, okay?

603
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,236
Maybe it's Haydar. - No, be quiet.

604
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,433
What happened?

605
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,835
It's Ekrem.

606
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,399
Did you see Haydar and my son?

607
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,193
Didn't they come with you?

608
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,549
Go on, hurry up.

609
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,636
Hurry come on, hold on to me.

610
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,309
Hurry, othenlvise we will be caught.

611
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,672
Papa, did you find Mama?

612
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
Be quiet.

613
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,598
Papa, I'm so cold.

614
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,755
I am freezing.

615
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,031
Scratch your head, you'll be warm.

616
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,389
Will we visit Ramser in Switzerland?

617
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,712
This is not the right moment.

618
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,237
Slowly. There is something.

619
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,154
It's closed.

620
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,352
Don't talk nonsense.

621
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,995
Not even I would find the right way.

622
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,589
Tell us with whom you came.

623
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,110
He said there was nobody else with him.

624
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,959
That's bullshit.

625
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,111
How did he find the way?

626
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,393
Allah showed him.

627
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,118
What? Him, too?

628
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,469
He lied, I knew it right away.

629
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,349
Where are they?

630
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,358
Back there at the pool.

631
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,392
I'll get dressed first.

632
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,149
Sound an alarm for a search on the pass.

633
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,670
The border control calls up too.

634
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,315
Another six persons are in the border

635
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,989
area, one of them a child.

636
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,069
Probably their lives are in danger.

637
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,673
I understood that, over.

638
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,793
Resist a bit more, my son.

639
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,831
It won't take much longer.

640
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,593
You are strong.

641
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,916
Your mother is waiting for us.

642
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,874
Move a little.

643
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,752
My twig has fallen down.

644
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,471
It's lost in the snow.

645
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,788
Attention, attention! I repeat.

646
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,038
Your lives are in danger.

647
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,195
You might get lost any second.

648
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,754
Don't be afraid, we will help you.

649
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,113
Approach the lights.

650
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,199
I repeat.

651
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,589
Ivan to Charly, come in, please.

652
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,155
What's up?

653
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,996
Did something happen?

654
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,113
Up to now, nothing.

655
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,194
We are moving towards the old Roman path.

656
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,272
The dogs have not reacted.

657
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,949
Will call as soon as we notice something.

658
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,113
They are looking for us.

659
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,908
They speak Turkish.

660
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,830
Do you understand what they are saying?

661
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,314
They are looking for us.

662
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,989
It's a trap. Someone has betrayed us.

663
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,871
But they won't find us.

664
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,989
Wait. Let's try to understand them.

665
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,838
I know what they're saying.

666
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,672
They are offering help,

667
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,598
but I don't believe them.

668
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,631
I did not come all this way

669
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,592
to get caught here.

670
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,438
Don't give up!

671
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,358
I have no energy left.

672
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,719
We are here!

673
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,509
Damn it!

674
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,197
Why this punishment, God?

675
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,631
In Ali's name, please see me!

676
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,399
Here we are!

677
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,392
God, I am at the end.

678
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,553
Papa, where are we?

679
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,709
We'll be there soon, I promise.

680
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,675
Pull yourself together, all right?

681
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,794
Tea? Coffee?

682
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,274
Tea, please.

683
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,673
Any news?

684
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,749
I'm afraid not. They're still searching.

685
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,550
<i>Any news from my son and Hayden'?</i>

686
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,829
No, but don't worry, they'll be alright.

687
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,471
Did you get their personal data?

688
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,193
Personal data!

689
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,272
You can't talk with them!

690
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,391
I won't register uninvited guests.

691
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,069
Wake them and register them properly.

692
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,229
No one will be awakened and registered.

693
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,909
I won't let you mess them up again.

694
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,110
These people need our help. I don't care

695
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,914
what they are called and where they go.

696
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,831
But I care. If everyone thought

697
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,917
he could come, where would we be?

698
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,713
Many more will be coming,

699
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,638
whether you like it or not.

700
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,076
The water is up to our necks.

701
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,597
So you better learn to swim.

702
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,117
And you better learn Turkish, so that

703
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,516
you can talk with your new clients.

704
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,631
Aldemir is a good teacher.

705
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,909
Jealous?

706
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,509
We don't register people

707
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,233
according to swollen feet,

708
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,158
but according to name and origin.

709
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,670
Whether they like it or not.

710
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,109
Help! We want to go to the police.

711
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,512
I am not a police officer.

712
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,073
Come on, get in.

713
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,318
Renato, this is Bruno.

714
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,549
Suitcases in the back. In the back.

715
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,032
I just picked up two madmen.

716
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,072
They ask for the police.

717
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,879
Finally - we are rescued.

718
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,119
Help! Help!

719
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,910
Wait for us help!

720
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,393
This is Switzerland?

721
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,159
I guess this is Switzerland.

722
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,839
Is this Switzerland?

723
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,073
He doesn't understand.

724
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,476
He doesn't answer Look!

725
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,197
Help! Help us!

726
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,949
Help! Help my son and me!

727
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,594
We'll do an ECG.

728
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,874
Wait outside.

729
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,757
Who are these people? - No idea.

730
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,837
Can you stay with him?

731
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,997
Yes. You have a blanket for him?

732
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,918
Outside in the closet.

733
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,836
We are happy that they found you.

734
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,917
Please, Haydar, these men

735
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,158
would like to ask you a few questions.

736
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,112
And what about my son?

737
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,640
I'm not leaving without my son.

738
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,234
He's in good hands.

739
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,317
I'm not leaving without him.

740
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,034
Don't worry, he's in good hands.

741
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,755
They will only ask a few questions.

742
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,836
I didn't harm anybody.

743
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,192
Your son is dead!

744
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,680
Dear Haydar. We have arrived safely.

745
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,309
Miisliim and his wife have found work.

746
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,397
We still have to wait.

747
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,989
It's true, this really is paradise.

748
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,475
Butter would flow from the udders

749
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,876
of your goats. The yoghurt would

750
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,196
be firm like ice cream from Maras.

751
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,869
Once you've crossed the mountain,

752
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,515
everything's okay. God be with you.

753
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,276
Is he Cemal?

754
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,631
Looks like a Turk, doesn't he?

755
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,831
Sometimes we all look like Turks.

756
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,675
I'm sorry. He needs to be put

757
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,234
in custody.

758
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:24,919
What are the charges?

759
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,270
Illegal crossing of the border.

760
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:30,028
In our eyes he remains responsible

761
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,914
for his son's death. He stays here

762
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,509
until we can clear this matter.

763
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:38,555
Exhaustion and exposure as the doctor

764
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,831
found out is not enough proof?

765
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,229
He did not expect as much coldness here.

766
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,150
Not even here is there only sunshine.

767
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,193
We both know very well

768
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,232
that other facts are involved.

769
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,117
We would like to know

770
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,675
what and who brought them here.

771
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,875
Haydar, what made you come her?

772
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,235
Hope.

773
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,799
My condolences.

774
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,879
I am so sorry.

775
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,238
I brought you something.

776
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,800
Thank you.

777
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,675
What's happening with the boy?

778
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,394
Mehmet Ali will be buried at home

779
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,355
so that he can give us new energy

780
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:55,074
and so that we won't lose hope in future.

781
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,231
And you can also tell him that

782
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,829
I would like to join in on the burial,

783
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,117
on the expenses, I mean

784
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,030
And if he needs anything else

785
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:27,549
I would have liked to become your friend.
