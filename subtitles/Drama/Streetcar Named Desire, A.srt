1
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,316
Cheers, mate!

2
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:10,198
Yo!

3
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,662
Hey, Elvis, you've seen, Dee?

4
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,487
I'm not looking for Dee.

5
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,991
Oh.

6
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,271
You want to try this again?

7
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:19,000
You sing vocals on it, mate.

8
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,760
Go away, now.

9
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,201
Brass monkey band?

10
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,825
Knew you'd crash here tonight.

11
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:31,674
No, seriously.

12
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:33,050
You've seen Dee?

13
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:34,682
Seriously, I'm on the script.

14
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:37,179
I mean it this time.

15
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,643
Yeah, who doesn't?

16
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,340
Well, tell Dee
I'm looking for him, yeah?

17
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,374
Three quid, mate.

18
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,294
And...

19
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,350
You're short.

20
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,783
That's all I've got.

21
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:03,711
It's three quid, mate.

22
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:05,727
Come on, I haven't
eaten all day.

23
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,487
It's three quid!

24
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:10,624
Can you let me off at 9p?

25
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,617
No!

26
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:14,465
All right... I'll...

27
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,713
Play you a little song, yeah?

28
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:18,849
I'll play you a little song,
and you let me off at 9p, okay?

29
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,987
Thanks, mate.

30
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:30,820
That's... that's...

31
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:31,652
That's great.

32
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:32,484
Don't come back.

33
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:33,284
Okay.

34
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,852
Don't want you here, go on!

35
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,261
All right.
Okay, I'm going.

36
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,245
Thanks, a lot.

37
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,031
Get out of here!

38
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,695
Sorry... sorry.

39
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,200
Yo, Elvis?

40
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:01,608
Get in.

41
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:11,818
Whose is it?

42
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,515
The bloke who forgot
to lock it.

43
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:18,956
I found Dee.

44
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:23,373
Have some.

45
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:34,126
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here,
no, no, no, no,no...

46
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:35,726
- That's nice, that's nice.
- See, I'm here, I'm here.

47
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,455
Come on, you don't
have to do this. Please.

48
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:38,542
Oh, yes, I do.
You're late.

49
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:40,463
I don't know.
It's your car.

50
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,712
How long
have they been here?

51
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:43,312
Hey, what are you
doing in my car?

52
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,720
You didn't do
something...

53
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:45,712
Why should I?

54
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,280
James! James!

55
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:49,905
James, come on, wake up!
You can't do this.

56
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:51,120
You didn't
see them get in?

57
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,561
Oh, do I look
like a genie?

58
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:53,649
From a certain angle.

59
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:54,994
I caught you.
Come back here!

60
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,266
Get after him, will you?

61
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:59,730
This is not Batman
and Robin, you know.

62
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,163
Hey, wake up, you're in my car.

63
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:03,987
Hey!

64
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:06,483
Well, he's...

65
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,044
Well, he's not moving.

66
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,942
Did they bring my guitar?

67
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,541
Must say you too.

68
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:22,006
So, I'm not exactly
myself this morning.

69
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,511
That's a matter of opinion.

70
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,046
They brought it to me.

71
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:27,927
Well, this isn't our first
time in the circus, is it?

72
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,175
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:30,936
You know, I made
a mistake. I messed up.

74
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:33,496
Tell me something I haven't
already heard 20 times today?

75
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,809
So much prefer the sound
of silence to bullshit.

76
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,441
How do you feel?

77
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,754
Not dead.

78
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:44,345
Look, I mean...

79
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,226
I'm... horrible.

80
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:49,019
Turns out you've
also got hepatitis.

81
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:50,971
Congratulations.

82
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:54,971
Ever wonder why you see so many
old alchies but never junkies?

83
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,116
No fellow can use this
more than I do.

84
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:58,908
You can't mix
heroin with methadone.

85
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,284
You'd od.

86
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,149
You know this stuff.

87
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:02,236
Yep.

88
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,901
Do it again
and you'll probably die.

89
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,493
I never... look I...

90
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,918
- I'm sorry. I...
- silence over bullshit.

91
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,335
Right.

92
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:15,359
I'll see you when
you're discharged.

93
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:16,415
Yeah.

94
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,138
Hello.

95
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,770
What'd you do?
Nicking this uniform.

96
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,067
Uh, no. I didn't Nick it.

97
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,244
Nurse gave it to me because
they lost my t-shirt.

98
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:43,779
All right.

99
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:48,132
Sign that one,
and take that one to the chemist everyday.

100
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,573
A few methadone.

101
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:51,621
Check in with me
every two weeks.

102
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:54,629
And addicts who stop the methadone
treatment and go back to heroin,

103
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,453
- have a higher percentage of od'ing.
- Percentage of od'ing.

104
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,182
Yeah, I know this already.

105
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,879
It's my job to tell you.

106
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,078
Fall off the methadone and it's more likely
you'll od the next time you do heroin.

107
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,615
And you could, well, die.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,535
Yeah.

109
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,071
Is there anyone I can call?

110
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,704
Any relative, anyone?

111
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm... I'm kinda solo
these days.

112
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,409
No word from your dad?

113
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:15,849
Or mum?

114
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,513
Uh, yeah.

115
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,369
"Get lost."

116
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,394
Guess that's two words.

117
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:21,226
Here you go.

118
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,762
Uh, thank you.

119
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,418
Can you play something for me?

120
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,530
You want to hear me sing?

121
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:28,363
Are you any good?

122
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:35,820
Okay...

123
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,955
There you go, mate.

124
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:31,509
Hey!

125
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,350
Get up. On your way.

126
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:59,482
I won't be back in here
if he wasn't a special case.

127
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:01,626
Special?

128
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:04,987
I've got three single mums
waiting for a spot. I've got...

129
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:08,540
I've got a sweet old pensioner who's
getting kicked out of here sometimes.

130
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,004
They all need emergency housing,
they're all special.

131
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,637
Please.

132
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,012
What's so special
about a drug addict?

133
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:14,909
Why this one?

134
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,093
Oh, I don't know.

135
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,813
Every now and then
one comes along and...

136
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,014
You just know they
have in them to be clean.

137
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:24,766
I think this is his last shot.

138
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,942
He really wants to be clean
but he's got nothing.

139
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:28,575
No support system at all.

140
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,359
I have to get him off the street
or I'm going to lose him.

141
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,144
I'm not giving a spot
to a user.

142
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,200
He's in the program.

143
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,120
He falls off his methadone,
he's out. Period.

144
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,784
He won't.

145
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:40,769
I hope.

146
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:58,371
Come on, everybody.

147
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,868
Come on. Woof!
Albert, this side.

148
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,547
- Val?
- Hey! Come in.

149
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,108
Wow!

150
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:50,348
Welcome home.

151
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:03,503
You okay?

152
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,911
Yeah, but...

153
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:10,832
Yeah!

154
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,848
It's a little bit stuffy,
so just open the window.

155
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,025
Hot water!

156
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:25,234
Look, I've got to run.

157
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,507
- Keys.
- Right. Yeah.

158
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,019
Val, I'm...

159
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,460
You're welcome.

160
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,955
Oh, and I've put some cereal in the kitchen,
and milk in the fridge.

161
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,581
I don't know what to say.

162
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,045
Say, you're gonna
stay in the program,

163
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:42,261
and you won't miss
our next meeting.

164
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:43,157
I promise.

165
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,853
I promise you. I...

166
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,517
Cross my heart, hope to die.

167
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,342
Okay.

168
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,863
I'll see you out.

169
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,741
Whoever is there?
You better leave!

170
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:40,894
I mean it!

171
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:44,031
I've got a weapon here!

172
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,808
Um...

173
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm seriously armed!

174
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,718
That was you
making all that noise.

175
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,862
How'd you get in?

176
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,527
I see.

177
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,296
You're a thief, are you?

178
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:38,504
Stealing all my cornflakes?

179
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:39,688
Hmm?

180
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:41,801
Hey?

181
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:42,857
Are you friendly?

182
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:44,137
Hmm?

183
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,466
I guess that answers that.

184
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,298
No, come on.

185
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:53,866
This way.

186
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,139
There you go.

187
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:57,131
They're a...

188
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,179
They're better with
a bit of milk, you see.

189
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,364
I'll get you some.

190
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:04,877
You're not a very good
thief, by the way.

191
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,341
Next time, try to be
a bit quieter.

192
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:09,229
That's the trick out here.
Come on.

193
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,182
Up you come, now.

194
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:13,774
Look at that.

195
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:23,248
Hmm.

196
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:26,576
There's going to be a family
worried about you.

197
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,361
You better go home now.

198
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,025
Hmm?

199
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:33,137
No, no, no, no, no.

200
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:34,449
This way.

201
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,146
Oh, no.

202
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,002
You know. I think it's time
you better go home.

203
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,283
Hey, this way.

204
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:40,787
There you go. Yeah.

205
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:42,386
Go home.

206
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:43,667
Go out there.

207
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,875
That's it. Come on.

208
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,404
Oh, don't look at me
like that.

209
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:49,972
Okay?

210
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,436
All right, then.

211
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,573
One night. Okay?

212
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:58,901
And then I'm going to take
you back to your owner.

213
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:01,910
Yeah, deal?

214
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,302
There you go.

215
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:47,933
I'll see you
in the morning, okay?

216
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,454
Over there?

217
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,615
Excuse me.

218
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,384
Did you lose a cat?

219
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:57,929
Is it there?

220
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,401
No?

221
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,338
Excuse me.

222
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,714
Did you lose a cat?

223
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:06,955
Hello!

224
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:14,188
Got a little ginger cat down
here if anyone's looking for it.

225
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:15,724
Hello!

226
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,084
So what number life
are you on?

227
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:20,717
Apparently, I'm on the ninth.

228
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,726
Hello, did anybody lose a cat?

229
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,294
Get out of here, go away!

230
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,542
Thanks.

231
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:29,231
Come on.

232
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:31,855
There you go.

233
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,183
Someone will come
looking for you.

234
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:38,672
Take care of yourself.

235
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:40,305
Thank you.

236
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,248
All right, methadone, mate?

237
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,461
Thank you, mate!

238
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,120
Hey! Go on, on your way!

239
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:29,912
Oh, don't do this, mate.

240
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,545
In all the world, you're
causing an obstruction.

241
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,177
I'm just trying to make
a living here.

242
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,457
I'm not in anyone's way.

243
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,217
It's an health
and safety issue.

244
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,810
If you strum there
you're obstructing the exit.

245
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,443
Well, if you stand there
you're obstructing the exit.

246
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,330
Walk to, mate,
or I'll haul you away.

247
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,667
Up to me, I'd arrest
the lot of y'all.

248
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:45,852
Oh, you would.

249
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,547
Fucking vermin!

250
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:48,987
As if I haven't
got enough to do.

251
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,252
Dad! Dad!

252
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:54,237
Hey, dad.

253
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,708
What are you doing here?

254
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,525
Oh, we're... we're...

255
00:19:58,527 --> 00:19:59,934
We're a bit shopping.
This and that.

256
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,054
Uh-huh.

257
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,134
Oh, yeah. You good?

258
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,855
Uh, yeah. I've stopped using.

259
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:07,263
I'm in the program.

260
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,759
Great.

261
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:12,512
Remember that last time?
My own flat and everything...

262
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,376
Mm-hmm.

263
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,496
Jack?

264
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,088
You remember, hilary?

265
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,720
Hi.

266
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:20,769
Yeah, we're late, darling.
I'm sorry, we've got to...

267
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,938
we were just chatting about Christmas,
actually, you know.

268
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:25,314
Family and all that...

269
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:26,754
Coming together...

270
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,866
Christmas dinner. Right, dad?

271
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,082
Oh, I wish we'd known.

272
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,842
Unfortunately,
our table's full, so...

273
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,467
Always ready for one more
at Christmas, right?

274
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,580
Don't you think, darling,
maybe one more, would...

275
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:37,892
What, in our house?

276
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,012
We'll have children there.

277
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,260
Eh?

278
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:41,188
What's that supposed to mean?

279
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,724
Jack, we're late, come on.

280
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,125
I'm not contagious, you know.

281
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,429
Wait... take this.

282
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:48,517
No, I don't want any money.

283
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,606
It's... here.

284
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:51,526
Maybe, um...

285
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:53,222
Maybe, new year's, okay?

286
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:55,911
Darling, hold up.

287
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:57,959
Hey, wait for me.

288
00:20:58,312 --> 00:20:59,559
Yeah.

289
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:09,833
Hey, mate?

290
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,393
Hey, how are you?

291
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:13,481
It's okay.

292
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,306
It's okay.

293
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:17,546
You're hurt.

294
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,498
What have you been
doing today?

295
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:23,691
Did you get into a fight?

296
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:27,788
Is it okay if I take you
and try and find your owner?

297
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:29,260
Is it okay?

298
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:30,893
It's okay.

299
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:34,765
Yeah.

300
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:36,589
Down here.

301
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,214
Ah, excuse me?

302
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,134
Would you know
whose cat this is?

303
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,991
Wait, I have a hurt cat here.

304
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:45,999
It's you with the dogs?

305
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:48,848
Yeah, it's just in there.

306
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,904
What did you do to her?

307
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:51,152
No, I didn't do anything.
I just...

308
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:52,593
Just found him over there.

309
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,792
Don't just stand there.

310
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,483
It's all right.

311
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,148
Here you go.

312
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:17,653
See.

313
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,318
There we go.

314
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:26,517
And, it might be purulent.

315
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,669
It might be what?

316
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:28,950
The wound.

317
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:31,478
He needs antibiotics
before it's infected.

318
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,078
Maybe they can
glue it together.

319
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,134
He needs a vet.

320
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,055
Oh, it sounds expensive.

321
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:38,583
Can you put a price on that?

322
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:40,056
I don't know.
He's not my cat.

323
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,496
I mean, I just found him.
I think...

324
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:42,904
He's like a stray, or...

325
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:43,673
I don't know.

326
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,433
Well...

327
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:48,505
He is telling me, he was
here to be with you.

328
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:51,386
Reading his spirit
loud and clear.

329
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,170
He came to you for a reason.

330
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,899
You... you're what,
you're sensing that?

331
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:58,523
Of course not, what do I look
like, some kind of nut?

332
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:04,251
There's a card there, for
the vet that I volunteer at.

333
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:05,756
It's a charity.

334
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,100
Tell them Betty sent you.

335
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:08,412
Okay, how much?

336
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:10,301
And you are?

337
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:11,645
Me, I'm a...

338
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:13,309
I'm, James. James Bowen.

339
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:14,877
Oh, I, I don't believe
in last names.

340
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,094
Big trouble, burdens...

341
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,134
Um...

342
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,055
I got to go,
I've got dogs to walk.

343
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:22,047
All right. Yeah.

344
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:26,080
Okay, mate, okay,
it's all right.

345
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:27,103
Are you okay?

346
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,120
Yeah, uh, allergic, animals.

347
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,464
Ironic, huh?

348
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:31,489
Yeah.

349
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:33,312
Um, you should go.

350
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:35,233
Bacteria is multiplying
by the second.

351
00:23:35,235 --> 00:23:36,673
And, Bob, needs a vet.

352
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:39,906
That's what he told me
he wants you to call him.

353
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:41,410
It's okay.

354
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:42,818
He's not actually
my cat, you know.

355
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,251
No. Mine, your's. We all
belong to each other.

356
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:47,267
See you, Bob!

357
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,547
It's nice to meet you.

358
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:51,396
You're a bit of an
attention hog.

359
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:52,612
You know that, Bob?

360
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,397
It's okay.

361
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:00,485
It's okay, I got you.

362
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:10,599
See you later.

363
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,680
Hi, there. I just
found this cat.

364
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:18,312
And he's hurt himself.

365
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,337
A stray?

366
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:21,257
Um, I don't know.

367
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,984
You're asking us
to put him down?

368
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:25,802
Do you know how many stray
cats there are in London?

369
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:26,570
It's an epidemic.

370
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:27,754
Well, he's got a name.

371
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:28,522
It's Bob.

372
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:30,314
And he's... wounded, so...

373
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:31,563
It's purulent.

374
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:33,963
Take a number.

375
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:35,467
It's going to
be a long wait.

376
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,667
I've got to be somewhere.

377
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:40,620
Can't we drop him off
and come back?

378
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:42,220
Does this look like
a dry cleaner's?

379
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:54,670
It's okay.

380
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:57,903
It's okay.

381
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:04,432
Hey, look. It's a rabbit.

382
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,240
No, no, no.

383
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,225
Don't look at the rabbit,
rabbit's not for dinner, okay?

384
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:16,626
Don't worry about him, Bob.
It's okay.

385
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,861
Bob, look. It's the month
of the cat.

386
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:33,461
Yeah.

387
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:36,981
So, kind of hip for you,
isn't it?

388
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,253
Look at, Tiffany.

389
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:41,365
She looks cute.

390
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,902
Who's that? Look at that one.

391
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:44,183
Lucky?

392
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,622
Look at, lucky?

393
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:47,607
Doesn't look very lucky,
does he?

394
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:55,032
I've lost my appointment.
Val is gonna kill me.

395
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:57,944
I've got this rush hour
busking to do, I've gotta go.

396
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:59,289
I'll have to come
back tomorrow.

397
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,522
Number 62 is up.

398
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:06,682
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

399
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:09,787
Hi.

400
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,163
He did great!

401
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:12,059
Is he okay?

402
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:13,948
Yeah? Come on, mister.

403
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,035
In you go.

404
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:16,508
That's it. Good boy.

405
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,676
And you get your pills
from the front desk.

406
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,732
Okay.

407
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:23,453
22 pounds.

408
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:26,686
Uh, I thought
this place was free?

409
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,094
Not the drugs.

410
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,230
Sorry, mate.

411
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:33,663
Hang on.

412
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,639
That's all I've got.

413
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:38,335
Come on,
at least for his sake.

414
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,688
All right, look.

415
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:46,017
This is my food money
or the next week.

416
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:47,233
It's up to you.

417
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:53,794
All right.

418
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,874
Come on, Bob.
Time for your medicine.

419
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:57,634
This is gonna make
you feel better, yeah?

420
00:26:57,636 --> 00:26:59,075
Look, I've sat, yeah?

421
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,035
Exactly.

422
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:01,891
All right, ready?

423
00:27:02,596 --> 00:27:04,099
Open, wide?

424
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:05,892
No, no, no, no, no.
Come here.

425
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:06,852
All right.

426
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,900
Bob, Bob. Look, look...

427
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:10,853
Yeah, just,
down the hatch, mate.

428
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:13,157
Oi... oi...
Come back here, mister.

429
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:14,277
Come here.

430
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,142
All right.

431
00:27:15,144 --> 00:27:16,229
Come here.

432
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,606
Hey, hey.

433
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:19,014
Oi... no, Bob.

434
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:22,182
Bob!

435
00:27:25,256 --> 00:27:27,720
Right. Okay. Okay.

436
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:33,352
Bob?

437
00:27:33,577 --> 00:27:34,889
Treat.

438
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:38,954
All right, mister.

439
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:40,841
Let's try this again.

440
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:43,018
Twice a day, for two weeks...

441
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,042
They said.

442
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:46,059
No. Come here.

443
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:47,467
All right.

444
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,828
No. No, no.
Stay here. Stay here.

445
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,076
Stay here.

446
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:53,228
Bob. Bob. Bob.

447
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,493
Aye! Come here, come here.
All right, come here, look.

448
00:27:56,495 --> 00:27:58,668
Look. What's that?
What's that.

449
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,365
What's that, what's that...

450
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:02,189
Bob!

451
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,645
It's all right, mate.
It's okay.

452
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,238
Oh, I know.

453
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,871
I swear. He wasn't
like this earlier.

454
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:12,271
Yeah. Well, I've had practice.

455
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,832
Did they tell you to bring
him back in a couple of weeks?

456
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:18,256
Yeah, that'll be a good
time to get him snipped.

457
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:20,208
Snipped?

458
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,649
Yeah, man parts.

459
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,625
But, I mean...

460
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:26,002
Please, that isn't a big deal.

461
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,729
It's easy for you to say.

462
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:28,689
Besides, he's not even mine.

463
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:30,482
An intact male
alone on the streets,

464
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,794
it's the worst life
imaginable.

465
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:35,283
They fight for food,
they fight for territory.

466
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:36,787
I need to imagine that, do I?

467
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:39,892
If you can't give him a home at least
give him the chance to stay alive.

468
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:42,452
Now, ordinarily,
i don't touch meat, but...

469
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,732
Bob needs some protein, so...

470
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,805
What do you do?

471
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,149
How did you end up here?

472
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,397
Me?

473
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:50,645
Well, I know what he does.

474
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,430
- What have you got there?
- Allergy pills.

475
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,262
Oh, right, I thought...

476
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,727
Otherwise I'm 100% anti drug.

477
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,543
A lot of addicts in here.

478
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,207
I steer clear.

479
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:02,647
So...

480
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:03,863
You do?

481
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:04,919
How did you end up here?

482
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,680
I'm... I'm a musician.

483
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:09,080
- I write songs, and play.
- Yeah?

484
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,353
Yeah, I haven't exactly
been discovered yet.

485
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,689
But, I've just moved in here,
which is good.

486
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:15,289
From Australia?

487
00:29:15,802 --> 00:29:16,953
Oh, well, I...

488
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,066
I've actually
been back a while, uh...

489
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:20,538
Sort of...

490
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,770
In between places...
I guess you could say, um...

491
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:27,355
Got taken out there as a kid
when my parents split up.

492
00:29:27,357 --> 00:29:30,364
And, my mum took me
out there, dad stayed here.

493
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:32,892
He had his business
to run and...

494
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:34,396
Didn't like flying, apparently.

495
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:35,804
And you?

496
00:29:37,822 --> 00:29:38,749
Well...

497
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:41,565
She brought me
a kitten, actually.

498
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:45,214
Dad, kitten. Kitten, dad.

499
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,366
You must've missed him?

500
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,422
My dad?

501
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:49,215
It's a long story.

502
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,263
Long story, eh?

503
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:55,008
I'm so sorry
i missed our appointment.

504
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,504
Honestly, I've tried
to get there, little things...

505
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:58,688
There was this cat, right...

506
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,808
We have an agreement.

507
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,345
You miss your appointment
you're out of the program.

508
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:03,905
And I met this girl, Betty.

509
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:06,721
I'm waiting for the part that explains
why you missed our appointment.

510
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:09,730
Is that blood on your coat?

511
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:10,755
Must be, Bob's.

512
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,291
Who's Bob?

513
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,371
Bob's my cat I'm telling you
about. Look...

514
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,395
Not really mine.

515
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,291
Betty's?

516
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:17,124
No.

517
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,076
Betty is allergic.

518
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:21,540
And, but, she told me
to take him to the vet.

519
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:23,364
You seem a little rattled.

520
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:25,573
I'm trying to explain to you
why I missed our appointment.

521
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,845
Bob was hurt,
he needed a vet.

522
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:28,965
It took forever.

523
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:31,174
How'd you pay for the vet?

524
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,862
It was my... my dad
gave me some money.

525
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,111
You saw your dad?

526
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:36,231
Yeah.

527
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,895
Bumped into him, um...

528
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:40,712
It didn't go very well.

529
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,952
This, Betty, does she use?

530
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:44,552
No.

531
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:47,145
I put myself on
the line for you.

532
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:51,465
Did you tell her you
were in the program?

533
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:52,842
I told her I was a musician.

534
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:56,395
So you didn't tell
her the truth?

535
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,051
Wow!

536
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:01,931
You've covered a lot of ground
since I last saw you.

537
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,883
You can't take on
too much too fast.

538
00:31:03,885 --> 00:31:05,132
Because I'm an emotional wreck?

539
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:07,404
Because, feelings aren't
an addict's friend.

540
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:10,125
Bad, good, any feelings.

541
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:12,397
When was the last time
you were totally sober?

542
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,117
No weed, no brown, nothing?

543
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,902
When my parents split up,
and I was...

544
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:19,918
You just couldn't
deal with your emotions?

545
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,486
Emotions are still dangerous.

546
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:24,879
It's baby steps, James.

547
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:27,728
You're not ready
for a relationship.

548
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:11,735
Another one?

549
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:16,247
Hang it up high?

550
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:18,584
Go on. Come up.

551
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:19,928
Good boy.

552
00:32:21,177 --> 00:32:22,809
You could get
your strength back.

553
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,170
Hey.

554
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,866
Here he is.

555
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,098
Look at your collar!

556
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,819
Look at you. You look like
Shakespeare, or something.

557
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:40,731
He's a little drowsy, but
the castration went well.

558
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,108
Please, don't even say
the word.

559
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,932
I think
he understands English.

560
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:45,564
Here you go.

561
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,972
It's okay. Does it hurt...

562
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:47,805
Down there?

563
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:49,341
Big worry.

564
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,325
Do you know how many cats
we castrate every...

565
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:52,125
Uh...

566
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:54,142
Following procedure...

567
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:56,126
He won't even remember,
won't you, Bob?

568
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:57,438
Yeah, I don't know
about that.

569
00:32:58,495 --> 00:32:59,231
You know...

570
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:01,951
I was thinking, is he too thin?

571
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:03,488
You're keeping him,
aren't you?

572
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:05,119
Well, I'd like to, but...

573
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:07,231
I can't. I mean, it wouldn't
be fair to him, would it?

574
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:10,016
Keep him cooped up all day.

575
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,129
He's a street cat.

576
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:13,856
His weight's fine.

577
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,585
He should be good
to go in a week.

578
00:33:15,587 --> 00:33:16,641
Okay.

579
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:18,305
Thank you.

580
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:24,739
Oi.

581
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,307
I know, I know.

582
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,003
No, don't look at me
like that.

583
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,764
It's for your own good.

584
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,700
Hey, it wasn't my idea.

585
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:34,917
You take it up with Betty.

586
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:37,669
Okay, look.

587
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:40,965
I'll take that off if you promise
not to let the stitches, okay?

588
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,654
All right. No, it's okay.

589
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:46,374
Now, you hold still there.

590
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,263
It's okay. It's okay, Bob.

591
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:49,831
Let me just take this
off, okay.

592
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,823
That's it.

593
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,487
That is a good boy.
Okay, here we go.

594
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,760
There you go.

595
00:33:58,345 --> 00:33:59,433
Hey, look?

596
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:00,937
Got this.

597
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:02,537
Come on.

598
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:03,913
Look, look.

599
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:05,577
See, there you go.

600
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,202
Yeah, I'm your he right now.

601
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:10,378
You wait till you realize
you got no bits left.

602
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:31,181
Good morning, mate.

603
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,416
No, no, no, no, Bob!

604
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:36,889
Bob, Bob, no.

605
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:39,769
Naughty.

606
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,881
Eh? Don't I feed you enough?

607
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,634
You only eat what I give you.

608
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:45,786
Yeah?

609
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:47,515
Not the neighbors.

610
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:49,691
And you...

611
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:51,227
Don't come back.

612
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:10,814
Oi, no, look, Bob.

613
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:12,254
Bob.

614
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:13,918
I've got to go
to work, all right.

615
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,615
I can't take care of you.

616
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:16,895
I wish I could, but...

617
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:18,303
I can't.

618
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:21,344
Look at the big world
out there.

619
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,497
Waiting for you.

620
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:24,032
Go and explore it, okay.

621
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:26,881
That's it, good boy.

622
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:31,457
So long, Bob.

623
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:47,620
Come on.

624
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,444
This is the city now,
what did I just say

625
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:51,237
you nearly got run over.

626
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,189
Hey, it's not safe out here.

627
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:55,205
I mean it. You can't
come with me.

628
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,718
Seriously, you'd be surprised
at how much he understands.

629
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,599
Hey, Bob, go on.
Go back to the grass.

630
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:06,791
Go on. Good boy!

631
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:08,616
Boy.

632
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,972
That's so sweet.

633
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:37,036
What are you doing here?

634
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:38,508
Hey, now, don't go over there.

635
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,069
He's not even my cat, he just
followed me onto the bus.

636
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:42,957
Loving you, okay.

637
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:46,190
Aw, ain't he lovely!

638
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:47,854
Is it okay,
that he's on here?

639
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:49,038
I don't know,
who paid for him?

640
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,095
Two for one?

641
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:54,223
You want to go up here?

642
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:55,439
There you go.

643
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:57,648
It's a good view.

644
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,728
Yeah.

645
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,633
What are you doing,
following me into town?

646
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,242
Hey, Bob. Look.

647
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:15,155
Look at those, mate.

648
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:16,627
Yeah, you're a lion.

649
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:17,812
You're a lion!

650
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:19,251
Yeah.

651
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:21,780
They've got nothing
on you, mate.

652
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:27,765
Yeah, would this help, love?

653
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,141
That's perfect.

654
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,837
Well, that's good
its a bit thicker.

655
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,085
Yeah.

656
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:33,270
Not too tight, now.

657
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:37,238
It's just if he get spooked in town,
I don't want him to run off.

658
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,902
He's not actually mine,
you know, he's a stray.

659
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:40,503
No, he don't look
like a stray to me.

660
00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:42,487
I don't know.

661
00:38:56,538 --> 00:38:58,010
Good boy, good boy.

662
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:00,634
Come on. Come on, Bob.

663
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,267
This way.

664
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:03,962
We're not going to make
any money here, mate.

665
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:05,243
Come on, this way.

666
00:39:05,692 --> 00:39:07,611
Good boy. On we go.

667
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:10,460
Whoa! Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...

668
00:39:11,614 --> 00:39:13,116
Good boy, good boy.

669
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,972
That's enough shopping
for one day.

670
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:19,197
Bob, come on.

671
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,830
Come on.

672
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,230
I'll tell you what.
You jump up here.

673
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:25,854
Look, we haven't
got all day. Come on.

674
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,447
Good boy.

675
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:30,175
A lot better up there?

676
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:32,832
This is covent garden.

677
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:35,168
You okay, Bob?

678
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,568
Bob, the goodest cat!

679
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,969
Oh, goody, you are!

680
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:40,896
She doesn't mean you.

681
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,210
He's gorgeous!

682
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:43,329
Thank you.

683
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,146
See that. I'd like
to see you do that.

684
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,546
- Hey, can I have a photo?
- Hello.

685
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:50,370
Yeah, yeah. Okay, sure.

686
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:51,618
Say, "cheese," Bob.

687
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:53,571
All right?

688
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:04,037
You're quite the little
party piece, aren't you?

689
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,277
Mother, look,
he's so cute!

690
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,366
Look at the cat!

691
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:08,870
Hi.

692
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:11,014
You want to say hello?

693
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:14,247
We're playing now, over there,
so if you want to come and watch then...

694
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:15,143
You want to?

695
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:17,799
Yes! Yes!

696
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:19,911
Good work. You're getting
your time, is it?

697
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:56,216
High five.

698
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:57,720
Hey, high five.

699
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:01,944
Do you know
what just happened?

700
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:03,481
Look at this!

701
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:04,857
Hey!

702
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:07,385
You are a wonderful
little being, aren't you?

703
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:11,322
You got yourself
a lovely ginger, all right.

704
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:14,842
I had a ginger tom
just like him, once.

705
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,531
Loved him with all my heart.

706
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:18,747
He's got a mind of his own.

707
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:19,868
Well, that's the point.

708
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,428
The gingers got wills
like iron, they are.

709
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,181
Mine wouldn't leave my side
till his last breath.

710
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:27,389
You've got yourself
a lovely partner there.

711
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:29,309
Better friends
than people they are.

712
00:42:29,311 --> 00:42:30,781
Believe me.

713
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:34,750
Is that right, Bob?

714
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:35,966
Boy.

715
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:55,329
Hey, mister you were a hit
today, weren't you?

716
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:02,115
All right, you want to
come again tomorrow?

717
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:03,458
The bright lights.

718
00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:05,666
There, look.

719
00:43:06,212 --> 00:43:07,203
This could be you, Bob.

720
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:09,507
Your name in lights, look.

721
00:43:18,694 --> 00:43:20,581
You want to get some food
when we get home?

722
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:27,847
Dinner is served.

723
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:30,087
Okay.

724
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,127
You played a blinder.

725
00:43:35,593 --> 00:43:36,776
There you go.

726
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:42,889
Bob.

727
00:43:44,523 --> 00:43:47,690
Yeah, you're gonna wear professional
cat harness wearer now.

728
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:50,027
Did you think about that?

729
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:04,236
Hello, stranger.

730
00:44:04,718 --> 00:44:05,485
Hi.

731
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:06,989
Oh, haven't seen you around?

732
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:11,438
Oh, I'm going on a march
to free farm animals.

733
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,334
Free what?

734
00:44:12,336 --> 00:44:14,031
Only cows, pigs, chickens.

735
00:44:14,032 --> 00:44:14,958
Turkeys.

736
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,134
Uh, you want them
just running the street?

737
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,631
We want them
not to be murdered.

738
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:21,231
Don't tell me
you're a carnivore?

739
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:23,280
Um, never really
thought about it.

740
00:44:23,825 --> 00:44:24,784
Well...

741
00:44:25,169 --> 00:44:26,736
Think about it.

742
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:28,752
Every bite you take
you're eating suffering!

743
00:44:28,754 --> 00:44:30,545
Living all posh,
now, eh?

744
00:44:30,547 --> 00:44:31,889
Off the streets and all?

745
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:34,034
What are you doing here?

746
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:36,530
I just though I'd
follow a friendly face.

747
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:38,930
I thought maybe I could crash
with you for a bit, you know?

748
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,779
Spread the word
for about a bit.

749
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:43,283
- Hello, kitty.
- Oi!

750
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:44,883
Go away, baz, all right.

751
00:44:44,885 --> 00:44:46,004
I mean it.

752
00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:48,051
Come on, anything.

753
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,844
I had a bit of hard lines, mate.

754
00:44:51,734 --> 00:44:53,012
James, please.

755
00:44:53,782 --> 00:44:54,709
Please, James.

756
00:44:54,711 --> 00:44:55,829
Look at you.

757
00:44:56,342 --> 00:44:57,973
All right.

758
00:44:57,975 --> 00:44:59,638
This is for food,
yeah, baz. All right?

759
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,694
Promise. Yeah, for food.

760
00:45:00,696 --> 00:45:02,774
- Please promise me.
- Honestly, yeah, promise.

761
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:04,374
Well, I mean it.
I mean it.

762
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:07,799
Hey, you need to look
after yourself, all right?

763
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:09,079
Please, baz.
Buy some food, all right.

764
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,551
- I promise, it's food.
- Yeah?

765
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:14,840
And don't come
back here, all right?

766
00:45:18,106 --> 00:45:19,257
Nice cat.

767
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,115
Thank you.

768
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:56,831
Thank you very much.

769
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,336
Thank you, merry Christmas.

770
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,664
Oh, hi.

771
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:04,768
Hope you don't mind, but,
i got Bob a little something for Christmas.

772
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:07,489
Look at that, Bob.

773
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,546
You want a bit of that?

774
00:46:08,547 --> 00:46:09,825
And I made him
a little something.

775
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:11,426
Oh, you shouldn't have.

776
00:46:12,387 --> 00:46:13,922
Thank you. Look at that!
Look at that!

777
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:15,298
Hope he likes it.

778
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,611
Thank you so much.
You're an angel.

779
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:18,019
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

780
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:19,619
I wasn't always an old lady.

781
00:46:23,268 --> 00:46:24,580
Thank you!

782
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,732
Look at that, Bob.

783
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:26,916
You're gonna have that later.

784
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:31,365
Hi, Betty.

785
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,029
Oh, look at Bob!

786
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:35,301
Dr. who's twin.

787
00:46:35,303 --> 00:46:36,390
Love the scarf.

788
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:37,766
Yeah, just got it.

789
00:46:37,768 --> 00:46:39,238
You all right?
You look tired.

790
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,054
I've been busy,
or, rather he has.

791
00:46:42,056 --> 00:46:43,335
I've been to more
into sidekick.

792
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,119
I'm starving. Can I...

793
00:46:46,121 --> 00:46:47,463
Can I get you dinner?

794
00:46:47,465 --> 00:46:49,736
Anything, as long as
there's tuna.

795
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:52,232
I'm level four, vegan.

796
00:46:52,234 --> 00:46:54,344
Um, I don't know
what you said.

797
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:55,977
I don't eat anything
that casts a shadow.

798
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,962
You don't get shadows
on the wall now, do you?

799
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:01,802
All right, how about this.
I will cook you dinner.

800
00:47:01,804 --> 00:47:02,890
You give me an hour.

801
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:04,042
Yeah.

802
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:05,066
Yeah? Okay.

803
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:06,283
An hour? No more, no less.

804
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:07,403
Okay.

805
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,188
I think this is a date, Bob.

806
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:14,700
So, who did
all these paintings?

807
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:16,653
Only the most talented
painter I know.

808
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:18,796
Well, that narrows it down.

809
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,005
Strained seitan with miso.

810
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:21,773
Bang.

811
00:47:21,998 --> 00:47:23,501
Wow!

812
00:47:23,503 --> 00:47:25,294
Just eat it,
it's good for you.

813
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:26,542
Yeah. Ahem!

814
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:30,255
I'm actually...
Painting my flat as well.

815
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:32,239
Maybe not quite like this.

816
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,192
I can see.

817
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:35,056
Mm-hmm.

818
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:40,144
Oh, I just bloody bought this.

819
00:47:40,146 --> 00:47:41,904
I've got some dabs
in the kitchen if you want.

820
00:47:42,897 --> 00:47:44,433
Painting by?

821
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:45,457
Life must be good?

822
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:46,801
Yeah, well, first I come...

823
00:47:46,803 --> 00:47:49,106
Join the real world after
all these years, you know.

824
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:51,186
Meaning?

825
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:53,010
I, just um...

826
00:47:53,012 --> 00:47:55,187
You know, I said about
my parents splitting up and...

827
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,851
I just, I got moved
around a lot, and...

828
00:47:56,853 --> 00:47:58,323
You went off
the rails a bit...

829
00:47:58,325 --> 00:47:59,027
A little angry...

830
00:47:59,029 --> 00:47:59,668
You know, wild...

831
00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:02,420
Yeah, you could say that.

832
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,685
But anyway, what about you?

833
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,637
More?

834
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:09,717
Thank you.

835
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:17,526
Right, we need
some real food, Bob.

836
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:18,934
What's it gonna be?

837
00:48:18,936 --> 00:48:20,279
You want some hot dogs?

838
00:48:20,888 --> 00:48:22,360
No? Okay.

839
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,624
All right, so what
do you fancy?

840
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:28,440
Wild pacific pink salmon?

841
00:48:29,882 --> 00:48:31,193
Is that a yes?

842
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:32,281
Okay, we'll get one of them.

843
00:48:32,698 --> 00:48:33,785
Ah, what else?

844
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:35,034
Some tuna?

845
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:36,506
Yeah?

846
00:48:36,508 --> 00:48:38,650
Yeah, that's a yes
for that as well.

847
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:40,474
What else? Ah...

848
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:43,867
Boneless sardines?

849
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:45,531
Yeah, you want that,
don't you?

850
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:47,932
Okay.

851
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:48,955
It's good.

852
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:51,516
Salmon, tuna, sardines.

853
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:53,085
Good to go?

854
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:54,685
All right.

855
00:48:57,054 --> 00:48:59,998
We are gonna eat like
kings tomorrow, Bob.

856
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:03,678
Tell you what...

857
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:07,743
We'll get a bunch of
these as well, please.

858
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:08,511
Of course.

859
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:09,664
All right, then.

860
00:49:09,665 --> 00:49:11,168
Hey.

861
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,768
Bob, they're for Betty.

862
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,168
Thank you, Bob.

863
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:26,466
Hello!

864
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:30,242
Hello?

865
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:35,876
Oh, no.

866
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:37,700
Please. Bob, down.

867
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:39,492
Baz. Baz, wake up!

868
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:41,060
Wake up, baz.

869
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,980
Wake up, come on, wake up!

870
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:45,253
Baz? Hello, wake up!
Can you hear me?

871
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:46,373
Baz! Wake up!

872
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:48,645
Can somebody call
an ambulance?

873
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:50,566
No. Bob, Bob,
get away from that.

874
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:51,654
No.

875
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,927
Hey, baz,
come on, wake up.

876
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:55,302
Hey! Call an ambulance!

877
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:56,295
They're on their way.

878
00:49:56,297 --> 00:49:57,863
Baz! Baz, listen to me.

879
00:49:57,865 --> 00:49:58,824
Come on.

880
00:49:58,825 --> 00:49:59,976
James!

881
00:49:59,977 --> 00:50:02,088
- Has he od'ed?
- Yeah.

882
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,264
- You checked his airways?
- No, no.

883
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:06,409
- Help me get him up.
- Yeah, okay. Come on.

884
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:08,553
Is he breathing?

885
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:09,705
Baz, come on!

886
00:50:10,218 --> 00:50:11,721
Come on, baz, wake up!

887
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:17,610
Come on.

888
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:18,795
He's od'ed.

889
00:50:18,797 --> 00:50:19,818
- What's his name?
- Baz.

890
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,227
All right, baz,
can you hear me?

891
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:22,827
You know, he's taken heroin.

892
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:27,116
How old is he?
Do you know?

893
00:50:27,118 --> 00:50:28,108
About 20.

894
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,388
Baz, can you hear me?

895
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:33,197
Let's get him up.

896
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:35,470
One, two, three.

897
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,919
Make some room.

898
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:46,511
I know a bit
about addicts.

899
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,167
I was in sheffield...

900
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:51,696
Studying a veterinary course...

901
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:54,928
My parents didn't
call, they...

902
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:56,881
Drove up and told me...

903
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,305
My brother was everything
to me.

904
00:51:03,347 --> 00:51:04,562
Protector...

905
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:05,746
Teacher...

906
00:51:05,748 --> 00:51:07,859
He was the best painter
i ever knew.

907
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:09,075
- This was your...
- Yeah.

908
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:10,675
Your brother's place?

909
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,371
Mm-hmm.

910
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:15,668
He died right back
there in the bathroom.

911
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,484
The needle still in his arm.

912
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:21,461
Don't you eat?

913
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:24,853
- So why did you um...
- Move in here?

914
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:26,934
Be near him.

915
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:30,422
He tried.

916
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,039
So hard to get clean.

917
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:37,976
But I guess that he
didn't want it enough.

918
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:40,440
Or could...

919
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:42,392
Want it enough.

920
00:51:43,545 --> 00:51:44,985
But he couldn't do it.

921
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:47,353
Not even for me.

922
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:55,226
I thought you wanted clean?

923
00:51:55,228 --> 00:51:56,986
I do. Of course I do.

924
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,075
Then why not now?

925
00:51:58,077 --> 00:52:00,156
I'm ready to come
off the methadone.

926
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,724
It's a process, James.

927
00:52:01,726 --> 00:52:03,868
It's my job to manage
the process with you.

928
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:06,300
I'm down to ten mil.

929
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:08,637
Let's revisit this after
the holidays.

930
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,301
God knows how hard
enough as it is.

931
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,829
Hey, you're doing great.

932
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:14,781
I just, I want...

933
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,502
I want to be clean.
I want to live a life.

934
00:52:18,783 --> 00:52:20,127
This... this kid...

935
00:52:20,129 --> 00:52:21,119
I knew, baz.

936
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,391
He, um...

937
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,176
He od'ed and died, and...

938
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:29,473
I don't want
to go that way.

939
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:30,816
I know.

940
00:52:31,457 --> 00:52:32,672
After the holidays?

941
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:34,849
Yeah.

942
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,554
Look, I've got
another appointment.

943
00:52:40,419 --> 00:52:41,506
Okay.

944
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:44,675
Hey, no.

945
00:52:44,677 --> 00:52:45,795
Come on.

946
00:52:45,797 --> 00:52:47,139
What are you
doing for Christmas?

947
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:52,100
As long as I promise not to mention the
words Christmas, or merry in any way.

948
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,156
My kind of girl.

949
00:52:53,158 --> 00:52:55,941
Ho, ho, ho! Happy catsmas.

950
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:56,837
What's all this?

951
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:57,989
Happy catsmas, Bob.

952
00:52:57,991 --> 00:52:59,205
New girlfriend for you.

953
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:00,229
This is, bobbina.

954
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:01,958
He's not impressed.

955
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,750
Oh, so, he was
just playing hard to get.

956
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,311
Don't panic by the way. This
isn't a-you-know-what tree.

957
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:08,167
No, it's a lamp tree.

958
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:14,376
Tastes like Turkey?

959
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:16,392
Not even vaguely.

960
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,256
It does.

961
00:53:17,258 --> 00:53:18,793
- Tastes like rubber.
- No, it doesn't!

962
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,865
It's nice, but I think if
you're going to eat tofu

963
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:24,969
why pretend it's Turkey,
or burgers, or whatever.

964
00:53:24,971 --> 00:53:27,241
It's like giving tofu
an inferiority complex.

965
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:28,842
Let it be who it wants to be.

966
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:30,858
"I am tofu."

967
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,042
"I am inedible."

968
00:53:32,044 --> 00:53:33,579
It's not inedible!

969
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:34,379
No.

970
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,787
- Give it to Bob to try it.
- Okay.

971
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:36,907
He's a better judge than you.

972
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,636
Bob. Bob. What's that?

973
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:40,460
What's that?

974
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:41,676
Num-nums?

975
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:45,709
I think he doesn't know.

976
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:49,710
Oh, wow!

977
00:53:51,343 --> 00:53:53,006
I love it!

978
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:53,967
Yeah?

979
00:53:54,415 --> 00:53:55,150
Thank you!

980
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,136
Oh, right, okay. So I'll
read this to you, mate.

981
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:07,984
"Dear James and boblib, happy catsmas.
Lots of purrs and whiskers." From Betty.

982
00:54:07,986 --> 00:54:08,784
Eh?

983
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:09,809
Good, right?

984
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:11,313
Thank you.

985
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:15,282
This is one
of your brother's?

986
00:54:15,284 --> 00:54:16,466
Yeah, yeah.

987
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:17,458
I mean, its just...

988
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,027
Yeah, just... just that.

989
00:54:20,084 --> 00:54:21,203
There you go.

990
00:54:21,588 --> 00:54:23,859
So beautiful.

991
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:26,196
Yay.

992
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,227
Come on?

993
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:12,635
No, you know I can't sing.

994
00:55:15,614 --> 00:55:16,860
It's awful, I can't.

995
00:55:22,911 --> 00:55:24,285
Bob.

996
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,621
I don't know. Is it crazy?

997
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,022
What's surprising you?

998
00:55:29,024 --> 00:55:30,847
Dad, and his new family
on new year's Eve,

999
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:34,238
well, they've given no indication
that they want you back?

1000
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,415
If you want you put
it like that, but,

1001
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:39,903
you know I didn't exactly say
i couldn't come, and...

1002
00:55:39,905 --> 00:55:42,880
I don't know, things have been
going pretty good lately.

1003
00:55:55,364 --> 00:55:57,763
You ever wonder why
people kiss with their lips?

1004
00:55:57,765 --> 00:56:00,739
And why not rub ears like...

1005
00:56:01,604 --> 00:56:03,043
I want to hear you?

1006
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:06,180
Or wrists, like this?

1007
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,415
Why don't you play quietly,
please, come on.

1008
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:15,696
Did you drink your tea?

1009
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,416
Oh, come on!

1010
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:21,393
What will my family say, Bob.

1011
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:23,440
Right, come on.

1012
00:57:23,442 --> 00:57:24,785
We got this far.

1013
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:27,441
You know what...

1014
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,674
Let's put you under here.

1015
00:57:30,676 --> 00:57:33,171
I think two surprise guests might
be more than they can handle.

1016
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:34,195
Right, come on.

1017
00:57:34,419 --> 00:57:35,891
Come on.

1018
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:38,419
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1019
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,188
All right.

1020
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:41,492
Ha, ha, what...

1021
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:42,484
Happy new year?

1022
00:57:43,637 --> 00:57:44,853
Uh...

1023
00:57:45,941 --> 00:57:47,317
Uh...

1024
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:49,717
Yeah, thanks.
How are you doing?

1025
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:51,893
All right. Wow, nice house!

1026
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,166
Hi, kids.

1027
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:55,702
Girls, you remember
your brother?

1028
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,814
Kris, faith, this is James.

1029
00:57:57,816 --> 00:57:59,799
You've grown up so much
since I last saw you.

1030
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:01,847
what were you
playing in there?

1031
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,512
Dad and I used to play
trivial pursuit.

1032
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:07,736
You let me play the adult version that
weekend before I left for Melbourne.

1033
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,017
- Did I?
- Yeah

1034
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,105
she was cheating.

1035
00:58:10,106 --> 00:58:11,609
And mama doesn't like you.

1036
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,273
Mummy says you're a junkie.

1037
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:14,522
I didn't cheat, you cheated.

1038
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:15,609
I did not, you cheated!

1039
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:16,474
Is there an adult here?

1040
00:58:16,476 --> 00:58:17,626
Stop it. Girls, come on.

1041
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:18,875
Where did you get
that idea from?

1042
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:19,866
Stop it, please!

1043
00:58:19,868 --> 00:58:21,306
You can't be here,
we got guests coming.

1044
00:58:21,308 --> 00:58:22,491
Go, mummy will be down...

1045
00:58:22,493 --> 00:58:24,219
I thought you said
new year's would be okay?

1046
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,787
I said maybe, you...

1047
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:26,748
Should have called!

1048
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,412
He's a junkie!
He's a junkie!

1049
00:58:28,414 --> 00:58:30,043
Will you
leave the tree alone!

1050
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:31,612
I'm a recovering
addict actually.

1051
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,013
Daddy, he's got a cat!

1052
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:35,165
What the hell!

1053
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:36,925
Hey kids, meet, Bob.

1054
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,357
Bob!

1055
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:40,702
Bob, Bob... Bob...

1056
00:58:40,704 --> 00:58:41,886
Chris, leave it!

1057
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:42,910
Bob, Bob!

1058
00:58:42,912 --> 00:58:44,158
Stop screaming!

1059
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,111
Jack, what is going on here?

1060
00:58:46,113 --> 00:58:47,039
It's James.

1061
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,015
Hey, Hillary.
Happy new year! Bob?

1062
00:58:50,017 --> 00:58:51,295
What is he doing here?

1063
00:58:51,297 --> 00:58:52,160
Faith!

1064
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,176
Listen mommy, he's got a cat!

1065
00:58:54,178 --> 00:58:55,168
But she's allergic!

1066
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:55,968
I know!

1067
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,377
Bob!

1068
00:58:57,379 --> 00:58:58,465
Please, don't...

1069
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:00,449
Get that thing out of here!
She'll have an attack.

1070
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:01,474
I'm trying, I'm trying.

1071
00:59:01,475 --> 00:59:02,593
James, please.

1072
00:59:02,595 --> 00:59:04,450
Come on, mate. Come here.

1073
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:05,377
Bob, come on.

1074
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:06,594
Oh,
for goodness sake...

1075
00:59:07,235 --> 00:59:08,386
No!

1076
00:59:12,388 --> 00:59:13,507
That was my mother's.

1077
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:14,404
I know.

1078
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:16,836
Bob? Bob!

1079
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:17,668
I'm sorry, I'm...

1080
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,564
Get out of my house!

1081
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:21,125
You and your creature,
just get out!

1082
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:22,116
Come on, James.

1083
00:59:22,118 --> 00:59:23,045
Come on, mate.

1084
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:24,165
Bob!

1085
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:26,725
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1086
00:59:26,727 --> 00:59:28,165
It's okay, come on.
It's okay.

1087
00:59:29,672 --> 00:59:32,614
What do you think I'm going to do,
close the door in his face!

1088
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:33,894
What am i
supposed to do.

1089
00:59:33,896 --> 00:59:35,590
- You told me before.
- Don't let him in...

1090
00:59:35,592 --> 00:59:36,871
can I stroke him?

1091
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,247
Can I?

1092
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:39,624
Yeah, you can try.

1093
00:59:40,073 --> 00:59:41,672
So cute.

1094
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:44,873
How old is he?

1095
00:59:44,874 --> 00:59:45,993
I don't know.

1096
00:59:46,602 --> 00:59:48,105
I want a kitten?

1097
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:51,305
My friend, Sammy,
has a kitten.

1098
00:59:51,307 --> 00:59:52,617
Make sure
he's out of here!

1099
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:56,362
Happy new year, dad.

1100
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:24,623
Thanks.

1101
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:38,353
Nice to see you again.

1102
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:06,678
Go on, right there.

1103
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:08,502
That's it, go on.

1104
01:01:08,504 --> 01:01:09,367
Hey!

1105
01:01:09,368 --> 01:01:11,095
Piss off, you moron.

1106
01:01:11,097 --> 01:01:12,823
It's more like piss onto me.

1107
01:01:12,824 --> 01:01:15,159
Get that dog away from here,
I'm trying to play here.

1108
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:16,023
Come on, mate.

1109
01:01:16,025 --> 01:01:16,856
Come on.

1110
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:18,136
What! Don't touch me.

1111
01:01:18,137 --> 01:01:19,864
Will you get that
person out of here?

1112
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:21,464
What, just
because there's a crowd?

1113
01:01:22,106 --> 01:01:23,513
Don't touch me, yeah!

1114
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:27,097
Back off, back off.

1115
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,946
I got a cat under here.

1116
01:01:29,948 --> 01:01:33,082
Hey! Hey, that's enough
over here. Give it up.

1117
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:34,843
Just leave, it's not me.

1118
01:01:34,845 --> 01:01:36,314
My dog needed a piss.

1119
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:38,235
It's your fault
with that dog...

1120
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:44,316
Cc TV proved
it wasn't your fault.

1121
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:46,588
You had it here for busking
for six months.

1122
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:50,685
Do you want to thank me for
coming down and bailing you out?

1123
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:51,485
Maybe you can focus.

1124
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,957
You can't go back
to covent garden.

1125
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,853
You're banned from busking.

1126
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:55,774
I want to know
where my cat is?

1127
01:01:55,775 --> 01:01:56,894
You missed your meds,
didn't you?

1128
01:01:56,896 --> 01:01:58,270
I just want to know
where Bob is.

1129
01:01:58,272 --> 01:02:00,063
He's safe, he's in
the police kennel.

1130
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:01,951
We can go and get him
right now.

1131
01:02:03,424 --> 01:02:06,208
You got yourself arrested and you
didn't get your methadone, James!

1132
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:08,160
You are so close.

1133
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:09,376
Don't lose it now.

1134
01:02:09,378 --> 01:02:10,784
It wasn't my fault,
none of this.

1135
01:02:10,786 --> 01:02:12,225
It wasn't my fault.

1136
01:02:12,227 --> 01:02:17,346
authorize them to give you the methadone
even though you missed it yesterday.

1137
01:02:17,348 --> 01:02:20,258
You go straight there,
I'll get Bob, okay?

1138
01:02:24,804 --> 01:02:26,179
Hello.

1139
01:02:26,181 --> 01:02:28,771
If you failed the shot any day we
can't give you the medication.

1140
01:02:28,773 --> 01:02:30,083
Yeah, she called you,
didn't she?

1141
01:02:30,085 --> 01:02:31,364
Like your work here,
she called?

1142
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:32,356
I'm just warning you.

1143
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:34,084
Okay.

1144
01:02:34,726 --> 01:02:35,556
Sign.

1145
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,846
Come on, man.

1146
01:02:54,377 --> 01:02:55,303
Let me explain.

1147
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,352
What's to explain,
i have eyes, James.

1148
01:02:57,354 --> 01:02:59,593
You're an addict,
you lied to me.

1149
01:02:59,595 --> 01:03:01,289
No, I didn't lie,
i just, I just...

1150
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:02,697
Shaded the truth a little.

1151
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,042
Oh, please!

1152
01:03:04,044 --> 01:03:06,154
Wait, look, okay, yeah,
I'm on the methadone program, yeah...

1153
01:03:06,156 --> 01:03:09,514
But I haven't used for three months,
and believe me i am trying to get clean.

1154
01:03:09,516 --> 01:03:11,307
I can't be around addicts,

1155
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:14,507
I told you that, it's just...
It's too much...

1156
01:03:14,509 --> 01:03:16,939
I can't do it! And I wasn't
shading the truth.

1157
01:03:16,941 --> 01:03:19,692
This, this dog, Bob, and
i was trying to protect him

1158
01:03:19,694 --> 01:03:21,612
and then this whole fight
broke out, and then...

1159
01:03:21,614 --> 01:03:24,845
I got arrested. I wasn't doing anything
wrong, it wasn't me fault but,

1160
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:28,621
that, and busking if I do,
then I'll get arrested again and then...

1161
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:30,702
I don't know. I don't know
what even happened to Bob.

1162
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:32,910
If you can't sing then you
can't make any money.

1163
01:03:32,912 --> 01:03:34,767
And if you do sing then
you'll get arrested

1164
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:37,039
and all you're thinking about
is what happens to the cat.

1165
01:04:06,868 --> 01:04:09,748
When you sell our magazine,
you get out or you put in.

1166
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,732
You know they say
weed is a gateway drug.

1167
01:04:11,734 --> 01:04:13,973
Uh, yeah, I'm a little
familiar with the concept.

1168
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,758
Well, the big issue is
the gateway opportunity.

1169
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,997
I'll start you off with
a handful of free ones.

1170
01:04:18,999 --> 01:04:21,974
Just like a pusher, right, you sell them,
the next ones you buy from us.

1171
01:04:21,976 --> 01:04:23,735
Sell those, make
a little profit...

1172
01:04:23,737 --> 01:04:28,759
After a while you get better territories,
work your way up, et cetera, et cetera.

1173
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:31,992
Before you know it, you're freaking
Rupert Murdoch. But not a dick head.

1174
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:34,328
If you can't sell them
we don't buy them back.

1175
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:37,465
And you get one
designated territory, get it?

1176
01:04:37,467 --> 01:04:39,289
Poach on anyone else,
and you're done.

1177
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:41,081
Period, boom, clear?

1178
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,074
Boom, clear.

1179
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:43,034
Good.

1180
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:46,074
You can't have an animal
in your photo.

1181
01:04:46,076 --> 01:04:47,290
This is your official ID.

1182
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:48,283
What animal?

1183
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:50,395
I don't see an animal,
this is my co-pilot.

1184
01:04:50,397 --> 01:04:51,675
Yeah, I heard about that.

1185
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:53,147
Okay.

1186
01:04:53,693 --> 01:04:55,036
Look this way.

1187
01:04:55,037 --> 01:04:56,092
Say cheese, Bob.

1188
01:04:58,078 --> 01:05:01,149
You know what, I might have just
the right thing for you two.

1189
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,133
It'll cost a tenner.
But it's worth it.

1190
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:25,825
Big issue!
Come on guys!

1191
01:05:25,827 --> 01:05:27,745
Give it a try,
help for the night.

1192
01:05:27,747 --> 01:05:29,570
Big issue!

1193
01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:31,298
Can I have a selfie
with the cat?

1194
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,482
Do you take a picture?

1195
01:05:32,484 --> 01:05:34,531
And then you buy a paper,
how is that?

1196
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:37,347
Oh, you are a good
businessman, I like that.

1197
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:38,915
Come on, Bob,
look at the camera.

1198
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:40,707
There you go, all right.

1199
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:43,748
He wants to give you
a high five. High five, Bob.

1200
01:05:43,749 --> 01:05:44,900
High five there.

1201
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:46,020
Oh, that's two pounds, fifty.

1202
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:48,836
I've only got two thirty,
is that all right?

1203
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:50,949
Two pounds, fifty. I can
see thats two pounds, fifty.

1204
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:52,581
Excuse me, mate.

1205
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:55,494
Hello, Peter gruner,
I'm from the<i> Islington tribune.</i>

1206
01:05:55,496 --> 01:05:58,791
Do you mind if I did a story
on you and the cat?

1207
01:05:58,793 --> 01:05:59,847
You taking the Mick?

1208
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:00,999
Ooh, can I pet him?

1209
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:02,855
You can try, just
behind the ears though.

1210
01:06:02,857 --> 01:06:04,519
I see you're a human
interest story.

1211
01:06:04,521 --> 01:06:05,991
- What's that?
- Would you mind?

1212
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,232
All, right. Yeah, sure.

1213
01:06:08,234 --> 01:06:09,544
Look this way, Bob.

1214
01:06:09,897 --> 01:06:11,336
Bob, over there.

1215
01:06:11,338 --> 01:06:12,200
Bob?

1216
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,065
Lovely.

1217
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:14,825
Another one.

1218
01:06:15,274 --> 01:06:16,969
Big issue! Big issue!

1219
01:06:17,483 --> 01:06:18,730
Big issue!

1220
01:06:21,707 --> 01:06:23,755
Big issue, big issue.

1221
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:26,027
Big issue!

1222
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:27,659
Bloody stupid cat.

1223
01:06:55,985 --> 01:06:57,072
Hello, mate.

1224
01:06:57,074 --> 01:06:58,288
Go screw yourself, yeah.

1225
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:00,529
Hey, watch your mouth.
I've got a nine in here.

1226
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,961
Excuse me, sir.

1227
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:04,977
Sir! Sir.

1228
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,698
Can I take a picture
of you and your cat?

1229
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,337
Please?

1230
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:09,906
Uh... yeah, sure, sure.

1231
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,387
It's okay, Bob.
He loves your hat.

1232
01:07:15,348 --> 01:07:16,787
- Great.
- Okay, no worries.

1233
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:18,131
Thank you.
Can we buy a magazine?

1234
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:19,059
Oh, sorry,
it's not my patch.

1235
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:20,659
You go speak to that guy
over there.

1236
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:21,972
We just really want
to help, please.

1237
01:07:21,973 --> 01:07:22,740
Ah, you cant.

1238
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:23,829
Thank you
so much.

1239
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,301
- Have a great day.
- And you.

1240
01:07:27,414 --> 01:07:28,469
Come on,
i wasn't poaching.

1241
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:30,037
Do you know...
He knows I wasn't poaching.

1242
01:07:30,039 --> 01:07:31,221
My patch!
You're selling papers.

1243
01:07:31,223 --> 01:07:32,502
What else you want to call it?

1244
01:07:32,504 --> 01:07:33,302
Call it envy.

1245
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:34,807
Envy! I'll envy your arse.

1246
01:07:34,808 --> 01:07:36,119
God, stop, stop it.

1247
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:37,367
James, you knew the rules.

1248
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:38,391
I wasn't selling,
i was just...

1249
01:07:38,393 --> 01:07:39,735
One month, no papers.

1250
01:07:39,737 --> 01:07:42,039
Come on, don't do this to me,
i wasn't selling I promise you.

1251
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,255
- You knew the rules.
- This was one...

1252
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:44,632
Couple that came up,
you saw what happened.

1253
01:07:44,634 --> 01:07:46,360
So they forced you to sell
to them, didn't they?

1254
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:47,416
I wasn't trying to poach.

1255
01:07:47,418 --> 01:07:48,601
You're taking
business off me, yeah.

1256
01:07:48,603 --> 01:07:50,776
Why are you making this up,
why are you picking on me?

1257
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:52,249
- Enough, enough.
- I saw you took the money.

1258
01:07:53,786 --> 01:07:55,641
One month, no papers.

1259
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:12,893
What?

1260
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:15,036
Nothing.

1261
01:08:16,766 --> 01:08:18,366
Just the... chaos.

1262
01:08:18,368 --> 01:08:19,934
Chaos around drug addicts?

1263
01:08:20,927 --> 01:08:23,102
Life's a constant shit storm.

1264
01:08:23,104 --> 01:08:24,286
That kind of chaos?

1265
01:08:31,104 --> 01:08:33,120
Bob, put the frog down.

1266
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,368
Leave it.

1267
01:09:12,841 --> 01:09:14,310
I'll leave at one.

1268
01:09:19,658 --> 01:09:21,448
Here you go.

1269
01:09:36,012 --> 01:09:37,803
Come on, Bob.

1270
01:10:20,114 --> 01:10:21,618
Hey, there's nothing there.

1271
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:23,666
It's empty, mate.

1272
01:10:29,076 --> 01:10:29,971
Bob.

1273
01:10:32,213 --> 01:10:33,396
Bob, stop it.

1274
01:10:36,726 --> 01:10:38,229
Get a little rest,
mate, come on.

1275
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:42,613
Bob.

1276
01:10:45,112 --> 01:10:46,358
Stop it!

1277
01:10:47,479 --> 01:10:49,590
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1278
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:53,239
I know, I know
you're hungry, buddy.

1279
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,351
I'm sorry.

1280
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,960
I'll find a way, okay.

1281
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:03,385
I'll find a way.

1282
01:11:46,498 --> 01:11:48,160
James, what are you doing?

1283
01:11:48,162 --> 01:11:49,441
Betty. Oh, I'm just...

1284
01:11:49,442 --> 01:11:50,816
You've been banned
from busking.

1285
01:11:50,818 --> 01:11:52,609
Well, Bob's hungry,
I'm hungry.

1286
01:11:52,611 --> 01:11:54,849
If you get arrested you're not
gonna be able to feed Bob.

1287
01:11:54,851 --> 01:11:56,353
They're not going
to arrest me. Not here.

1288
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,426
What, you think your just above the rules.
That they don't apply to you?

1289
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:00,867
Gosh, they're typical!

1290
01:12:00,868 --> 01:12:01,986
Typical of what, Betty?

1291
01:12:01,988 --> 01:12:04,195
Oh, go on, say it.
Let them hear.

1292
01:12:04,197 --> 01:12:06,947
What am I supposed to do,
how am I supposed to eat?

1293
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:07,619
I don't know.

1294
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:08,388
I... I don't know.

1295
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,700
What do you want me to do?

1296
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:11,908
Just erase the last 20 years
of my life and start over?

1297
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,964
I don't know!

1298
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:14,501
I would if I could.

1299
01:12:14,503 --> 01:12:16,261
You know who shouts
like this in public!

1300
01:12:16,263 --> 01:12:19,749
And the people who fall
in love with them, that's who.

1301
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:23,238
I can't do this again.

1302
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:31,047
I didn't like it
any more than you.

1303
01:12:31,688 --> 01:12:32,871
Those are the rules.

1304
01:12:33,801 --> 01:12:34,856
Welcome back.

1305
01:12:34,858 --> 01:12:35,688
Thank you.

1306
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:36,904
James...

1307
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:38,696
Watch yourself, okay?

1308
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:39,721
Yeah.

1309
01:12:40,393 --> 01:12:41,257
Big issue!

1310
01:12:41,258 --> 01:12:42,921
Give it a try.
Help Bob and I.

1311
01:12:42,923 --> 01:12:44,778
Big issue, come on.

1312
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,057
Oh, yes, mate.

1313
01:12:46,059 --> 01:12:47,050
Thank you very much.

1314
01:12:47,052 --> 01:12:48,874
Oh, he's adorable!

1315
01:12:48,876 --> 01:12:50,474
This is, Bob.
You want to say hello?

1316
01:12:50,476 --> 01:12:51,947
- Say hello.
- Hi.

1317
01:12:52,332 --> 01:12:54,571
Would you care
for a big issue, ma'am?

1318
01:12:54,573 --> 01:12:56,107
Oh, yeah, of course.

1319
01:12:56,109 --> 01:12:58,091
Actually, we came
to see the cat.

1320
01:12:58,093 --> 01:12:59,020
Oh, yeah?

1321
01:12:59,022 --> 01:13:00,556
Yes, Graham can't stop
talking about him.

1322
01:13:00,558 --> 01:13:01,868
He's beautiful, isn't he?

1323
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:03,404
Where's he from?
I found him.

1324
01:13:03,406 --> 01:13:04,173
You like Bob?

1325
01:13:04,175 --> 01:13:06,061
Two pounds, fifty, please.

1326
01:13:06,063 --> 01:13:07,213
Yeah, he's my best mate.

1327
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:08,845
We want the best for him.
All of that.

1328
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:10,286
Here you go.
Thank you very much.

1329
01:13:10,288 --> 01:13:11,310
Yeah, of course, yeah.

1330
01:13:11,312 --> 01:13:13,710
What I mean is I'd be willing
to take him...

1331
01:13:13,712 --> 01:13:14,991
Well, I mean, to buy him...

1332
01:13:14,993 --> 01:13:16,143
- Uh...
- Even, how much?

1333
01:13:16,145 --> 01:13:17,583
He's not for sale.

1334
01:13:17,585 --> 01:13:19,952
Well, like obviously, this isn't
the best environment for an animal,

1335
01:13:19,954 --> 01:13:21,968
living on the streets
and all that...

1336
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,024
Yes, all right, darling.

1337
01:13:23,026 --> 01:13:24,688
Well we've got a flat, so...

1338
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,121
We've got all the things that you can't,
like a decent home

1339
01:13:27,123 --> 01:13:30,257
And I'm sure you can use the cash,
how much do you want?

1340
01:13:30,259 --> 01:13:31,185
I don't want your money.

1341
01:13:31,187 --> 01:13:32,465
How about,
how much for your kid?

1342
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:34,161
Or I'll trade you.

1343
01:13:34,163 --> 01:13:35,890
Yeah, I'll give him
a decent home.

1344
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:37,554
How dare you?
It's exceptionally rude.

1345
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:42,194
Bob!

1346
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,531
Bob!

1347
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:51,893
Bob!

1348
01:13:53,621 --> 01:13:54,901
Bob! Oh, no!

1349
01:14:00,855 --> 01:14:01,974
Bob!

1350
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:11,544
Excuse me, did you
see a cat come here?

1351
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:12,312
No.

1352
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,368
A ginger cat... no?

1353
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:14,904
Bob!

1354
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,337
Bob!

1355
01:14:17,946 --> 01:14:19,321
Bob!

1356
01:14:21,307 --> 01:14:22,425
Bob!

1357
01:14:24,603 --> 01:14:25,690
Bob.

1358
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:27,803
Oh, mate, where are you?

1359
01:14:28,668 --> 01:14:29,723
Bob.

1360
01:14:31,036 --> 01:14:32,123
Bob.

1361
01:14:36,797 --> 01:14:39,228
What if the dog got him,
or a car, or...

1362
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:43,037
I can't.

1363
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:47,389
It's been two nights, you know.

1364
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:50,366
Look.

1365
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:51,550
I'm not saying this is it...

1366
01:14:52,511 --> 01:14:53,823
But...

1367
01:14:53,825 --> 01:14:56,191
Maybe, Bob did what
he was meant to do.

1368
01:14:57,185 --> 01:14:58,080
He's a cat.

1369
01:14:58,082 --> 01:14:59,392
Cats are independent animals.

1370
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:01,312
My own stupid fault,

1371
01:15:01,314 --> 01:15:03,072
I wasn't...
I wasn't watching him.

1372
01:15:04,098 --> 01:15:06,433
You know, I promised
I'll take care of him, but...

1373
01:15:08,994 --> 01:15:10,050
I wasn't watching him.

1374
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:12,034
This isn't a time you
want to be on your own,

1375
01:15:12,036 --> 01:15:13,826
what about your dad, or Betty?

1376
01:15:13,828 --> 01:15:15,842
Oh, I need to, um...

1377
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,403
I need to get home, I need
to wait for him there.

1378
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,251
And maybe he'll come back.

1379
01:15:21,253 --> 01:15:22,723
I really need to have
someone with you.

1380
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:24,388
He might come back,
mightn't he?

1381
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:25,572
He might, oh, yeah.

1382
01:15:25,574 --> 01:15:27,108
He could come home,
couldn't he?

1383
01:15:33,222 --> 01:15:34,085
James?

1384
01:16:06,412 --> 01:16:08,043
Oh, I knew these two.

1385
01:16:08,045 --> 01:16:10,540
I used to see them all the
time when he was singing.

1386
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,916
But look at this.

1387
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:15,436
This guy and his cat are all over YouTube,
look at the hits.

1388
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:17,261
Over a million.

1389
01:16:17,263 --> 01:16:18,445
And they're on instagram.

1390
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:20,525
And Facebook.

1391
01:16:21,262 --> 01:16:22,286
They're so cute.

1392
01:16:23,118 --> 01:16:25,102
Look at that.
Incredible.

1393
01:16:25,104 --> 01:16:26,350
So, you're thinking a book?

1394
01:16:30,064 --> 01:16:31,023
Hmm.

1395
01:17:01,973 --> 01:17:03,892
Are you looking
for paradise?

1396
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:05,556
'Cause I've got all day.

1397
01:17:05,558 --> 01:17:07,668
White. Brown,
whatever you like.

1398
01:17:13,815 --> 01:17:15,862
I want my cat. I'm...

1399
01:17:16,952 --> 01:17:19,094
I'm looking for a ginger cat.

1400
01:17:19,096 --> 01:17:20,823
Have you seen it anywhere?

1401
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,331
Bob! Bob...

1402
01:17:46,812 --> 01:17:47,868
Hey!

1403
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,211
Hey, mister.

1404
01:17:50,173 --> 01:17:51,933
Where have you been, hey?

1405
01:17:51,935 --> 01:17:53,341
Where have you been?

1406
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,221
Oh, Bob.

1407
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:06,046
I'm ready.

1408
01:18:06,976 --> 01:18:08,415
I think you are, too.

1409
01:18:09,312 --> 01:18:11,072
It's about weathering
the tests, James.

1410
01:18:11,648 --> 01:18:12,640
Can I do it straight?

1411
01:18:12,642 --> 01:18:14,784
That's always
an addict's question.

1412
01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:17,249
Think of the worst flu
you've ever had.

1413
01:18:17,251 --> 01:18:18,753
Multiply that by hundred.

1414
01:18:20,066 --> 01:18:21,825
Do you know what
riding the bike is?

1415
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:24,481
It's when you can't keep your legs
still even when you're lying down...

1416
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:27,202
For a week,
everyday of your fight.

1417
01:18:27,204 --> 01:18:30,531
Every hour a struggle not
to go out and score.

1418
01:18:30,533 --> 01:18:33,155
It's harder coming of methadone
than kicking heroin.

1419
01:18:33,157 --> 01:18:34,691
You can't do it on your own.

1420
01:18:35,589 --> 01:18:36,580
I'm not.

1421
01:18:37,605 --> 01:18:38,500
I got him.

1422
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:41,253
He got me this far.

1423
01:18:41,255 --> 01:18:44,581
The other day we were out selling
papers and this guy came up to us,

1424
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:48,582
And I just thought that they wouldn't want
to share the pavement with me before.

1425
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:51,719
He called me, "sir".

1426
01:18:53,191 --> 01:18:55,206
"Sir, do you mind
if I take your picture?"

1427
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,247
No one's ever
called me sir before.

1428
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:01,000
And it's because of Bob.

1429
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,400
He's shown me
what life could be like.

1430
01:19:04,681 --> 01:19:05,801
On the other side.

1431
01:19:29,326 --> 01:19:30,349
Betty.

1432
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:35,214
I know you're in there.

1433
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:40,654
Just wanted to say you're not
going to see me for a few days.

1434
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:41,870
Val's given me the go ahead.

1435
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:43,535
So...

1436
01:19:43,537 --> 01:19:44,815
I'm doing it.

1437
01:19:46,928 --> 01:19:48,240
I'm...

1438
01:19:49,297 --> 01:19:51,601
I'm sorry that
I've disappointed you.

1439
01:19:53,553 --> 01:19:54,544
And...

1440
01:19:54,546 --> 01:19:56,401
And after all this, I'll...

1441
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,545
I'll make it up to you.

1442
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,706
Make it up to everyone
i ever knew.

1443
01:20:03,795 --> 01:20:05,874
I just... just wanted
to let you know.

1444
01:20:19,926 --> 01:20:21,205
You're gonna need food.

1445
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:22,997
A stockpile, because...

1446
01:20:22,999 --> 01:20:26,421
Any excuse to go outside and
you're going to try and score.

1447
01:20:26,423 --> 01:20:27,862
Let me bring you the food.

1448
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,143
Then lock the door.

1449
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:30,486
Tofu?

1450
01:20:32,248 --> 01:20:34,263
I'll make an exception
this once.

1451
01:20:34,488 --> 01:20:35,735
Okay.

1452
01:20:35,737 --> 01:20:36,791
But that's all.

1453
01:20:36,793 --> 01:20:38,936
I don't want you
to see me like that.

1454
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:40,856
And I've got Bob.

1455
01:20:40,858 --> 01:20:42,073
He'll look after me.

1456
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:32,171
<i>Bob!</i>

1457
01:23:09,938 --> 01:23:10,929
Hey.

1458
01:23:12,178 --> 01:23:13,234
Hey, mister.

1459
01:24:03,259 --> 01:24:04,570
I'm very proud of you, James.

1460
01:24:06,652 --> 01:24:08,763
So, what are you going
to do now?

1461
01:24:09,148 --> 01:24:10,427
First thing...

1462
01:24:10,429 --> 01:24:12,475
I'm going to try and
find a way to thank you.

1463
01:24:12,477 --> 01:24:13,308
Ah...

1464
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:14,491
Come here.

1465
01:24:17,534 --> 01:24:19,485
All right. Come on, mister.

1466
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:20,412
Let's go.

1467
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:21,597
Come on.

1468
01:24:21,854 --> 01:24:22,909
Yeah.

1469
01:24:25,247 --> 01:24:26,717
Please take care of yourself.

1470
01:24:27,455 --> 01:24:28,510
And you.

1471
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:30,110
Thanks, val.

1472
01:24:31,552 --> 01:24:32,703
Come on, mate.

1473
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,071
He's coming.

1474
01:24:38,752 --> 01:24:39,807
Yeah, that one too.

1475
01:24:43,361 --> 01:24:45,953
You give us a
hand with this, ready?

1476
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:47,777
Sorry, I didn't know
why the door was shut.

1477
01:24:48,514 --> 01:24:49,794
- Hi.
- Hi.

1478
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,642
Look at you!

1479
01:24:54,404 --> 01:24:55,426
You did it!

1480
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:56,931
Yeah, just.

1481
01:24:58,213 --> 01:24:59,203
You look great.

1482
01:24:59,748 --> 01:25:00,579
Thanks.

1483
01:25:00,581 --> 01:25:01,507
How do you feel?

1484
01:25:02,469 --> 01:25:05,284
Yeah, now I feel good.

1485
01:25:07,525 --> 01:25:08,581
The same, but...

1486
01:25:09,254 --> 01:25:10,309
Totally different.

1487
01:25:10,534 --> 01:25:11,973
What...

1488
01:25:11,975 --> 01:25:13,125
What's going on, you're moving?

1489
01:25:13,351 --> 01:25:14,758
Yeah...

1490
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,718
Going home for a while.

1491
01:25:17,223 --> 01:25:18,630
I can't stay here.

1492
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:21,127
It's not my life.

1493
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,687
It was my brother's, and...

1494
01:25:24,392 --> 01:25:25,768
I need to move on.

1495
01:25:26,056 --> 01:25:26,888
Yeah.

1496
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:28,616
You actually helped me
see that.

1497
01:25:29,353 --> 01:25:30,056
Good.

1498
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,385
Um...

1499
01:25:33,386 --> 01:25:35,817
It doesn't necessarily
mean goodbye.

1500
01:25:36,138 --> 01:25:36,841
No, do...

1501
01:25:36,843 --> 01:25:38,314
Oh, wait...

1502
01:25:45,484 --> 01:25:46,410
For you.

1503
01:25:46,412 --> 01:25:48,524
I... yeah, I made this one.

1504
01:25:48,525 --> 01:25:50,028
It hangs over the...

1505
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:51,371
Yeah, I know these all right.

1506
01:25:52,524 --> 01:25:53,420
Thank you.

1507
01:25:54,957 --> 01:25:55,949
That's my address.

1508
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:58,157
My parent's address
is where I'd be staying.

1509
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,405
Elizabeth Robinson?

1510
01:26:00,046 --> 01:26:01,229
It's my real name.

1511
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:04,366
Hello, reality.

1512
01:26:05,295 --> 01:26:06,798
My number's on there too.

1513
01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:08,654
In case you need me.

1514
01:26:10,032 --> 01:26:11,247
Until we meet again.

1515
01:26:12,144 --> 01:26:14,159
Oh, a, there was
a guy hanging around,

1516
01:26:14,161 --> 01:26:15,408
who wants to give you this.

1517
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:17,200
Um, he asked me to
make sure you got it.

1518
01:26:17,585 --> 01:26:19,153
Literary agency.

1519
01:26:21,618 --> 01:26:22,513
All right.

1520
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:24,561
Say hi to Bob.

1521
01:26:24,563 --> 01:26:26,353
I will do.

1522
01:26:26,355 --> 01:26:27,953
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you too.

1523
01:26:28,402 --> 01:26:29,586
All right.

1524
01:26:34,771 --> 01:26:37,236
While we were thinking
a book, for starters,

1525
01:26:37,237 --> 01:26:38,804
we'd like to team you up
with a ghostwriter

1526
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:40,564
he'll help you tell
your story.

1527
01:26:40,566 --> 01:26:42,036
Sorry, it's stories.

1528
01:26:43,222 --> 01:26:45,301
We think it would
make a great book.

1529
01:26:46,006 --> 01:26:47,509
Or a series of books.

1530
01:26:48,023 --> 01:26:52,150
The important thing is that
we need to get a hold of you.

1531
01:26:52,152 --> 01:26:53,718
I don't actually
have a phone currently.

1532
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,214
Okay, um, we can sort that.

1533
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:57,239
Should we get one for Bob?

1534
01:26:57,241 --> 01:26:58,678
I think we could share.

1535
01:26:59,353 --> 01:27:01,719
Looks like he wants
to write it then.

1536
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:13,785
What, what...
What are you...

1537
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:16,122
I'm clean, dad.

1538
01:27:17,563 --> 01:27:18,906
Clean as, what, like...

1539
01:27:18,908 --> 01:27:19,770
Everything.

1540
01:27:21,308 --> 01:27:22,170
I just...

1541
01:27:22,812 --> 01:27:23,867
Wanted you to know.

1542
01:27:26,268 --> 01:27:27,643
You know, I was um...

1543
01:27:27,645 --> 01:27:29,916
I was thinking when I was
standing here just now,

1544
01:27:30,941 --> 01:27:31,869
the last time...

1545
01:27:32,766 --> 01:27:34,141
I wasn't...

1546
01:27:34,143 --> 01:27:35,677
High in front of you...

1547
01:27:36,286 --> 01:27:37,374
I was leaving...

1548
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:39,613
For Australia.

1549
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:44,670
I wanted to apologize.

1550
01:27:46,783 --> 01:27:47,871
For everything.

1551
01:27:52,065 --> 01:27:53,632
I don't blame you...

1552
01:27:54,145 --> 01:27:55,328
For giving up on me.

1553
01:27:57,122 --> 01:27:58,945
No, dad, I don't
want your money.

1554
01:28:10,595 --> 01:28:11,875
I didn't give up on you.

1555
01:28:15,077 --> 01:28:16,484
I was ashamed.

1556
01:28:17,637 --> 01:28:18,756
Of myself.

1557
01:28:20,389 --> 01:28:22,245
I was never afraid to fly.

1558
01:28:23,558 --> 01:28:26,181
I... I just didn't
know how to do...

1559
01:28:28,422 --> 01:28:30,118
I didn't know how
to be your father.

1560
01:28:37,256 --> 01:28:39,207
I'm the one who
needs to apologize.

1561
01:28:40,586 --> 01:28:43,273
Jack, what are
you doing out there?

1562
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:48,713
I'm talking to my son!

1563
01:28:54,219 --> 01:28:55,722
And my grandson.

1564
01:28:57,164 --> 01:28:58,763
I got him on a lead,
don't worry.

1565
01:29:05,357 --> 01:29:06,860
Wait till you see
the screen saver.

1566
01:29:08,269 --> 01:29:09,197
Look at that.

1567
01:29:11,629 --> 01:29:12,717
Yeah.

1568
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,759
Where'd they go, hey?

1569
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,967
How are you doing in the deep
blue sea there, Bob?

1570
01:29:23,473 --> 01:29:26,384
I've got to get this bloke
garry, a lot of notes.

1571
01:29:27,152 --> 01:29:28,080
Stop fishing.

1572
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:40,466
Good morning, monster.

1573
01:29:41,554 --> 01:29:42,674
Hello, mate.

1574
01:29:44,628 --> 01:29:46,002
Caught any fish yet?

1575
01:29:49,972 --> 01:29:53,908
<i>How is a guy who spent a third of his
life checked out to write a book?</i>

1576
01:29:55,541 --> 01:29:56,820
Come on, Bob,
help me out here.

1577
01:29:58,198 --> 01:29:59,092
I'm stuck.

1578
01:30:08,087 --> 01:30:09,302
Bob.

1579
01:30:09,528 --> 01:30:10,358
Bob!

1580
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:22,040
I just loved it,
every word!

1581
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,057
Thank you.

1582
01:30:24,059 --> 01:30:26,777
James, we're about to start.

1583
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:29,049
Not before you say hi
to your biggest fan.

1584
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:31,322
Betty?

1585
01:30:31,323 --> 01:30:32,602
I'm so proud of you.

1586
01:30:32,891 --> 01:30:33,947
Hi.

1587
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:35,515
Thanks for coming.

1588
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:39,387
James.

1589
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:43,580
- James.
- Oh, yeah.

1590
01:30:43,582 --> 01:30:44,732
Come on.

1591
01:30:44,734 --> 01:30:45,565
Okay.

1592
01:30:45,567 --> 01:30:46,909
Off you go.

1593
01:30:48,286 --> 01:30:49,661
Right, Bob.

1594
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:51,965
Thank you.

1595
01:30:56,927 --> 01:30:58,174
Hey, Bob.

1596
01:31:00,832 --> 01:31:02,047
- Hi, dad.
- Son.

1597
01:31:02,049 --> 01:31:03,712
- What?
- A bit overwhelmed.

1598
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:05,216
Yeah.

1599
01:31:05,218 --> 01:31:07,200
It's gonna survive.

1600
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:09,569
I told you weren't a stray.

1601
01:31:10,402 --> 01:31:12,481
- Bob.
- Yeah.

1602
01:31:16,418 --> 01:31:18,658
Come on, Bob, high five.

1603
01:31:19,011 --> 01:31:20,995
Good boy.

1604
01:31:25,412 --> 01:31:27,523
Hi, everyone.

1605
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:29,668
Didn't expect that there'd
be so many people here.

1606
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:34,373
some joke about there not being
enough room to swing a cat.

1607
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,141
But...

1608
01:31:35,143 --> 01:31:36,549
I don't think Bob
would like that.

1609
01:31:36,869 --> 01:31:37,989
Um...

1610
01:31:38,758 --> 01:31:40,165
A friend helped me with this...

1611
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:43,526
And... when I was stuck...

1612
01:31:43,528 --> 01:31:47,719
Her advice was, "start by mentioning
that everyone gets a second chance."

1613
01:31:48,647 --> 01:31:50,151
But... but not everyone...

1614
01:31:50,856 --> 01:31:52,199
Manages to take them.

1615
01:31:54,121 --> 01:31:55,368
Luckily for me,

1616
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:58,600
I had some very
important companions,

1617
01:31:59,273 --> 01:32:00,681
to help with my second chance.

1618
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:04,361
And then she said,

1619
01:32:04,363 --> 01:32:06,730
to just tell the truth.

1620
01:32:06,732 --> 01:32:07,818
And that's what I've done.

1621
01:32:18,253 --> 01:32:19,884
Absolutely loved it.

1622
01:32:19,886 --> 01:32:21,196
Thank you.

1623
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:26,765
- A little paw print there.
- Thank you so much.

1624
01:32:26,767 --> 01:32:27,821
Here you go.

1625
01:32:29,551 --> 01:32:30,702
Enjoy that?

1626
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:32,718
It's like I lived
every moment.

1627
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,542
Good, okay.

1628
01:33:02,836 --> 01:33:03,859
Come on, you guys.

1629
01:33:07,765 --> 01:33:09,237
Keep it going, it's great!

1630
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:10,453
Now, you guys.

1631
01:33:20,919 --> 01:33:22,423
<i>Wow, beautiful!</i>

1632
01:33:22,425 --> 01:33:23,767
Let's train our faces.

1633
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,719
C<i> ome on, getting low.</i>

1634
01:33:35,033 --> 01:33:36,280
All together!

1635
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:44,282
It sounds beautiful.

1636
01:34:12,608 --> 01:34:14,207
Of the cat, hey.
