1
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:02,311
Previously on The Firm

2
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:08,612
What I gave you
incriminated the firm.

3
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:10,013
You said it would
motion a chain of events

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,519
that could cripple
the mob, Mitch.

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,637
They deal in revenge.

6
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:13,938
This is Marshal Coleman

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,407
with the witness
protection program.

8
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:19,911
It's been ten years.
We're done running.

9
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,345
The firm--
it's called Kinross & Clark.

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,747
They offered me the job.

11
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,483
- You joined a firm?
- I'm not kissing any asses.

12
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:26,717
Fair enough.

13
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:27,919
You report to me
on all our cases.

14
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:29,654
I'm your boss
from this day forward.

15
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,173
- I'm your defense lawyer,
Sarah--I'm Mitch McDeere.

16
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:34,542
I have questions, questions like
why would a 27-year-old

17
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,510
kill a 71-year-old woman
in her sleep?

18
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:37,645
I didn't.

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,580
Does he know why
we made him an offer?

20
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:40,815
No.

21
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,150
Of course, our real interest
here--Sarah Holt.

22
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,619
We were just
discussing your case.

23
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,587
I'm telling you,
I'm onto something.

24
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:47,655
He should be
under surveillance.

25
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,956
We should
be listening everywhere.

26
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,358
Our priority here
is control.

27
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:52,827
I have to see somebody.
Somebody knows the truth.

28
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,830
If Mitch McDeere ever finds
the truth in this case,

29
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:58,499
everyone in this room
is going to prison.

30
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,735
Mr. Markson,
thank you for coming.

31
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,939
Five minutes.
That's what you said...

32
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:06,107
Then I'm gone.

33
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,975
This is my client.

34
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,043
You know who this is?

35
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:09,577
No.

36
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,412
A woman is dead.

37
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,914
Bottom line is the trail leads
me to you and your company.

38
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,333
They'll kill me.

39
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,634
Hell, I'm already dead.

40
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:17,635

I can't help you.

46
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:29,280
And you can't help me.

47
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:30,982
Mr. Moxon.

48
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:33,017

49

Boundaries?

00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,494
That's not a word you use
in a law firm, buddy.

That's a word you use in

00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:15,980
Well that's number 1.

79
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:17,148
I get to approve my cases.

80
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:18,516

81
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,850
2...

Are we good,
'cause we're here.

85
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,656
One more thing: I don't
take meeting with guys

86
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,560
who wear suits that cost
more than 5 grand.

87
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:31,595
Is that a problem?

88
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,752
Not anymore.

89
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,387
Sorry we're late.

90
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:42,640
Russell Strickland,
this is Mitch McDeere.

91
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:43,757
Hello.

92
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:45,209
Thanks for coming.
This is my son, Brian.

93
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:46,227
Hello.

94
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,478
Hi.

95
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:48,946
Well, I know the 3 of you
have a lot to talk about,

96
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,981
so I'll leave you to it.

97
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,721
So, is this
a criminal matter?

98
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:02,359
We don't know.

99
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:03,744
My girlfriend,
Amy Sackheim,

100
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:05,496
she's been missing
for 3 days.

101
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,598
The police have asked Brian
to come in for questioning.

102
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,700
Well, that sounds routine,
I'm sure they just want to know

103
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:10,868
the last time you saw her.

104
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:12,269
Well, that's the problem.

105
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:14,305
I was with Amy
the night she disappeared.

106
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,673
We had a fight.

107
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,791
We'd been together
almost 3 years.

108
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,744
And we were
graduating in may...

109
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,113
And I didn't
want to lose her.

110
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,983
So, I got it into my head
that we should get married.

111
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,654
I got this ring.

112
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,473
I made a reservation
at Sophia,

113
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:34,592
a little French place
near where I live.

114
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,695
And I asked her.

115
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,129
And she said no.

116
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:41,315
She didn't just say no.

117
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,968
She got upset.

118
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:46,436
She told me that
we were too young,

119
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:48,539
that I should have
discussed it with her first.

120
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,374
They got into an argument.

121
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:52,343
Maître d' asked us
to leave.

122
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,578
Everybody was staring.

123
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,113
What happened outside?

124
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:59,149
Well, we walked to the car,
but Amy...

125
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,785
Amy wouldn't get in.

126
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:04,488
She wanted to be alone.

127
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:07,491
So, she took my keys and
she said she was going home.

128
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,393
She left you there.

129
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:11,595
I was only live a few blocks
away, she knew I could walk.

130
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,464
Brian's car has
never been found

131
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,132
and nobody has seen
the girl for 3 days.

132
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,350
That's all we know.

133
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,835
And when do the police
want to meet with you?

134
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,303
11 o'clock tomorrow.

135
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,304
You think we should go?

136
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,672
Yes, I do.

137
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,974
By now, the police will already
know about the fight.

138
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,826
If you're telling the truth,

139
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,646
then I would prefer to
get out in front of this.

140
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,813
I am.

141
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,849
I loved her,
Mr. McDeere.

142
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,836
So, you're bringing
in the son voluntarily?

143
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,840
If we don't, the police won't
focus on anything but him.

144
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,842
Well, they're probably
already doing that, honey.

145
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:44,211
Maybe, but the kid did have a
plausible explanation.

146
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:47,631
So it is our job
to provide a new theory.

147
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,799
I think he killed her.

148
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,718
That's just my opinion.

149
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,019
You don't know anything
about this girl.

150
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,170
Maybe she left town.

151
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,472
Or maybe she's seeing
somebody else.

152
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:57,474
Suddenly Brian proposes,

153
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,193
she doesn't want
to tell him yet,

154
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:00,911
so she skips town
with the new guy.

155
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,046
There you go.

156
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,514
And they go to Vegas.

157
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,182
Sleeping in motels
along the way,

158
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,551
but never long enough
for anyone to notice.

159
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:10,988
Eating in truck stops
and existing solely

160
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:12,523
on their secret love.

161
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,825
That's a disturbing
amount of detail, babe.

162
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,360
Okay.
Thanks.

163
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,828
Yeah.
Well, for now,

164
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,964
I want this case
to be your top priority.

165
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,198
What about your
murder case? The woman?

166
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,366
Sarah Holt?

167
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,701
I'm seeing her
later this afternoon.

168
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,538
You two, find me Amy Sackheim.

169
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,039
Mr. McDeere...

170
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,075
Brian?

171
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,985
What I told you
wasn't all true.

172
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,020
Have a seat.

173
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:51,895
It was an accident.

174
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:54,915
We left the
restaurant together.

175
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,234
Amy forced me to stop the car,

176
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:59,253
I didn't want to,
but she insisted.

177
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,607
I left her there.

178
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:05,626
(Tires screeching)

179
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:12,049
I couldn't do it.

180
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,803
I loved her.

181
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:17,855
So, I turned the car around.

182
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:21,125
I wanted to apologize,

183
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,310
I wanted to cry,
I wanted to see her,

184
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,145
I didn't even know
why we were fighting.

185
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:27,197
(Screaming)

186
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,438
I put her in the car
to take her to the hospital.

187
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,939
She was gone.

188
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:38,175
What happened then?

189
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:41,145
There's a lake...

190
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,280
About 2 hours north.

191
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,350
My family used to go there
when I was a kid.

192
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:48,652
I drove there.

193
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:51,004
I left Amy
in one of the boat houses.

194
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:53,757
I sank the car in the lake.

195
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,893
You have to
go to the police.

196
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:57,394
Listen to me.

197
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,829
If this was an accident,

198
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:00,347
we have to
tell them that now.

199
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:02,299
They will find the body
and they will find the car.

200
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:04,068
And when they do, they will
never believe you.

201
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,937
I can't go to prison.

202
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,689
You can't tell my father.

203
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,707
Brian, you have to
tell your father.

204
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:11,909
You have to
tell Amy's family.

205
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:14,912
They deserve to know
what happened.

206
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:16,313
No.

207
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,614
Brian?

208
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:19,416
Brian!

209
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:20,918
Brian!

210
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:23,454
Brian!

211
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,931
I've been over the case
a hundred times.

212
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:34,167
By law,
everything Brian said

213
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,635
is protected by privilege.

214
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:38,371
He has a right
to confide in his lawyer.

215
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,506
Okay, so we
can't tell the cops.

216
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,908
At least we can tell
Amy's parents

217
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:43,176
where they can
find her body.

218
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,477
No, we can't.

219
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,112
Why not?

220
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,781
'Cause he's our client.
We cannot incriminate him.

221
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:49,982
He's not our client, bro.

222
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:51,200
You're the one
who took the case.

223
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:52,718
You work for my office.

224
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:58,291
The privilege applies
to all of us.

225
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,359
Okay...

226
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:02,795
The body is in a location that
can be connected to Brian.

227
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,048
The body itself could have trace
evidence proving he killed her,

228
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,600
which would lead to his car.

229
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:08,835
So we just sit here?

230
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,536
Forget that.
I'll go get the body myself

231
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:12,138
and I'll take it
to a hospital.

232
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:14,257
And in the process
get arrested

233
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:17,643
for tampering with evidence
and obstructing justice.

234
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:20,780
We're obstructing justice
if we sit and do nothing.

235
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:24,417
Okay, Ray, see if you can
find the boathouse.

236
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,487
Don't touch anything, but see
if you can verify Brian's story.

237
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,855
And what are you going
to get him to do?

238
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,156
I'm going to get him
to tell the truth.

239
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,126
We have to be at the precinct
tomorrow at 11.

240
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,028
We will make the right
thing happen here.

Relax, Martin, everything

No, Alex, things

00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:07,593
There are loose ends.

249
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,362
McDeere works
with us now.

250
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:11,531
He knows nothing
about why we hired him.

251
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:13,950
He thinks it's because
of some tort case he found.

252
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:15,768
How did he get our case
in the first place?

253
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,103
A mistake.

254
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,572
It was assigned by the court
before we knew about it.

255
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:22,909
The better question is how did
the girl get arrested?

256
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,777
We don't know yet.

257
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,279
Her name is Sarah Holt.

258
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,080
McDeere is
meeting with her now.

259
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:29,114
Well, I'm his boss.

260
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,484
Whatever he learns,
I learn.

261
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:32,552
Now, is that all?

262
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,287
No.

263
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,322
We have another problem.

264
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,193
Do you need
to be somewhere?

265
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,595
No, no, not until um...

266
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:44,463
Until 11.

267
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:48,768
Tell me about the woman they say
you killed, Margaret Whittaker.

268
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:50,670
I hardly knew her.

269
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,738
I have a new doctor here,
in D.C.

270
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:54,874
I went for an appointment
about a week ago.

271
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,475
We met in the waiting room.

272
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,944
And you spoke
to her first?

273
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,145
Yes.

274
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:00,813
She was very sick,
I could see that.

275
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:02,848
I didn't know she was
terminal at that point.

276
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:04,250
It was just
the two of you?

277
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:05,484
Yes.

278
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,204
And we started talking.

279
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:09,455
She said she
was all alone,

280
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:11,290
that her only son
is a deputy sheriff

281
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:14,060
who lived 2 hours away.

282
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:15,995
She was very unhappy.

283
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,463
She wasn't allowed
to be alone at night.

284
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:19,865
And she said the woman
from the hospice

285
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,701
who stayed with her
was abusive.

286
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,002
That's the word she used?

287
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,169
Yes.

288
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,105
It sounds crazy, but she...

289
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,841
Asked me if I would maybe stay
with her at night.

290
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:30,509
She said it wasn't much work.

291
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,478
She'd pay well.

292
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:35,147
I said, "yes,
I'm a Christian woman."

293
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:37,116
I got there at 8.

294
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,651
We watched tv for an hour,

295
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:42,238
I did some work on my laptop and
then I took her to the bedroom.

296
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:49,829
I waited until she fell asleep.

297
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:52,999
And that's when I saw it.

298
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,767
It was so beautiful.

299
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:57,903
And I know it was wrong but...

300
00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:59,939
I put it on.

301
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:03,976
I heard the door opening.

302
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:04,977
Who are you?

303
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,412
Where's my mother?

304
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:08,314
You must be Eugene,
Margaret's son.

305
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:10,566
I got a call from the hospice,
she fired her nurse.

306
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,151
You wait right there.

307
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:14,186
And he told you to stay
while he checked on her?

308
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:18,057
I got scared.

309
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:22,628
I-I just didn't want to be there
to explain, so I left.

310
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:26,032
And when I got outside,
I remembered the pendant.

311
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,234
It was a mistake.

312
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:31,003
I started to go back
and he came running outside

313
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:32,038
with his gun drawn.

314
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:37,276
He said he found
his mother dead.

315
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:40,079
I don't know how.

316
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:44,850
They can't honestly believe that
I killed her for a necklace.

317
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:47,053
(School bell ringing)

318
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,253
Hey, Claire.

319
00:13:48,271 --> 00:13:49,622
Hey.

320
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,223
You going to ally's party
on Saturday?

321
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:52,224
Yeah.

322
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,060
Great.
So am I.

323
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:56,612
And if you want anyone to talk
to you there or ever again...

324
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:58,664
You didn't see anything.

325
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:05,287
It's not just any necklace,
Mitch, it's worth over 50 grand.

326
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,957
Come on, Diane, she's an
auto insurance adjuster

327
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,375
with no record.

328
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:11,277
She's a good samaritan,
she's not a murderer.

329
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:12,444
She was stealing
that necklace

330
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,462
and she would
have taken more

331
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,463
if the son
hadn't come home.

332
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:15,481
You're wrong.

333
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:16,515
And you know this how?

334
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,917
Because I just
talked to her.

335
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,785
I'm pretty good
at reading people.

336
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:21,620
I don't see a case here.

337
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,806
Sorry, Mitch, you're not
the only one who can read.

338
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,457
The me's report
just came in.

339
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:28,728
Cause of death
was asphyxiation.

340
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:30,763
Margaret Whittaker
was smothered to death.

341
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,850
Guess word's out.

342
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,535
Why?
What's going on?

343
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,187
I just heard, you know
the girl who is missing,

344
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:39,238
the college student?

345
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:40,639
Amy Sackheim?

346
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:41,907
Apparently, she's dead.

347
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:42,992
The guy who killed her

348
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:45,494
just walked into a precinct
and confessed.

349
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:46,812
You okay?

350
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,813
Yeah, yeah.

351
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,814
I gotta go.

352
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,916
That's my client.

353
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,952
(Tires screeching)

354
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,178
Detective...

355
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:03,829
Detective!

356
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,599
Uh, my name is Mitch McDeere,
I'm an attorney.

357
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,969
I understand you're uh,
you're questioning my client

358
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:12,221
in connection to the Amy
Sackheim disappearance.

359
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,939
He's represented.

360
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,191
You cannot interrogate
him without--

361
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:16,942
hey, we didn't
interrogate anyone.

362
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:20,112
Guy just walked in here
spilling his guts.

363
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:23,282
Well, then I am invoking
his rights to council.

364
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:26,118
You cannot question him
'till I can see him.

365
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:27,620
You're too late anyway.

366
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,655
He told us everything.

367
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,259
I was supposed to meet him
here this morning.

368
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,130
You got 10 minutes.

369
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,202
Who are you?

370
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:46,105
I'm Mitch McDeere,
I'm a defence attorney.

371
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,274
Good.

372
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:50,443
Looks like I'm going
to be needing one.

373
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:54,480
♪

374
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:04,018
- What is you name and age?
- Calvin Parker, 43.

375
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:07,021
And you live in Washington?

376
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:09,824
Your elbows
are on the table

377
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,859
and your posture
is terrible.

378
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:21,202
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:23,137
You know what else
is terrible, Calvin?

380
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,438
Lying.

381
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:25,973
Saying you
murdered Amy Sackheim

382
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,341
when we both know
you didn't.

383
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,342
I did.

384
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,343
No, you didn't.

385
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:32,646
Wh-- why would you say that?

386
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:34,115
I think I know what I did.

387
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:36,217
Certainly better than
some person I just met.

388
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:41,188
A person with the table manners
of a chimpanzee.

389
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,790
Did you know Amy Sackheim?

390
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:44,792
Of course not.

391
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:47,528
I mean,
only for a few minutes.

392
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:51,432
I picked he up in my car near
some French restaurant.

393
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,701
She was hitchhiking
in the rain.

394
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:56,237
Very dangerous.

395
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,038
Go on.

396
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:00,374
She wanted to
go back to her dorm.

397
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:03,611
She had a fight with her
boyfriend, something.

398
00:17:03,645 --> 00:17:05,713
To be honest, I tuned her out.

399
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:08,182
I found it very impolite
to talking about

400
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:10,551
another man in my car.

401
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:12,153
And so, you killed her.

402
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,588
Her voice was upsetting.

403
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:16,824
I pulled the car
onto a side street.

404
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:18,125
Which one?

405
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,928
I really don't remember.

406
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:24,031
And I strangled her.

407
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:25,299
And her body?

408
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,101
It was thin, athletic.

409
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:29,570
What did you do
with her body?

410
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:30,871
No shouting.

411
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:32,473
We don't need
to shout to be heard.

412
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:33,707
Now you're upsetting me.

413
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:35,109
I need to know, Calvin.

414
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:37,178
If you truly did this.

415
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:39,079
Then where can I
find Amy's body?

416
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,115
I don't know!

417
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:47,520
The red room.
I put her in the red room

418
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:48,556
the red room?
What does that mean?

419
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,624
I don't like this.
I don't like talking to you.

420
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:53,427
So you just decided
to confess?

421
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,062
Killers go to prison.
Is that what you want?

422
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:56,430
You want to go to prison?

423
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:59,400
I think it's time.

424
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,969
I think I need to be stopped,
otherwise I might do it again.

425
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:04,405
Does that mean that
you've done this before?

426
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,873
Yes.

427
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:07,908
Many times.

428
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:15,382
You're not s--

429
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,151
it's not acceptable
to sit like that.

430
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,485
You'll get a hump
when you get older.

431
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,521
Is that what you want,
a terrible hump?

432
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:25,659
Hey mom, I'm going to Gillian's
house after school.

433
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:27,428
Really?

434
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:29,063
Thanks for letting me know.

435
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:30,564
I am.

436
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,832
I mean...

437
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,667
Can I go?

438
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,002
I graded your test.

439
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,136
Don't you want
to know how you did?

440
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:37,705
Already?

441
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,806
92. A-.

442
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:43,677
Second highest
in the class.

443
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,579
Uh-huh.

444
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:46,981
Who beat me?

445
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:47,981
Heather gamble.

446
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,183
Ugh!

447
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,585
What does that mean?

448
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,687
Nothing.
Nothing.

449
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:56,457
Look, I know she hasn't done
as well as you in the past,

450
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,292
but she is a smart girl.

451
00:18:58,326 --> 00:18:59,293
Yeah, great.

452
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:00,294
Thanks mom,
see you later.

453
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:01,328
Why do you do that?

454
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,429
Another student improves,

455
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:03,931
you should be
happy for that.

456
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:06,300
Happy for me as their teacher.

457
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:07,401
Whatever.

458
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:08,736
No!
Not whatever!

459
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,104
Why whatever?

460
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:11,272
It's one test.

461
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:12,523
If you're jealous,
maybe you should--

462
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:13,840
I'm not!

463
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,309
Okay, I'm not jealous!

464
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:17,144
Well obviously--
I think it's great!

465
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:18,946
She cheated!

466
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,247
She cheated, okay?

467
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:24,017
She had the answers
written all over her arm.

468
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:27,521
How do you know that?

469
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:29,290
I saw her.

470
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:31,358
Okay, but mom, mom,
you cannot say anything.

471
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:32,409
Claire...

472
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,627
Mom, please!

473
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:35,696
She cannot know
that I told you.

474
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,865
Well, I have to
do something.

475
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:40,834
<i>So, he just walked in</i>
<i>and confessed.</i>

476
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,136
Yeah,
to multiple murders.

477
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,937
He can't even
keep track of how many.

478
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,406
<i>I've seen this before, bro.</i>

479
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,890
I did time with a guy
at Brushy Mountain,

480
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:48,559
he killed his
entire family and then,

481
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:50,010
<i>some innocent dude</i>
<i>took the credit.</i>

482
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:51,228
You think he's a crazy?

483
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:52,513
Well, he wants the attention.

484
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:53,647
<i>He knew details.</i>

485
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,316
He knew Amy was out
walking in the rain,

486
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,383
that she'd gone to college,

487
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,051
that she had a fight
with her boyfriend.

488
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:00,354
So, he reads the papers, I mean,
all that stuff was reported.

489
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,022
Yeah, that's true.

490
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:04,108
He didn't seem to know where the
body was.

491
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,492
<i>We already know</i>
<i>where the body is.</i>

492
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,111
That's assuming Brian
is telling the truth.

493
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,228
Maybe he's lying.

494
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,631
Mitch, Brian wasn't lying.

495
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:12,032
You found the boathouse?

496
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,667
Echo lake, 2 hours north.

497
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:16,737
And don't worry,
I didn't touch anything.

498
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:19,006
Amy's here.

499
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,591
If she's there, that means
Calvin Parker is innocent.

500
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,042
And crazy.

501
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:24,011
But the police don't know that.
<i>We need to find Brian.</i>

502
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:26,079
If he tells the truth,
then we can get Calvin out.

503
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,514
<i>Mitch, you already have one</i>
<i>client in this case,</i>

504
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:28,582
<i>you can't have 2.</i>

505
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,850
But we have to do something.

506
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:30,984
I'm not just sitting
by while they charge

507
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:32,136
the wrong guy with murder.

508
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,387
Look, you want it, you take it.

509
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:34,722
I don't give a damn
about the rules.

510
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,089
But what's Russell Strickland
going to say?

511
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:37,725
Absolutely not.

512
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,760
He is disturbed, Russ.

513
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:41,128
I don't know
why he confessed,

514
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:43,464
but I am satisfied that
Calvin did not kill Amy.

515
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,998
You don't know that.

516
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,467
Yes...

517
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,835
I do.

518
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:48,935
But...

519
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:50,704
Brian told you that he did it?

520
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:53,440
I can't answer that,
but we did have a conversation.

521
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,282
I am so sorry, Russ.

522
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:07,254
I uh...

523
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,923
I can't find him.

524
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,092
I haven't seen Brian
since our meeting.

525
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:13,794
- He's not at home?
- No.

526
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:15,329
And he won't call me back.

527
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,147
- If you're hiding him--
- I'm not!

528
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:20,100
But even if I were,
you'd have to protect him.

529
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:21,201
You're his lawyer.

530
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,319
Listen to me.
I promise you,

531
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:24,471
nothing I do will
incriminate your son.

532
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:27,007
But I feel obligated
to help the police realize

533
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,742
that Calvin
is not responsible.

534
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:30,194
No!

535
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,479
To represent him, you are
pointing the finger at Brian.

536
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:34,415
I won't.
You have my word.

537
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:35,749
Now, if it comes
down to that,

538
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:37,534
I will withdraw and let
another lawyer step in.

539
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:38,986
I said no.

540
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,055
End of discussion.

541
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,924
I'm doing it, Russell.

542
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,193
I am not letting some jaded
public defender screw this up

543
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:47,828
and plead him guilty.

544
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:49,229
You want to fight me
on that,

545
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,031
you put in a complaint
at the bar

546
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:53,066
and we will air this out
in a hearing.

547
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:08,982
I understand, Martin and I told
you we'd take care of it.

548
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:13,520
Why do you think
he sniffs like that?

549
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:15,289
Does he have a cold or
is he snorting half the coke

550
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:16,857
on the eastern seaboard?

551
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:19,493
Well, if it's a cold, he's had
it for the last 3 years.

552
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,527
Could be a nervous tick.

553
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:21,862
I suppose.

554
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,549
He does have reason
to be nervous.

555
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,034
McDeere met with Sarah Holt
this morning.

556
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,219
You get an update?

557
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,637
Not yet, I called,

558
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:32,406
but he's knee-deep in the
Strickland situation.

559
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,540
He asked if it could wait.

560
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:35,642
The update can,
but this can't.

561
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:39,313
When Sarah Holt was arrested,
she had a laptop with her.

562
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:40,647
Her own?

563
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:42,683
No, it was provided
by her employer

564
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:45,519
and let's just say it had
sensitive information.

565
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:47,554
Do you know what it is?

566
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:50,924
Material we care
about is hidden.

567
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,226
Routine examination by the
police won't reveal it,

568
00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:54,862
but our client
wants it secured.

569
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,413
Then how am I supposed
to get access to it?

570
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:57,798
It's in evidence lock-up.

571
00:22:57,832 --> 00:23:01,251
Then you steal it or you pay
someone to hand it to you

572
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,069
or you burn down the building.

573
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:07,591
I don't give a damn if you have
to join the police academy.

574
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,643
Whatever you need, boss.

575
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,814
Andrew...

576
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:15,482
You may not know
what's on that computer,

577
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:17,050
but what you do know
is more than enough

578
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:19,319
to take you down
with the rest of us.

579
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:21,021
It's not just what I need.

580
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:24,525
It's what you need,
what your wife and son need.

581
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,393
Are we clear?

582
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:28,428
Yeah.

583
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:38,172
(Elevator dings)

584
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:42,673
Calvin Parker, 43, in a
flaming ball of excitement.

585
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:45,509
Works as a tax evaluator
for the IRS.

586
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:47,144
Ah, no wonder he wants
the attention,

587
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:48,812
it's a nameless,
thankless job.

588
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,848
There's a thousand of him
out there.

589
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,303
Where'd he grow up?

590
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:57,604
Right here in DC.

591
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,257
Father was killed in Vietnam,
raised by his mother.

592
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:04,061
She taught music over at a
private school, very posh.

593
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:09,766
So, she spends her day with kids
who are rich and well-mannered.

594
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:13,704
That explains the whole
"elbows on the table" thing.

595
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:16,206
She wants her kid
to act like them...

596
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:18,775
Probably made him
crazy about it.

597
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:22,246
Literally.
Anything else?

598
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,381
Everything else is routine.

599
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,000
On the day Amy was killed,

600
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:28,419
he went to the bank, got his car
serviced at the dealership.

601
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:30,154
No red flags
on his credit card.

602
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,805
He's clean.

603
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:44,601
♪

604
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:47,871
It's kind of creepy, huh?

605
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:50,541
15 women.

606
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:51,775
Girls, really.

607
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:53,694
So this is how he knew
about the cases.

608
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:56,813
He memorizes the details
from the papers.

609
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:58,816
Ah, the truth is
it doesn't make perfect sense.

610
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,951
Some of these girls went
missing for a while,

611
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:03,454
but returned later,
unharmed.

612
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,289
Why does he put their
pictures up here?

613
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:06,840
'Cause he's innocent
and a fruit loop?

614
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,025
No way.

615
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:09,493
Half a dozen of these girls
was murdered

616
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:12,663
and I'll bet my badge
your boy did it.

617
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:16,133
Unless you know something
I don't.

618
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,801
Cops still think it's Calvin,
they're not giving up.

619
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:18,936
They will.

620
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,554
Look, we know Calvin
didn't do this,

621
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:21,805
we just have to find Brian.

622
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,357
Yeah, I'm trying, my sources
are all over it.

623
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,275
Meanwhile, Amy's body is still
sittin' in a boathouse

624
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,511
and her parents think she
still might be alive.

625
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,113
Which horrifies me
as much as it does you,

626
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:30,564
but my hands are bound.

627
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:32,483
There's nothing we can do;
We're out of options.

628
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:33,817
No, we're not
out of options!

629
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:35,685
Look, Ray,
you're a convicted felon.

630
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,454
Do I need to explain to you
why criminals need

631
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:38,822
to trust their attorneys?

632
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:40,407
Hey-hey, I took responsibility
for what I did.

633
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,126
I didn't hide behind any
technicality.

634
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,461
It's not a technicality, Ray,
it's the law!

635
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:46,497
Oh, you and your
precious rules, Mitch.

636
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:48,065
How do you live
with yourself?

637
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:50,667
What am I supposed to do,
let my emotions run me?

638
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:51,919
Yeah, because we both
know how well

639
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,970
that philosophy
worked out for you.

640
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:54,505
Meaning?

641
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,007
Meaning your way got you 15
years in a federal prison.

642
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,759
And yours got
your entire family

643
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,111
10 years
of Witness Protection!

644
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,113
At least when I went down

645
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:08,435
I got to keep
my own last name.

646
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,604
I mean, in a way,
I feel responsible.

647
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:13,657
I've been pushing this student
to do better and I...

648
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:15,325
You didn't
drive her to cheat

649
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,094
if that's what
you're saying.

650
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:20,364
Well, even if I did, I-I can't
just look the other way.

651
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:23,500
I mean, I have
to confront her, right?

652
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:27,771
Mitch?

653
00:26:27,806 --> 00:26:30,808
I agree.

654
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:33,343
Or maybe you can
let this one go.

655
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:35,112
Are you serious?

656
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:36,547
I'm just thinking about Claire.

657
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:38,482
I mean, she's spent her whole
life moving around

658
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:40,083
and she's been
home schooled.

659
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,385
So?

660
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:43,120
So, she's just
trying to fit in.

661
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:45,189
The last thing she needs
is to rat out

662
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:47,524
the popular girl to her mom.

663
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,359
That's interesting.

664
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:50,894
What?

665
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:54,164
You're all about the rules when
it comes to your job, by mine...

666
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:57,000
Stakes are a little different,
Abby.

667
00:26:57,035 --> 00:26:59,036
Hey, are you okay?

668
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:07,144
When I was a kid, my dad,
he drove this old truck.

669
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:08,745
Red pick-up.

670
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,748
Thing had to be 30 years old.

671
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:14,918
Breaks were shot,
no air bags, no suspension.

672
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:17,387
Half the time he drove it,
it broke down.

673
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:21,391
And my mom, my mom,
she had this rule.

674
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:24,361
Ray and I were not allowed
to ride in that truck.

675
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:25,596
Ever.

676
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,031
That sounds like her.

677
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:32,002
The thing was a death-trap.

678
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:35,022
One day, Ray and I were playing
in the driveway, my dad,

679
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:37,341
he comes out, says he
doesn't have to go to work

680
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:40,744
for a couple hours
and to get in the truck.

681
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:42,145
We'd go for breakfast.

682
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,514
But the rule.

683
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,349
It didn't stop Ray.

684
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:47,384
He yelled "shotgun"
and he jumped in.

685
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:53,290
Me, I wouldn't go.

686
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:54,491
What happened?

687
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:57,494
Nothing.

688
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:00,497
Nothing, two hours later,
they came back,

689
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,516
dropped Ray off
and he went to work.

690
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:10,173
My dad...

691
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:13,577
He was killed that day.

692
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:15,612
Killed in an explosion
in the mine.

693
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:23,220
It was his last day.

694
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:25,255
And Ray got to spend it
with him.

695
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,028
That's the thing
about rules, Abby.

696
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:35,666
It's more than what you do,
it's who you are.

697
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,135
Some people are wired to follow
them, others aren't

698
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,306
baby, that could have been
Ray who died that day.

699
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,341
Or you.

700
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:47,344
In an old truck with a
half a million miles on it.

701
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,350
What did you say?

702
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:55,552
I just don't think your
dad should have--

703
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:57,788
no, no...

704
00:28:57,822 --> 00:29:00,457
About the mileage?

705
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:02,893
Abby, that's it.

706
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:04,294
That's it.

707
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:05,529
Where are you going?

708
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:07,965
I gotta call Ray.

709
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:10,000
I think you just got Calvin
Parker off the hook.

710
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:17,874
Your honor, the defendant is
charged with a single homicide,

711
00:29:17,908 --> 00:29:19,509
the murder of Amy Sackheim.

712
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:21,244
But we ask you to note
that he has confessed

713
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,946
to several other
killings as well.

714
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,615
Which you cannot prove.

715
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:25,966
And I object to you
trying to sway the court

716
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:26,984
with speculation.

717
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:28,819
Speculation,
is that a joke?

718
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:30,320
Your client told us
about the crimes.

719
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:32,022
We just haven't had
time to investigate.

720
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:35,859
Your honor, my client confessed
to killing a dozen young girls,

721
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:39,596
half of which the da knows full
well are very much alive.

722
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:40,897
Is that your defense,
council?

723
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:43,700
He thinks he killed 12,
but he only killed 6?

724
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,619
He didn't kill anyone,
your honor.

725
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,771
These are false confessions.

726
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:50,273
And why, pray tell would
an everyday tax evaluator

727
00:29:50,308 --> 00:29:52,275
want us to think
he's a serial killer?

728
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,443
Because he is unstable.

729
00:29:53,478 --> 00:29:55,112
Because he wants the attention.

730
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:56,580
Your honor...

731
00:29:56,614 --> 00:29:58,448
Amy's parents
are in the court, today.

732
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:00,167
It's hard enough
to face this tragedy,

733
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:02,085
but now to be told
it was all a sham?

734
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,621
I'm sorry.

735
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:06,723
But Calvin
did not do this.

736
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:10,510
He can't even tell the police
where to find their daughter.

737
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,978
A sidebar, your honor?

738
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:14,031
Quickly!

739
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:20,404
Your honor, the day before
Amy Sackheim disappeared,

740
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:21,938
my client had
his car serviced.

741
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:22,989
What's the relevance?

742
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:24,474
Just listen.

743
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:27,344
Calvin says he picked up
Amy in his car

744
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:29,346
near a restaurant
called Sophia.

745
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,683
That road is 29 miles one way
from the dealership

746
00:30:32,717 --> 00:30:33,667
that serviced his car.

747
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:35,118
So?

748
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:37,921
So, the dealer registered his
mileage on the odometer

749
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:41,291
when they serviced it and the
police also registered his

750
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:43,226
mileage when they seized it.

751
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:47,330
The car had only gone
21 miles in total.

752
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:48,682
It's not possible.

753
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,801
He could not have been there,
not in that car.

754
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:52,736
Okay, look, I admit,
that's a discrepancy.

755
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,187
This is a lie.

756
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:56,005
His entire confession is a lie.

757
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,508
Mr. Hobermann, aside from the
confession of the defendant,

758
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,777
do you have any real evidence
connecting him to the crime?

759
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:01,778
I feel confident--

760
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:03,880
answer the question,
council.

761
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,716
Not directly, no.

762
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,084
Are there
any other suspects?

763
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:08,652
We intended to question
the victim's boyfriend,

764
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,220
but that wasn't necessary.

765
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:11,521
Well, it is now.

766
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:13,356
You don't have enough
to hold this defendant.

767
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:15,058
And so until
you can find more,

768
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:17,911
this charge is dismissed.

769
00:31:17,962 --> 00:31:19,196
Bailiff, take charge.

770
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,299
Mr. Parker, you will be
released from inside.

771
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,550
What did she say?

772
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,969
I strongly suggest you
seek counseling, sir.

773
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:28,588
No, wait, listen to me,
you're making a mistake!

774
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,706
I'm the killer!

775
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:30,707
No!

776
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:32,392
Don't do this!

777
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:34,561
Now, you will be sorry.

778
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,046
I need to be in prison.

779
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,547
I'm a killer!

780
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:38,782
Don't do this!

781
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:40,150
Why won't you stop me?

782
00:31:40,184 --> 00:31:41,768
I need to be stopped!

783
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:43,587
Why won't you stop me?

784
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:47,602
♪

785
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,722
So what are you gonna do, honey?

786
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:51,522
I don't know yet.

787
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:54,224
I mean, we've enough
for the last 10 years

788
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,011
to guarantee Claire
a lifetime of therapy.

789
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:59,096
I don't want to do anything to
make things worse.

790
00:31:59,097 --> 00:31:59,964
I get that.

791
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,199
But you also don't want
to give her the impression

792
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,601
that she's running things,
you know?

793
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:06,037
Claire!

794
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:09,624
I need your help
setting the table!

795
00:32:09,658 --> 00:32:12,076
And this girl, Heather,

796
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,879
she just gets
away with it?

797
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:17,048
Maybe not.

798
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:21,052
When I was 19, I was in love
with Jimmy Martucci.

799
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,220
Gorgeous!

800
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,338
And he used to hang out
at this place

801
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,924
where I was working
and waiting tables.

802
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,426
And he was older, you know,

803
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,646
like 21 and wouldn't give me
the time of day.

804
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,931
I find that hard to believe.

805
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:36,100
Well, he was a tough guy,
you know, not a real one.

806
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,652
But he thought he was.

807
00:32:37,686 --> 00:32:40,271
And anyway, so one day,

808
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:44,242
I show up at work
with my new Firebird.

809
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:47,745
I had saved my money for
2 years and all of a sudden,

810
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,146
Jimmy wants to know me.

811
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:50,448
He asks where did I get it?

812
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:51,832
What's up, ladies?

813
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:53,884
Take those bowls to the table.

814
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,920
Please.

815
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:03,794
And I don't know why,
but I told him that I stole it.

816
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:05,396
The words just came out!

817
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,465
You did not.

818
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:10,801
From that moment on,
Jimmy loved me.

819
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:13,771
I was the bad girl
of his dreams and we started

820
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:16,073
hanging out almost every night.

821
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:17,858
Was it amazing?

822
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:19,377
Actually,
it was the worst.

823
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,479
He turned out to
be a total moron

824
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,614
and his friends
were petty criminals.

825
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:27,952
And I was just stuck, like
driving around with these jerks,

826
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:31,122
trying to figure out how
I'm going to break it off.

827
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:34,191
And that's the problem with
pretending to be

828
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:37,194
someone you aren't,
you have to then be that someone

829
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:39,230
even when you don't
want to anymore.

830
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:44,502
So, that was Strickland.

831
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:46,370
Detective Doyle just called.

832
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:47,972
The police want to
talk to Brian again.

833
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,273
Join the club.

834
00:33:49,308 --> 00:33:50,975
If he went underground,
my people'll find him

835
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:52,009
before the cops do.

836
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:53,010
Maybe he's at the boathouse.

837
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:54,395
Why would he go back?

838
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:55,680
You don't think he'd move
the body, do you?

839
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:57,047
Maybe it's psychological.

840
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:59,617
They took Amy's body there
for a reason, right?

841
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,152
He feels safe at the boathouse.

842
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:03,771
Sometimes when people do
horrible things, they regress,

843
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:06,524
they go back to the place where
they felt secure as a child.

844
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:08,743
Okay, I keep thinking this,
so I'm just going to say it.

845
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:12,063
But what if Strickland
found Calvin Parker.

846
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:15,166
What if he hired this
crazy guy to confess.

847
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,335
Do you think that's
even possible?

848
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,969
I don't know, but something's
wrong and I keep thinking

849
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:20,838
that thing has to
do with Calvin.

850
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:22,106
Where'd he grow up?

851
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,041
Dc, single mom.

852
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:27,211
Uh, went to a fancy private
school, uh, Wardell...

853
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:28,412
Something.

854
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,814
The Wardell Fieldhouse?
Got it.

855
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,416
His mom used to teach there.
You know it?

856
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:33,601
I've heard of it...

857
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:36,253
It shut down a
couple of years ago.

858
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:38,689
I worked with some people who
used to teach there.

859
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:40,558
A lot of really good schools
lost their funding

860
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:42,593
when the economy
went bad.

861
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:58,325
Wait, wait.

862
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:01,912
Calvin said he put his victims
in a red room.

863
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:05,049
"Mrs. Joanna Parker in the
middle school music room."

864
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,333
That was his mother.

865
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:08,803
Could be a coincidence.

866
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:11,188
Or...

867
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:13,224
Maybe not everything Calvin
told us is a lie.

868
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:17,127
We appreciate the help.

869
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:19,563
I appreciate
the hundred bucks.

870
00:35:19,598 --> 00:35:21,232
I don't know what you boys
are looking for.

871
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:23,150
No one's been around
this place for years, now.

872
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:25,186
This is research for a case.

873
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:31,509
Well, this is it.

874
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:34,862
This here,
is the music room.

875
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,664
Look, you'll need this.

876
00:35:36,698 --> 00:35:39,717
I'll be outside
if you need me.

877
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:40,835
Thank you.

878
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,887

Maybe up here.

884

Bring-bring that trunk over.

885
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,620
I need something to stand on.

886
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,192
Slide it over.

887
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:30,768

888
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:34,889
Yeah,

Well,
he isn't lying.

895

Calvin Parker's a serial killer
and I just set him free.

896
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:32,839
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

897

Calvin Parker kills women.

He's so far gone,
he can't even keep track.

That's why he confessed.

901
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:46,449
He read about Amy Sackheim
disappearing,

902
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:48,818
just assumed it was him,
like all the others.

904

905
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:52,889
Calvin said we'd be sorry.

906
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:54,824
It's only a matter of time

Heather, you did
so well on the test.

00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:54,183
I'm so proud of you.

927
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:56,652
Thank you.

928
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:59,355
I mean, I always knew
that you had great potential,

929
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:01,090
but this...

930
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:03,125
I was really impressed.

931
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,294
How did you do it?

932
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:07,029
Studying, I guess.

933
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:10,533
Well, I teach some of the other
students who need help,

934
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:12,301
every Tuesday
and Thursday after school

935
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:14,337
and since you did so well,

936
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:17,440
I decided to make you
my very own assistant.

937
00:39:17,474 --> 00:39:19,525
I think you could
really help them.

938
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:22,244
Um, I'm not sure I can
stay after school.

939
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:23,713
It's okay.

940
00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:26,198
I called your mom
and she said it's fine.

941
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:29,485
She's also really
proud of you.

942
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,653
Great.

943
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:32,288
Great.

944
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:34,323
So today's Tuesday,
so I guess I'll see you later.

945
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:45,368
Where'd you find Brian?

946
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:47,353

a youth hostel downtown.

Gracias.

948
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:57,847
So what's the plan, Brian,
you gonna run forever?

949
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:59,882
'Cause let me tell ya,
that is harder than you think.

950

you'd be long-gone by now.

Look at me.

954

955
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,338
Okay.

956
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:25,107
Then I will be with you
every step of the way.

957

This will not be okay until you
face it, until Amy's home.
