1
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,966
<i>Why couldn't things go on without me?</i>

2
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:58,068
<i>By June 5th I had to be in Paris,
by June 7th in New York.</i>

3
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:01,441
<i>By the 10th at the latest, in Venzuela.</i>

4
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:09,193
<i>Why can't it be April again and everything
else simply a hallucination on my part?</i>

5
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,478
<i>I just sat there.</i>

6
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:17,308
<i>I didn't want to be there,
I didn't want to be anywhere.</i>

7
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:20,001
<i>What was the use of looking?</i>

8
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,051
<i>There was nothing for me to see.</i>

9
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:26,469
<i>Her hands that no longer existed anywhere.</i>

10
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,694
<i>Her movements as she tossed her ponytail.</i>

11
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,815
<i>Her teeth... her lips...</i>

12
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:36,661
<i>Her eyes that no longer existed.</i>

13
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,113
<i>Where could I look for them?</i>

14
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,809
<i>She was gone now.</i>

15
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:51,839
<i>Ground transportation to the city of Caracas</i>

16
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:55,109
<i>is available at the lower level.</i>

17
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:05,741
You look familiar, have we met?

18
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:10,703
No. Don't think so.

19
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:15,578
Perhaps it was here in Caracas? The country
reception at the Chamber of Commerce?

20
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:18,985
No, I don't go to cocktail parties.

21
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:23,270
Of course, being a salesman I see so
many people these days. Here's my card.

22
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:26,930
Hencke?

23
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,654
Swiss? German?
German.

24
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:30,926
Keep it.

25
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:36,256
<i>I had no urge to get better
acquainted with this gentleman.</i>

26
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,241
<i>I don't know why he got on my nerves.</i>

27
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:42,451
<i>There was something familiar about his face.</i>

28
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,130
<i>Excuse me.
A very... German face.</i>

29
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:48,025
<i>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
The plane is ready for departure.</i>

30
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:51,810
<i>If you'd like you may board at this time,
turn in your boarding passes please.</i>

31
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:06,948
<i>Just as our flight was called I realised
what it was that struck me about the German.</i>

32
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,679
<i>His face reminded me of Joachim.</i>

33
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,569
<i>I heard the announcment.</i>

34
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,476
<i>I was hoping they'd fly on without me.</i>

35
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:35,437
Paging passenger Faber. Passenger Faber.

36
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,783
This is the last and final
call for passenger Faber.

37
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:44,821
<i>Paging passenger Faber. Passenger Faber.</i>

38
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,183
<i>Flight 163 is ready for boarding.</i>

39
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:19,801
Well, there you are! My goodness Mr. Faber,
I have been looking all over for you.

40
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:23,970
Well, come on we got a plane to catch.
I thought it took off already?

41
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,779
Oh, sorry. I thought it was vacant.

42
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,823
Well, it was. I mean, it is. Come on in.

43
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:48,897
Sorry.

44
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:50,638
Thanks.

45
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:54,034
You know, it's funny how we
keep bumping into each other.

46
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:57,366
You're the one who... dragged
me on this plane, right?

47
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:58,562
It's my job.

48
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,679
I've been having some bad
luck with bathrooms lately.

49
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,663
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

50
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:08,342
I don't know. Something happened to me
at the airport before you found me there.

51
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:12,082
I collapsed or something, I think my eyes.
They look all right to me.

52
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:16,200
Maybe your just afraid of flying?
No, I fly all over the place just like you.

53
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:18,654
You must have an interesting job.

54
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:23,519
I spent three months in the jungle,
it feels like I never left.

55
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,543
See you.
Wait! Wait... um.

56
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:32,903
You see this German guy
here sitting next to me?

57
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:35,984
He keeps following me around.

58
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:40,329
Happens to me all the time.
Wait, wait, wait...

59
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:57,111
Do you work for Umesca?

60
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:01,137
I couldn't help but see some of your
papers sticking out of your briefcase.

61
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,090
No, not really.

62
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:05,179
Medical or technical aid?

63
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,574
I'm an engineer.

64
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,376
How interesting.

65
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,601
Are you working down here?

66
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:17,613
Yes, in Venezuela. In the...
Oronoco project. It's a dam.

67
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,440
Smoke?
No, no thank you.

68
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,982
I would prefer a cigar but I think
our fellow passengers might object.

69
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:31,600
Unfortunately the German cigar
is not among the world's best.

70
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,766
My brother is trying to remedy
that lamentable situation.

71
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:39,551
I'm on my way to see him,
on his plantation in Yucatan.

72
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,725
Something to read?

73
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:48,737
No thanks. I don't read fiction.

74
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,658
Sweet dreams then.

75
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:56,885
I don't dream either.

76
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,725
<i>Ladies and gentlemen our (inaudible)
plane has failed us.</i>

77
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:44,707
<i>Not to worry we can reach Mexico City,
our next destination, on three engines.</i>

78
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,492
<i>So please return to your seats, extinguish
all cigarettes and fasten your seatbelts.</i>

79
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:10,336
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
a second engine has failed us.</i>

80
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:14,561
<i>I would like to reassure you there is
absolutely no danger.-We're losing altitude!</i>

81
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:18,446
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time I'd like to
ask you to reach underneath your seats please.

82
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:23,094
Looks like we're either going down right
directly over the desert or near Tampico.

83
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:27,142
Okay, madam! Please sit down and put
your lifejacket on! Put your safetybelt-

84
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:30,772
I had ptomaine poisoning once
in Tampico, terrible town.

85
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,104
Rotten hotels. Cold showers.

86
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:36,940
They barbecue dogs in Tampico.
Did you know that?

87
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:40,858
This is only a safety precaution, madam.
Everything is fine. Can you just please

88
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,568
give me your head please.
Put this on. Everything is fine.

89
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:53,393
Let me help you with that, sir.

90
00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:56,967
Arms over the white, head through the hole.
That goes for you too, Mr. Faber.

91
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,612
What are we gonna do, swim in the desert?
Just put it on.

92
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:04,988
Well, look. If we're travelling
at 400 miles an hour.

93
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,618
Well, that's what I thought we were
going to go down right in the desert.

94
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,813
According to my calculations.

95
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:25,552
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please put
your head between your knees</i>

96
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:27,702
<i>and your hands over your
head we are going down!</i>

97
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,518
Looks like we're going in
for a belly flop, Herbert.

98
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:34,396
<i>Good morning ladies and gentlemen! SAC
is proud to offer you a breakfast service.</i>

99
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:40,013
<i>This morning we will be serving apricot,
cheese and blueberry danish pastry.</i>

100
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:45,551
<i>We also have apple turnovers,
crackers, croissants and fritters.</i>

101
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,492
Morning.

102
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:50,852
<i>I am sorry to say that we do
not have any coffee this morning</i>

103
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:54,850
<i>but we do have teas, juices,
sodas, and other fine beverages.</i>

104
00:11:55,754 --> 00:12:00,964
<i>If you would please hold on to all cups and
glasses as you may need to use them again.</i>

105
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:05,077
<i>At this time, you may
remove your lifejackets.</i>

106
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:09,407
<i>And the captain has requested,
no smoking please.</i>

107
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,573
Do you think it will be
long before they find us?

108
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:41,313
Oh, any day now.

109
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:43,645
Tampico can't be that far away.

110
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:47,566
Just don't eat any barbecue
when we get there.

111
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:52,170
It's a miracle that only two died.

112
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:55,016
What's miracles got to do with it?

113
00:12:55,658 --> 00:13:00,230
I mean if 999 planes make their destination
at least one of them's got to crash.

114
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:01,922
Aren't you ever scared?

115
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,269
Not about this kind of stuff.

116
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,383
What really spooks me is getting
caught in a train of coincidence.

117
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:10,776
What do you mean?

118
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,804
You don't happen to have a brother
by the name of Joachim, do you?

119
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:17,742
How did you know that?

120
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,302
Hencke.

121
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,648
I had a friend by that name, Joachim Hencke.

122
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:24,739
We were students together
in Zurich before the war.

123
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:26,269
Is this the same man?

124
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:29,568
I told you, I'm... going to see
him, he runs a tobacco plantation.

125
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,856
No, the Joachim I knew is a doctor.

126
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:34,401
Not really. He never
finished his studies.

127
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,897
Maybe, it was his marriage.

128
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,838
What happened with his marriage?

129
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,458
It didn't last.

130
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,471
Hannah was not quite German.

131
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:48,975
What do you mean?

132
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:51,866
Well, you know she was, how do you say...

133
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Jewish?

134
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:56,559
That's it.

135
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,389
Hannah Landsberg?

136
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,782
You know her?

137
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:09,479
Yeah, I knew her.

138
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,735
Incredible.

139
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,869
It certainly is a small world.

140
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,805
<i>I wrote to Ivy.</i>

141
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:47,530
<i>It didn't take long to tell her
I was sitting in the desert,</i>

142
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:50,452
<i>hundreds of miles from the
world of normal transport.</i>

143
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:55,042
<i>That it was hot, dry weather.
Not the slightest injury and so on.</i>

144
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,237
<i>What else?</i>

145
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:02,370
<i>Oh yeah, I thought this was as good
a time as any to tell her it was over.</i>

146
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,321
Why did she marry him?

147
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:13,016
That was always the question.

148
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,218
Nobody could understand Joachim.

149
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:20,078
Why would anyone marry a Jewish
girl in '39, in Munich of all places.

150
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:26,767
I thought they were safe in Switzerland?
She went back to Germany with Joachim.

151
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,310
Just a few weeks before
their child was born.

152
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:34,510
They were divorced soon after.
They had a child? Yes.

153
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,086
It's a common enough story.

154
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,947
Marriage, child, divorce...

155
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:41,674
but then the war.

156
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:43,975
Especially for her.

157
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:46,789
As for Joachim, he was a prisoner of war.

158
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:50,499
Then returned home and...
back to life as usual.

159
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:54,542
It was an unfortunate period in history.

160
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:56,258
Your move.

161
00:15:56,591 --> 00:16:00,028
Whatever became of Hannah?
I don't know.

162
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,223
Joachim might know.

163
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:49,180
Sorry. Sorry... Joachim has seen us.

164
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:56,115
Wait a minute. Listen... I would, I would
really love to but I can't tonight. -Why?

165
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,794
Because it's, you know it's the day.
What day?

166
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:03,023
It's, it's the most dangerous
day of the month.

167
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,566
Hannah!

168
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:11,396
You're not gonna believe
what I've just been offered.

169
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:15,783
Walter, there's something I have to tell you.
Escher Wyss wants me to go to Baghdad.

170
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:20,765
They're gonna build a huge dam to irrigate
the entire desert. It's revolutionary.

171
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:21,827
Walter.

172
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,762
I'm pregnant.

173
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,092
You are?
Yeah!

174
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:35,663
Have you seen a doctor?
I don't need a doctor I'm absolutely sure.

175
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,143
Listen, we have to think about this.

176
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:46,409
Escher Wyss is the absolute best in turbines,
they offered me 300 francs a month.

177
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,211
I just can't turn 'em down.

178
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,478
Besides, you know what's
going on in Germany.

179
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,748
It's not a good time to be having a child.
Stop it!

180
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,565
All right, all right, all right.

181
00:17:56,628 --> 00:18:00,365
If you want to have your child then
we should just get married, right?

182
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,019
It looks like we have
landed in dinosaur country.

183
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:20,366
Don't let your imagination run away
with you, Herbert. It's just erosion.

184
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,227
It's true, you really don't dream.

185
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,503
Ladies and gentlemen, I have some good news!

186
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:35,090
The captain has said it is safe and
you are welcome to sleep on the plane.

187
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,657
Everything all right?

188
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:54,923
Just dandy except I wish
you hadn't found me.

189
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,022
Oh, so do I.

190
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:04,464
<i>Without our forced landing, I never
would have heard of Hannah again.</i>

191
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:08,453
<i>I wouldn't know today that I was a
father and Sabeth might still be alive.</i>

192
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,498
<i>I don't deny that it was more than
a coincidence, it was a whole...</i>

193
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,182
<i>train of coincidences.</i>

194
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,807
<i>But still within the laws of probability.</i>

195
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:19,275
<i>What's providence got to do with it?</i>

196
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:28,025
Can't wait to get to New York City. They
gotta give us at least a week off after this.

197
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,664
Be sure and say hello to
Joachim for me and tell him...

198
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:37,419
Hannah got the man she deserved.
Too bad it didn't last. -Absolutely.

199
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:39,066
We must stay in touch.

200
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:43,846
I'm almost tempted to go with you, Herbert,
but I'm late in New York. -All right.

201
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,410
Good luck.
Good luck.

202
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,392
You know, I was thinking... I mean
I've never really seen New York and

203
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:05,795
I thought maybe you could show
me around. What do you think?

204
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:10,394
Look uh... could you do me a favor?
Could you hang onto this bag for me?

205
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:14,100
I'll call you in a couple days in New York,
okay? I got your number right? I'll call ya.

206
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:17,916
Oh, and mail this, could you
mail this for me too? Thanks.

207
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:19,993
I'll call ya.

208
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:24,632
Hey Herbet! Hold on.

209
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,685
Thought maybe I'd come along
with you, if you don't mind?

210
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:32,119
I'd like to see him again after all this time.
- You Americans are amazing.

211
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,272
I wonder if uh...

212
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:02,743
Joachim will even recognize me.

213
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:06,049
It's been a while.
We have all changed.

214
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,951
More than we care to admit.

215
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:12,995
Why'd they get divorced?

216
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:15,289
I don't know, really.

217
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,499
I think Hannah became a Communist.

218
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:22,671
That's as good a reason as any.

219
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:34,519
<i>I couldn't understand myself.</i>

220
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,838
<i>I should've landed in New York a week ago.</i>

221
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:42,011
<i>Generally, I'm extremely conscientious
about professional matters.</i>

222
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:45,811
<i>Anyway, I've never intentionally
changed my route before.</i>

223
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:14,126
You were right. We will never find him.

224
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:18,526
They say he's about an hour from town.

225
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:21,331
Salut!

226
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,610
Hannah.

227
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:56,946
Hannah!

228
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:20,533
She's pregnant.

229
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:21,780
Yeah, I know.

230
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:24,228
I thought that's what you wanted.

231
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:28,485
But not now. This is the wrong time to
be bringing babies into the world.

232
00:24:28,654 --> 00:24:30,314
Do you see a way out of this?

233
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:37,456
It's not exactly why I studied medicine.

234
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:22,775
Here's to your brother.

235
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,664
Salut!

236
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,578
To your brother.

237
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:37,706
I have no idea why Joachim ever came here.

238
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:49,358
<i>The three game series is equal one a
piece after the Blue Jays scored back...</i>

239
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:04,930
Good to have you back, Mr. Faber!

240
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:06,796
Good to be back, Henry. Real good.

241
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,582
Are you here to stay
or is it just a pit-stop?

242
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:12,149
Well... I think I'll put
up stakes for a while.

243
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:14,984
A young lady's up there waiting for you.

244
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:17,546
Ivy?

245
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,746
I guess so. The one with
the pink Studebaker.

246
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:26,033
Well, out of the jungle,
into the frying pan.

247
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:27,413
Adios Henry.

248
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:31,231
I'm coming.

249
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:34,472
Hi.

250
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:39,370
How'd you get in, honey?
You gave me a key, don't you remember?

251
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,433
Here. Wait.

252
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:56,160
I couldn't just sit around,
knowing you were coming.

253
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,747
I've made a special dinner.

254
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:03,593
Lobster sauterne.

255
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:07,111
Something they wouldn't
do for you in Venezuela.

256
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,649
That's for sure.

257
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:12,646
Here.

258
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:15,109
I would've picked you
up at the airport but...

259
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:18,127
I thought it'd be much more
fun to surprise you here.

260
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:31,220
It's quite a surprise.

261
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:38,070
<i>She'd gotten my letter from the desert.</i>

262
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:40,165
<i>She had it in black and white.</i>

263
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:43,036
<i>She... simply refused to believe me.</i>

264
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:10,899
I think it's time you settled down, lover.

265
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:15,563
You can't keep on roving
around the world forever.

266
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:18,227
I'm ready, believe me.

267
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:23,117
Unfortunately, I gotta
go to Paris next week.

268
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:26,740
I thought you said we were gonna
have some real time together?

269
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:31,924
I had made plans for us to go to Montauk,
just the two of us. -Yeah, I know.

270
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:35,534
But uh... it's an important conference,
I just can't get out of it.

271
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:37,315
I'm important too.

272
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:41,251
Look honey, there's nothing I can do about
it. It's my work, you know that. -I know.

273
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,987
I'll go with you.

274
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,398
I've never been to Paris.

275
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:50,076
You got my letter. I mean,
you read the letter, right?

276
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:52,305
I can't believe you.

277
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:57,191
You never listen to me, everything is
different now. I told you I'm divorced.

278
00:28:57,254 --> 00:28:58,254
Right.

279
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,169
I love Paris in the springtime.

280
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:06,570
I love Paris every day.

281
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,213
Monsieur.

282
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:23,426
To Paris.

283
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:32,019
Monsieur.

284
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:41,858
Look uh... honey. I gotta...

285
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:46,606
take a walk. I need some air. I've
been cooped up on planes for weeks.

286
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,827
You don't mind, do you?
I mean... we can meet later.

287
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:56,371
Lobster sauterne is good cold.

288
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:14,705
<i>I had a week before I had to fly to Paris.</i>

289
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:18,727
<i>I was looking forward to
New York, but not with Ivy.</i>

290
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:25,653
<i>Once again it was pure coincidence
that decided the future, I just...</i>

291
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:29,748
<i>happened to walk by a ship that
was sailing for France the next day.</i>

292
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:03,109
<i>I felt as though I was starting a new life.</i>

293
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:06,137
<i>I had never made a sea voyage before.</i>

294
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:10,078
<i>I enjoyed being out of reach.</i>

295
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:40,899
Excuse me.

296
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:43,764
You are sitting in my chair.

297
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:45,726
Oh, really?

298
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:48,791
Sorry.
My name is on it.

299
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,976
Piper. You see?

300
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,654
Is that German?
Yes.

301
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:59,832
Well, you speak pretty good English.
I've always been told it's excellent.

302
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:03,439
Have you seen a book around here?
A book?

303
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:05,721
No. Ah, there you go.

304
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,623
Here it is.

305
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:11,742
Must be an important book.

306
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:15,399
'The Stranger' by Camus.
Have you heard of it?

307
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:17,441
No.

308
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:19,493
That's amazing.

309
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:21,879
You haven't heard of Camus?

310
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:24,100
No, why? Should I have?

311
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:28,451
Sartre.

312
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,213
Have you heard of him?

313
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:35,818
Oh yeah. You mean the existentialist guy,
everybody wears black and drinks espresso?

314
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:37,640
You should give it a try.

315
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,178
Maybe I will.

316
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:05,158
My mother says everyone can
be moved by a work of art

317
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,815
except the intellectual philistine.
Mr. Faber is an engineer.

318
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,373
He is not interested in creativity.

319
00:34:11,664 --> 00:34:14,547
Don't speak for myself, thank you very much.

320
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:17,563
To experience... eternity

321
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:20,608
takes a little bit more
than rational science.

322
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:23,250
Oh shit! Now we're gonna
talk about eternity?

323
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:28,091
I mean, excuse me, I'm sorry.
I... I'm a technologist.

324
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:30,563
You know, it's a very simple point of view.

325
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:33,039
We're trained to see things
as they are without dreaming.

326
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:36,575
I don't know what the souls of the
damned look like. Do you reverened?

327
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:40,033
I mean how can I experience something
that isn't there? We're on a ship here.

328
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:42,562
You know, were all at sea
with a bunch of strangers.

329
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:45,735
It's very simple. That's all
there is to it. Excuse me.

330
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:52,286
Oh, and what, another thing.

331
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:58,738
It's not art or religion that's keeping us
all from drowning here. It's technology.

332
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,834
American technology.

333
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:02,965
Good night.

334
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:05,151
Good night, Walter.
Cheers!

335
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,213
Ready?

336
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:15,489
My partner didn't show up. Would you
like to play ping-pong with me?

337
00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:16,552
Ping-pong?

338
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,644
Well, I'm a little rusty.

339
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:23,119
No excuses, Walter.
The shuffleboard can wait.

340
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,243
And take your beatings like a man.

341
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:33,574
Well, I suppose ping-pong's like everything
else, just a question of confidence.

342
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,670
Are you alwys so pompous?

343
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,935
Pompous? Is that being pompous?

344
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:40,285
It was the way you said it.

345
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:42,651
"Question of confidence."

346
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:49,354
Oh, you're... very good.
Do you wanna play?

347
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:50,941
I'm game.

348
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,569
Ready?

349
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:03,545
Yeah, I shouldn't have had
that chocolate mousse, you know?

350
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:05,786
I mean it was great but I'm on a diet.
Hey Louie!

351
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:08,377
Hey, look. An avid game
of ping-pong here.

352
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,520
All right.

353
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:12,588
Your serve, right?

354
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:15,422
Hi.
Hi.

355
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:24,582
Hey, Walter. You wanna
drink now or later?

356
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,097
Hey Louie. Citrus fruit.

357
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:30,307
I don't even know your name.

358
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:32,689
Walter Faber.
I'm Elizabeth.

359
00:36:33,312 --> 00:36:34,365
Elizabeth?

360
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,570
That doesn't seem to fit you.

361
00:36:37,212 --> 00:36:39,670
We'll have to think up
something better for you.

362
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:44,516
I don't think you're having a very
good time on this ship, Mr. Faber.

363
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,844
No, five days without a car.
I love it! I could sail around the world.

364
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,038
Yeah, well you'd have to go without me.

365
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:53,873
That would be sad. No
one to beat at ping-pong.

366
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:59,938
<i>I had forgotten that
anyone could be so young.</i>

367
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:04,510
<i>Her endless curiosity got me
talking about navigation, radar,</i>

368
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:06,787
<i>the curvature of the earth and so on.</i>

369
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,052
Thank you.

370
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:16,212
<i>It's always a pleasure to
watch machinery in operation.</i>

371
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:31,203
<i>We walked down to the big propeller shafts.</i>

372
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:35,551
<i>What impressed her most were all the
pipes, never mind what they were for.</i>

373
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:43,091
<i>I explanied the main control panel,
what a kilowatt is, hydraulics...</i>

374
00:37:43,154 --> 00:37:46,536
<i>What an ampere is, problems
of torsion, index and friction.</i>

375
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,469
<i>Teague of the steel through
vibration and so on.</i>

376
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:50,772
Scary!

377
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:57,596
The structure has to hold up to all
this pressure of water. It's fantastic.

378
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:12,431
You're a great teacher.

379
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,762
Well, you can learn all
the same stuff from books.

380
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:17,405
Here.

381
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:21,069
I'd rather you teach me.

382
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:26,883
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. Dinner is now
being served for the first sitting.</i>

383
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:31,188
Excuse me. I have to go.

384
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,599
Sure.

385
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:40,876
Sabeth. How about if I called you Sabeth?

386
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:44,449
Instead of Elizabeth. How's that sound?
Sabeth?

387
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:46,121
What do you think?

388
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:47,668
Okay.

389
00:38:51,283 --> 00:38:55,027
<i>I'd begun to think a great deal
about Hannah again lately.</i>

390
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:59,299
<i>Probably any young girl would
somehow remind me of Hannah.</i>

391
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,336
<i>Twenty years is a long time.</i>

392
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:20,942
She sick?

393
00:39:21,005 --> 00:39:24,080
She's all right, just seasick.
You all right?

394
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,586
Well, let's help her to the cabin.
Yeah, well I can manage. Thank you anyway.

395
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,703
Come on. You'll be all right.

396
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,556
Do you feel better now?

397
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:47,055
Here we go.

398
00:39:57,913 --> 00:39:59,791
You, you'll be all right.

399
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:03,328
Thank you, Mr. Faber.
I can manage it now.

400
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:14,607
Well, I guess we should let
her sleep for a while, huh?

401
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:18,738
You gonna be all right?

402
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:27,981
Well, I'll see you up on deck later
for some trap shooting maybe, huh?

403
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:29,980
Yeah. Maybe.

404
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:33,829
Pull.

405
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:46,939
Pull.

406
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,075
Are you engaged to Miss Piper?

407
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:57,418
No. Hardly. She's very independent.

408
00:40:58,048 --> 00:40:59,719
We both are actually.

409
00:40:59,782 --> 00:41:03,589
I mean, we don't want to make the
same mistakes our parents made.

410
00:41:04,594 --> 00:41:06,011
No, of course not.

411
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,375
Pull.

412
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,584
Yes?

413
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:24,356
It's Faber. I brought you
some pills for your stomach.

414
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:27,161
Thank you. I'm all right.

415
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:31,981
Well they... they.
These will help your stomach.

416
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:35,649
No. It's okay. Thank you.

417
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:37,102
You feeling better?

418
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:40,269
Yes.
You oughta take these, they'll help you.

419
00:41:41,157 --> 00:41:42,175
Thank you.

420
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,185
Thank you.

421
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:07,933
You know, I really wanted
to be an airline stewardess.

422
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:11,942
And I would have loved to go out
west... but mother wants me back.

423
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,595
She's alone and we've never
been separated that long.

424
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:18,241
She sacrificed everything for me.

425
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:22,574
She even learned to play the piano because
she wanted to accompany me on the violin.

426
00:42:22,636 --> 00:42:24,416
Which is amazing at her age.

427
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:30,424
Well, you see that ship out there?

428
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:32,145
That's an oil tanker.

429
00:42:33,904 --> 00:42:37,053
No, it's a cigar floating on a mirror(?).

430
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,173
Don't you see the smoke?

431
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:41,038
You're quite a poet.

432
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,947
This is our last sunset before France.

433
00:42:49,558 --> 00:42:51,751
I am so excited about Paris.

434
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:56,545
I just hope Kurt will get this
woman that cheap hotel.

435
00:42:56,715 --> 00:42:58,641
It's really close to the Louvre.

436
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,129
Then, I'll hitchhike to Italy.

437
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:05,427
You gonna hitchhike?
Yeah.

438
00:43:06,444 --> 00:43:08,770
I can take care of myself, you know?

439
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:10,580
No, I'm used to travelling alone.
In fact, I like it.

440
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:14,528
I enjoy waking up and not having
to explain myself to a woman.

441
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:19,040
You're such a delightful man, Walter.
Why are you so impossible?

442
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:22,231
No, really. Three or four days
with a woman is absolute maximum.

443
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,896
After that I start to dissimilate.

444
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:58,335
Hey, what happened to my drink?

445
00:44:58,637 --> 00:45:01,072
Pretty good hoofer, Reverened.

446
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:03,386
Oh, we know devil's toys.

447
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:06,995
Are you sure you don't want to dance?

448
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:09,620
I'm positive, but I enjoy watching you.

449
00:45:09,683 --> 00:45:12,751
He's saving himself for the big moment.

450
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:18,574
In ten minutes it will be midnight... and
Walter will be one year older! -All Right!

451
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:25,847
<i>And now ladies and gentlemen, it's time
to make orange juice. -Smile everyone.</i>

452
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:29,097
Congratulations, Walter!
Reverened. Thanks.

453
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,405
Come on, let's do another one.
I think I need some air.

454
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:35,269
That sounds good to me too. Excuse me.

455
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:11,944
I think you should get
married, Mr. Faber.

456
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,318
No, I'm serious.

457
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:19,593
No. No. I tried that once but she ran out
on me. We had kind of a disagreement.

458
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:24,577
But, I don't think you should
hitchhike to Rome.

459
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:26,527
You sound like my mother.

460
00:46:28,005 --> 00:46:30,827
Would your mother recommend
me getting married too?

461
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:34,628
No. I don't think she has a
very good opinion of marriage.

462
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:38,994
Well, she sounds like the kind
of woman I get along with.

463
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,527
Will you dance with me?

464
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:53,673
Would you marry me?

465
00:46:57,878 --> 00:46:58,878
Hi.

466
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:04,781
Thanks.

467
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,437
Nice night, isn't it?

468
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:13,218
It sure is.

469
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:18,367
Happy birthday.

470
00:47:19,615 --> 00:47:20,863
Thanks, Kurt.

471
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:32,118
Okay, I'll be at the bar for a while.

472
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,433
Okay.

473
00:48:02,986 --> 00:48:04,670
Are you serious?

474
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:09,764
Yeah.

475
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:42,196
It's crazy, huh?

476
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:51,916
You wanna slow dance?

477
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,768
With an average volume of 1000 cube
megatons per hour these waters now produce

478
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:21,457
over 300,000 kilowatts of energy.

479
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:24,048
It's a remarkable engineering concept.

480
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,887
1.6 million acres of land
had to be rehabilitated.

481
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:46,984
The dam itself...

482
00:50:47,154 --> 00:50:50,364
uses 10,500 liters per second of water.

483
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,397
The power...

484
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:57,000
is enough to service three major
cities of over 400,000 people each.

485
00:50:58,229 --> 00:51:01,471
This is truly a vision of the future,
ladies and gentlemen.

486
00:51:10,503 --> 00:51:12,769
Fantastic! Great, Walter!

487
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:19,103
I am afraid our turbines won't
quite be ready for assembly.

488
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:22,361
The usual... bureaucracy.

489
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,153
That's all right. I'd like to
get down there anyways.

490
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,442
That would be premature.
_Walter.

491
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,406
I thought you promised to go on holiday.

492
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:35,034
No. No. I got enough rest on that boat trip.
I want to get down there as soon as possible.

493
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:40,432
I must remind you gentlemen, that we are
extremely concerned about donning artifacts.

494
00:51:40,494 --> 00:51:42,547
That won't be a problem, monsieur.

495
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,324
All the good stuff has been
stolen a long time ago.

496
00:51:45,387 --> 00:51:48,074
It's either the British Museum,
or the Louvre.

497
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:50,975
What time does the Louvre close?
I beg your pardon.

498
00:51:51,038 --> 00:51:53,914
The museum. The Louvre. What time
does it close? -I have no idea.

499
00:51:53,976 --> 00:51:56,179
As far as I know it's always closed.

500
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:09,113
To the Louvre.

501
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:22,368
I thought you didn't like museums?

502
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:25,796
I don't.

503
00:55:26,474 --> 00:55:27,734
That's funny.

504
00:55:28,267 --> 00:55:29,267
Why?

505
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:34,488
I saw you at the Louvre.

506
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,164
I planned to leave today but...

507
00:55:37,227 --> 00:55:39,200
I decided to stay another day.

508
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:40,435
You saw me?

509
00:55:41,628 --> 00:55:43,687
You weren't hiding from me, were you?

510
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:52,227
Your not still going to hitchhike
all the way down there, are you?

511
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:54,126
Absolutely.

512
00:55:54,532 --> 00:55:57,014
I've got my itinerary all worked out.

513
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,201
Your itinerary?

514
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:02,417
Itinerary, okay.

515
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:04,406
Avignon.

516
00:56:04,672 --> 00:56:06,816
Avignon?
Then, Nimes.

517
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:08,996
Florence.

518
00:56:10,022 --> 00:56:11,598
Pisa.
Pizza?

519
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:12,857
Orvieto.

520
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:14,505
Assisi.

521
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:16,019
And Rome.

522
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:18,566
Oh, boy! I'm glad you finished.

523
00:56:18,772 --> 00:56:23,105
And of course I will stop in Saint Tropez.
I know some crazy people there.

524
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,988
We will go to the beach. Dance.

525
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,743
You know, it will be one of those summers.

526
00:56:31,147 --> 00:56:33,897
You know I could buy you a train ticket.

527
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,925
I just don't like the idea of
you hitchhiking down there.

528
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:40,310
I'll be all right.

529
00:56:44,028 --> 00:56:46,021
This is my subway station.

530
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,794
Well, good luck to you.

531
00:56:57,845 --> 00:56:59,819
Do you think we'll meet again?

532
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,998
How about if I bought you lunch?

533
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:07,979
Great!

534
00:57:08,347 --> 00:57:09,583
I'm starving.

535
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:18,071
This is, so great.

536
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:21,766
I love Paris again. I really haven't
had a good meal in two days.

537
00:57:21,828 --> 00:57:23,668
It's so expensive here.

538
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:26,236
Want some more wine?

539
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:27,812
No. No. No...

540
00:57:29,144 --> 00:57:31,409
Coffee.
Coffee? Garcon!

541
00:57:51,453 --> 00:57:54,881
You know, there's only two
things that I wish for you.

542
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:57,349
One is that you don't hitchhike.

543
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:03,038
And the other one is that you never,
ever, become an airline stewardess.

544
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:04,619
Okay?

545
00:58:05,507 --> 00:58:07,068
You promise?
Yes.

546
00:58:19,573 --> 00:58:21,379
Well, I got this...

547
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:26,021
conference that I'm locked into
here, I can't get out of it.

548
00:58:47,484 --> 00:58:50,468
Do you think I could just sit
here and have another coffee?

549
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,733
Sure.
Got plenty of time.

550
00:58:59,427 --> 00:59:02,410
Maybe you could send me a telegram or a...

551
00:59:02,733 --> 00:59:07,508
postcard or something you know, when you
get down there so that I know you made it.

552
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:09,625
Maybe.

553
01:00:10,226 --> 01:00:12,904
How about if I rent us a car...

554
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:17,801
and drive you as far as Rome?
What about your conference?

555
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,205
Well, they can live without me.

556
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:24,489
I'll have to tell Kurt,
and take my suitcase.

557
01:00:27,175 --> 01:00:29,242
You mean you'd actually come?

558
01:00:45,276 --> 01:00:47,862
Are you listening to me, Walter?
Yes.

559
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,326
Walter.

560
01:00:49,908 --> 01:00:52,786
I can't call you Walter.
Why not?

561
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:57,683
It makes me think of teachers and
uncles and people like that. -Oncles?

562
01:00:57,872 --> 01:00:58,975
Uncles!

563
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:02,264
Well, call me anything
you like. I don't care.

564
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:07,315
Then I just have to call you Faber.
It's a good name for you, anyhow.

565
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:09,371
Do you know what it means in Latin?

566
01:01:09,434 --> 01:01:12,248
Did you take Lating?
At the French (???).

567
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:18,161
It means... the forger of his own fate.

568
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,840
Let me see.

569
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,896
You tell anything in there?

570
01:01:40,425 --> 01:01:42,277
Maybe we should stop?

571
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:46,609
No. No. Avignon can't be that far and
there's no place to stay here, anyhow.

572
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,169
I'll be all right. It's just my eyes.

573
01:01:52,771 --> 01:01:54,409
Let me be your eyes.

574
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:55,924
Come on.

575
01:01:56,628 --> 01:01:59,888
You handle the gas and breaks.
You sure about this?

576
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:04,739
I don't know if this is a good idea.
We can go faster now... even faster.

577
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:06,852
That's right.

578
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,576
Put down the breaks a little.

579
01:02:10,954 --> 01:02:12,928
We're coming around a curve.

580
01:02:24,587 --> 01:02:26,638
Now we are on a flat stretch.

581
01:03:09,547 --> 01:03:11,444
Is this it?
Yes.

582
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:19,142
It's okay?

583
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:22,708
Good night.
Good night.

584
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:21,159
Merci, madam.

585
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:24,908
Au revoir.

586
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:38,188
Well. Down the road.

587
01:06:22,843 --> 01:06:25,858
<i>On our trip through Italy
I can only say I was happy.</i>

588
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,799
<i>Because the girl, I believe, was happy too.</i>

589
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,712
<i>The only thing that worried
me was her hunger for art.</i>

590
01:06:34,095 --> 01:06:38,916
<i>Her mania for looking at everything.
Museums don't mean a thing to me.</i>

591
01:06:40,438 --> 01:06:42,703
<i>What I enjoyed most was her joy.</i>

592
01:06:44,464 --> 01:06:46,469
I'm gonna see the Masaccio.

593
01:06:46,698 --> 01:06:49,300
It's supposed to be almost as primitive...

594
01:06:49,529 --> 01:06:52,637
I mean as... as archaic as an early (???).

595
01:06:54,564 --> 01:06:57,120
Where's you learn all these fancy words?

596
01:06:57,395 --> 01:07:02,400
From mother. -Ah, mother! You coming?
Thanks, I'll sit this one out.

597
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:05,231
You're very old today.

598
01:07:34,386 --> 01:07:35,579
Wake up!

599
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,313
Wake up!

600
01:07:53,314 --> 01:07:54,645
Where are we?

601
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:56,252
Orvieto.

602
01:07:56,788 --> 01:07:58,501
Orvieto?
Yeah.

603
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:45,419
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I thought you went for your campari.

604
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:48,036
I wonder what she's dreaming about.

605
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:53,928
Here, wait a second. Look.

606
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:58,473
See how she's completely different when the
light falls on one side of her face? Look.

607
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:02,376
Can you see?

608
01:09:02,651 --> 01:09:03,998
She looks wilder.

609
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:05,988
Think so?

610
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:13,773
I know she's asleep.

611
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:15,946
Who is she?

612
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:18,462
A sleeping girl.

613
01:09:42,431 --> 01:09:46,133
Did you know that the sleeping girl
we like so much is a real celebrity?

614
01:09:46,195 --> 01:09:49,026
Really?
Yeah. She's more than 2000 years old.

615
01:09:49,464 --> 01:09:52,495
That's old.
Do you want to sign it? No.

616
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:56,979
Anyway, we will be in
Athens before it gets there.

617
01:09:57,836 --> 01:09:58,892
Probably.

618
01:10:13,069 --> 01:10:14,385
Am I too heavy?

619
01:10:15,089 --> 01:10:16,421
No.
You sure?

620
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:18,487
No, you are.

621
01:10:24,109 --> 01:10:25,109
Frau...

622
01:10:25,915 --> 01:10:27,078
Doctor...

623
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:30,429
Hannah...

624
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,430
Piper.

625
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:38,522
What's her name? -Good question.
She's gone through a lot of names.

626
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:41,139
Piper is only the last one.

627
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:44,629
He's living in East Germany now.
He's a communist.

628
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:46,802
I never liked him.

629
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:50,093
And I was very pleased they divorced.

630
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:53,622
Thank you.

631
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:57,464
Before that it was Hencke.

632
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:01,979
My real father, Joachim Hencke.

633
01:11:07,902 --> 01:11:10,305
Go away! This is our place!

634
01:11:10,764 --> 01:11:12,126
Go away!

635
01:11:15,064 --> 01:11:18,216
Do soemthing. I mean they're
going to have a picnic right here

636
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:22,639
and I will have to go behind a tree.
Your father's name is Joachim Hencke?

637
01:11:23,389 --> 01:11:24,389
Yeah.

638
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:26,434
From Zurich?

639
01:11:27,122 --> 01:11:28,122
Yeah.

640
01:11:30,942 --> 01:11:32,289
I have to go.

641
01:11:35,365 --> 01:11:38,013
You're hurting me. What's the matter?

642
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,528
Nothing.

643
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:50,807
Don't look!

644
01:12:05,046 --> 01:12:06,117
Hannah!

645
01:12:08,183 --> 01:12:12,714
Hannah, come on. They're calling us. Let's
just get this thing over with, all right?

646
01:12:13,188 --> 01:12:17,305
You know what I just realised?
I really don't know who you are.

647
01:12:17,368 --> 01:12:20,677
Why are you suddenly ready to throw
this whole thing away? What's the matter?

648
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:24,767
I think it's better you go to Baghdad and build your dam.
- Look, I'll make my own decisions.

649
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:26,621
All right?
Bye Walter.

650
01:12:26,896 --> 01:12:30,737
And as for my child, don't worry
about it, there won't be any child.

651
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,140
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

652
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,079
I'll talk to Joachim, he'll help me.

653
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:41,389
He loves me.

654
01:12:43,895 --> 01:12:48,119
<i>The best of Greek and Roman
culture in one ideal city.</i>

655
01:12:52,604 --> 01:12:53,604
Faber!

656
01:13:06,793 --> 01:13:08,461
Do you have a light?

657
01:13:10,424 --> 01:13:12,628
You smoke too much.
I know.

658
01:13:15,306 --> 01:13:16,500
Thank you.

659
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:19,393
Did I do something wrong?

660
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,102
No. Nothing at all.

661
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,469
For a minute I thought I
had done something wrong.

662
01:13:56,810 --> 01:14:01,859
Faber, what's the matter with you?
Nothing, I'd just like to have a drink.

663
01:14:11,582 --> 01:14:13,557
You're acting so strange.

664
01:14:16,312 --> 01:14:20,904
So many things have happened to me
lately. So many different things that I...

665
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:23,138
can't account for.

666
01:14:27,056 --> 01:14:29,443
Do you believe in chance?
Chance?

667
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:33,361
Yeah, like coincidence.
Like a chain of... coincidence.

668
01:14:34,187 --> 01:14:37,024
There's all these things
that keep piling up.

669
01:14:43,498 --> 01:14:45,456
What are you trying to say?

670
01:14:47,815 --> 01:14:50,829
Sabeth, I think I knew
your mother and father.

671
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:56,482
They were friends of mine a long time ago.
You knew them? When?

672
01:14:59,466 --> 01:15:02,436
We went to school together.
Are you sure?

673
01:15:04,191 --> 01:15:05,369
Sabeth...

674
01:15:06,808 --> 01:15:08,782
When exactly were you born?

675
01:15:09,149 --> 01:15:14,031
Exactly? You mean the hour? The minute?
No. No. Just the date.

676
01:15:14,613 --> 01:15:16,496
June 23rd, 1938.

677
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:19,954
- June 23rd? -Yeah.
- Where? -In Munich.

678
01:15:20,857 --> 01:15:22,326
Do you remember...

679
01:15:23,179 --> 01:15:26,485
when your mother married Joachim?
No.

680
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:32,102
Could it have been January 1938?

681
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:34,643
How would I know?

682
01:15:41,446 --> 01:15:43,481
How old were you when he left?

683
01:15:44,307 --> 01:15:45,868
Two or three, I guess.

684
01:15:46,397 --> 01:15:51,156
I hardly remember father. All I know is
that he's somewhere in South America.

685
01:15:53,269 --> 01:15:55,105
What's this all about?

686
01:16:00,026 --> 01:16:01,373
You knew mother?

687
01:16:02,168 --> 01:16:03,607
What was she like?

688
01:16:09,055 --> 01:16:11,382
She was just as beautiful as you.

689
01:16:36,642 --> 01:16:39,642
Buona notte, Mr. Faber.
Buona notte, Ms. Faber.

690
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:13,509
You don't love me anymore.

691
01:17:15,936 --> 01:17:18,446
No, Sabeth. I do. Of course I do.

692
01:17:24,922 --> 01:17:27,615
Is it because you're the
same age as my mother?

693
01:17:29,053 --> 01:17:30,247
What is it?

694
01:17:32,757 --> 01:17:36,078
You're not old. You're just
as young as me sometimes.

695
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,137
You're completely different from my mother.

696
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:44,218
Don't tell me about your mother anymore! I don't
want to hear about your mother all right?

697
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:11,156
You're gonna leave me, I know it.

698
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:13,467
No, but I have to take you back.

699
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:16,880
Back where?
To Hannah.

700
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,145
I'm not a child.

701
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,961
I can take a train to Athens, or hitchhike.

702
01:18:25,818 --> 01:18:30,730
And you can go back to Paris or
New York, or wherever you want to go.

703
01:18:33,245 --> 01:18:35,128
You don't have to babysit me.

704
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:38,678
I have to take you back myself.
I have to talk to her.

705
01:18:46,658 --> 01:18:48,050
You do love me.

706
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,060
I see it in your eyes.

707
01:18:54,386 --> 01:18:56,483
Why are you trying to stop it?

708
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,031
Frau doctor. Telephone.

709
01:19:52,062 --> 01:19:53,210
Elizabeth!

710
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:55,275
Where are you?

711
01:19:56,974 --> 01:19:59,178
I was waiting for you yesterday.

712
01:19:59,621 --> 01:20:00,632
Tomorrow?

713
01:20:01,091 --> 01:20:02,091
What?

714
01:20:02,286 --> 01:20:06,143
No, I was really glad that you didn't
hitchhike. Tell me, is Kurt with you?

715
01:20:11,392 --> 01:20:12,785
Is everything all right?

716
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:17,758
Yes. They're all here in front of me.

717
01:20:20,263 --> 01:20:22,053
Oh, I can't wait to see you.

718
01:20:49,565 --> 01:20:52,106
There's so much more to be seen around here.

719
01:20:53,299 --> 01:20:56,192
I mean, it would be criminal
not to go to Delphi.

720
01:20:56,973 --> 01:20:58,365
What's the rush?

721
01:21:00,163 --> 01:21:03,438
Athens is terrible in the summer.
Have you ever been there?

722
01:21:05,091 --> 01:21:07,586
No.
So what's the big rush?

723
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:14,535
Well, your mother's waiting for you.

724
01:21:18,147 --> 01:21:19,907
I wanna be with you.

725
01:21:24,896 --> 01:21:26,702
I don't understand you.

726
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,427
Why do you want to get rid of me?

727
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,147
Sabeth!

728
01:21:57,478 --> 01:22:02,162
Leave me alone! You don't have to
follow me. Go back to your drink. Go!

729
01:22:08,812 --> 01:22:10,686
Sabeth!
Go away!

730
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,481
Sabeth, come here!

731
01:22:16,544 --> 01:22:17,424
Go!

732
01:22:17,486 --> 01:22:19,579
Sabeth!
Leave me alone.

733
01:24:08,472 --> 01:24:09,472
Help!

734
01:24:10,487 --> 01:24:11,487
Help!

735
01:24:20,887 --> 01:24:21,887
Sabeth.

736
01:24:23,346 --> 01:24:24,484
Sabeth!

737
01:24:55,347 --> 01:24:56,347
Help!

738
01:24:57,576 --> 01:24:58,605
Over here!

739
01:25:01,224 --> 01:25:02,224
Wait!

740
01:25:27,543 --> 01:25:28,543
Hey!

741
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,444
There's a truck Wait! Wait!

742
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:44,198
Wait!

743
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:53,934
I got somebody hurt down near there. Snake
bite. I need to get her to the hospital.

744
01:25:54,595 --> 01:25:57,007
Where are you going? How far? How far?

745
01:25:57,521 --> 01:26:00,325
Take this watch. The watch. Take it!

746
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:03,594
We got this truck.

747
01:26:03,814 --> 01:26:05,920
Here. We got the truck.

748
01:26:34,835 --> 01:26:37,651
Okay, where is this now?
Where the hell are we?

749
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:42,426
Is this the road to the center?
Do you know your way around here?

750
01:26:55,227 --> 01:27:00,760
Can we ask somebody where the hospital is if
you don't know? Can we ask somebody? Okay?

751
01:27:01,445 --> 01:27:03,209
Where's the hospital?

752
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,129
Where's a doctor?

753
01:27:07,361 --> 01:27:09,092
We need help here!

754
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:35,817
How is she?

755
01:27:36,578 --> 01:27:38,309
We must hope for the best.

756
01:27:41,404 --> 01:27:43,062
She's alive though?

757
01:27:44,449 --> 01:27:45,449
Yes.

758
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:52,840
The doctor was here just now. He says
it was most likely a snub nose viper.

759
01:27:54,673 --> 01:27:58,099
Any case, the mortality from
snakebites is only 3-10%.

760
01:28:08,156 --> 01:28:09,156
Here.

761
01:28:09,654 --> 01:28:10,944
Drink your tea.

762
01:28:20,978 --> 01:28:22,329
How did it happen?

763
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:26,782
I tried to talk to her but she was so confused
I couldn't understand what she was saying.

764
01:28:29,154 --> 01:28:31,118
How long has she been in Greece?

765
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:33,341
Since yesterday, I think.

766
01:28:39,268 --> 01:28:42,252
So, you're the older gentleman
she met on the boat?

767
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,410
We travelled togather.

768
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:52,266
Drink your tea.

769
01:28:55,855 --> 01:28:57,942
How long you been wearing glasses?

770
01:29:00,557 --> 01:29:02,701
Now, let's get a look at you.

771
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,127
Mr. Faber is a friend of mine.

772
01:29:20,721 --> 01:29:22,194
Just for a minute.

773
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:46,197
Come. Let her sleep.

774
01:29:48,014 --> 01:29:49,107
Sabeth.

775
01:29:50,347 --> 01:29:52,189
Walter. Please.

776
01:30:21,932 --> 01:30:24,143
What did you call her, Sabeth?

777
01:31:05,404 --> 01:31:08,204
So, how long have you been living in Athens?

778
01:31:08,812 --> 01:31:11,845
For years. Elizabeth went to school here.

779
01:31:14,922 --> 01:31:16,580
Why don't you sit down?

780
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:32,765
Looks like you actually became
an archaeologist, huh? -Yeah.

781
01:31:32,973 --> 01:31:36,570
I'm patching up fragments, sticking
the puzzle together like a detective.

782
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:41,037
Ah, this is a find I'm really excited about.

783
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:44,521
See, that's a cast from a mold.

784
01:31:45,912 --> 01:31:48,282
It was made 400 years B.C.

785
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,714
See how detailed it is?
Look at the face.

786
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,360
Or the hair.

787
01:31:57,514 --> 01:31:58,890
Very intricate.

788
01:32:01,314 --> 01:32:03,988
It's probably a (???) or a Nereid.

789
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,559
What's a Nereid?

790
01:32:09,173 --> 01:32:10,954
Nereids are sea nymphs.

791
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,461
Mythological beings that live
in the sea, like mermaids.

792
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:18,882
Can you see the dress?
It looks as if it was wet.

793
01:32:20,072 --> 01:32:21,730
That's very typical for...

794
01:32:24,153 --> 01:32:26,977
Would you like to take
a batch before dinner?

795
01:32:27,968 --> 01:32:29,908
Yeah, I could use a shave too.

796
01:32:34,822 --> 01:32:36,124
It's over here.

797
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:53,821
How is she?
She's all right.

798
01:33:10,398 --> 01:33:12,116
Did you tell her I was here?

799
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:15,984
No. Come, let's have something to eat.

800
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,578
I'd like to talk to her.

801
01:33:20,605 --> 01:33:24,950
Why? What for? I told you everything.
What's the number at the hospital?

802
01:33:25,012 --> 01:33:26,755
God. Leave me alone!

803
01:33:27,025 --> 01:33:28,621
What do you want from us?

804
01:33:28,684 --> 01:33:33,128
Listen I haven't seen my daughter for half a
year and finally I get a call from the hospital.

805
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:36,168
And when I go there I find her half
conscious and then you're there!

806
01:33:36,231 --> 01:33:39,535
And I have no idea what this is all about!
Why don't you want me to talk to her?

807
01:33:39,598 --> 01:33:40,934
What did she tell you?

808
01:33:41,475 --> 01:33:44,483
Did you know who she was?
That I was her mother?

809
01:33:45,616 --> 01:33:48,661
I would just like to hear
her voice, all right?

810
01:33:59,577 --> 01:34:01,333
Come sit down. Please.

811
01:34:27,138 --> 01:34:28,807
So where did you go in Italy?

812
01:34:30,822 --> 01:34:33,609
The usual places, you
know. Florence. Sienna...

813
01:34:34,432 --> 01:34:35,432
Cici.

814
01:34:35,949 --> 01:34:38,000
Your daughter has a great curiosity.

815
01:34:40,286 --> 01:34:42,878
Yeah, she's really like a child sometimes.

816
01:34:45,996 --> 01:34:48,121
Do you think she's ever been with a man?

817
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:53,286
What?

818
01:34:53,586 --> 01:34:55,219
Tell me what happened.

819
01:34:55,551 --> 01:34:58,669
I told you. I didn't like the
idea of her hitchhiking and...

820
01:34:59,492 --> 01:35:01,788
I rented a car.
Why shouldn't she hitchhike?

821
01:35:02,009 --> 01:35:05,872
Well, she's just a kid. I mean anything
can happen, you read the papers.

822
01:35:10,762 --> 01:35:12,420
Whay are you so concerned?

823
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:18,459
It's amazing you know, the
statistics about snakebites is only

824
01:35:18,644 --> 01:35:21,259
3-10%, I would have thought
it was much higher.

825
01:35:22,487 --> 01:35:25,274
I'm not interested in statistics, Walter.

826
01:35:27,592 --> 01:35:30,698
If I had 100 daughters and all of
them had been bitten by a viper then

827
01:35:30,761 --> 01:35:34,382
there'd be some sense in it and
I'd lose only 3 to 10 daughters.

828
01:35:36,669 --> 01:35:38,829
Not that many really think about it.

829
01:35:47,317 --> 01:35:49,134
Well, I think I need some sleep.

830
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:52,153
I'll put you in Elizabeth's room.
Hannah.

831
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:53,909
Tell me the truth.

832
01:35:58,188 --> 01:35:59,588
Am I her father?

833
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:05,678
Is this the child you
said you wouldn't have?

834
01:36:05,741 --> 01:36:06,741
No.

835
01:36:08,097 --> 01:36:09,890
I've told you already.

836
01:36:11,424 --> 01:36:12,702
It's Joachim.

837
01:36:13,746 --> 01:36:15,244
Joachim's dead.

838
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:19,702
I found him in Mexico.

839
01:36:23,668 --> 01:36:24,834
He's dead.

840
01:37:19,127 --> 01:37:20,821
The bed's all made up.

841
01:37:39,217 --> 01:37:40,274
Good night.

842
01:37:46,258 --> 01:37:47,258
Walter.

843
01:37:47,535 --> 01:37:49,451
How far did you go with the child?

844
01:37:52,102 --> 01:37:53,102
Tell me.

845
01:37:54,713 --> 01:37:55,732
Yes or no?

846
01:37:58,827 --> 01:37:59,827
Yes.

847
01:39:46,041 --> 01:39:47,061
Hannah.

848
01:39:55,981 --> 01:39:56,981
Hannah.

849
01:40:32,218 --> 01:40:33,218
Hannah!

850
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,391
Hannah!

851
01:41:11,064 --> 01:41:12,064
Hey!

852
01:41:24,915 --> 01:41:28,400
Why didn't you wake me up?
Her body rejected the poison. She's fine.

853
01:41:28,462 --> 01:41:31,752
Where is she? I want to see her. Now.
No. She needs more rest.

854
01:41:32,497 --> 01:41:34,707
Where is Elizabeth Piper's room?

855
01:41:35,309 --> 01:41:38,439
Piper? Yeah. Do you
know where she... Piper.

856
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:41,439
Or is it Hencke or Landsberg or what?

857
01:41:41,501 --> 01:41:43,870
Where is she? -Down there.
It's down here?

858
01:41:44,116 --> 01:41:47,858
Who is this Mr. Piper anyway?
One of your abandoned men?

859
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,724
Like Joachim. Why'd you divorce Joachim?
I didn't love him.

860
01:41:51,787 --> 01:41:56,105
Ah, you didn't love him. That's cute.
Must be why he killed himself.

861
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:58,801
Maybe that's what you had
in mind for me, huh? Suicide.

862
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:01,966
Cause you wouldn't marry me. -You didn't
want to get married. -Are you crazy?

863
01:42:02,028 --> 01:42:05,251
You didn't. You wanted to build a dam in Baghdad.
- I asked you to get married!

864
01:42:05,314 --> 01:42:07,683
So we could have this child. I asked you.
That's not what you said.

865
01:42:07,745 --> 01:42:11,588
Don't tell me what I said! I know what I said!
You said if you want to have your child

866
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:14,045
then we must get married.
You said 'your' child.

867
01:42:14,635 --> 01:42:15,764
Not 'ours'.

868
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,249
Is this true?

869
01:42:21,256 --> 01:42:22,385
One word.

870
01:42:23,064 --> 01:42:26,268
After 20 years one stupid word divided us?

871
01:42:27,091 --> 01:42:28,295
Exactly.

872
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:31,514
And by the way it's 21 years.

873
01:42:32,681 --> 01:42:35,210
Why do you keep getting the figures wrong?

874
01:42:35,273 --> 01:42:39,154
Isn't it interesting that you, the man of
science, the great believer of mathematics

875
01:42:39,216 --> 01:42:41,414
who cannot add 9 months to a year?

876
01:42:49,918 --> 01:42:51,920
I want to see my daughter.

877
01:43:24,841 --> 01:43:26,843
Why didn't you tell her?

878
01:43:28,611 --> 01:43:33,204
I mean, I don't care if you deceived
me all these years but why her?

879
01:43:46,006 --> 01:43:47,737
She has to know now.
No!

880
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:50,083
She has to know for herself.
No please don't.

881
01:43:50,146 --> 01:43:51,729
What are you so afraid of?

882
01:43:55,449 --> 01:43:57,745
She loves you. She told me this morning.

883
01:44:01,017 --> 01:44:03,878
<i>I never knew how much Hannah had told her.</i>

884
01:44:04,873 --> 01:44:07,634
<i>And Hannah made sure we
couldn't talk to each other.</i>

885
01:44:16,189 --> 01:44:19,198
The doctor says I might be
able to go home in a few days.

886
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:23,122
I never really heard you speak English.
She has a good accent, hasn't she?

887
01:44:23,565 --> 01:44:27,089
You know, in the beginning I was so much
against her going to the United States

888
01:44:27,151 --> 01:44:28,943
but now I'm so glad she did.

889
01:44:29,225 --> 01:44:31,509
We travelled a lot together, you know?

890
01:44:31,571 --> 01:44:35,350
I remember when she was about two years
old and she was just starting to talk

891
01:44:35,413 --> 01:44:38,507
we travelled through France
and through Italy. Remember?

892
01:44:38,875 --> 01:44:40,754
We visited a lot of churches.

893
01:44:41,468 --> 01:44:45,324
And whenever we entered
a church I would say to her:

894
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:50,574
'Shh, Leise!' Which means 'quiet' in
English. And later on, she thought that...

895
01:44:51,253 --> 01:44:54,089
'Shh, quiet.' was the word for 'church'/.

896
01:44:54,718 --> 01:44:58,586
Oh! When you went to Rome did you look
at the mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore?

897
01:44:58,649 --> 01:44:59,875
See you, Faber.

898
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:03,805
Remember, I told you not
to forget to look at them.

899
01:45:05,998 --> 01:45:06,998
Sabeth.

900
01:45:59,993 --> 01:46:01,589
<i>From what I understood,</i>

901
01:46:01,651 --> 01:46:06,053
<i>it was not the snakebit but a fracture
from the fall that caused her death.</i>

902
01:46:06,524 --> 01:46:07,524
<i>She died</i>

903
01:46:08,071 --> 01:46:09,790
<i>just before midnight.</i>

904
01:47:26,853 --> 01:47:28,253
I won't come in.

905
01:48:14,803 --> 01:48:19,481
<i>Passengers for New York flight
number 232 please proceed to the...</i>

906
01:48:20,316 --> 01:48:21,716
<i>I just sat there.</i>

907
01:48:22,882 --> 01:48:25,645
<i>I didn't want to be there.
I didn't want to be anywhere.</i>

908
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:31,578
<i>I've got no use for suicide. It doesn't alter
the fact that one has been in the world.</i>

909
01:48:32,388 --> 01:48:35,655
<i>And what I wished was
that I'd never existed at all.</i>

910
01:48:36,516 --> 01:48:38,370
<i>What was the use of looking?</i>

911
01:48:38,789 --> 01:48:40,630
<i>There was nothing for me to see.</i>

912
01:48:42,439 --> 01:48:44,980
<i>Her hands that no longer existed anywhere.</i>

913
01:48:45,582 --> 01:48:48,258
<i>Her movements as she tossed her ponytail.</i>

914
01:48:48,894 --> 01:48:49,975
<i>Her teeth.</i>

915
01:48:50,467 --> 01:48:51,473
<i>Her lips.</i>

916
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:55,403
<i>Her eyes that no longer existed.</i>

917
01:48:57,518 --> 01:48:59,225
<i>Where could I look for them?</i>

918
01:49:01,497 --> 01:49:02,909
<i>She was gone now.</i>
