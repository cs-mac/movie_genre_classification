1
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,837
Not again!

2
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:56,276
Stop taking pictures of your
pretty mom like a paparazzi.

3
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,611
Blame it on your beauty, mom.

4
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,078
I know, but...

5
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,178
I'm starving.

6
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,881
- Say, "please."
- Please, Mom. $10?

7
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,045
Am I your bank, kiddo?

8
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,321
I'll be late today.

9
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,461
Buy yourself dinner with this.

10
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,951
Again?

11
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,959
To prepare for the housing exams.

12
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,530
I'm sleepy already.

13
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,764
Are you Jealous?

14
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,938
You like him that much?

15
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,602
You said he was so-so.

16
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,081
Is love a guy's dick
turning big or small?

17
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,216
Jeez, Mom...!

18
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,612
Hey, JuJu! Let's go.

19
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,015
Hey, Gigi!

20
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,192
Didn't I tell you to stop calling
my precious son 'JuJu'?

21
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,352
Ditto that.

22
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,862
But you keep calling me Gigi.

23
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,126
"Gigi" and Guitar, big difference!

24
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,068
I can call him whatever I like.

25
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,170
What? Stay right there.

26
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,865
I'm going after you!

27
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,499
See you later, Mom!

28
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,075
I'll let you go today, cutie.

29
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,642
Thank you, ma'am.

30
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,604
See you later, Mom!

31
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,050
Eat properly!
Don't eat ramen noodles!

32
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,608
Wait for me!

33
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,593
I'll go nuts.

34
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,296
- Mama says report.
- Wow, scary.

35
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,868
Damn.

36
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,199
How will I survive
the next semester?

37
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:41,410
- Won't there be a war?
- One's in my stomach.

38
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,776
How about ramen noodles?

39
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,847
Fish balls, 70, topokki, 280,
dumplings, 400.

40
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:52,991
And ramen is 800 kcal,
you kind bastard.

41
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,221
And why'd I eat ramen with you?

42
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,492
How about a tteok ramen then?

43
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,370
The break is almost over.

44
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,343
Will you...

45
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,720
come to school?

46
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,721
Your phone number's...

47
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,061
changed.

48
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,206
Tteok ramen, please.

49
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,008
No, dumpling ramen.

50
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,527
- Stop hogging chocolates, Porky.
- Stop that, JuJu!

51
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,569
The meaning in this sentence is...

52
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,111
I talk, you sleep.

53
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,316
You're in class, huh?

54
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,549
At least have your books open.

55
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,990
Saved by the bell.

56
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,458
Don't get all excited
cuz it's new semester.

57
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,771
One-on-one about your scores
start next week.

58
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,134
Be prepared.

59
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,880
Why is the student director
so into that?

60
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,757
Will this really help sexually?

61
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,528
- Heard he takes eel extracts, too.
- Really?

62
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,161
It only gives me cramps.

63
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,006
Guys would think
you don't have lunch money.

64
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,332
Get lost. I'm on a diet.

65
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,039
Like hell you'll lose weight.

66
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,441
Reading that again?

67
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:09,585
Boring bastards like you
wouldn't know the world of otaku.

68
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,355
The final episode is out next week.

69
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,722
I need to read it over again
10 times until then.

70
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,762
That fun?

71
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,531
Like hell.

72
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,870
Gaia, the main character,
completely lost control.

73
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,963
She's about to wipe them out.

74
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,464
Cheap bastard!

75
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,219
Wanna go to the Silkworm Isle

76
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,714
even if it's Just us?

77
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,689
No one within 300m as usual.

78
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,329
See?

79
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:32,862
Just us two from my school
and yours.

80
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:42,213
Who would dare to turn on
the gay app at school?

81
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,382
We met through this, remember?

82
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,053
I've kept it on for 6 months,

83
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,056
and there's Just us.

84
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,897
There might be more.

85
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,802
Who else is there?

86
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,038
It's Just us.

87
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,308
Know what?

88
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,655
They say when you lie,
your nose gets warm.

89
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,621
You have a crush
on someone, right?

90
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,771
Get lost.

91
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,432
Go and study.

92
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,541
Smoking insolently
in front of a senior.

93
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:50,644
You're only a year older.

94
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,911
Move, you asshole.

95
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,410
Here! Quick, fuck!

96
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,324
- Hey! Hey!
- Buzz off!

97
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,591
You fucking bastard!

98
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,126
Stop right there!

99
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:42,959
Hey!

100
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,631
Stop!

101
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,840
Get him!

102
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,911
Hurry up!

103
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,146
Han Gi-woong!

104
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,649
Where the hell did he go?

105
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,357
Come out, you shit!

106
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,857
Hey!

107
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,629
Han Gi-woong!

108
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,899
Hey!

109
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,893
Where are you hiding like a rat?

110
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,387
Come on out!

111
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,523
Come out!

112
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,705
Give it back.

113
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,377
I'll shout.

114
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,995
Damn you freaking shit.

115
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,122
Damn thief.

116
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,221
Does it hurt?

117
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,228
Hurts, huh?

118
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,996
You took it,

119
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,477
but I'm taking it back.

120
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,466
Gi-woong!

121
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,231
Han Gi-woong!

122
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,178
Gi-woong!

123
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,721
Han Gi-woong!

124
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,568
Han Gi-woong!

125
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,367
Where is it?

126
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,440
Where is it, I say!

127
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,211
Give me my bike or I'll report
this hires minors.

128
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,723
What did you Just say, asshole?

129
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,430
You little!

130
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,723
I'll get going.

131
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,197
Hey, you shithead!

132
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,332
Who's that small fry?

133
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,861
You prick!

134
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,855
Told you not to smoke
in front of the shop.

135
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,069
He's not at the
cheap dorms, either?

136
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,139
Ow, that stings.
Freaking mosquitos.

137
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,509
See you later, boss.

138
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,646
Take your flip-flop,
you idiots.

139
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,670
Yes, sir!

140
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,614
Why are you looking for him?
Said he was released 3 months ago.

141
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,516
Just...

142
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,482
Just, my ass.

143
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,252
It's all out of your wage.

144
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,792
Who the hell is he?

145
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:56,031
You nailed lip bastard.

146
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,433
Just wait a few more days.

147
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,064
Fuck, get the phone!

148
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,410
I made breakfast,
so eat before you go.

149
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,025
You should attend school.

150
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,741
We're moving next month.

151
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,292
These idiots tried to lynch
Gi-woong on Saturday.

152
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:57,888
Heard one of them went to ER
scalded by ramen.

153
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,532
If I had my hands
on those shitheads.

154
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,161
Stupid assholes,
bandaged like a freaking mummy.

155
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,664
Hey, punching machine!

156
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,512
Guten Morgen!

157
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,849
Good morning!

158
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,179
Good morning, you shit.

159
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,091
Good morning.

160
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,794
Wanna smoke?

161
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,396
You paid for it.

162
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:43,337
Then again, you shouldn't.
We don't want you broken.

163
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,780
You know, Yong-Ju here
was looking around for you.

164
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,945
Yeah, I sold off his bike.

165
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,125
What? He had an expensive one.

166
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,828
How much did you get?

167
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,764
Wash it clean, you bastard!

168
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,970
Wasn't Gi-woong...

169
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,071
Just a dickhead in Junior high?

170
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,238
His dad...

171
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,211
You know what they mean by

172
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,989
a punching machine?

173
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,419
How the fuck would I know?

174
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,795
Hey, Yong-Ju!

175
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,659
Answer your goddamn phone!

176
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,433
One-on-one! It's your turn.

177
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,779
Yong-Ju.

178
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:05,182
You're in grade tier 1, but your
recent scores are a bit risky.

179
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,525
You know we're creating an
honors class next week, right?

180
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,359
To focus on English and Math,
so let's raise your scores a bit.

181
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,533
Sir.

182
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,370
Why? You have something
to say?

183
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,402
Haven't had lunch?

184
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,573
A friend is...

185
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,214
being bullied.

186
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,362
There's no time for friends now.

187
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,193
Just study.

188
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,507
Get back.

189
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,407
Why are you taking pictures?

190
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:40,247
Did I mention that this
used to be a gay bar?

191
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,278
It got reported coz it's
near a school.

192
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,985
Why did they build it in
such a high place?

193
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,591
Have you...

194
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,967
met a straight before?

195
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,525
Why?

196
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,396
Just curious...

197
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,672
How would the bitches know
if they are straight?

198
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,576
Coz they have girlfriends.

199
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,086
How would they know until
they've slept with me?

200
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,825
Do they know how I taste?
A taste of me?

201
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,015
So, there really is someone...

202
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,087
Did you confess?

203
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:11,441
Don't ever confess if he'd puke.

204
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,740
Having crushes on a straight is

205
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,345
Iike taking rat poison.

206
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,085
Get it?

207
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,296
You know how much it was?

208
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:18,370
It was $225 with VAT..

209
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,181
Shit, you know your IQ drops
when you get hit?

210
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,081
Goes down by 1.6!

211
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,943
And adolescence is an important time.

212
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,580
It's Just you now.
I'm not scared.

213
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:36,726
Give it!
Hey! Give it!

214
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,197
Give me my bike back.

215
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:46,631
Or I'll report you're working against
the Juvenile Protection law.

216
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,100
I know your phone number now.

217
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,707
Give it back!

218
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:59,642
I will not go
until you return it.

219
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,779
Hey!

220
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,181
And give me 50 cents.

221
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,422
You haven't paid back.

222
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,261
Did you...

223
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,006
really sell it?

224
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,609
Did you sell it off?

225
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:23,390
The place looks expensive.
Did you really sell it here?

226
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,669
Isn't this it?

227
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,331
No.

228
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,041
Fuck, choose whatever!

229
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,868
Who's there?

230
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,610
Stop there!
Who is it?

231
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,715
Wait for me!

232
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,065
You look old now.

233
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,601
You didn't smoke in Junior high.

234
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,254
Still make gliders?

235
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,684
Was it summer?

236
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:36,633
You borrowed 50 cents from me
to buy glue for its wings.

237
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,768
Said you'd pay back
after the mid-terms.

238
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,278
You have a cut on your arm...

239
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,071
From the bike shop, I guess.

240
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,819
What?

241
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,182
Wait up!

242
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,451
What about my bike?

243
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,593
Be responsible.

244
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,526
We didn't get to steal one.

245
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,104
Why do you keep following me?

246
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,498
You stole my bike.

247
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,706
No... why do you keep
sneaking at me?

248
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:32,618
Since Junior high,
why do you keep
sneaking at me?

249
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:42,450
Don't tell... anyone.

250
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,283
Get up when I ask you nicely.

251
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,320
Can I take a day off?
I'm sick.

252
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,490
No, you're not.

253
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,463
You were like this yesterday!

254
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,232
Get up.

255
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,273
Get up!

256
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,121
Are you becoming defiant
coz of me?

257
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,652
What now?

258
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,828
Are you Jealous of the man
I'm seeing?

259
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,769
It's not even the first time.

260
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,735
Did you know that IQ drops
when you get hit?

261
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,942
- And where is your bike?
- Lent it to Gi-taek.

262
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,485
You lend it out for 2 weeks,
while you walk?

263
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,419
Told you, it broke.

264
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,588
My God!

265
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,190
Is this like a voodoo thing?

266
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,966
It must hurt.

267
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,502
Is this from school violence
on TV these days?

268
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,272
It's not!

269
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,953
Then why are you like this?
Hardly talking...

270
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,820
Just leave me alone!

271
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,592
Acting like a refugee in winter!

272
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,495
Your kid is your worst enemy.

273
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,291
Hey, refugee!

274
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:09,495
He bought it for you.
It's brand-new.

275
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,175
Hey, kiddo!

276
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,389
Aren't you gonna wish me luck
for my exam today?

277
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,721
You kind bastard!

278
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,931
Come grab some cake later.

279
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:51,976
Social mobility means individuals
or groups in social position...

280
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,891
Minus 2 points, you shit.

281
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,056
In lightspeed, huh?

282
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,859
To minus infinity and beyond?

283
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,832
Look at this bastard...!

284
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,781
Get out! Get out!

285
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,341
Get out of my class!

286
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,355
Get your ass in the teachers' room
after class!

287
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,354
Just because of the fuss on
Student Rights Ordinance,

288
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,755
you all think I won't hit you?

289
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,733
What are human
rights to students?

290
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,699
Isn't studying what matters?

291
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,074
I'll say this again.

292
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,744
Students in grade tiers 1-3
will end up ordering chicken,

293
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,050
Repeat after me! Order...!

294
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,484
Order!

295
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,786
Those in tiers 4-6...

296
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,651
...will fry the chicken!

297
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,189
Those in tiers 7-9...

298
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,487
...will deliver the chicken!

299
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,854
Your scores went up, didn't it?

300
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:18,428
Shit, mine went
down by 5 points.

301
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:31,180
Don't hang around with that
fat bitch friend of yours.

302
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,111
You show your weakness at school
and you're dead.

303
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,660
He's not on our level.

304
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:55,533
And don't mess with Gi-woong, either.
You'll get hurt.

305
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,838
You won't find that bike.

306
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,605
What if I do?

307
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,254
I'll piggyback you every day,
fucking bastard.

308
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,356
Guess you don't know shit
about Gi-woong...

309
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,757
Man, you OK?

310
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:25,833
Fuck, the student director
going berserk in the morning.

311
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,068
The son of a bitch!

312
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,303
Must be true he can't
get his dick up.

313
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,680
He was doing this shit again.

314
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,848
Always sucking on eel extracts.

315
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,578
I saw him piss in the bathroom.

316
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,154
His dick is this small.

317
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,679
Thought it was a mosquito dick.

318
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,258
Come here.

319
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,692
Run over,
you freaking bastard.

320
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:56,064
You asshole, I told you not to wear
high heeled shoes.

321
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,000
Hey, want a cig?

322
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,477
No.

323
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:11,107
Fuck you, god damn
punching machine, try one.

324
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,846
Just get lost, dickhead.

325
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,789
Who's a dickhead?

326
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,279
Crazy bastard!

327
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,891
Just fuck off.

328
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,033
Who cried in the schoolyard?

329
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,295
Shut up!

330
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,770
Get out, you assholes!

331
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,173
Gi-taek!

332
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,036
- Gi-taek!
- Get out!

333
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,578
Get that camera!

334
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:48,379
Gi-taek!

335
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,186
Gi-taek!

336
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,102
Shut the door.

337
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,882
Shut the door, I say!

338
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,818
See Seong-Jin's mom
herding others like a pig?

339
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,843
They call her, "Pig Mom."

340
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:01,720
Teachers and parents obey her coz
she has connections to elite universities.

341
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:08,296
Gi-taek is the victim since
everyone will Just cover this up.

342
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,395
Even his own mom.

343
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,899
Seong-Jin will probably Just get
community service again.

344
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,861
Damn bastard! How many points?

345
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,442
75 points.

346
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:57,039
What? You can't feel
the impact coz of the fat?

347
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,176
Shit. I'll tell Grandma on you...!

348
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,923
What's my score?

349
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,590
85 points.

350
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,494
Fuck.

351
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,103
Only 85 points? It won't get
Seong-Jin in Seoul University.

352
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:25,773
You bastard, I need 95 to be
in grade tier 1.

353
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,173
Let's send Seong-Jin
to college, you bastard.

354
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,377
These Jerks don't remember
unless it hurts.

355
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,485
He needs more beating.

356
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,417
How dare you rat on me.

357
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,521
How many points?

358
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,427
What's he doing here?

359
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,263
- Hey, you!
- Who told you to come here?

360
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,639
What are you doing here?

361
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,843
Freaking bastard, you wanna die?

362
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:00,611
Let go!

363
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,746
You think you're something, huh?

364
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,881
Leave him alone.

365
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,475
Told you not to
hang around here!

366
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,511
You want to be the
punching machine too?

367
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,052
Shut up and get lost, all of you!

368
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,226
Can't hear me?

369
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,589
Fuck, get out, everyone!

370
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,524
Let's go.

371
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,019
Hit me!

372
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,030
Hit me with this.
I'll give you 100 points.

373
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,535
Hit me with the real thing!

374
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,268
We're... friends, aren't we?

375
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,235
- Remember we used to...
- Shut up!

376
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,428
The kid who died last year...

377
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:37,498
Before Jumping off the roof,
he was in the elevator like this.

378
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:42,305
I told mom about him,

379
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,177
and you know what she said?

380
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,413
"Did he get good grades? "

381
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,789
The final episode of Gaia.

382
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,889
It wasn't a happy ending.

383
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,560
The main character dies like a fool.

384
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:14,173
If the world is this shitty,
shouldn't the ending be happy?

385
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,939
What have we done so wrong...

386
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,682
that we can't even laugh at the end?

387
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,984
It means at least we should laugh
because the world is shitty.

388
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:33,057
Bad guys don't laugh.

389
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,062
So we should.

390
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,128
Shouldn't we, fatso?

391
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,197
Stop crying.

392
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,733
Stop.

393
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,373
It's alright.

394
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,211
!

Hush!

395
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,939
Did you call the boys?

396
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:56,074
It's another kid from Ilsin High.

397
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,317
The kid we've been asked to
protect is Gyeong-sik.

398
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,849
His parents are
really concerned.

399
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,850
The police must be lousy
since we get all these Jobs.

400
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,891
Keep it as your wage, kid.

401
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,994
Right?

402
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,301
You'll find him soon,
since the boys are out searching.

403
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,842
Your life is pretty shitty, too.

404
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,014
See you, sir.

405
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,948
Talk to him nicely.

406
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,704
Smile.

407
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,643
Smile, you shit!

408
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,338
You need to keep that smile
on your ugly faces.

409
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,784
If you so much
as touch Gyeong-sik,

410
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,850
I'll kill you...

411
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:21,360
If you go near him,
I'll kill you.

412
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,160
If you report to the police.

413
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,464
I'll stab your mother.

414
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,493
Sophomore at Ilsin High.

415
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,487
Kim Jin-seok.

416
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,696
Don't pick on your friends...

417
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,401
- Aren't you going to answer me?
- Yes.

418
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,365
Let's never meet again...

419
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:04,932
Beat it!

420
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,177
Live right, you bastards.

421
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,103
See you tomorrow.

422
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,107
See ya.

423
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,405
You'll definitely pass.

424
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:40,210
I think I made it.
But Just barely.

425
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,677
Congratulations.

426
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,748
Delivery.

427
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,250
Delivery!

428
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,361
The money is inside.

429
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,869
Or you can go if you want.

430
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,245
Do you know
how late you are?

431
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,246
I should make a complaint.

432
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,925
My wallet's inside.

433
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:23,341
What a shitty service.
Is that how you're trained?

434
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:28,706
Eat.

435
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,187
I'll pay you then.

436
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,735
Eat up the crusts too.

437
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,877
I got your name...

438
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,024
back then.

439
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,295
I'm Shin Yong-Ju.

440
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,441
Han Gi-woong.

441
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:32,017
Don't know about the others,
but you don't scare me.

442
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,600
I still have this.

443
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,571
Don't worry.

444
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,072
Have them on digital files...

445
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,584
You like me?

446
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,156
Crazy bastard.

447
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,662
Don't you come near me.

448
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,774
I'll kill you.

449
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,378
Han Gi-woong.

450
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,216
Take this.

451
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,669
Just like old days.

452
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,744
Just like then.

453
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,084
Know what?

454
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,988
When Mongolians
like someone, they say,

455
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,985
"Let's go to the
mountain together."

456
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:29,337
And Eskimos say,
"Let's laugh together."

457
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,871
It's corny.

458
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,873
But, isn't it nice and short?

459
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:51,860
But then, you don't even know
how to smile.

460
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,122
Thanks...

461
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,123
for coming with me.

462
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,894
That girl...

463
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,104
is she your girlfriend?

464
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,698
Gi-woong!

465
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:51,031
Han Gi-woong!

466
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:15,697
Okay, I'll call you back.
I will!

467
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,097
Why are you so late?

468
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,881
Why didn't you turn on
the light?

469
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,782
- Don't turn it on.
- Why not?

470
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,179
Just leave it and get out!

471
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,819
Why are you yelling?

472
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,823
Your words
are thorny these days.

473
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,394
What is the matter with you?

474
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,629
Talk, for goodness' sake.

475
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,797
My situation is enough of
a thriller as it is.

476
01:07:56,105 --> 01:08:01,133
Do you tell me everything?
You live the way you want.

477
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,709
What did I say?

478
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:10,380
You can live your life
the way you want it.

479
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,708
You must be going through
puberty again.

480
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,020
That's shitty.

481
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,120
Better than menopause.

482
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,388
What would you know...

483
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,822
You think flowers
only bloom in spring?

484
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,399
They bloom in autumn, too.

485
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:20,578
Han Gi-woong.

486
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,149
Absent again?

487
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,158
It's the fourth day already.

488
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,898
Class president.

489
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:29,956
Yes, sir.

490
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,569
Contact him. One more absence
and he's expelled.

491
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,999
Absence counts as 2 points.
Don't miss school.

492
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,033
Just bear it for 3 more months.

493
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,946
You all know about the honors class
that starts today, huh?

494
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:52,386
Those of you in the honors,
go to classroom 2.

495
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,890
It's based on your grades.
You think it's unfair?

496
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,128
Then study.

497
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:02,992
OK, get moving.

498
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:13,097
It's like an exodus.

499
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,701
Is this a wrecked ship?

500
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,865
- Aren't you going?
- I'm coming.

501
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,547
What are you doing here?

502
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,413
I'm busy. You go ahead.

503
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:03,149
He should help since he got me into
school service as punishment.

504
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,111
Hey, pick it up.

505
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,248
Pick it up, quick!

506
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:48,333
You do that on the next exams,
then you write your will that day.

507
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,242
You shithead! I fell one grade tier
because of you!

508
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:10,354
Must feel good
about your grades.

509
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:14,527
Have you grown taller too?

510
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,332
Where did you get your bike?

511
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,002
Was it Gi-woong?

512
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,612
Why should I tell you!

513
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,363
Aren't you going?

514
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,338
This is better...

515
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,508
It's not like that bastard will
die of stomach ulcers...

516
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,180
You go ahead.

517
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,070
What's with that Jerk now?

518
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,308
What's the matter?

519
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:18,970
Jeez!

520
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,913
You really wanna do it?

521
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:36,495
Told you not to take
rat poison.

522
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:40,531
Think I don't have any pride?

523
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,971
So, did the bastard...

524
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,909
puke when you confessed?

525
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:02,448
Don't do it
if you're not confident.

526
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,558
Watch out for rumors.

527
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:11,057
Am I some toy to you?

528
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,430
I'm transferring...

529
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,483
Mom says she'll die of shame.

530
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,680
Wants me to transfer far away.

531
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:38,820
My teacher ratted on me to Mom.

532
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,564
Damn.

533
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,063
I can't even take part
in the school festival now.

534
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:57,369
Then again, it's not the first time.

535
01:16:58,747 --> 01:16:59,907
Huh?

536
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:07,955
The power's back.

537
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,087
So pretty...!

538
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,295
Been here for 3 months

539
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,204
and never seen it so lively.

540
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:35,976
NIGHT FLIGHT

541
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:40,851
Guess it'll be hard to visit here.

542
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,686
Hard to see you.

543
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,597
Wanna go... take a shit?

544
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,713
Let's Just go.

545
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:14,522
What if we get caught?

546
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,050
So what?

547
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,718
I'm through with this school now.

548
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:29,035
This will surprise them.

549
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,839
Homeroom teacher, the eunuch.

550
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:36,334
Have eunuch bastards for
generations to come.

551
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:41,748
You think... you're the
only one with a mouth?

552
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,274
Who's there!

553
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,387
Hey!

554
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,885
HERE TOO

555
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,258
- Stop right there!
- Don't follow.

556
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:51,460
Stop right there!

557
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,860
Run, honey!

558
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,199
Run like hell!

559
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:05,769
Run, run!

560
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,647
Be careful...

561
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,242
Right here.

562
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:24,619
Oh, my back...!

563
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:28,290
Haven't used it for too long.

564
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:45,172
See you over the break.

565
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:01,628
Jun-woo.

566
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,632
Song Jun-woo!

567
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:23,074
Don't you do it.

568
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,376
Don't you turn your back on me.

569
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:04,148
Was seen there yesterday.

570
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,388
But that's all.

571
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:11,096
Good luck.

572
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,130
My only weak point is,
I'm too soft.

573
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,038
Where are you off to now?
Wait for me.

574
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,646
Why? You're gonna run off again?

575
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:35,589
Fuck, what's the matter
with you these days?

576
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:38,926
Tell that small fry bastard,
that I'll kill him!

577
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:42,759
- Come. Let's go.
- Let go, let go.

578
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,095
Where the hell have you been?

579
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:01,107
The school will kick you out
if you don't come and write a pledge.

580
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:14,426
You know how much I looked for you?

581
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:19,529
You'll come to school, right?

582
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,937
I get nervous without you.

583
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,500
The bastards act up like shit.

584
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,414
Can't focus on my studies, either...

585
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,573
Who would I trust except you?

586
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,221
Am I your mom?

587
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:06,079
REHIRE LAID-OFF WORKERS
IMMEDIATELY

588
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,452
Where did Han Sang-gi go?

589
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,218
Where is he?

590
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:22,957
You must know, you were his friend.

591
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:24,958
Let go, damn.

592
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,657
You would know where he is!

593
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:30,598
I said, let go!

594
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:39,812
Why do you pretend you don't know.
He was your leader!

595
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,308
Where is he?!

596
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:45,720
Not talking?
I know he was here.

597
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,123
- Stop it!
- Don't pretend you don't know!

598
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,887
- We don't know, either!
- Bring him now!

599
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:55,892
- We can't do anything here!
- I'm not going, fuck!

600
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,855
Bring him here!

601
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:00,967
Bring him now!

602
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:05,000
Please calm down!

603
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,308
Bring back the son of a bitch!

604
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:10,436
Bring Han Sang-gi! Now!

605
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:02,946
Hey, Han Gi-woong!

606
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:06,452
Coming and going as you please.

607
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:14,096
Go see the student director
right now.

608
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,436
Now!

609
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,650
Shin Yong-Ju...

610
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,216
Yes, sir?

611
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:45,127
Write the pledge if you
don't want to be kicked out.

612
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:55,300
Am I a Joke to you?
I was in the Marine Corp.

613
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:58,135
Start writing!

614
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,641
Are you getting
fresh with me now?

615
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:06,985
Think I haven't seen
bastards like you before?

616
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,753
Why don't you Just drop out?

617
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:16,555
Instead of ruining the
academic atmosphere.

618
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:33,072
Mr. Yi, must be tough
with these idiots.

619
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:41,683
Come see me at the
teachers' office later.

620
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:47,424
Come here.

621
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:57,662
Sit down.

622
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,945
Don't you have
something to tell me?

623
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:10,277
You're wearing glasses, sir.

624
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:15,520
You feel like Joking at a
time like this?

625
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,656
This came from the other school.

626
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:25,529
The teachers'
office is in an uproar.

627
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,642
What are you going to do?

628
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,679
Are you...

629
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,380
a gay, too?

630
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:11,011
Just promise me one thing.

631
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,742
Get into Seoul University.

632
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:20,149
Nothing else matters.

633
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:27,818
Go back to class.

634
01:29:56,758 --> 01:30:01,457
In extreme cases,
sexual assaults or murder.

635
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,961
They say they followed
what they saw on film or TV.

636
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,259
Who's fault is it?

637
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:11,797
Adolescents follow stars and trends.

638
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:21,114
Clothes, bags, shoes that stars wear
on TV become sold out.

639
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:28,614
Why are you still on page 69?
Everyone else is on page 70.

640
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,725
You like 69, don't you?

641
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,961
He watches porn every day.

642
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:35,792
"I'm coming! " "I'm coming! "

643
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,331
Be quiet!

644
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:45,570
Should you be watching porn
and Jerking off?

645
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,331
Just go to college.

646
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:51,169
Then no one will care
whatever you do.

647
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,209
Bastards.

648
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:57,883
You know what?

649
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:03,419
I heard a bastard at our school
is a homo...

650
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,094
Heard he's in this class.

651
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,760
Who is it?

652
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:13,696
How disgusting...!

653
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:17,996
Guess someone will end up
with a male daughter-in-law.

654
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:24,479
Cut the shit and Just
study hard, got it?

655
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,003
Yes, sir.

656
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:29,550
And go to church on weekends
and pray hard, got that?

657
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,177
Yes, sir.

658
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,490
Attention, salute the teacher.

659
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,824
Thank you, sir.

660
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,314
t's you right.

661
01:31:41,128 --> 01:31:43,289
It's okay, you're my pal.

662
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:46,732
He's been fishy.

663
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,567
- Is it you?
- No, way!

664
01:31:51,806 --> 01:31:54,468
- Is it you?
- No!

665
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:04,477
Which bastard is it?
What if he has AIDS?

666
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:58,123
Run away with me.

667
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:06,429
I'm so scared.

668
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:25,123
Know where the southernmost
train station is?

669
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:32,297
It's Yeosu.
I thought it was Busan.

670
01:34:33,868 --> 01:34:36,359
The last train leaves

671
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:41,602
at 8 o'clock.

672
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:03,460
They say if it leaves four trails...
it's an airliner.

673
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:08,767
If it leaves two,
it's a fighter Jet.

674
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:14,033
Damn, this is shitty.

675
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,193
Don't you...

676
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:37,792
get lonely?

677
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:47,006
Han Gi-woong!

678
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:06,791
Heard they'll tear down this place
next week.

679
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:12,928
Should we leave it on?

680
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:30,774
Turning your back to me
even to the end.

681
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:51,570
Go away.

682
01:36:57,812 --> 01:36:59,780
What are you... to me?

683
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:03,641
Can't you...

684
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:07,377
Just smile for me?

685
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:15,027
So stupid.

686
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:17,520
Yeah.

687
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:22,024
So I'll never look at you again,

688
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:25,165
never call your name again,

689
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,775
never remember a bastard
like you,

690
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:36,277
not even for a second.

691
01:38:12,686 --> 01:38:15,086
Guess I'll find someone again.

692
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:25,295
This world is over
without a friend.

693
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:38,234
Although you'll never know.

694
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:17,878
My son.

695
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:22,013
Who never answers
the goddamn phone.

696
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:31,987
Perhaps you might know
the taste of alcohol by now.

697
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:34,624
Is this our first time?

698
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:37,165
Did you fail the exam?

699
01:39:37,338 --> 01:39:40,933
Kiddo, your mom's a genius.

700
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:43,577
You think I'd fail something like
the housing exams?

701
01:39:43,577 --> 01:39:45,943
I passed the second round, too.

702
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,540
Then why are you drinking alone?

703
01:39:48,749 --> 01:39:50,478
That's why I called you.

704
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:54,855
Another glass here, please.

705
01:39:54,855 --> 01:39:55,913
Yes.

706
01:40:02,863 --> 01:40:05,058
Is something wrong?

707
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:14,539
The hot news is, your mom's been
dumped again.

708
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,034
It's not the first time,
either, anyway!

709
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:23,039
Drink up, JuJu.
It's okay with your Mom.

710
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:33,127
Any bastard who says 'Love is...
two people standing side by side

711
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:38,463
Iooking in the same direction'
are all freaking crooks.

712
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:46,604
Then drivers rushing on the highway
all fall in love?

713
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,407
What a laugh.

714
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,768
Love is...

715
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:58,013
Iooking at different directions.

716
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:04,485
The bastard couldn't accept
this professional life of mine.

717
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:09,555
Is love a guy's dick?
Turning big or small?

718
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:11,162
Fuck.

719
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:14,324
Hey!

720
01:41:14,802 --> 01:41:16,497
A glass here!

721
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,448
Mom.

722
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:33,213
What?

723
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,746
Do you know...

724
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:39,754
everything about me?

725
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:49,661
How would I know, you bastard.

726
01:41:51,839 --> 01:41:53,966
Did you kill someone?

727
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:04,248
I've learned one thing,

728
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:11,821
by raising a son as
a single unwed mother at 26.

729
01:42:13,026 --> 01:42:18,396
There's nothing stupid as
minding what the world thinks of you.

730
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:28,440
I got no end of scorn and temptation
for being a single mom, you know?

731
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:37,210
I only want you to live
without hurting other people.

732
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:40,710
Don't care about studies and all.

733
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:43,753
That's all I want.

734
01:42:44,091 --> 01:42:45,956
Even if...

735
01:42:47,628 --> 01:42:50,756
I'm different from other people?

736
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:03,434
Shin Yong-Ju!

737
01:43:04,645 --> 01:43:06,875
Who gave birth to you?

738
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:10,975
Does that fact change,

739
01:43:11,285 --> 01:43:17,121
even if you grow
goblin horns on your head?

740
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:48,454
When are you packing?

741
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:22,880
He's doing well?

742
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,459
What does it matter?

743
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:41,439
He can't come home because of
police surveillance.

744
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:47,740
Not embarrassed that labor union
bastards gave him the cold shoulder?

745
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:49,942
Criminal bastard.

746
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:55,005
You're here early.

747
01:46:07,728 --> 01:46:09,229
Good morning.

748
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:10,457
Hi.

749
01:46:29,182 --> 01:46:33,778
'Good Neighbor policy' was taken for
Southeast Asian countries.

750
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:39,983
Underline 'Good Neighbor policy'
it's frequently asked in the tests.

751
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:45,390
When Japanese pirates become rampant
at the end of Koryo until early Chosun,

752
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:50,737
Chosun reinforced its naval forces,
and built mass warships.

753
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:56,835
And the gunpowder weapons were
developed by...?

754
01:46:57,611 --> 01:47:02,412
Choe Museon. How many times
did I tell you?

755
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:23,100
Hey, homo!

756
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:26,332
Where're you going?

757
01:47:27,474 --> 01:47:29,567
I heard you're the gay king?

758
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:32,479
I really like gays, too.

759
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:33,810
Get out.

760
01:47:34,414 --> 01:47:35,415
Get out!

761
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:37,849
Get lost. Fucking bastards!

762
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:41,985
Get out now,
before I bash your skulls!

763
01:47:48,628 --> 01:47:52,621
I hear you're a pro
at this, Yong-Ju.

764
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:57,832
Suck mine, too.

765
01:47:58,238 --> 01:47:59,603
You homo bastard!

766
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,498
Fuck.

767
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:04,305
It was like a hidden picture puzzle.

768
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,977
Wondered who it was...
in our class.

769
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,643
Does your grandma know, too?

770
01:48:11,451 --> 01:48:13,009
Who says so?

771
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:16,379
This friend here...

772
01:48:17,123 --> 01:48:18,317
No?

773
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:21,687
No... Jerks.

774
01:48:22,796 --> 01:48:24,364
Where do you think you're going?

775
01:48:24,364 --> 01:48:27,856
Suck mine, too,
you fucking bastard!

776
01:48:28,068 --> 01:48:30,670
Stay still, you dirty asshole.

777
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,228
You like that?

778
01:48:35,976 --> 01:48:37,170
Stay still.

779
01:48:37,811 --> 01:48:39,972
Hey, get the fuck out.

780
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:42,883
Told you to stay still.

781
01:48:42,883 --> 01:48:47,217
Heard Gi-taek
witnessed yesterday.

782
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:53,356
I wonder what this is.

783
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:01,258
You know what schwul
in German means?

784
01:49:02,769 --> 01:49:04,600
Schwul.

785
01:49:05,438 --> 01:49:09,534
Ho, mo, sex, ual.

786
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:12,112
I even like the sound of it.

787
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:14,342
Homo Schwul bastard.

788
01:49:14,748 --> 01:49:16,238
Let him go.

789
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:18,378
Get up.

790
01:49:25,659 --> 01:49:26,990
Yong-Ju.

791
01:49:28,528 --> 01:49:33,124
Friends wouldn't spread rumors
or anything, right?

792
01:49:37,837 --> 01:49:39,134
And...

793
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:48,674
Iower yourself a bit
when you talk to people.

794
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,011
Fucking bastard.

795
01:49:54,688 --> 01:49:56,815
Because this is your eye level.

796
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:01,587
Hey, let's go.

797
01:50:04,364 --> 01:50:08,528
See you tomorrow, homo.

798
01:50:20,814 --> 01:50:24,150
You're the one
who betrayed first!

799
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:25,913
What betrayal?

800
01:50:27,887 --> 01:50:29,354
Disgusting.

801
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:32,986
You and Gi-woong both!

802
01:50:35,729 --> 01:50:39,028
Gi-taek!

803
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:06,451
Hey, Han Gi-woong!

804
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:22,498
Why so cold?

805
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:31,279
I'm beginning to forget your face.

806
01:51:37,123 --> 01:51:41,059
Gi-taek's our friend now.
It's about time.

807
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:48,698
You and Yong-Ju aren't
like that, huh?

808
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,502
There's been such a rumor.

809
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:07,410
Our leader shouldn't be
like that, right?

810
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:20,357
Of course you aren't, right?

811
01:52:22,368 --> 01:52:24,996
I have a question.

812
01:52:26,339 --> 01:52:31,140
This guy set a factory on fire
and went to Jail several years ago.

813
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:38,144
Someone you know?

814
01:52:39,486 --> 01:52:40,919
No, right?

815
01:52:43,289 --> 01:52:47,749
Can't have the school look bad
with low-income classes.

816
01:52:55,201 --> 01:53:00,571
Don't come near me!
It's your freaking dad!

817
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,711
You cried after getting beaten
by kids in Junior high.

818
01:53:04,711 --> 01:53:05,973
Didn't you?

819
01:53:06,279 --> 01:53:10,113
Teachers didn't like you either,
so they spread a rumor at school!

820
01:53:18,424 --> 01:53:21,621
What did I do so wrong?

821
01:53:23,563 --> 01:53:25,793
That you all bully me?

822
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:57,796
Do you deliver chicken, too?
Bring some here if you have time.

823
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:02,023
You're coming to school tomorrow?

824
01:54:09,876 --> 01:54:12,902
Fuck, hit me!
Hit me, you son of a bitch!

825
01:54:13,112 --> 01:54:14,670
You betrayed me first!

826
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:23,547
I was never... your friend.

827
01:54:31,664 --> 01:54:34,098
Let go! Fuck...

828
01:55:11,604 --> 01:55:13,094
Excuse me.

829
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:50,001
How did you find me?

830
01:55:52,145 --> 01:55:54,136
Why did you come out?

831
01:55:56,349 --> 01:55:58,681
To set this place on fire?

832
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:11,920
You know how
Mom and I've been living?

833
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:16,167
Why did you do it? Why?

834
01:56:18,104 --> 01:56:22,200
You know how I've been living
all because of your high horse?

835
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,449
Damn, why did you do it?

836
01:56:39,158 --> 01:56:45,154
You've grown a lot.
Should've bought a razor.

837
01:56:55,708 --> 01:56:57,505
Gi-woong!

838
01:56:58,111 --> 01:56:59,271
Gi-woong!

839
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:02,374
Gi-woong!

840
01:57:02,982 --> 01:57:04,347
Han Gi-woong!

841
01:57:06,619 --> 01:57:08,018
Fuck, let go!

842
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:22,468
I'm sorry.

843
01:57:36,616 --> 01:57:39,380
Thought you were dead.

844
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:45,582
Don't die on us.

845
01:58:43,483 --> 01:58:44,984
Nothing but a dickhead.

846
01:58:44,984 --> 01:58:46,952
Out of my way!

847
01:59:08,941 --> 01:59:10,340
Gi-woong, you okay?

848
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:32,524
Gi-woong.

849
01:59:52,285 --> 01:59:53,718
Fuck off.

850
02:00:01,127 --> 02:00:02,822
Gi-woong!

851
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:08,892
Han Gi-woong!

852
02:03:11,717 --> 02:03:13,810
Aren't you packing?

853
02:03:18,724 --> 02:03:23,286
We aren't moving anyway.

854
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:54,525
I made breakfast.

855
02:03:55,895 --> 02:03:57,590
Let's eat.

856
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:19,751
Hey, stop right there!

857
02:04:22,688 --> 02:04:25,213
Son of a bitch, stop!

858
02:04:26,091 --> 02:04:28,924
Hey, stop right there bitch!

859
02:04:33,032 --> 02:04:34,897
Come here.

860
02:04:40,873 --> 02:04:44,400
Thanks for the damn
morning exercise.

861
02:04:44,777 --> 02:04:47,439
Damn bitch,
think you can run away?

862
02:04:49,515 --> 02:04:52,279
Seong-Jin!

863
02:04:53,652 --> 02:04:57,088
- Come down you asshole.
- Let go!

864
02:05:29,154 --> 02:05:32,055
Careful with that taser!

865
02:05:35,728 --> 02:05:39,926
Didn't I tell you not to
challenge me?

866
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:42,301
Bring the bastard's camera!

867
02:05:42,301 --> 02:05:44,565
Relax, you shit.

868
02:05:45,371 --> 02:05:46,804
Gi-taek!

869
02:05:47,406 --> 02:05:49,101
Shut up, you bitch.

870
02:05:50,676 --> 02:05:53,611
Shoot it nice and quick.
I'll put it up on Youtube.

871
02:05:56,849 --> 02:05:57,816
Like it?

872
02:06:00,486 --> 02:06:01,680
Like it?!

873
02:06:04,089 --> 02:06:06,353
Hey, you bitch!

874
02:06:07,826 --> 02:06:10,727
Like it? Huh?

875
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,907
Han Gi-woong!

876
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:28,974
Yong-Ju...

877
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:05,983
Yong-Ju!

878
02:07:07,653 --> 02:07:09,211
Shin Yong-Ju!

879
02:07:11,724 --> 02:07:13,385
Shin Yong-Ju!

880
02:08:23,195 --> 02:08:24,822
Yong-Ju!

881
02:08:44,683 --> 02:08:47,311
They even took the memory chip.

882
02:08:48,153 --> 02:08:51,589
This cost $100 without VAT....

883
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:16,341
Don't you...

884
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:20,543
come near me, either.

885
02:09:26,458 --> 02:09:27,857
Fuck off.

886
02:09:56,488 --> 02:09:59,582
We'll learn about
radical root today.

887
02:09:59,992 --> 02:10:03,393
First question. Sigma kay...

888
02:10:05,397 --> 02:10:08,298
That bastard always comes
in the middle of class.

889
02:10:09,902 --> 02:10:11,335
Take your seat now!

890
02:10:11,937 --> 02:10:13,131
Sit down now!

891
02:10:13,772 --> 02:10:14,830
Where is it?

892
02:10:16,208 --> 02:10:18,699
- What is?
- Bastard, late and all...

893
02:10:20,979 --> 02:10:22,606
Stop it!

894
02:10:25,017 --> 02:10:26,006
Sit!

895
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:29,087
- Sit down!
- Where is it, bastard!

896
02:10:29,421 --> 02:10:30,149
Stop it!

897
02:10:35,727 --> 02:10:38,252
Let go, son of a bitch!

898
02:10:38,530 --> 02:10:39,690
Give it back!

899
02:10:43,502 --> 02:10:45,402
You shit!

900
02:10:57,516 --> 02:11:00,576
Han Gi-woong!
You fucking bastard!

901
02:11:07,259 --> 02:11:08,783
Where is it?

902
02:11:10,229 --> 02:11:11,992
Where the hell is it!

903
02:11:15,567 --> 02:11:18,400
I have nothing...

904
02:11:44,529 --> 02:11:45,931
What's this?

905
02:11:45,931 --> 02:11:48,991
What are you doing in
the honors class? Get out!

906
02:11:49,601 --> 02:11:50,795
Give it back.

907
02:11:50,969 --> 02:11:52,137
Give what?

908
02:11:52,137 --> 02:11:54,833
Fuck, give it!

909
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:58,141
Get out you crazy shit!

910
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:06,817
You bastard!

911
02:12:08,954 --> 02:12:12,082
Give it back,
you son of a bitch!

912
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:16,093
Fuck...!

913
02:12:23,235 --> 02:12:24,759
Son of bitch...!

914
02:12:27,506 --> 02:12:29,940
Fuck, give it back,
dammit!

915
02:12:36,048 --> 02:12:37,413
Fuck!

916
02:12:47,893 --> 02:12:49,554
Fucking bastard...

917
02:12:53,065 --> 02:12:57,024
Think you can still run away?

918
02:13:20,025 --> 02:13:21,720
Han Gi-woong!

919
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,184
Bastard!

920
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:25,831
What the hell are you doing?

921
02:13:25,831 --> 02:13:27,492
Fuck!

922
02:13:56,061 --> 02:13:57,195
Stop it!

923
02:13:57,195 --> 02:13:58,430
Stop!

924
02:13:58,430 --> 02:13:59,021
No!

925
02:14:02,401 --> 02:14:04,028
Gi-woong!

926
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:10,704
Call an ambulance,
an ambulance!

927
02:14:13,645 --> 02:14:15,806
Call an ambulance.

928
02:14:55,353 --> 02:14:57,116
What are you going to do now?

929
02:14:57,389 --> 02:14:59,186
Are you transferring?

930
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:02,849
Dropping out.

931
02:15:06,865 --> 02:15:09,390
Why didn't you report earlier?

932
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:15,906
How would that help?

933
02:15:42,267 --> 02:15:45,794
What is he doing?
Is he nuts or something?

934
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:50,601
- Must be crazy...
- Isn't he the one...?

935
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:52,978
You crazy bastard!
Get down now!

936
02:15:52,978 --> 02:15:54,411
Hey! You son of a bitch!

937
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:57,315
Get down, get down!

938
02:15:57,315 --> 02:16:00,944
Get down, I say!

939
02:16:01,186 --> 02:16:03,620
Get down, you bastard!

940
02:16:04,289 --> 02:16:07,156
What the hell are you doing
to the school building?

941
02:16:07,526 --> 02:16:08,660
You wacko.

942
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:11,458
Erase it all before you go.

943
02:16:13,832 --> 02:16:16,733
Crazy bastard.

944
02:16:19,671 --> 02:16:21,639
Go up and erase it.

945
02:16:22,507 --> 02:16:24,668
Erase it, hurry!

946
02:16:25,877 --> 02:16:27,879
A GAY LIVES HERE TOO

947
02:16:27,879 --> 02:16:29,938
Go bring a teacher.

948
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:38,348
Even if they settle...

949
02:17:40,018 --> 02:17:43,283
you'd have to do time
for about 5 months.

950
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,024
I'm sorry.

951
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:01,872
For not coming sooner.

952
02:18:06,544 --> 02:18:09,104
It's in my pants pocket.

953
02:19:19,050 --> 02:19:20,984
Look it's so freaking gross.

954
02:19:43,074 --> 02:19:47,101
I dropped out today.

955
02:19:51,182 --> 02:19:53,912
I'm going to an alternative school
in the provinces.

956
02:20:02,193 --> 02:20:04,991
It's a school in a mountain.

957
02:20:06,865 --> 02:20:09,231
Gandhi School.

958
02:20:12,036 --> 02:20:14,470
They have dorms...

959
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:21,044
Don't go.

960
02:20:23,181 --> 02:20:25,308
It's so hard...

961
02:20:29,154 --> 02:20:32,021
I think I'll break down.

962
02:20:36,428 --> 02:20:39,556
- Never again...
- Never again.

963
02:20:44,969 --> 02:20:46,334
Please...

964
02:20:55,747 --> 02:20:58,910
I'm fucking lonely.
