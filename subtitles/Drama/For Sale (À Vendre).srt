Yeah.

Really, Candace?

Okay, so what
was I going to do?

189
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,641
Was I going to move to L.A.
with him and his girlfriend?

(Dedra) Kat, you let the

I mean, you could've salvaged
that relationship.

(Katherine) Okay, my relationship
with my husband was unsalvageable.

I think I have something special
with this young man.

(Dedra)
No, you don't.

200

It's just physical,
pure and simple.

And you know it is,

202

taken him nowhere in public.

free studio time.

(Dedra)
I heard you.

326
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,133

got an attitude with me?

(Keily)
Hm, I don't know.

328

(Carlton)
You know what?

(Keily)
What do you want, Carlton?

334

Why'd you come here?

335
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,605

No, it wasn't.

343
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,254
(Keily) Well, then I was
probably talking to my aunt.

How would you possibly know

how long I was talking
on the phone anyway?

351
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,935
(Carlton) Because I
called the phone company.

And between the hours
of 9:37 and 11:16,

selective to what gigs that we take.

00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,577
And doing a free show

463
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,324
I'll print out the flyers
on my computer.

464
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,328
(Trey)
That's cool.

465
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,262
So I'll start posting them up
around town.

466
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,356
<i>(Vince)</i>
<i>Hey, but check it out.</i>

467
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,730
We only got one artist.

468
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,928
What you want me
to put on the flyer?

469
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:17,935
(Trey)
Know what?

470
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,062
I'll think of something,
all right?

471
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,071
I'll see you in a minute.

472
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,837
[woman singing]
I have never been stronger.

473
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,707
(Keily)
I'm ready to go home.

474
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:35,152
(Carlton) Could we please
finish a conversation for once?

475
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,247
(Keily) I knew I shouldn't
have left with you.

476
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:38,256
(Carlton)
Girl, I'm your man.

477
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,691
You are always supposed to stand
by my side, no matter what.

478
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,284
(Keily)
Oh, beside you.

479
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,728
Yeah, what you mean
is behind you.

480
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,029
I'm ready to go home now,
Carlton.

481
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:53,334
(Carlton) Sweetheart,
just answer one question.

482
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,930
(Keily)
What is it?

483
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,100
(Carlton)
Be honest.

484
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,610
Who were you talking to
on the phone for almost two hours?

485
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,908
Sweetheart, if you answer that,
I'll take you home.

486
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,676
(Keily)
You know what?

487
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,478
I'll walk.

488
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,348
(Carlton)
What do you think you...

489
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,915
Just answer my question!

490
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,049
(Keily)
You are hurting my arm.

491
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,057
(Carlton)
You cheating on me.

492
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,822
Look, Keily,
I'm sorry, okay?

493
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,193
But, baby, I just can't
bear the thought

494
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,322
of somebody else
being with you.

495
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,592
<i>(Keily)</i>
<i>You are suffocating me.</i>

496
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,533
Can't you see that?

497
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,695
I've had enough,
and I need a break.

498
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,703
Can you understand that?

499
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,704
(Carlton)
Are you serious?

500
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,708
You need a break from me?

501
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,505
Look, I don't know
who this guy is,

502
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,510
but you're getting ready

503
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,547
to lose the best thing
that ever happened to you.

504
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,047
(Keily)
The best thing?

505
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,313
I pray to God that this
is not the best that I can do.

506
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,752
(Carlton) I tried to give
you a chance to tell me,

507
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,188
but I already know
who you were talking to.

508
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,419
Give me this scarf I bought.

509
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,019
Walk, whore.

510
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:53,122
[woman singing] I done
never been strong as I am.

511
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,963
(Carlton) And tell Trey I said hi.

512
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:59,631
[woman singing] Could've never
written this song that I can.

513
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:03,642
'Cause of you,
now I'm labeled a stand away...

514
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,075
(Katherine)
Keily?

515
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,840
Is that you?

516
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:07,937
(Keily)
Oh, hey.

517
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,949
(Katherine)
Are you crying?

518
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,245
Get in the car.

519
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,483
Come on,
get in the car.

520
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,148
What's wrong?

521
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,887
(Keily) I really don't want
to talk about it right now.

522
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:25,625
Well, you know-
you know about Carlton and I.

523
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,894
We've been together since I was
a freshman in high school,

524
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:31,870
and that's basically the only guy
I've ever been with.

525
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,304
It's just that things have been
changing recently,

526
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,605
and he's so manipulative
and possessive.

527
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,144
(Katherine)
Yeah, well, like every man.

528
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,338
Welcome to the real world.

529
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,278
Go on.

530
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,375
(Keily)
Recently, I met a guy.

531
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,680
(Katherine)
Okay.

532
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,277
This is getting good.

533
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,913
<i>(Keily)</i>
<i>He's just a friend.</i>

534
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,957
(Katherine)
Mm-hmm, yeah, right.

535
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,924
A friend.
They all are.

536
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:56,520
(Keily) I really have
feelings for him, and...

537
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,257
you know, I...

538
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,528
Carlton somehow found out
that we talked, all right?

539
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,263
How he knows,
I have no clue.

540
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,567
But it's like he's a stalker.

541
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,938
He put a bug
on my phone or something.

542
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,807
This boy, tell me
how you feel about him.

543
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,870
(Keily) Well, I fantasize
about him all the time.

544
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:22,013
Well, you know, I'm kind of
going through the same thing.

545
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,646
[laughs]

546
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,056
You know, I mean,
I think I really love this guy,

547
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:30,688
but we just don't have
anything in common.

548
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:31,696
(Keily)
Oh, really?

549
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:32,697
(Katherine)
Yeah.

550
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:36,395
I mean,
the sex is outrageous.

551
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,561
[both laugh]

552
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,697
(Katherine) But, you know,
I'm old enough to realize

553
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,106
that sex doesn't define
a relationship.

554
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,108
(Keily)
Very true.

555
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,201
You know,
Carlton and I,

556
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:48,247
we stopped having sex about,
what, a month ago,

557
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,044
because we just
don't have a connection anymore.

558
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,380
It sucks.

559
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,216
(Katherine)
Trey.

560
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,346
<i>Hey.</i>

561
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,720
(Trey)
Hello, Miss Katherine.

562
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,191
(Katherine)
Miss Katherine?

563
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,249
(Trey)
Hi, Keily.

564
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,955
(Keily)
What are those?

565
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,726
(Trey) These are flyers for the
big party/fundraise on the 23th

566
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,858
that we're having.

Watch this.

00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,300
Featuring No Doubt.

569

(Keily)
Who?

570
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,063
(Vince) I told you they didn't
know who the hell that was.

<i>I told your ass.</i>

Later, man.

00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,711
Y'all don't know
who No Doubt is?

574
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,839
(Keily) That's the one that
goes "Hot water, corn bread,

575
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,680
I said I just got popped
by the feds."

<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:28,686
(Trey)
That's them.

579
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:29,687
(Vince)
Oh, well, in that case,

580
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:31,917
then you can help us out by passing
these around the campus,

581
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,049
'cause all the proceeds

582
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,060
are going to Trey's uncle's
recording studio.

583

They trying to shut it down.

584

Oh, God, they're trying to shut
down Uncle Mack's studio?

585
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,023
(Trey) Yeah, they
trying to shut it down.

586
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,362
But it's all good.

587

Well, you know what?

588
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,902
Listen, I've got some friends.

00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:46,904
Take all of these.

592
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,407
We need as much help
as we can get, ladies.

let Mr. Vickers know

Can I tell you something?

603

No, you go first.

606

about the fantasies
I was having and stuff?

I really, really want
to get to know him better.

619
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:50,496
(Katherine) Wow, well, you
know, I think you should

620
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,094
(Keily)
Well, it's your turn.

621
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:53,662
<i>(Katherine)</i>
<i>My turn what?</i>

622
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,605
(Keily) You remember, you wanted
to tell me something earlier.

623
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:56,607
(Katherine)
I forgot.

624
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,143
Don't worry about me.

625
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,200
Let's eat.

626
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:04,876
(Katherine) So Keily's
the unavailable girl?

627
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,919
(Trey)
Yes.

628
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:12,515
(Katherine)
Wow.

629
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:13,581
(Trey)
So did you tell her?

630
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,957
(Katherine)
Tell her what?

631
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:15,960
(Trey)
About us.

632
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,293
(Katherine)
What about us?

633
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,296
(Trey)
That we were-

634
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:22,857
(Katherine)
That we were or are?

635
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,096
(Trey)
We were lovers.

636
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,831
(Katherine) Okay, so
I never got the memo.

637
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:30,604
When did we stop
being lovers, Trey?

638
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:31,644
(Trey)
You know what?

639
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,145
This little attitude,
all this angry-

640
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:35,238
(Katherine) Trey, you
can't come into my house

641
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:36,577
and treat me
like a piece of meat.

642
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,877
You can't walk
into my life,

643
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:39,851
make love to me
a couple of times a week,

644
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,786
and then expect me
not to be emotional.

645
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,050
(Trey) Katherine, just
listen to yourself.

646
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,055
Let me tell you something.

647
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,592
Look, she has a boyfriend.

648
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,592
She's unavailable.

649
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,424
So what difference
does it make?

650
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,830
(Katherine) Keily and Carlton
are no longer attached, all right?

651
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,834
<i>(Trey) What you mean,</i>
<i>they no longer attached?</i>

652
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,132
(Katherine)
They broke up.

653
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:01,002
<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>Okay, they broke up.</i>

654
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:05,204
(Katherine) Trey, I'm not
prepared to give you up, okay?

655
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,677
(Trey)
Did you tell her?

656
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,180
(Katherine) No, I didn't
tell her, but that seems to be

657
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:10,841
the only thing
that you're concerned about.

658
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,680
What about me?

659
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,947
(Trey) Katherine, for
real, you need to calm down.

660
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,511
You got neighbors next door,
all right?

661
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,521
(Katherine)
I don't care!

662
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,522
(Trey)
You already-

663
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:19,853
Look, look,
why are you playing?

664
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:20,858
You know
how I feel about-

665
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,622
(Katherine)
No, Trey, I don't.

666
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,858
How do you feel about me?

667
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,298
(Trey) Look, Katherine, I
care deeply for you, all right?

668
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:30,233
You scaring me right now,
for real.

669
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,235
You really scaring me.

670
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,568
(Katherine) How deeply
do you feel for me?

671
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,473
(Trey) Look, Katherine,
look, look, look.

672
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,601
This is just, like-

673
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,406
honestly,
all I'm saying is-

674
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,776
(Katherine)
How do you feel for Keily?

675
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:41,779
(Trey)
Listen.

676
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:42,815
Oh, do you want to know?

677
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:43,940
For real,
you really want to know?

678
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:44,949
So you want to act all crazy
and yelling and been-

679
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:45,950
(Katherine)
Yes!

680
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,008
(Trey)
Listen, listen.

681
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,054
I care for the girl.
I love the girl.

682
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:50,089
I like the girl.

683
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,145
I want to be
with the girl.

684
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:52,691
You crying,
and I got to go.

685
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,691
I got to go.

686
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,853
I can't deal with this.

687
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,529
(Katherine)
If you love her so much,

688
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:05,128
then why are you here
with me?

689
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,136
(Trey) You want to
know why I'm here?

690
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,137
This is why.

691
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,138
These right here,

692
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,869
this little stupid bag that you
always wanted me to deliver,

693
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,468
this damn bag of ribs.

694
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,445
That's what you always
called me for, ribs.

695
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:21,386
That's why I'm here.

696
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,649
(Katherine) I don't
want the stupid ribs.

697
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:28,422
I want you.

698
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,553
I want you.

699
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,562
(Trey)
Why you acting like this?

700
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:37,695
Why you crying?

701
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,399
[camera clicks]

702
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:44,443
[camera clicking]

703
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,350
(Trey)
I'm just surprised you called.

704
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:02,417
(Keily) Well, actually,
I'm outside right now.

705
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:03,587
<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>You are?</i>

706
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:10,091
Right now?

707
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:14,697
For real?

708
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,867
I see you.

709
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,470
(Keily)
I see you too.

710
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,015
Can we go somewhere and talk?

711
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:28,176
(Trey) Yeah, hold
on one second, okay?

712
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,519
Mr. Vickers,
I got to go, brother.

713
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,354
I'll be back.

714
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,893
I'm coming out.

715
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,452
(Keily)
All right.

716
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:46,031
<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>How you doing, Keily?</i>

717
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,266
Hi, Sida.

718
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,305
(Sida) Call me if
you have any problems.

719
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,246
Okay?

720
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,181
(Trey)
There won't be no problems, okay?

721
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,184
[woman singing] Lately I feel
like I'm doing this on my own,

722
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,557
like I'm so alone.

723
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,858
Even my shadow
is gone.

724
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,364
I'm trying hard
to focus on what I know.

725
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:14,832
Hustle and the bustle

726
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,994
on which way
I should go.

727
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,231
I'm tired of watching
my enemies grow strong.

728
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,932
Adversaries get on.

729
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,872
I'm saying
this is hard for me.

730
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:27,140
I need a word,
a noun, adjective, and verbs.

731
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:30,011
(Keily)
All right.

732
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,380
Thank you.

733
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,749
[woman singing]
How much longer till the sun comes up?

734
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,549
I'm saying how long?

735
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,213
Till i break free.

736
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,986
How much longer till you rescue me?

737
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,959
Tell me, how long...

738
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,655
Till I get you.

739
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,528
How much longer till I hear from you?

740
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:57,306
(Trey)
Is it really over?

741
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,809
(Keily)
Yes, it's really over.

742
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:05,544
(Trey)
I want you, Keily.

743
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,921
I'm just a bit overwhelmed
right now.

744
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,325
You want me
in what way?

745
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,228
(Trey)
I want to be with you.

746
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,065
In what way, Trey?

747
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,673
In every way.

748
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,468
I thought you meant
something else.

749
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:38,245
(Trey)
Nah, not in that way at all.

750
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,147
I want your smile.

751
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:47,090
I want to have
your embraces.

752
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,392
I want your kisses.

753
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:54,297
I want to share your air.

754
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,432
(Keily)
That's so sweet.

755
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:03,373
That's the most romantic thing
anybody's ever said to me.

756
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:09,644
I wasn't trying
to be romantic.

757
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:13,947
I was speaking
from the heart.

758
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:24,528
Well, I'm gonna
get out of here.

759
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,430
I have a fire to put out on the bridge
I burned with my aunt.

760
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:34,532
Um...

761
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:38,407
would it scare you
if I told you that...

762
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,001
that I just-

763
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:45,116
Don't say it.

764
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,755
(Trey) Let me get the
door for you, though.

765
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,122
Don't worry about that.

766
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,821
Always let a man
open the door.

767
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,261
I got you.

768
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:07,232
Hey, I think we should do some
old-school reverb on this, man.

769
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,273
That'd be real cool.

770
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,467
(No Doubt)
Yeah.

771
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,942
Yo, I heard the commercial
on the radio.

772
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:16,675
(Mack) Yeah, man, I heard
it three times yesterday.

773
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:20,742
Say, dig, man, I really
appreciate what you doing, man.

774
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,948
It's a beautiful thing.

775
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,718
You know, all the time
you been coming here,

776
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,282
I don't even know
your real name.

777
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:31,455
(No Doubt) You know, I usually
don't tell people my real name.

778
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,361
But you know what I'm saying,
if you can keep a secret,

779
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,364
it's all good.

780
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,458
(Mack) Hey, you
know, man. I'm good.

781
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,560
(No Doubt)
Corky Douglas.

782
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:40,469
(Mack)
What?

783
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:44,703
(No Doubt)
Corky Douglas.

784
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,075
(Mack)
Corky Douglas?

785
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:49,512
[laughing]

786
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:50,606
Okay, Corky.

787
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,948
[laughing]

788
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,456
I'm going
to call you No Doubt.

789
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,516
(Rex)
Yeah, yeah.

790
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:01,992
Come on, Weezy.

791
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,586
Weezy, it's just a chorus.

792
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:05,892
Man, don't worry
about Baby.

793
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:07,592
I'll take care of that.

794
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:10,158
All right?

795
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,828
<i>All right, all right,</i>
<i>all right.</i>

796
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:12,836
(K-3)
Hey, yo, yo.

797
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,133
That as Lil' Wayne
and them?

798
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,571
And Baby?

799
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,768
Yo, you know them?

800
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:18,935
Damn.

801
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:19,943
That's cool.

802
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,003
Yo, heard
you was in here.

803
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:23,013
Hey, listen, man.

804
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,448
You've got to reconsider
doing the show.

805
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:28,646
(Rex) There's absolutely no
buzz on the streets on this.

806
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,450
You gonna damage
your career.

807
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:33,117
(No Doubt)
I don't care about that.

808
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,023
I'm a loyalist.

809
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,891
I don't leave my partners
out there when they need me.

810
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,863
(Rex) Man, that spot
gonna be empty, man.

811
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:39,863
K, you know what?

812
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,456
You need to make a decision
right now,

813
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:44,196
'cause I'm detecting a problem,
a virus,

814
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,362
in this here
whole program.

815
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:48,896
I say that we delete
and download another rapper.

816
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:50,465
(K-3) Yo, I grew up with this man.

817
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:53,068
(Rex)
Then you can grow apart from him.

818
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,772
We can always find
another No Doubt,

819
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,577
one with "real" skills.

820
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,515
It's either him or me.

821
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,090
(K-3)
Doubt...

822
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,064
man, we need
to start rehearsing.

823
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,498
(Rex)
Brilliant.

824
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:22,905
You gonna blow a golden
opportunity for this clown.

825
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,771
(Mack) Hey, it's
time for you to leave.

826
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,782
(Rex)
No problem.

827
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,648
I could've done wonders
with y'all limited talent,

828
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,687
<i>but if that's what you want,</i>

829
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:38,246
then fine.

830
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,347
(K-3)
Man, nah, nah, nah, nah.

831
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,415
It ain't even worth it.

832
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:42,893
Man, be up out of here.

833
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,020
(Rex) Yeah, all right, tough guy.

834
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,893
But I give you three months,

835
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,694
<i>three months before</i>
<i>you working in a movie theater</i>

836
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:48,825
tearing up tickets.

837
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,766
Theater 8,
to your right.

838
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:53,361
Fake-ass <i>Kenan & Kel-</i> looking bastards.

839
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:57,500
(K-3) Man, you come in here
dressing like chocolate and butter.

840
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,942
(No Doubt)
Shit, let's do it, man.

841
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,639
(Mack) Say, man, let's get to work.

842
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:04,376
We need to cut
a couple of more hits.

843
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,474
What you got
in your notebook?

844
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:06,483
(K-3)
Hey, show him the stuff.

845
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:07,484
(No Doubt)
Oh, man, oh, man.

846
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:08,850
I got some new stuff, dog.

847
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:09,853
Look, look, look.

848
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,082
Here goes one.
Here goes one.

849
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,022
It's called
<i>Streaks in My Drawers.</i>

850
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,116
[laughing]

851
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,626
Then I got another one
talking about,

852
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,922
<i>I'm Calling In Sick.</i>

853
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,122
[laughing]

854
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,926
(K-3) Yo, Mack, I love these, man.

855
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,398
You got to see where you're
going with them, though.

856
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,434
You got to see
where you're going with them.

857
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:27,265
Mm.

858
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,328
(Trey)
So look, man.

859
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,307
She going
to the concert with me.

860
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,435
(Vince)
Oh.

861
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,969
So you not at all
worried about Carlton?

862
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,015
(Trey)
Nope.

863
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,243
Not at all, man.

864
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,249
<i>Not at all.</i>

865
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,081
(Vince) Oh, then you must
be in love, then, man.

866
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,087
(Trey) Yeah, I'm gonna
give you that right there.

867
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,749
I love you like a brother
and everything, man.

868
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:46,757
(Vince)
Oh.

869
00:33:46,826 --> 00:33:49,761
Oh, that's what
I forgot to tell you.

870
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,491
You know I had to break it up
with Bunni, right?

871
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:53,554
(Trey)
Why?

872
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:54,758
(Vince)
Man, come to find out,

873
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,394
the broad been squeezing me
for cash the whole time.

874
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,564
(Trey)
Just been squeezing you, huh?

875
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,833
(Vince)
Huh? What?

876
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:02,839
(Trey)
Nothing, man.

877
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,899
Just nothing at all, man.

878
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:05,966
You know how it-

879
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,513
Uh, so how'd
she take it, man?

880
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:11,846
(Vince)
Aw, man, pretty damn hard.

881
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,442
You know, once you get
a dose of this pimping,

882
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,044
hard for them
to go back.

883
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,214
[knock at door]

884
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,551
(Mrs. Vickers)
Excuse me.

885
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:19,989
Hi.

886
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,924
Honey,
can you watch the front?

887
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:24,758
Cinque has a customer,
and, well,

888
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,390
your father's a little upset,
and he went to bed.

889
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:28,455
(Vince)
What's wrong now?

890
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,764
(Mrs. Vickers) Cinque told
him how the Voting Rights Act

891
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:32,463
has to be renewed
every so often

892
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:35,098
so blacks can get the vote,
you know?

893
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,165
And your father took it-

894
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:41,441
<i>took it pretty hard.</i>

895
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:45,678
(Vince) All right, I'll be
downstairs soon as I put my sock on.

896
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,048
(Mrs. Vickers)
Thank you, baby.

897
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:53,052
(Trey) Look, man, I'm
gonna go watch the front.

898
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,492
That may
take you a while.

899
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:58,863
[crackling]

900
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,091
Damn.

901
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,562
You don't even know anything
about this Trey dude.

902
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:07,868
(Keily)
I know enough.

903
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,737
(Sida)
Hmm.

904
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,572
Well, did you
know about these?

905
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,050
<i>Did he mention that?</i>

906
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,773
(Trey)
Hi, Keily.

907
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,110
<i>Damn.</i>

908
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,705
Keily, just give me
a minute, okay?

909
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:51,715
Please, please.

910
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:52,944
(Keily)
There's nothing to say, Trey.

911
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:57,478
(Trey) Keily, this doesn't
mean nothing, nothing at all.

912
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:58,784
(Keily) I thought
you were different.

913
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,155
(Trey)
Come on, Keily.

914
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:21,174
(Katherine)
Hey.

915
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:22,839
(Keily)
Pick one.

916
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:25,145
(Katherine)
What-

917
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,515
What are these?

918
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,281
(Keily)
I trusted you.

919
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,050
Why don't you
say something to me?

920
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:32,112
(Katherine) Keily, how
are you going to leave

921
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,920
before you get the answer
to your question?

922
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:35,756
(Keily)
No, you betrayed me.

923
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:38,729
(Katherine) Look, how was I supposed
to know that you had a thing for Trey?

924
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,094
And don't go
blaming this on Trey.

925
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,861
Besides, it doesn't even matter
anymore, 'cause it's over.

926
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:44,698
(Keily) So he was the guy
you were talking about?

927
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,297
(Katherine)
Yes.

928
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:49,671
(Keily)
Do you love him?

929
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,334
(Katherine)
I thought I did.

930
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,640
But it's exactly
what I told you.

931
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,875
I mean, we have nothing
in common, nothing.

932
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,144
(Keily) Well, why
would you just sit there

933
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,242

Look, Carlton,

1089
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:39,601
from now on, I'd like you
to cease contact with my woman.

1090
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:40,975
And if you don't,
I'm going to have to-

1091
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:42,536
(Carlton)
You'll do what, bitch?

1092
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:45,777
Get your face ripped off?

1093

Carlton, come on.

let's get out of here.

Oh, no, no, no.

1102
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:05,869
Get him, get him, him,
and her ass too.

1103
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:06,869
Get her.

1104
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,428
Grab her by the back
of the weave.

1105
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,975
You can come back
if you give me your number.

1106
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,009
Oh, well,
forget you then.

1107
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,339
Yeah, take her ass out, then.

1108

Let me see.
Let me see that.

Oh.

We need to talk.

No, we don't.

(Cinque) Listen, so the
No Child Left Behind Act

did the exact opposite of what
it was supposed to do, Vick.

1161
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,322
They never funded it,
you know what I'm saying?

00:50:47,846 --> 00:50:50,314
Baby, I see you
when you're tired.

1203
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,248
Yeah, I know
you're working so hard.

1204
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:55,115
But sometimes
I look in your eyes,

1205
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,815
and it's so sad,
it just breaks my heart.

1206
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,688
And, baby,
I know that we're struggling.

1207
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,125
But that's why
our love's the best part.

1208

Together,
you know we're gonna make it.

We're riding this out
to the top.

1210
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:15,900
Love should be much more
than just a four-letter word.

1211
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:18,738
Yeah, it's the reason
I keep believin'

1212
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,404
even when
sometimes it hurts.

1213
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:24,710
It might catch you off guard
and change your breathing

1214
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:27,080
before you know
it has occurred.

1215
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:30,053
But I wonder
if they can't shake the feeling.

1216
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,783
So right now,
for what's it's worth,

1217
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:34,290
seeing all that you see me,

1218
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,260
the love that's in your eyes
is telling me that you need me.

1219
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,260
Before you came along,

1220
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,160
all that I had was lonely.

1221
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:42,927
And now
that's all gone away.

1222
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:45,526
You and I together
even when it ain't easy.

1223
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,570
The way that it should be.

1224
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:48,367
Baby, you got to believe me.

1225
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,371
And when you're down and out,

1226
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,204
you know
that you can count on me,

1227
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:54,677
'cause you know
that I see you.

1228
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:56,680
Baby, I see you
when you're trying.

1229
00:51:56,748 --> 00:52:00,206
Yeah, I know
you're working so hard.

But sometimes that
look in your eyes

is so sad,
it just breaks my heart.

1232

And, baby,
I know that we're struggling,

1233
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:11,428
but that's why
our love's the best part.
