1
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,435
Who are you hiding from?

2
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,037
My older brothers.

3
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,396
Have you done anything wrong?

4
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,679
I saw them so many times.

5
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,555
I saw how they looked at each other.

6
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,316
Every night she'd massage his back.

7
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,594
She'd massage his legs.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,956
I kept seeing them.

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,036
I kept wishing for death to come.

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,873
Who to?

11
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,512
Your wife?

12
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,951
My father.

13
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,954
They'll put me in jail!

14
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,799
Who is it?

15
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,748
It's me, ma'am.

16
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,238
What do you want?

17
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,317
- I came to hug you!
- Get out!

18
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,549
Why aren't you looking at me?

19
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,797
Shut up!

20
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,679
That's the worst punishment
you can give a person.

21
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,078
Shameless man!
You seduced a woman of this age!

22
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,318
I'm so ashamed!

23
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,197
Isn't your body's desire
also your soul's desire?

24
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,274
No, it isn't!
That's what animals do!

25
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,677
Human beings are
supposed to be different.

26
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,598
- But they aren't different.
- Shut up!

27
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,196
Wanton savage!

28
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,877
I came to love you
with body and soul, ma'am.

29
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,877
Get out!

30
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,314
Two are better than one.

31
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,713
For if they fall,
one will lift up his companion.

32
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,480
And a twofold cord
is not quickly broken.

33
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,994
When my soul isn't listening to me,
I step out and tell my skeleton...

34
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,429
Do not be rash with your mouth, and let
not your heart utter anything hastily.

35
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,873
For God is in heaven,
and you on earth.

36
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,669
Therefore let your words be few.

37
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,751
That's what I say.

38
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,190
- They've caught the thief.
- Really?

39
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,153
They caught him on the train.
He's from the village.

40
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,076
- The man killed his father as well!
- Don't! That's just not possible here.

41
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,511
- Which village is he from?
- The village up top.

42
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,153
Now a pharmacy's been robbed.
The man was there on his own.

43
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,158
He closed to go to Friday prayers
and that's when the bastard broke in!

44
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,554
Shame on him!

45
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,193
That kind of thing
just isn't possible round here.

46
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,592
These break-ins are getting
out of control.

47
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,390
If they'd given me that thief,
I wouldn't kill him right away.

48
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:09,152
I'd tie him to a pole, and punish him by
cutting a piece of his flesh every day.

49
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,951
What are you doing?
Get off him!

50
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,070
- Wait. He's OK.
- OK, gentlemen! He's fine.

51
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,077
Move away now.
Move away. Let him breathe.

52
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,432
Oh my!
What's going on here?

53
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,311
- It's as if my lungs are better.
- Possibly you're cured, Tahir.

54
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,839
Captain! Captain! Captain!

55
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,840
Captain, I need to talk!
I need to talk, captain!

56
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,076
Get off!

57
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,029
I did it, captain! It was me.

58
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,959
I did it, captain. It wasn't him.

59
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,068
He didn't do it, captain.
It was me.

60
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,748
I did it, captain!

61
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,429
Everything has a place of its own.

62
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,395
When everything finds its place,
it's all in peace and harmony.

63
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,512
Our bodies...

64
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,560
...find that place of their own
with their own gravity.

65
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,518
But it's not the kind of gravity
that pulls down.

66
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,349
Fire rises, stones fall.

67
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,550
The real gravity of our bodies
comes from the love we have.

68
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,637
Son, we need your cures.
My orphan boy has stopped speaking.

69
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,951
Doctors and hospitals are no good.

70
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,992
His mother died giving birth.
His father went away to find work.

71
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,474
He hasn't spoken for a year.
And it's made him all crabby.

72
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,229
There, that's what he's like.

73
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,674
Turn to the right! Quick time!
Left, right! Left, right!

74
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,874
Do they know they're going to die?

75
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,592
Of course they do.

76
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,519
They're even glad
they're going to die.

77
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,153
This place means release for them.

78
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,996
The sign!

79
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,719
And I thought,
"Oh no! A plane's crashing!"

80
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,549
- A star! It's a star, dad!
- Stars don't fall!

81
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,871
But there are shooting stars!

82
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,791
It was like an earthquake.
The earth roared.

83
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,199
It's a rocket. Definitely a rocket.
And obviously fired across the border.

84
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,953
Attention! The road is closed!
Going near the object is forbidden!

85
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,393
The area is declared a forbidden zone
until further notice.

86
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,750
- What has fallen?
- Must be a satellite again.

87
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,678
- We're being rained on with rubbish!
- They've sealed off the whole place.

88
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,152
I got sick.

89
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,870
You'll get better, son.
Praise be to God!

90
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,708
You can talk now, can't you!

91
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,476
May God grant your every wish!

92
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,271
Here, this money is yours.

93
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,556
- That wasn't my money.
- No. Take it. It's yours.

94
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,718
I don't need it.

95
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,389
- You keep it.
- No, don't take it!

96
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,196
I stole that money from him.
Don't take it! I stole it from him.

97
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,919
My punishment's over, isn't it?

98
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,597
That was over long ago.
It's time for rewards now.

99
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,637
He threw the kitten off the bridge.
He didn't think it would drown.

100
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,518
In his dream that night
he was in a cat court.

101
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,551
And the head cat said...

102
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,355
"As your punishment you mustn't speak
until we give you a sign."

103
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,991
- So he didn't speak.
- Right, he didn't speak.

104
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,873
- He served his punishment.
- He served his punishment.

105
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,350
But now he's really sick.

106
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,160
Those pills aren't for your illness.

107
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,428
It's numb.

108
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,116
It's completely numb.

109
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,358
You were sent to us by God.
I've heard you cure the poor.

110
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,470
God bless you! Now could you
take a look at my son's mind here?

111
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,196
I've had so many hodjas pray for him.
None of them has done any good.

112
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,470
Could you just take a look?

113
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,035
For the love of God.

114
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,959
I don't know what my body knows.

115
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,516
My body doesn't know what I know.

116
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,833
My body and I fear God.

117
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,038
For in the multitude of dreams
and many words there is also vanity.

118
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,638
But you should fear God.

119
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,030
Son, please take a look at him.

120
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,437
We're poor.
We don't have money for a doctor.

121
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,073
What have you done to my back?

122
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,432
The illness is
in the column of your back.

123
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,153
His condition is serious.

124
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,948
He should be taken to hospital
immediately.

125
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,316
We can go in my car.

126
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,191
It's you who made my boy ill,
isn't it?

127
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,909
What happened to the pills?

128
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,398
What did you do with them all?

129
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,076
I threw them away.

130
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,279
Go and get them.

131
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,478
Go and get them.

132
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,159
Go and get them then!

133
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,399
I can't do without them!
Dirty thief!

134
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,556
I gave you money!

135
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,914
I gave you money, dirty thief!

136
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,076
I can't bear it.

137
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,718
Why...

138
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,278
...does your heart
eat away at you like this?

139
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,311
Why do your eyes flash lightning...

140
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,673
...but you turn
your soul against God...

141
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,952
...and spit out words like this?

142
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,392
What is man
that he might be pure?

143
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,713
Don't lessen the stride
of your strength.

144
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,148
Your bones are full of
your youthfulness.

145
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,512
And you say...
what does God know?

146
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,799
Thick clouds
are a curtain to Him.

147
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,754
You say He doesn't see
you or your troubles.

148
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,591
I've been all the way
to the pole star and back!

149
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,476
I've climbed up and down
the seven layers of heaven!

150
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,353
Lift your face to God.

151
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,515
I've seen your illness!

152
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,830
I've got you now, asshole!
Wait! Don't run away!

153
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,039
- Where is he?
- Who?

154
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,548
Didn't you see him?

155
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,559
You said you hadn't seen him, huh?

156
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,228
Are you taking the piss?
He jumped over there!

157
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,508
Open the door! Go on, open it
