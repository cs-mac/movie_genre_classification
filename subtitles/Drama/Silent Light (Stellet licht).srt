1
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,500
Amen.

2
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,900
Have some cereal.

3
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,800
Pass the bread, Dad.

4
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
No banana today?

5
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,800
Pass the milk, please, Alfredo.

6
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Well done, Anita!
You've spilled the milk again.

7
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,700
It doesn't matter.

8
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Open your mouth like this...

9
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,100
Esther, I'm going to the garage now

10
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,300
to pick up the crankshaft for the tractor.

11
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes, Johan. We're going out now, too.

12
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,800
Okay, let's all get moving.

13
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Hand me the dishes, children.

14
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,300
Help me arrange the table.

15
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Don't leave any leftovers, Dani and Anita!

16
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,400
Thank you, Sara.

17
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,900
Come on, children. We have to go.

18
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,700
Come, children!

19
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,500
Come on, Jak!

20
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,400
-Where's my hat?
-Right here.

21
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,500
Come on, children.

22
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,600
Sara, head along with the children.

23
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,500
Stay on your own for a while, Johan.

24
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
I love you, Esther.

25
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,700
I know, Johan.

26
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,100
I love you, too.

27
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Raubart!

28
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,200
Raubart! Raubart!

29
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,100
You're a good dog...

30
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,800
Good dog.

31
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,500
Zacarias!

32
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Hold on, he's fixing an engine block!

33
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,500
Zacarias!

34
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Hold on, Johan, damn it!

35
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,100
Are you in a bloody hurry, or what?

36
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, man, a bloody hurry...

37
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,200
All right, Juanito, your damn crank is all ready.

38
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,800
-Hold it, don't let it fall.
-It's very heavy.

39
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
Watch your fingers!

40
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't want them to get hurt.

41
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,900
One...

42
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,400
Two...

43
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Three!

44
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,400
What did the guy on the phone want?

45
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,100
He wants us to fix the engine.

46
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,300
-What's wrong with it?
-It's completely busted.

47
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
We'll have to replace everything.

48
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Pistons, suspension,

49
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,200
timing belt, crankshaft, and

50
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,900
redo the valves,

51
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,500
the head needs new spark plugs...

52
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,400
Did they get bent, or what?

53
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,700
We have to change them, anyway.

54
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They're all elongated.

55
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,800
And the hoses don't work, either.

56
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,100
We have to do an overall cleaning of the engine.

57
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,500
The man on the phone wants
a plutonium exhaust. Can we do that?

58
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,600
Yes, right now. Get to work!
And move it!

59
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,300
Come on, move it!

60
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,600
What can't be done today
will be done tomorrow.

61
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I thought you stopped seeing her.

62
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Me, too.

63
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,500
But the days go by, and before I know it...

64
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,400
And the pain won't stop digging in.

65
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,900
A powerful thing's come over you.
You've found your natural woman.

66
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,000
Very few know what that means.
You'll have to carry on.

67
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,500
I'd hurt my wife so...
You know how I've loved her.

68
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,200
Just talking about it feels like lead
being poured into my guts.

69
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,700
If that is your destiny,
then you'll have to be brave.

70
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,200
A brave man makes destiny
with what he's got.

71
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,700
Plus, I have a woman
and I have a family, and...

72
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,900
My woman is called Esther, Zacarias.

73
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
It's only for you to decide,

74
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,600
but be careful not to betray yourself.

75
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,100
It's true that Marianne
is a better woman for me.

76
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,500
At least that's my feeling.

77
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,600
And that feeling may be founded
in something sacred,

78
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,800
even if we don't understand it.

79
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,400
Turn that thing up!

80
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
-The swine's on for a good lay, huh?
-Yeah!

81
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,600
Let me help you.

82
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,300
You can go in the water now.

83
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,700
Come, Autghe!

84
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,200
The water is warm.

85
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,800
A little cold.

86
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,700
Alfredo, send me one of the children for a wash!

87
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,600
You go, Anita.

88
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,700
Time for a wash!

89
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,500
-Right now?
-Yes, now.

90
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,700
Press on my toe.

91
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,900
I'm going to hold onto you.

92
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,300
Come, Anita, let's get the soap off him!

93
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Come and help me.

94
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Wait a moment.

95
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,200
You help me, too.

96
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,600
-Enough!
-Enough?

97
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Yes.

98
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,200
Wait, there's more here.

99
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,300
Come, the foam is gone.

100
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,900
I've got water in my nose.

101
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,700
-Come here! Get in the water.
-No.

102
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,900
I want to get out.

103
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,800
-Hold on.
-No, I'm going!

104
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
What a wimp!

105
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,600
Do it softer, Mummy!

106
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,400
-Dad, can I go see Cornelio?
-Yes, but don't wake him up, Anita.

107
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
You've always been so good
at making the soap, Esther.

108
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,900
Finished, Autghe, go into the water.

109
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,900
Come, Esther,

110
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,500
let's go swim.

111
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,200
Be careful.

112
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,300
Someone has arrived.

113
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,700
I'll go see.

114
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,700
-Hello, Mother.
-Good morning, Son.

115
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,800
-I need to talk to Dad.
-Go in, he's milking the cows.

116
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,700
Thanks, see you in a while.

117
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,900
Good day.

118
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,400
Good day, Johan.

119
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,400
I need to talk to you.

120
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,100
So early?

121
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,600
I fell in love with another woman.

122
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,100
You're joking, Johan.

123
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,600
Well, let's go out.

124
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,800
Come, let's go see the snow.

125
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,400
Planting will be delayed this season, Johan.

126
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,600
Soon it will be two years.

127
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,700
Does Esther know about it, Johan?

128
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,900
I've told her everything since the beginning.

129
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,200
I don't want Mother...

130
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,700
I don't want Mother to know about this.

131
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,300
Don't worry.
This is only between us.

132
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,300
Let's go in the house, Johan.
I'll send Mother off to do something.

133
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,200
Yes, Dad.

134
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,800
What's happening to you
is the work of the enemy, Johan.

135
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,700
Talk to me like a father, not like a preacher.

136
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,200
I am both, Johan.

137
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,800
I think it's God's doing.

138
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,000
Dad, if this is the work of the Devil,

139
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,000
I feel sorry for myself. Truly!

140
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,400
But now I have to know
who's the woman I must love.

141
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,400
Help me if you can.

142
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,700
I can only tell you what I went through...

143
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,700
And I've never told anyone.

144
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,500
After your birth,
I felt an unknown attraction to another woman.

145
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,100
I was ready to leave my family.

146
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,900
But before doing that,
I forced myself to stop seeing her.

147
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,900
Soon enough,
I realised the excitement existed only in myself.

148
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,400
It was my need to feel.

149
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,400
You suffer, because you think the pain
of losing her will never pass...

150
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,500
But it will, Son.

151
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,200
That's true, Dad.

152
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,500
But when I compare the two women,

153
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,000
I don't ask myself what I feel for Esther now.
I think of her when I met her...

154
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,500
Then I realise I'd have preferred the new woman.

155
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,800
I simply made a mistake with Esther,
and now I have to fix it.

156
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,200
Esther is your wife.

157
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,500
She loves you as your mother loves me,
and I know how you love her, too.

158
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,300
You love the new woman.
It's inexplicable, but I understand.

159
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,000
I wouldn't like to be in your shoes, dear Johan,
but somehow, I also envy you.

160
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,800
I can't tell you what to do,

161
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,800
but I know if you don't act quickly,
you will lose them both.

162
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,600
Yes, Dad.

163
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,700
Your mother and I will support you.

164
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,300
-Hello.
-Hello, Sara.

165
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,700
-Thank you, Mum.
-You're welcome, Johan.

166
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,400
Goodbye, Dad.

167
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,600
Goodbye, Johan.

168
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,200
-Hi, Johan.
-Hi. What's for lunch?

169
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,500
-Tacos. Yes.
-Tacos! Tacos again?

170
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,600
Well, we sure had a good corn harvest.
There's nothing I like more.

171
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,100
-I'm hungry!
-Let's say grace.

172
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,300
Amen.

173
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,000
-Let me see who's there.
-Okay, Johan.

174
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,700
It was on Marianne's behalf.

175
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,200
I have to go to her business
to bring her two urgent deliveries.

176
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,400
Then you can take the children
to the dentist in Blumenau.

177
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,400
-Is that where Uncle Abraham lives?
-Yes, Alfredo.

178
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,600
This year only these two have been, Johan.

179
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,800
-Really?
-Yes. Really, Johan.

180
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,400
Then I'll take them, Esther.

181
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,300
-I brought what you asked for, Marianne.
-Fine, Johan.

182
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,800
Daddy, will you buy me
two of these little beads?

183
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,100
Shall we go to my office
and prepare the invoice?

184
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:54,000
-I want Dad to buy me some of these sweets.
-Me, too.

185
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,500
-Pardon me.
-Please.

186
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,900
I think it's a swell idea, Marianne.

187
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,400
-Pardon me.
-Please.

188
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,500
Lie down.

189
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,400
I can feel your heart.

190
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,500
This was the last time, Johan.

191
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,800
Peace is stronger than love.

192
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,000
Poor Esther.

193
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,000
Let me get up.

194
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,500
Are you ready?

195
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,300
I'm afraid there's more pain yet to come,

196
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,900
but then there will be

197
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,100
peace,

198
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,900
and afterwards, a happiness
like we've never known.

199
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,900
This is the saddest time of my life, Johan,

200
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,600
but also the best.

201
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,700
I don't regret anything.

202
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,500
We're very fortunate, my love.

203
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,900
Me, neither.

204
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,900
I smell of sex.

205
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,500
What's that on the floor, there?

206
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,000
A leaf.

207
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,400
-A cedar leaf?
-Yes, red cedar.

208
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,800
We shouldn't have left the kids with that fatso.

209
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,100
That fatso is a good man.

210
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,800
Besides, they're in the restaurant
with more people.

211
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,100
I'd rather go down now.

212
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,700
You're the best man I've ever known.

213
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,500
I don't know how I'll live without you.

214
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,100
Where are my children?

215
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,200
They're with Bobby in his van.

216
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,800
Hello, Dad, come in to watch TV with us.

217
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Come on, make room for Daddy.

218
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,500
Alfredo, pass me a banana.

219
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,800
Sara, take good care of the children.

220
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,500
And you, children, obey your sister
while we're gone.

221
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,600
Yes, Mummy.

222
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,500
And don't forget your prayers.

223
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,300
-Right, Jak?
-Yes, Dad.

224
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,300
Dad...

225
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,500
We have to fix the leak in the barn.

226
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,100
We'll do that tomorrow
when Mum and I are back, Alfredo.

227
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,500
You'll have the whole day
to play where you want.

228
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,700
We're going to behave very well, Dad.

229
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,500
I love you, Daddy. Mummy, too.

230
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,800
Who can that be?

231
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,100
You go, Alfredo.

232
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,800
Dad, it's for you.

233
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,100
-Finished your breakfast, Cornelio?
-No.

234
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,800
Let's go in there. To the room.

235
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,500
To the room.

236
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,900
Who came to the house, Johan?

237
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,100
I don't know. A stranger.

238
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,500
It was on behalf of Marianne.
She needs to see me.

239
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,000
Damn whore!

240
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,100
It's very hard for her also, Esther.

241
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,600
What's the matter, Johan?

242
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,900
I've seen her again.

243
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,000
I've tried with all my might

244
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,100
but I've failed.

245
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,500
Poor Marianne.

246
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,400
Remember when we loved travelling like this?

247
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,700
We wouldn't stop singing.

248
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,400
We were always happy.

249
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,200
Or just remained silent,

250
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,200
or I would fall asleep.

251
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,100
However it was, just being next to you

252
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:54,100
was the pure feeling of being alive.
I was part of the world.

253
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,100
Now, I am separated from it.

254
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,300
I feel the same.

255
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,800
How I wished it was all just a bad dream...

256
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,900
To close and open my eyes
and be back in that time...

257
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,000
In that feeling.

258
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,400
That idiot's going to kill someone.

259
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,800
Sure, Johan.

260
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:02,000
My chest is hurting.

261
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,800
We're almost there, Esther.

262
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:14,000
Stop the car, Johan. I want to vomit.

263
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,800
Calm down, love. See how it's raining.

264
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,200
Stop the car.

265
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,700
Stop the car!

266
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,200
Don't follow me, Johan.

267
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,600
I'm cold, Johan.

268
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:31,000
Good afternoon!

269
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,600
-What's wrong with them?
-Let's go see.

270
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,300
Come with us.

271
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,900
Get up, get up!

272
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,600
-He's very stiff.
-Get up! Get up!

273
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:04,200
Tell me what happened.
What's wrong with your wife?

274
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,400
Did you crash? What's wrong?

275
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,400
My name is Juan.

276
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,600
She's my wife.

277
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,900
Her name is Esther.

278
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,000
Johannes Voth!

279
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,700
-Shall I wait in the office, Doctor?
-Yes, please.

280
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,700
Your wife suffered a coronary trauma.

281
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,000
That was the cause of her death.

282
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,900
And what is that?

283
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,800
It's a massive attack of the heart.

284
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,800
Why did that happen to her?

285
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,100
She might have been very tired,

286
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,700
it could be obesity,

287
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,100
alcoholism...

288
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,400
Medical science hasn't got all the answers.

289
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,200
Thank you, Doctor.

290
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,200
I will sign the paperwork
so you can take her now.

291
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,600
Thank you.

292
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,800
Saint John, verse XV, page 726.

293
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,400
Johan, you may seal in my daughter now.

294
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,300
Pull it tight.

295
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,700
Get in your places.

296
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:17,000
Cornelio, say goodbye to your sister.

297
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:26,100
You have to do it from this side.

298
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,600
Johan, come on, stand up.

299
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,500
Stand up.

300
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,400
Stand up now!

301
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,900
Goodbye, Esther.

302
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,900
Alfredo, your turn.

303
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,500
Goodbye, Mum.

304
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,900
Now leave us alone, please.

305
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,500
Johan, she's in peace now.

306
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,100
Now everything's broken, Dad.

307
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:00,600
The enemy is implacable.

308
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:04,700
It's not the Devil or anyone else. It's me.

309
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,700
Johan.

310
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,700
Johan.

311
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,600
You are nothing in the face of this, Johan.

312
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,400
It was all written beforehand.

313
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,000
My dearest friend.

314
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,300
Good day, Zacarias.

315
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,000
Come with me outside.

316
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:26,900
Wait for me!

317
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,600
Can you move your ears like this?

318
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,200
Without the hat?

319
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,000
Stare at them.

320
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,300
And how about this?

321
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:22,200
Daddy, is being dead like sleeping,
but without waking up?

322
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:28,600
-Who told you that?
-Grandmother Ruth.

323
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,000
It's the truth, Anita.

324
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,400
Don't cry, Dad.

325
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,600
Follow me, Marianne.

326
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:22,700
I'd give anything to turn back time...
Go back to things as they used to be.

327
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:31,600
That's the only thing in life

328
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,000
that we cannot do, Johan.

329
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:44,100
I'd like to see Esther once before she's buried.

330
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,300
Good afternoon.

331
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,500
Good afternoon.

332
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,000
Poor Johan.

333
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,400
Johan will be all right now.

334
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,200
Thank you, Marianne.

335
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:57,300
Dad sent us to see how you're doing.

336
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:01,000
We're fine.
Come here and say hello to Mummy.

337
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:10,000
-Hello, Mummy.
-Hello, Mummy.

338
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:12,700
Hello, Autghe.

339
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:16,100
Hello, Anita.

340
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:32,300
Dad, Mum has woken up!

341
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,100
Don't bother him, Anita.

342
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,800
Be strong, brother.

343
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:54,900
Come on, Dad, come on!
Mum wants to see you.

344
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,700
Come, come, come.
Come on, Dad, come on!

345
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:01,800
That's enough, Anita!

346
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,800
Let's go, Dad. Come on!

347
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:08,800
Come on, Dad, come on, Dad...

348
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,900
Go with her, Johan.

349
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:43,100
...and Grandpa helped us get dressed
this morning,

350
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:46,000
and Grandma did my hair Sunday style.

351
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,300
The grandparents brought us here.
They're out there, waiting for you.

352
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:55,100
And Jackob also came, and Anita.
They're all out there.

353
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:57,700
Greth didn't dress up.

354
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:12,100
Uncle Jak came, too, and Aunt Maria.

355
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:14,600
And the other Aunt Greth, and

356
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:18,400
our cousins from the north.
