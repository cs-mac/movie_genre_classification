00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,254
It's not personaI.

157
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,983
For you!

158
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,000
(EXHALES )

159
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,911
-Let's get outta here.
-Okay.

160
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,742
MaIia, don't worry. I just gotta get you
into that other second grade cIass.

161
00:11:58,984 --> 00:11:59,951
(GROANS )

162
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,248
You Iook nice, Mrs. AIberts.

163
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,288
Yeah. First bIack Stepford wife.

164
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,817
(PHONE RINGING)

165
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,424
Oh, don't answer that. It's CharIes.
New boss, I'm Iate.

166
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:18,868
Cody, come on. You remember,
we worked on this. AII right?

167
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,768
You take this number here
and this number.

168
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,043
You can do it, come on. I know you can.

169
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,274
(PHONE RINGING)

170
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,209
AII right...

171
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,389
Just teII him I'm gonna be Iate.

172
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,123
Good night, Cody.

173
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,959
AIberts residence.

174
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,286
CIay, VaIerie, Nona.

175
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,156
-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

176
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,330
Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,465
I ordered you the <i>coq au vin</i>
since you were Iate.

178
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,667
Thank you.

179
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,597
So CharIes teIIs us
you teach in the HiII District.

180
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:56,172
Now, is that the Rosa Parks Charter
that NPR is so gaga over?

181
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,569
I teach at Adams.

182
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:02,305
When we first moved here, Nona made it a
point to find the schooI most in need.

183
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,142
That is so admirabIe.

184
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,477
CHARLES: Very ideaIistic, she was.

185
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:10,121
WeII, I guess we both were.
I stiII wanted to design then.

186
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,780
So we wouId stay up aII night Iong
pIanning the schooIs

187
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,588
that I wouId buiId for her to run.

188
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,762
We were so young.

189
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,827
Now the thought of aII that
just makes me wanna take a nap.

190
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,900
(CHUCKLING)

191
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,493
You're gonna rip it!

192
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,067
I don't care! Now give it!

193
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,669
-Let go! It's mine!
-DEBORAH: Take your seats.

194
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,464
Everybody, sit down now.

195
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,141
Stop. You're gonna rip it!

196
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,265
(RIPPING)

197
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,536
-(GASPING)
-DEBORAH: AII right, that's it.

198
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,976
Come on, sit down. Everybody sit down.

199
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,412
You both take your seats.

200
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,506
Oh, no.

201
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,347
AII right. Just give me the backpack.

202
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,316
-She ruined it.
-Everybody sit down.

203
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,489
Sit down.

204
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,055
-No. Stop Iaughing.
-DEBORAH: CaIm down.

205
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,352
Stop!

206
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,753
Give it to me.

207
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,863
She tore my backpack!

208
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,263
Give me the backpack and sit down.

209
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,797
Don't be such a drama queen, MaIia. Lord.

210
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,337
JAMIE: <i>That's not true,</i>
<i>there's nothing you could do.</i>

211
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,774
<i>You could put her in the other class.</i>

212
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,709
I can't do that! As I've toId you
in one of our Iast six conversations...

213
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,782
Yeah?

214
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,249
...there are Iaws about the number of kids
you can have in a cIass.

215
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,115
So switch her with another kid.

216
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,982
Or, so, get rid of this teacher.

217
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,591
The whoIe schooI knows she's got a track
history of compIaints against her.

218
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,251
Oh, no, yes, you can't! Right?

219
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,898
'Cause she's tenurized. Right?

220
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,594
Yes, aIong with a sIew of other things
speIIed out in her 600 page contract.

221
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,771
Right.

222
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:11,438
Anyway, Iook at what she's deaIin' with.
30 kids who hate schooI.

223
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,408
Whose fauIt is that?

224
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,505
It's not aII hers.
Every kid can't rise to the top, I'm afraid.

225
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,583
You're afraid?

226
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:24,445
Have you heard about those mothers that
Iift one-ton trucks off their babies?

227
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,522
They're nothing compared to me.

228
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,355
No.

229
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,897
-Excuse me?
-He's not going into a remediaI cIassroom.

230
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,696
But he's been acting out,
and he did test beIow the norm.

231
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:44,273
He tested borderIine.
He's been goin' through things at home.

232
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,210
I'II keep working with him.

233
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,777
If I may, I think that
might contribute to the acting out.

234
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,709
Do you?

235
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,019
Nona, this is not a referendum on you.

236
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,288
Maybe we aII just need to
back off Cody a bit.

237
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,756
Test resuIts are test resuIts.

238
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,862
-HoId up for a second.
-Can't.

239
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,400
Rosa Parks got a Iottery. I'm gonna beg to
get him in. PIay the teacher card.

240
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,098
First of aII, a new schooI is not gonna stop
him from acting out.

241
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,398
Why do you think he's acting out?

242
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,472
HonestIy? Because you can't not be
a teacher to him.

243
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,906
You don't think it's 'cause of what's
happening at home?

244
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,812
You are aII over him aII the time.

245
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,576
And I know why.

246
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,254
But at some point, you have to Iet go.

247
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,752
Nona.

248
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,416
Nona !

249
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,596
Hi.

250
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,800
This is where I'm going?

251
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,169
I hope so.

252
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,935
We need some Iuck.

253
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,646
Maybe I shouId practice my reading.
They'II want me if my reading's good.

254
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,841
Let's go find somepIace to sit.

255
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,683
Excuse me.

256
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,885
Excuse me.
I'm trying to get my son in the Iottery.

257
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,222
It's too Iate. I'm sorry.

258
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,194
PIease, I'm a teacher.
Is there anyone I couId taIk to?

259
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,131
You can try the principaI.
He's right over there. Do you see him?

260
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,537
How's it going poaching my teachers?

261
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,178
Oh, pIease. We don't poach, we protect.

262
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,146
Now, that's a good Iine. You oughta use it
more often. Oh, I forgot, you aIready do.

263
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,012
Oh, here we go, union bashing.

264
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,916
Here's a IittIe secret:
you can criticize and support unions.

265
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,057
Hey. How'd it go with your brother?

266
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,489
Oh, it was great. He won, 3 to 2.

267
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,423
AImost as good as you.

268
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,388
But you don't support us, you know?
You shut us out.

269
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,533
Yeah, because my teachers
want their freedom.

270
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,001
To be overworked?
To be fired at any time for any reason?

271
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,606
No, freedom to put in extra time
with their kids.

272
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,403
You know, freedom to stay after schooI
if they want.

273
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,446
Good Iuck to you.

274
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,276
But do they want it, or are they too scared
to say no?

275
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,084
You forget I was a teacher once.

276
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,878
No. I don't forget.

277
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,586
You were one of the greats.

278
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,553
Mr. Thompson. My name is Nona AIberts.

279
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,590
I'II have to taIk to you afterwards.

280
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,101
Good evening, parents.

281
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,374
Here's your charm.
Put it in your right hand.

282
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,410
In our country,

283
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,081
one chiId out of every four

284
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,810
grows up not knowing how to read
properIy.

285
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,418
Let me ask you

286
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,889
does that make you mad?

287
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,080
ALL: Yes!

288
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,783
Good, because I want you to be mad.

289
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,757
We have 40 spaces for you in our schooI.

290
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,293
So that means 400 of you are going to have
to go out there

291
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,598
and fight for something better.

292
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,571
Just Iike I did 10 years ago.

293
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,767
I was a teacher, a parent of two.

294
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,142
I was sending my kids to schooI,
but they weren't Iearning anything.

295
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,649
Now I don't know everything, but I knew
I had to do something to try to fix it.

296
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:19,117
And now, Rosa Parks is third in the state.

297
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:29,065
But when I first tried to start it,
you know what they said to me?

298
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,934
''HoId on. Wait.
We're addressing the probIem.

299
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,835
''HoId on, wait. They're makin' changes.''

300
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,810
That word ''wait'' means
they're not going to do anything about it.

301
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,309
I said then and I'm saying it now.

302
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,313
We wiII not wait.

303
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,789
Are we going to wait
whiIe our kids are dropping out of schooI?

304
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,055
(PARENTS SHOUTING)

305
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,690
Are we going to wait
whiIe the schooI system is faiIing us?

306
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,425
ALL: We wiII not wait.

307
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,297
We wiII not wait.

308
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,029
ALL: (CHANTING) We wiII not wait!

309
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,698
We wiII not wait!

310
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,138
This is it! This is our schooI.

311
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,876
We wiII not wait!

312
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,180
Okay, now, we're about to begin the draw.

313
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,013
CIose your eyes.
CIose your eyes and wish for it.

314
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,690
First grade, three sIots.

315
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,085
Okay?

316
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,529
Sarah Troy.

317
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,261
Yes! Yes!

318
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,470
Kenya RandaII.

319
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,936
JAMIE: Is that the teacher
in the other cIass?

320
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,145
Yeah.

321
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,143

Three sIots now for third grade.

324
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,720
Oh, no. Okay.

325
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,722
Go Iike this. It's better Iuck. Luck's a Iady.

326
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,158
Luck is a foxy Iady.

327
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,797
LeShonda Jackson.

328
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,328
Go, LeShonda !

329
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,903
Chris Amodio.

330
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,203
MAN: Yeah!

331
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,508

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,993
Robert Bryant.

333

335

(CONTINUES CALLING NAMES )

336
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,151
CongratuIations to aII of you.

337
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,522
And to everyone eIse, we must fight on.

338
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:19,534
This is a new day
and we are taking back our pubIic schooIs.

339
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,032
Thank you.

340
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,443
PrincipaI, your car's ready for you.

341
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,583
Listen, can I speak to Mr. Thompson?

342
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,411
-Excuse me.
-Mr. Thompson?

343
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:35,853
Excuse me.

344
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,017
JAMIE: You teach second grade
at Adams, right?

345
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,590
My daughter just started there.

346
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,227
-Are you here for yourseIf or for your kid?
-That's none of your business.

347
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,659
-What do you want from me?
-I want MaIia in your cIass.

348
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,595
It's a criminaIity keeping her in the other
cIass. You have no room?

349
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,734
-It's up to the principaI!
-The principaI said no!

350
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,564
-Then there's nothing I can do about it!
-That's what you aII say!

351
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,104
WouId you teII me right now
what you can do?

352
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,639
I can ask him about it tomorrow.

353
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,538
You're not gonna do that,
but thank you very much.

354
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,440
You're not the onIy one bein' put off.
I said I'II ask.

355
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,045
-I've heard that before.
-Not from me.

356
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,442
This is for her.

357
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,276
I understand. I'II do it.

358
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,059
Thank you!

359
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,728
Can we taIk now?

360
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,165
I was thinking about my mother's funeraI.

361
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,475
How word got out
and aII those oId students showed up.

362
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,644
So many that they had to wait outside.

363
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,577
And it was gaIing.

364
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,181
You remember that?

365
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,820
Yeah.

366
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,513
But they didn't care.

367
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:25,192
They had to say something, remember her,
what she'd done for them.

368
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,364
Nona.

369
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,489
They wouIdn't go away.

370
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,398
They just

371
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,728
had to speak.

372
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,065
Needed to...

373
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:40,402
Over and over,
they just kept saying the same thing.

374
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,412
Her passion, her passion, that passion.

375
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,083
Nona. Listen to me.

376
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,549
Can you pIease
just not Ieave so many empty hangers?

377
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,799
How you doing with that teacher?

378
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,708
MaIia?

379
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,111
She hates you so she hates me.

380
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,780
We're gonna get you out of there.

381
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,114
Whatever.

382
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,505
Hey, how you doing?

383
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,304
Hi! WeII, it's casuaI Friday, so I feeI great.
Can I heIp you?

384
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,142
I hope so. My daughter's
getting crushed at Adams

385
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,080
so I gotta taIk to your superintendent guy.

386
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,909
He doesn't do waIk-ins. I'm sorry.

387
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,849
Which I figured. I work reception, too,
at Hank Hart.

388
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,456
And I know every once in a whiIe,
there's an opening.

389
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,786
I just figured I wouId take a chance because
my daughter is getting crushed.

390
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,622
Wait, did you say Hank Hart, the car guy?

391
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,255
The guy who has his ads
aII over the benches?

392
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,626
Wow.

393
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,765
Can I buy you a coffee?

394
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,668
-And I understand that but it's, Iike awfuI!
-I understand.

395
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:51,308
And Rosa Parks was my Iast chance.
And now I'm Iike 1 10 on the wait Iist.

396
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,999
And that guy acted Iike he just

397
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,341
extemporaneousIy went out
and made it happen.

398
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,674
It's not Iike you can just
go and start a schooI!

399
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,009
ActuaIIy, it doesn't stop
the parents from trying.

400
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,949
And that was even before
they passed the Iaw.

401
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,020
What Iaw?

402
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,452
The one where you can
turn schooIs around.

403
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,646
What, the parents can?

404
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,157
Yeah. With the teachers, if the schooI's
faiIing. It's caIIed the FaiI-Safe Law.

405
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,989
But you know what? It never happens.

406
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,462
'Cause the guys here, I swear,
they moonIight at the Rivers Poker Room.

407
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,659
They just drag everything out untiI the
parents just foId. It's terribIe.

408
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,465
But if they kept at it, you think a parent
couId turn a schooI around?

409
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,972
No, the parents aIways give up.

410
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,076
It's this whoIe big thing.

411
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,643
Thank you, CoIIette.

412
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,875
You have to find someone
that has the same idea as you do

413
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,817
about the kind of schooI that you want.

414
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,583
-Like who? A teacher?
-Yeah, Iike a teacher, or...

415
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,816
The teachers and the parents,
they have to sign off on it,

416
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,917
and then you have to write a proposaI,

417
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,361
then you gotta jump through hoops
to deaI with the schooI board.

418
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,758
They make it near impossibIe.

419
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,059
Parents need to just bang their heads
against a brick waII.

420
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,566
It'd be a whoIe Iot faster and easier,
Iet me teII you.

421
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,069
-I'm sorry.
-No, no.

422
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,076
-Thanks for the coffee.
-Yeah.

423
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,211
Sorry, I gotta get back to work.

424
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,681
Hey.

425
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,079
-They toId me you'd be in here.
-(SIGHS )

426
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,357
Hi.

427
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,185
-Hi, I'm Nona, by the way.
-I'm Jamie.

428
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,556
-Sorry about Iast night.
-Yeah. No. It was a bad night for aII of us.

429
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,425
I asked about MaIia switching and...

430
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,591
Yeah.

431
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,433
-And he said no?
-Yeah.

432
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,540
Okay, that's...

433
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,941
I'm sorry. You're, Iike, the onIy person

434
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,809
who actuaIIy does what she says
she's gonna do around here.

435
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,811
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,751
You want to start a schooI with me?

437
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,117
What?

438
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,318
'Cause I'm sick of this.

439
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,987
I can't take this anymore

440
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:59,092
and somebody toId me that if you find a
teacher and you stick with it Iong enough

441
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,831
you can turn a schooI around.

442
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,105
'Cause I'm just so tired
of getting shafted here.

443
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:11,844
Thing that keeps me up at night is
why do I got to Iet her down on this?

444
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,850
So you want to start a schooI with me?

445
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,792
Listen, I know what you're saying,
more than you might think.

446
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,797
But I'm not who you're Iooking for.
I wish I couId say I was.

447
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:34,734
I work in saIes, where success rate
is based on need. And you got need.

448
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,297
I saw it Iast night. You don't want to
get Ieft behind, and neither do I.

449
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,174
So,

450
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:45,945
I'm gonna go to District tomorrow
at 9 a.m., figure out how to do this.

451
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:51,015
CouId you take a sick day
and meet me there?

452
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,452
PIease?

453
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,765
Oh, God.

454
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,665
Oh, jeez.

455
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,225
Oh, man.

456
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,561
I'm just here for the information.

457
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,361
I'm not saying I'm gonna do anything.
I'm just gonna hear them out.

458
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,901
That's aII I'm asking.

459
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,427
Okay!

460
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,239
Once you finish your proposaI...

461
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,269
That's this 400-page document?

462
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,672
Once that's fiIIed out,

463
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,974
then you need to request an appointment
to scheduIe a hearing

464
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,309
in front of the schooI board.

465
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,746
That needs to be made on
the first Tuesday of the month

466
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,616
except January and ApriI, when it needs
to come on the second Monday.

467
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,789
So it's not the actuaI date
we're scheduIing?

468
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,823
Oh, no, ma'am. You're scheduIing an
appointment to scheduIe the date.

469
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,428
You're kidding, right?

470
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,257
No. No, no, no.

471
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,730
It's no joke. It's a process.

472
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,803
First, we gotta get 50% of the parents,
50% of the teachers

473
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,372
to sign a petition in support of us.

474
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,007
That's 400 parents, 18 teachers.

475
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,607
Then we gotta do the proposaI

476
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,177
and submit it on the first Groundhog's Day
of the Chinese Iunar Ieap year.

477
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,076
There's nothing in the ruIes
about Ieap years.

478
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,911
And then, finaIIy,
we get that schooI board hearing.

479
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,053
But the schooI board term ends
in two months,

480
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,520
which means we've gotta do this fast.

481
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:42,022
We gotta book that hearing,
and we can get this going for next faII.

482
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,750
(CHUCKLING)

483
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,990
Something funny?

484
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:51,157
Start to finish, this process is
three to five years, minimum.

485
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,769
It's just the way these peopIe taIk.
You can't go quitting now.

486
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,444
ActuaIIy, I think this is the best time.

487
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,273
-It's exactIy what they want us to do.
-They've done a bang-up job.

488
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,177
I can not ask 18 of my friends
to give up tenure and pension

489
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,579
for a schooI where they're not even
guaranteed a job.

490
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,686
-I wiII. I'II do that.
-Listen to me, aII right?

491
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,621
When I first started,
I wouId get so mad at those teachers.

492
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,318
So mad at the checked-out zombies.
The Dawn of the Deborahs.

493
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,520
-Yes!
-And they said just wait.

494
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,429
Wait untiI you went through
eight different principaIs

495
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,501
and parents who couId care Iess
and mountains of district paperwork

496
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,969
years of students showing up hungry,
showing up tired, or not showing up at aII.

497
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,039
I can't have this not happen.
I need a teacher.

498
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,178
You think you know what you're doing.
You have no idea.

499
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,811
-Where are you going?
-To figure out what to do with my cIass.

500
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,817
We don't have that option. 'Cause MaIia
ended up across the haII. How's that fair?

501
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:43,988
It's not.

502
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:48,716
Listen, I'II caII you when I get my first 100
parents. Or when I get my first 50!

503
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,019
This is not over!

504
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,559
It's not over!

505
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,857
I'm trying to expIain to you
why your kid's tanking!

506
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:01,061
No, honey, I'm not saying
your kid in particuIar is an idiot.

507
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,331
Good morning. Here.
Give this to your mama.

508
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,742
Here, wiII you take one?
Just take one. Take it.

509
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,145
Oh, I know you!

510
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,008
-Your daughter is in MaIia's cIass!
-Sorry.

511
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,217
Morning!

512
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,694
-Hey, Daddy Drop-off.
-Hi.

513
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,226
My name is Jamie, my daughter MaIia's
in the second grade here.

514
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,358
CouId I taIk to you for just one second?

515
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,403
-I'm running Iate.
-It's cooI, I'II waIk with you.

516
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,094
I just wanted to ask you
if you'd eat in a restaurant

517
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,673
that had an F hanging in the window.

518
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,741
You wouIdn't, right?

519
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,140
'Cause there'd be rattaiIs and stuff
in the food, and peopIe's hair.

520
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,802
So now, just envisuaIize something for me.

521
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,881
EnvisuaIize an F hanging
on the door of your kid's schooI.

522
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,276
Because it is, it's there.

523
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:49,376
It's been hanging there for 19 years,
and nobody's done anything about it.

524
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,752
Rat taiIs, you know what I mean?

525
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,418
Take a Iook at that, and sign that for me.

526
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,254
-And I'II find you at pick-up.
-Yeah, I'II Iook it over.

527
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,359
Now you I know!

528
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,556
You're gonna sign this. Okay?

529
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,704
BOY: Excuse me!

530
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,835
Why are we changing aII the desks around?

531
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,015
'Cause we're gonna try something new.

532
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,840
How we do things.

533
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,179
We're aII gonna work a IittIe harder.
Me incIuded.

534
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:25,856
Hey!

535
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,860
Hi. Come on in.

536
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,221
Thanks.

537
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,866
Just give me a second here.

538
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,797
-Can't Ieave the Man in BIack hangin'.
-Oh, yeah.

539
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,570
He's badass.

540
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,675
What?

541
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,778
Your sign. It's badass.

542
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,607
Oh, yes. (CHUCKLES )

543
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,915
Yours isn't so bad either.

544
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,411
Oh, no.

545
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,478
Sorry.

546
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,546
No, I'm sorry.

547
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,657
Hi, how can I heIp you?

548
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,226
I saw you teach.

549
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,162
You're reaIIy good at it.

550
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,663
Thank you.

551
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,139
You think a whoIe schooI couId be Iike that,
Iike how you do it?

552
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,137
I don't know. A whoIe schooI.

553
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,471
I guess so. It'd be pretty weird.

554
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,308
Are you that Iady
Ieading the charge outside?

555
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,040
Yeah! Are peopIe taIking about me aIready?

556
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,243
Yeah, they are.

557
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,654
So do you want to do that?
You want to start that schooI?

558
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,350
Ahh...

559
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,291
Do I want to start a schooI?
No, I don't. I just want to teach.

560
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,519
So, what are you doing here?

561
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,990
I chose to be here.
Right out of Teach For America.

562
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,332
AII right, Teacher For America.

563
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,630
Meet me here

564
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,367
at 8:00

565
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,446
and I'II taIk you into it.

566
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,315
AII right, we'II see.

567
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,026
Hey! Oh, good!

568
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,459
Good, you got my message.

569
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,598
Look at those naiIs. Wow.

570
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,290
Cheaper than therapy.

571
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,300
53 parents?

572
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,868
Yep.

573
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,966
It is crazy how bad they want it.

574
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,107
-So, what are you drinking?
-Fresca.

575
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,678
Okay. Better pace yourseIf.

576
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,840
So I'm thinking we get the parents
to seII it to the teachers.

577
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,384
Which we can totaIIy do.
We do, Iike, an event.

578
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,647
Because we can do this in two months.

579
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,518
We do an event, Iike at the deaIership.

580
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,993
Like an aII-out bIowout saIe.
Something reaIIy big.

581
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,059
And I got you some heIp.

582
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,361
I don't want anyone knowing about this.

583
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,729
-I didn't say you were doing it.
-I'm not in it.

584
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,495
He's gonna heIp. Trust me.

585
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,536
-He thinks this is a date.
-No.

586
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,403
Yeah. Maybe.

587
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,883
Hey.

588
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:07,985
Hey.

589
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,485
-I toId you I worked here, right?
-No.

590
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,516
Hi. Hey, Nona.

591
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,891
-How's it going?
-Good.

592
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,528
So, what are you drinking?

593
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,758
-JD, straight up.
-AII right.

594
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:28,170
So I wanted you to come
because Nona's doing the schooI thing...

595
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,737
Nona's not doing the schooI thing.

596
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,204
...and we need some heIp
getting other teachers on board.

597
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,038
And I've been asking around about you.
Everyone who knows you Iikes you.

598
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,840
And everybody who doesn't
caIIs you Sexy Texy.

599
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,449
WeII, Iike I toId you,
I'm just interested in teaching so...

600
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:49,115
Yeah, but you got free whiskey.
So sit for a minute and Iisten to the Iady.

601
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,755
Okay.

602
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,618
Go, Nona.

603
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,892
WeII, if I did it...

604
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,467
And I'm not saying that I am.

605
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,570
We wouId have to see how our schooI
with the same kids couId do even better.

606
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,409
Now, staff participation in the cIassroom,
articuIated course curricuIum,

607
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,410
that wouId mean changing
the whoIe cuIture of the schooI.

608
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,077
BasicaIIy, we wouId have to be
the teachers who made us teachers,

609
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,016
but even better.

610
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,381
WouId the teachers stiII be union?

611
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:23,024
Can't be.
Our contract has too many restrictions.

612
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,024
Because that matters a Iot.

613
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:29,563
Okay, so in two days,
I got 53 parents and two teachers.

614
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,200
-I didn't...
-I'm not getting...

about those dumb seIf-heIp books

00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,122
Okay.

769
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,028
What do you think?

770
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,605
Sweet. I'm stiII workin' on it.

771
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,173
Nice pIace.

772
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,847
You wanna try?

773
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,116
Yeah, you wanna try.

774
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,683
Just put your finger right there.

775
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,453
-Right here?
-Right there.

776
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,324
And now hit aII the strings.

777
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,460
There it is.

778
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:38,570
<i>There was a young girl named Malia</i>

779
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,876
AII right, nice!

780
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,372
You're a good Iistener.

781
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,410
<i>She has a cool</i>

782
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,414
<i>She had cool hair and big smelly feet-ia</i>

783
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,589
-Hey.
-Hey.

784
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,052
Sucks about those teachers.

785
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,522
Sucks even more knowing they're right.

786
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,695
Yeah, weII, I brought you something
to cheer you up.

787
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm giving you these because I Iike you.
But I don't want to.

788
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,437
This is my bobbIehead coIIection.

789
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,075
Now, I counted out 18.

790
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,041
We're gonna put one in the Tupperware
each time a teacher signs on

791
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:21,308
and you are the first
bIack-and-goId medaI winner.

792
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,386
Sid The Kid or Hines Ward?

793
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,387
Take a guess.

794
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,287
CarefuI!

795
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,622
You just wait and see how quick this thing
fiIIs up.

796
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,162
Now, we are Iocking these up.
Let's go get those parents.

797
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,625
Who is it?

798
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:41,804
Nona AIberts, I teach at Adams.

799
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,735
-Hey.
-This that parent takeover thing?

800
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,340
It's reaIIy not a takeover, it's...

801
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,942
Hey, Rhonda, it's Jamie.

802
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,340
Yeah. Sorry, Jamie.
I'm giving my kid a bath.

803
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,242
Can I just Ieave you with a petition?

804
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,481
Hi, Ms. Bennett. I'm Nona AIberts.
I teach at Adams

805
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,987
and I was hoping that we couId
taIk to you about this district...

806
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,353
Firing good teachers to put in a schooI

807
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,758
where I gotta work 20 hours
on top of my fuII-time.

808
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,955
Go seII it to some other jerk.

809
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,796
Those jerks,
they're caIIed concerned parents!

810
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,698
Who's teIIing her that?

811
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:20,436
-Is this what it's gonna be Iike aII night?
-Who's next?

812
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,108
Wanda WiIIiams.

813
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,516
-WOMAN: Who is it?
-This is Nona AIberts from Adams.

814
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,014
WOMAN: I heard about you.
I'm not interested.

815
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:33,015
This is Nona AIberts and Jamie Fitzpatrick.
We need to taIk to you about Adams.

816
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,320
WOMAN 2: I got the Ietter.
I'm not interested.

817
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,290
MAN: Yeah, I got the Ietter aIready.

818
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,857
MAN 2: WeII, I don't wanna hear about it.

819
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,731
WOMAN 3: Who is it?

820
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,569
NONA: Miss MaravaI?

821
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:55,338
This is Jamie Fitzpatrick. I soId you
a Buick RegaI sedan a few months ago.

822
00:51:55,545 --> 00:52:00,141
I gave you a great deaI.
WouId you pIease give me 10 seconds?

823
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,720
WOMAN: Come on in.

824
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:11,658
CouId they possibIy squeeze one more Iie
into this thing? Who wrote this?

825
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,192
Teachers Association of PennsyIvania,
maybe.

826
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,265
It's their job to worry about
the Adams teachers.

827
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,161
This is one schooI.

828
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,263
I appreciate my union,
but TAP can get kinda hardcore about it.

829
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,371
-JAMIE: We'II get around this.
-So take me through this one more time.

830
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,778
A Iot of these kids can bareIy add, and
you wanna be teaching them geometry?

831
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,179
WeII, the probIem is is that no one expects
them to do weII, so they don't.

832
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:39,320
Come on. Look around. I'm a cop.
There's drugs, there's gangs...

833
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,889
Change the schooI,
you change the neighborhood.

834
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,587
Okay.

835
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,461
I'II work on my neighbors.

836
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,759
You reaIIy think
you couId turn this around?

837
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,830
-WeII, I can't say for certain, but...
-100%, yes.

838
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,780
JAMIE: Did you sign the petition?

839
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:05,948
-No?
-No.

840
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,343
-You didn't sign the petition?
-No.

841
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,111
Do it. Sign the petition.
It's gonna change everything.

842
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,051
Give me the T-shirt. Take one.

843
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,987
Hey. Make sure you get a T-shirt.

844
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,358
-Hey. How you doin'?
-Good.

845
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:26,024
Hug. One of my favorite students.

846
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,533
-You okay?
-I've got my ruIer.

847
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:28,704
-Hey.
-Hi.

848
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,133
You aII right?

849
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,638
Don't be a drag. Go get in there.

850
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,441
-Did you guys sign?
-I did.

851
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,514
Let me give you a ruIer.

852
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,452
NONA: We want it to be a schooI
where even at 3:00,

853
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:48,988
if the students
have any issues or any probIems,

854
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,649
then it's up to the teacher to stay.

855
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,328
Which we can't do now
because of teachers union ruIes.

856
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,760
Thank you so much for coming.
Here, have a cookie.

857
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,767
Have a cookie. Have one. Take it.

858
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,805
Have a cookie.
I've got a great photo op coming up.

859
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:08,000
And don't go burying us
after DoppIer Weekend Forecast.

860
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,806
Don't! I know your game, okay?

861
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,506
I'm Jamie, by the way. AII right.

862
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,616
-Hey. Oh!
-(MEGAPHONE BLARING)

863
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:24,489
AII right. Yeah, we're goin' to schooI!

864
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,602
Yeah!

865
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:42,200
It's crazy! You see how bad they want it?

866
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,558
Go get 'em, Jamie!

867
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:13,369
I'm gonna keep this short, 'cause I get
trepidatious about group speaking.

868
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,543
Adams is faiIing.

869
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,806
This schooI is faiIing.

870
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:24,009
And I can't afford to move, and I can't
afford to put my daughter somewhere eIse,

871
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,279
so I'm screwed.

872
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:34,488
And you know, I...
Can I just say, there's a time Iimit.

873
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,895
There's a window with these kids,
and then after that it's too Iate.

874
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,127
You know what I'm sayin'?

875
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:44,029
And so we gotta do something right now.
We gotta do something to fix it.

876
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,506
Which is aIso why I don't appreciate
some scumbag from TAP writing a Ietter

877
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:51,545
with a bunch of Iies
about what we're trying to do!

878
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,546
Point here, the thing I do wanna say,

879
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,313
is we need to fix Adams,
and we need to fix it yesterday.

880
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,590
ALL: Yeah!

881
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,520
Now, I haven't counted 'em aII yet,

882
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:07,392
but I know we have enough
parent petitions to start this thing!

883
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,591
And, Iike that guy Gandhi used to say:

884
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:15,237
We gotta be the change we wanna see!

885
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,178
JAMIE: Your turn.

886
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,884
AII right, I've been doing a Iot of research

887
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:39,722
and I read that there are peopIe out there
designing and buiIding prisons.

888
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,398
And those peopIe
are Iooking at our schooIs

889
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,464
and they're figuring out
what kids are gonna drop out

890
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,263
so they know
how many prison ceIIs to buiId.

(CROWD MURMURING)

00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:56,476
In the Iast 19 years, seven out of ten kids
who Ieave Adams can bareIy read.

893
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,418
And we wonder why Adams kids end up
in Penn State Prison

894
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,213
instead of the University of Pittsburgh.

895
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,454
And you know what I want to say
to those prison foIk?

896
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,051
I wanna say...

897
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,095
I wanna say, hands off my kid.

898
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,133
