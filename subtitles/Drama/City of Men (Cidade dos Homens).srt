1
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,646
"CITY OF MEN"

2
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,726
Shit, Fasto.
It's fucking hot today.

3
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,061
Hot, my ass.
A gangsta never feels the heat.

4
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,331
-Sure is hot, man.
-Hot as hell.

5
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,666
-Fucking sun...
-lt's damn hot.

6
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,339
Beach time!

7
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,887
-You crazy?
-Down to the beach, man.

8
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,952
That's asking for trouble, brother.

9
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,988
I'm putting on my suit, dude.

10
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,456
-You serious, Midnight?
-You bet, Tina.

11
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,221
Use the hose, bro.
I'll even hold it for you.

12
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,991
What 's that, Fasto?
You'll hold my hose?

13
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,634
Hey, man,
he wants to hold my hose!

14
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,667
Fuck off!

15
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,038
Come on, let's go to the beach.

16
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,869
You wanna go for a swim?
Okay, buddy.

17
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,181
That's why I like you, bro.

18
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,875
Tina, go get the walkie-talkies
and guns in the shack.

19
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,249
Bette, tell the cops
we're coming through.

20
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,620
You wanna swim?
You got it, bro!

21
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,721
Hey, Wallace!

22
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,937
Ace!

23
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,442
Wake up, honey!

24
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:23,144
I gotta go to work.
Look after Clayton, okay?

25
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,686
I'll be back tonight.
Bye! Love you...

26
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,771
-Hey, Ace! What's up?
-Hey, how's it going?

27
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,703
Remember what today is?
The 3rd!

28
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,045
-Look over there!
-Where are they going?

29
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,044
-Let's go see.
-I can't, man. I got Clayton.

30
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,876
Well, later!

31
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,060
Come on!

32
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,492
Wallace! Wait!

33
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,374
-Bikinis and nice asses...
-Yeah...

34
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,372
Bikinis and asses!

35
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,616
Bet you can't pick one up...

36
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,148
Look at her, son...

37
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,911
Your sister Tina's gotten so thin.

38
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,206
Down to beach!

39
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,205
So, Midnight, what about those
soccer shirts for the boys?

40
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,146
We'll talk about it later.
Okay, coach?

41
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,187
You stand guard here.
And you, over there.

42
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,117
I'll call you when we're
ready to come back up.

43
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,606
-I'm in for a dive.
-The sun feels great, Midnight!

44
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,300
I'd prefer a private beach.

45
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,275
-Private!
-Sure, just order one on the hill!

46
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:32,110
You're asking for it!
You'd have to take care of it for me.

47
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:36,755
Carry all the sand up...

48
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,522
Come with daddy...

49
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,719
-lt sure is hot.
-Tell me about it!

50
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,631
All these guards just so your cousin
can go swimming!

51
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,828
Midnight hasn't left the hill
in 3 years.

52
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,333
So what's the set up, Fasto?

53
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,306
-Two up there...
-Two up there!

54
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,480
-One at the kiosk.
-One at the kiosk there!

55
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,808
Two others behind us.

56
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,677
-The kid, by the road.
-Eyes peeled!

57
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,409
Do your job, guys!

58
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,145
Midnight, check out
that Japanese babe!

59
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,347
-And the dark-haired chick!
-I like her!

60
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,493
Too bad, me too.

61
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,287
Shit, you want them all!

62
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,455
Okay, I'll take
the Japanese one.

63
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,758
That's cool, bro.

64
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,801
-Hold this...
-Hey, I wanna go in too.

65
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,905
-I need you to watch these.
-Come on, man.

66
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,836
Watch them.

67
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,431
-Hey, Wallace.
-What's up?

68
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,969
-How are things?
-Cool, man.

69
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,537
Look, Ace. Fasto even put
a soldier up on the rock.

70
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,304
Wow, I really dig that Camila.
She sure is cute.

71
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,775
Wallace, listen to me.

72
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,075
Forget about her.
Fiel never lets her out of his sight.

73
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,984
So watch out,
she could mean trouble.

74
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,657
-I'll find away.
-Really?

75
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,717
Where's Clayton?

76
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,224
-Let's go swim!
-Let's go in, Wallace.

77
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,025
-See you, Wallace.
-See you.

78
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,767
Tina, watch this for me.

79
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,563
You're my shadow now?

80
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,622
It's good to be Midnight!

81
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,448
I'm pissed off, Fiel.

82
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,621
That Midnight is a real asshole.

83
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,991
-Keep cool.
-A real asshole. How you doing, bro?

84
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,066
Look at this, I stole it.
It's cool, man. Listen...

85
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,737
-What is it, a radio?
-MP3, dude.

86
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,443
Yesterday was the 2nd, wasn't it?

87
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,272
-Yeah.
-Day of the Dead.

88
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,812
So today's the 3rd.

89
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,945
-That's clever, Ace.
-lt's the 3rd, man!

90
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,515
-Right! Happy birthday!
-My birthday!

91
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,716
Happy birthday to you...

92
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,760
Hey, wait! That means
my birthday's next month!

93
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,625
Put it here!

94
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,064
-Damn! 18 years old!
-Yeah, both of us!

95
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:42,698
Ever notice that rich kids,
at 18, they get to drive.

96
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,442
And poor kids?
They get to go to work.

97
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,408
That sucks.

98
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,514
I'm 18 and I've only screwed
one girl in my life.

99
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,310
And on top of that, it's my wife!
Jesus, man...

100
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,817
And Cristiane got pregnant
the first time.

101
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,521
Just my luck.

102
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,989
Hey, Caju!
Watch the kid!

103
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,859
I'll be 18 and I don't even know
who my father is.

104
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:14,963
Even worse, it'll be marked on
my lD forever "father unknown".

105
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,074
Forget that business
about your father.

106
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,541
Look at me.
I forgot mine ages ago.

107
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,715
I can't, Ace. I just can't.

108
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,176
Let's go chill in the water.

109
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,578
Come on...

110
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,184
Hey, got any Proibidão CDs?

111
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,120
-Yeah, good stuff.
-What about Pagode music?

112
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,126
-Sure, I got... I got everything.
-Shit!

113
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,666
-That guy!
-What?

114
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,700
I think he's my father.
But I'm not sure.

115
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,499
Yeah, the spitting image!

116
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,765
-He's not sure either.
-Go on...

117
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,375
Only my mother knows
for sure, I think.

118
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:56,241
-For sure? Go talk to him!
-No way! You kidding?

119
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,282
-You sure look alike!
-Stop it!

120
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,824
Hey, mister!

121
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,526
Hey, kid! Come here!

122
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,301
-How are you, Wallace?
-Hi!

123
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,264
-How's your mom?
-Okay, I guess.

124
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,365
-How's school?
-Great, they're on strike.

125
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,835
On strike, that's great?

126
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,804
-Something I can do, Wallace?
-No.

127
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,419
-Ace?
-What?

128
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,988
-I have an idea.
-What?

129
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,318
An idea, man!
C'mon, let's go!

130
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,989
-Just say it's for the papers.
-What papers?

131
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,630
The lD papers.

132
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,027
-What's this about?
-You'll see.

133
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,951
You know his name, grandma!
Tell me!

134
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,925
He never even showed up
when you were born.

135
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,531
He went to play soccer,
your mother was in pain.

136
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,193
I asked Pedreira to go get him,
but he hasn't shown up since.

137
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,172
So what, grandma?
Just tell me, please.

138
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,811
Dona Elvira,
he just needs the name for his lD.

139
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,010
-Wasn't he a waiter?
-Shut up, woman!

140
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,149
My dad was a waiter?

141
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,510
Your father was a bum.
He didn't work, he slept all day.

142
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,623
What use is a father who doesn't
care if his son is dead or alive?

143
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,885
Oh, shit! Clayton!

144
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,773
Let's go see who's there.

145
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,639
Uncle Fasto...

146
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,787
Hey, Fasto! It's time to go.
Game's over.

147
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,821
-Quit playing, Fasto. Here...
-What's up with that, Midnight?

148
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,089
Watch the kid.
There's your Uncle Fasto.

149
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,058
-Where's Ace?
-Watch the kid.

150
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,921
It's Ace's son.

151
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,868
Now he's yours, you take him!

152
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,734
-He looks just like you, man!
-The boy is ours, now.

153
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,841
-We'll return him in the hill.
-Okay, we're outta here, then.

154
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,233
Where's the kid?

155
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,134
Nothing, man!

156
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,599
I left him with Caju!
Let's go!

157
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,207
Caju, where's Clayton?

158
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,006
-How would I know?
-He was with you.

159
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,674
-With me? Are you kidding?
-You're such a prick!

160
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,875
Prick!

161
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,823
Airplane, airplane!

162
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,494
A header!

163
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,088
Pass the ball to the boy.

164
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,433
-Have you seen Clayton?
-A little black kid.

165
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,796
Kick it! Kick it!

166
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,038
A little back kid.
He's my son.

167
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,408
Kick it!

168
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,079
Give him to me...

169
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,050
Get back in the game!
Back in the game!

170
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,957
Remember, Goiano?
Great team, weren't they?

171
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,864
Sure...

172
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,972
-An all-star team.
-Sure, Pedreira...

173
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,039
Too bad you never let me play.

174
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,507
Why ask me for money?
Ask the guys who played.

175
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,475
Shirts for the boys,
won't ruin you, will it?

176
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,412
-What is this?
-Give him to his mother.

177
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,111
-What happened?
-We'll talk later.

178
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,481
We're not done!

179
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,856
What's wrong, Clayton?
What have they done to you?

180
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,924
Where's your father?

181
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,099
-Have you seen Clayton?
-ln there.

182
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,767
In there?

183
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,131
My son...
Where were you?

184
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,804
-Where was he?
-How would I know?

185
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,636
You're the father.
That's a good one!

186
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,039
It's okay...

187
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,705
It's over now.

188
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,443
Shall we go home?

189
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,744
-Want to go home?
-Yes.

190
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:06,516
-Let's go then. Don't cry.
-Mommy! Mommy!

191
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,852
-Here's mommy.
-Son!

192
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,926
What happened, sweetie?

193
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,065
-lt was awful...
-At least you know that much!

194
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,496
I didn't mean to...

195
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,442
Have you decided about Cristiane?

196
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,133
I think...

197
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,612
I don't want to have the kid.

198
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,079
But the money I scraped together
won't get us into a clinic.

199
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,051
So what are you going to do?

200
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,247
I don't know, man.
I'm too young to be a father.

201
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,761
I'll stop seeing Cristiane
for awhile.

202
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,596
And let her
bring the kid up alone?

203
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,432
Let the kid grow up
without a father?

204
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,509
What use is a father anyway?

205
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,974
I wish I had a father...

206
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,411
to teach me how to do things...

207
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,383
to take me to school.

208
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,702
So your son will be like us,
without a father?

209
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,909
Having to get by on his own?

210
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,137
Always getting into trouble?

211
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,417
So how's my nephew?

212
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,091
In'87, I'd given up playing.
I was the coach.

213
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,165
-Who are the other guys?
-They were all on the team.

214
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,664
Did you know my father?

215
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,532
No, I didn't.

216
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,607
Wasn't he one of them?

217
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,143
Most of those guys are
either dead or have left the hill.

218
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,976
My grandma said when I was born
she told you to get my dad.

219
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,982
She must be going senile.
Your dad's not there.

220
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,955
-Were any of them waiters?
-I don't know.

221
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,785
I got an idea...

222
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,295
Goiano, you pay for Tiquinho's
shirt, he's the star player.

223
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,399
Then I'll go hit up the others.

224
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,660
-lt's just $ 10 for one shirt.
-$ 15.

225
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,065
-10 or 15?
-15.

226
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,867
-Who are these guys?
-I don't remember this guy.

227
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,009
This is Helinho.

228
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,702
That was my brother, Edson.

229
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,905
Helinho, were any of them waiters?

230
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,141
Waiters?
I don't think so.

231
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,979
-ls that you, Zeze?
-No, I'm not bowlegged.

232
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,954
-Was anyone a waiter?
-A waiter? No...

233
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,456
-Wait! Heraldo was a waiter.
-Heraldo?

234
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,757
-He joined the team later.
-He was awaiter and on the team?

235
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,967
Hey, Ace!

236
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,760
-Well?
-Well what?

237
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,198
-Tell me...
-No way...

238
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,669
-C'mon, man!
-I'll think about it.

239
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,274
-You have to pay.
-Like hell!

240
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,445
Okay, take it easy.
Your father's name is Heraldo, bro.

241
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,614
-Heraldo?
-Heraldo.

242
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,146
Heraldo.

243
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,478
He plays over at
Aterro do Flamengo.

244
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,382
It's a team of waiters.

245
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,749
Heraldo...

246
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,682
Now, now!

247
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,196
Get it, get it!

248
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,296
-Shoot!
-A goal kick!

249
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,932
Fullback or forward?

250
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,365
Who, your dad? Probably the goalie,
if he plays like you.

251
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,776
Look, that must be him!
You guys have the same style.

252
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,912
It's hereditary,
you'll have the same potbelly!

253
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,275
A huge one!

254
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,479
Game's over, let's go see.

255
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,353
See you all next week! Thanks!

256
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,084
Are you Heraldo?

257
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,783
No, I'm Bira.

258
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,792
-What's your name?
-Vadinho.

259
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,065
-Do you know anyone named Heraldo?
-No.

260
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,158
-Do you know Heraldo?
-Geraldo?

261
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,634
-I know many Geraldos. Which one?
-No, Heraldo, the waiter.

262
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,067
Don't know him.

263
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,936
-Do you know anyone named Heraldo?
-Heraldo?

264
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,138
-Heraldo Coutinho?
-No, Heraldo, waiter.

265
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,610
Exactly.
What do you want with him?

266
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,477
Wallace's father is a friend of his.

267
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,677
He wants to be a waiter,
so he thought Heraldo could help.

268
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,186
Your dad hasn't seen him
in awhile, has he?

269
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,380
It's been awhile.

270
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,119
If Heraldo gets him any job,
it'll be at the prison cafeteria.

271
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,726
He's in jail for what happened
at the Fiery Bull.

272
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,833
-The Fiery Bull?
-The famous steakhouse. Remember?

273
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,904
He got 20 years.
Last I heard, he was in Frei Caneca.

274
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,501
Sorry about that.

275
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,039
-Thanks.
-Good luck.

276
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,140
Let's forget it.

277
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:59,078
What? You wait 18 for this
and now you chicken out?

278
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,980
Yeah, but I didn't think
I'd find him here.

279
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,047
What if he's dead?

280
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,153
Don't talk like that!
Come on.

281
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,350
He walked out of here
7 months ago.

282
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,620
-He's on parole.
-What'd he do?

283
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,628
-What?
-What was his crime?

284
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,733
-Who are you?
-His son.

285
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,374
Hello? Hi.

286
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,209
Yes, okay.

287
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,922
Heraldo Coutinho got 2O years
for manslaughter. He did 15.

288
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,718
Manslaughter? Robbery?

289
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,292
Yes, and murder.

290
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,124
He was a killer and a thief.

291
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,923
Let's go.

292
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,167
Cheer up.

293
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,129
You got his picture now...

294
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,520
-How are you?
-How are you?

295
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,755
Let's sit.

296
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,798
Hi, Fiel.

297
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,161
What's the matter?

298
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,471
It's too complicated.

299
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,464
Go on...

300
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,810
-Do you have a father?
-No.

301
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,078
Nor a mother.

302
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,489
-Wanna listen?
-Sure.

303
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,318
-Who was that bitch, Midnight?
-Some chick... What an ass...

304
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,924
Get him, Fasto!

305
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,833
And in broad daylight.

306
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,633
You mug someone, Fiel,
and then bring the cops here?

307
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,638
-You fucked up, man.
-You ass, you wanna die?

308
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,571
Well, Fiel?

309
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,147
Don't make a sound.
Your MP and your purse.

310
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,183
Quick!
Give them to me!

311
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,252
Hands on the car.

312
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,423
-Let's talk.
-Talk about what?

313
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,856
I can get you money
up on Dead End Hill.

314
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,360
-Please, man. I swear...
-We'll see!

315
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,026
You fucked up big time!

316
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,931
Come on, Midnight, please.
All they want is money.

317
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,134
Who's paying the cops?

318
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:15,405
Please, Midnight. Just give them
the money, brother.

319
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,945
Listen...

320
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,709
Some people learn the first time,
some the second time.

321
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,114
And some never learn, dude.

322
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,385
You never learn, Fiel!

323
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,655
-Dammit!
-Please, Midnight! Don't kill me, bro!

324
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,260
Let's get going, Fiel.
Get up!

325
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,954
Please, Fasto!
Please don't kill me!

326
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,656
Get up.
You're gonna die.

327
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,967
Stupid ass!

328
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,912
One more, Ceara.

329
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,520
-Coffee?
-Yeah.

330
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,158
-One less.
-One less.

331
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,489
-Hey, Ace.
-Hey!

332
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,995
-Hi, Ceara.
-Hi, Fininho.

333
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,633
-They killed Fiel.
-Fiel?

334
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,133
-What'd he do?
-I don't know, man.

335
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,198
Why Fiel, of all people?

336
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,236
See this CD player?

337
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,606
He sold it to me...

338
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,779
for cheap, really cheap.

339
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,481
Things are getting crazy.

340
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,981
Life goes on, bro.

341
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,135
What's the matter?

342
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,535
Your cousin had my brother killed.

343
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,971
They threw his body
into the quarry.

344
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,142
Did you see?

345
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,982
I want to bury him.

346
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,827
I'll help you.

347
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,256
He was all I had.

348
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,954
Fiel's not here, Camila.

349
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,070
Want to wait out the rain
in the guardhouse?

350
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,971
-I don't think so.
-Come on, it's starting to pour.

351
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,941
It'll be okay.

352
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,109
Come here! Quick!

353
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,681
I'm ready now.

354
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,686
Ace...
He shouldn't have seen me.

355
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,903
Don't let up!

356
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,439
Come on, Fasto!

357
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,813
You guys are shit!

358
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,716
-Goal!
-Shit!

359
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,293
Shut up for a second...

360
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,794
Hey, Fasto.
That punk Ace saw me.

361
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,624
-It wasn't myfault.
-Okay, all right. Okay...

362
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,800
-Let's play!
-Who was that?

363
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,736
-Some playboy from the beach.
-What'd he want?

364
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,431
What'd he want?
The usual.

365
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,141
You doing home delivery now?

366
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,671
-You keeping tabs on me?
-Nobody's keeping tabs.

367
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,713
I told him to fuck off.
Let's play.

368
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,785
Who gave that playboy
your number?

369
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,492
Vasco, the guy's hurting, man.

370
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,924
Yeah, Midnight.
He's really hooked, can't get enough.

371
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,961
-Vasco, like the team?
-Yeah.

372
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,996
Then take this!
Flamengo scores!

373
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,364
Fuck!

374
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,870
Way to go! Fuck Vasco!

375
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,235
Flamengo is the bomb!

376
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,242
SMOKE HlLL

377
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,201
Fasto!
What's up, boss?

378
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,395
This is Breque.
His hood is cool.

379
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,236
We appreciate your help, buddy.

380
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,743
This is the plan to return to
Dead End Hill and kill Midnight.

381
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,108
You can count on me,
and my weapons.

382
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,479
I'll back you up.

383
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,422
-What the hell?
-How's it going?

384
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,968
-Man, I think I saw Fiel.
-Shit, Ace! Alive?

385
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,002
Yes.
I'm being punished by God.

386
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,904
-Does Fiel know you saw him?
-I think so.

387
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,439
Are you going to see your dad
at the parole office?

388
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,140
-I don't know.
-lf you go, let me know.

389
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,445
-Sure.
-About Fiel...

390
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,145
...Iips sealed, okay?
-Of course.

391
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,415
-lt's serious.
-I know.

392
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,456
-You free?
-Yeah.

393
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,190
-Oh, no, I'm not.
-You free or not?

394
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,865
No, sorry.

395
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,437
Now, "d" equals "m" over "v"...

396
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,766
Camila!

397
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:24,932
Excuse me, teacher.

398
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,274
-What are you doing here?
-Your brother's alive.

399
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,175
-What?
-Your brother's alive.

400
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:35,011
-Don't joke about this.
-I'm not joking.

401
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,289
I want to see him.
Where is he? How do you know?

402
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,889
Ace saw him.

403
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,767
Camila, I couldn't tell you I was alive,
it was too dangerous.

404
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,594
We're waiting here to go in
and retake Dead End Hill.

405
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,672
So stay alert, girl.

406
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:02,570
Stay home and lay low.

407
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,806
You know how these things work.

408
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,051
Hang up, man! You gonna
talk to your chick all day?

409
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,515
Talk to you later...

410
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,656
Fasto, it's getting outta control.

411
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,291
Even my sister is onto things.

412
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,656
That punk Ace has been
shooting his mouth off.

413
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,423
Midnight's no fool, man.

414
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,232
You know what?

415
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,698
Ace is a fucking moron.

416
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,037
But don't worry, bro...

417
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,934
Oh, Cris!

418
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,705
When we go in,
he'll be the first to die.

419
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,668
-lt's so good, I'm gonna die, Ace.
-No you're not...

420
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,110
-Go on, Cris.
-Don't stop...

421
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,085
Oh, Ace...

422
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,855
Yeah, keep going.
Keep moving that way...

423
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,276
Wow, Ace!

424
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,241
-Did you like it?
-Where'd you learn to do that?

425
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,075
I don't learn, I invent.

426
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:41,375
-lt was like you were someone else.
-Why? You been with someone else?

427
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,672
No, and you?

428
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,349
Me? I'd rather die.

429
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,951
Never in my life...

430
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,916
Want a smoothie?

431
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,122
Hey, baby...

432
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,396
Where's the blender?

433
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,029
-I sold it.
-You sold it?

434
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,604
-I needed some money.
-What for?

435
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,435
Praise Jesus! Hallelujah!

436
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:16,238
If you give from the heart, you'll
receive a thousand times more!

437
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,278
I asked God for something
and had to make an offering.

438
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,941
-A $ 30 offering.
-What did you ask?

439
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:25,054
Cris, remember the job in São Paulo?

440
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,815
I think I'll take it,
but only if you come with me.

441
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,188
-What about my son?
-Cris, in one year...

442
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,956
you can make 3O grand!

443
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,463
$ 30,000?

444
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,999
Trust in the Lord!
He will provide...

445
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,899
30,000, Lord.
But $ 30,000 here in Rio...

446
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:46,634
with my son and my husband, Lord.
Is that too much to ask?

447
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,438
-For a job.
-What job?

448
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,817
I think I might go
to São Paulo for a year.

449
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,815
Are you kidding?

450
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,452
When I come back,
we can buy our house.

451
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,454
And you'll leave me with Clayton?

452
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,993
You're the father, Ace.

453
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,542
Cristiane...

454
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,871
Hush!

455
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,678
Are you the father?

456
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:30,947
Yes.

457
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,589
-Want to hold your son?
-No, thanks, ma'am.

458
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,258
-Go on...
-No, please...

459
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,257
Here, hold your son.

460
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,670
Are you afraid?

461
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,132
Did I tell you?
Cris wants to go to São Paulo.

462
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,936
It's always about her and Clayton.
But what about me?

463
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:31,877
-Nobody's ever looked after me.
-Well, thanks a lot, buddy!

464
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,313
It's true, you've lent me a hand.

465
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,985
More than just a hand!

466
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,452
Yeah, but what I mean is,
I'm always looking after Clayton.

467
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,485
When will I ever get a break?

468
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,092
Better hurry,
we got that parole thing...

469
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,422
I gotta look after you too?

470
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,220
DEAD END MARKET

471
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,297
-There's Grandpa. Go to auntie.
-What are you up to?

472
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:57,133
Wallace is turning 18 and
he needs to get his lD card.

473
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,740
And you?

474
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,377
Well, I have to go
because of the line.

475
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,241
-Go where?
-To the lD place.

476
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,748
That way, one stands in line
while the other pays the fee.

477
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,047
You only have to watch him
till the daycare opens.

478
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,190
Once your son grows up...

479
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,327
we won't have to swallow
your lies anymore.

480
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,792
Are you Heraldo?

481
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,790
-Why?
-This is Wallace.

482
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,468
He's your son.

483
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,405
You're Wallace?

484
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:15,476
-Who are you?
-I'm Ace. Luis Claudio, Jr.

485
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,846
-You look just like your dad.
-What?

486
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,217
The next ten!

487
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,324
Can I wait for you here?

488
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,654
Can't you see where I am?

489
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:33,533
No way, kid. I have nothing
to give you, nothing to offer.

490
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,718
-Who'll use this one?
-They're coming.

491
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,909
-Undo the safety...
-Hey, Midnight.

492
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,180
You know how?
You take this one.

493
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,553
-Cool.
-Use this gun...

494
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,061
We're gonna kill Fasto.
Got that?

495
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,030
What can the kids do?
Little man, come here.

496
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,135
Show the kids the fireworks,
they can keep watch.

497
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,328
-Okay.
-Good, thanks, bro.

498
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,564
We're a good team.

499
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,935
Where's the other rifle?

500
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,078
-Let's give it to him.
-To him?

501
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,442
-Right, not a rifle, not for him.
-No way.

502
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,549
Okay, give him a pistol.

503
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,284
Point it down.
It's to kill Fasto. Know him?

504
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,854
-That fucker?
-Exactly. You kill him.

505
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,958
Midnight, he's not ready for that.

506
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,628
Because he's your brother?

507
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,524
Is that why he's not ready?

508
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,256
Sure he is, Tina!

509
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,765
Cut it out, Tina.

510
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,735
-Why are you doing this, Midnight?
-Doing what, Tina?

511
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,864
You're sure to get killed.

512
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,174
He's with the dealers now, Ace.

513
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,279
-What's up with you?
-I wanna fight for our hill.

514
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,447
-You're a dope.
-Giving guns to 15-year-olds.

515
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,845
Can you believe it?

516
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:59,045
Stay out of it. They'll just
use you and throw you out.

517
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,656
-Oh yeah?
-Think about your dad.

518
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:05,225
I'm gonna fight, Ace.
The hill is fucking ours!

519
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,494
What an ass...

520
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,889
This little bitch is Fiel's sister.

521
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,996
And that weasel is in cahoots
with Fasto.

522
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,767
You little punk-ass!

523
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,100
You shouldn't mess with gangsters.

524
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,334
Cut off her hair, quick!

525
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,513
You crying, little girl?
I'm gonna cut this one...

526
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,545
Here.

527
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,051
Cut it.
This is a tough one!

528
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,847
-Where'd you get hair like this?
-Done!

529
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,683
What's aweasel's sister
called, Tina?

530
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,587
-A weaselet.
-Gotta pay.

531
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,196
That's my sister in the cab.

532
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,426
At least they didn't kill her.

533
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:55,037
At least they didn't kill you.
We'll be back home soon.

534
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,308
-How much, bro?
-25.

535
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,616
Here's 30, give me back 5.

536
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,246
He's on parole, ma'am.

537
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,779
He'd be so happy
to see his grandson.

538
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,947
I know, he's been in jail
for over 15 years.

539
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,417
He doesn't know
about his grandson.

540
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,486
Okay.

541
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,582
-Dad!
-What?

542
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,295
Come here.

543
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:56,664
And then the chick said
he couldn't get it up...

544
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,600
Wait here...

545
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,849
Hey, Wallace, how you doing?
Happy birthday, buddy!

546
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,610
You crazy?
It's in two weeks.

547
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,787
Really?
Here's a present anyway.

548
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,250
What is it?

549
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,550
-Your father's address.
-How'd you get it?

550
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,387
Hey, I'm Ace, remember?

551
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,759
There it is, man, number 3O1.

552
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,434
Aren't you going?

553
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,873
I'll go then.

554
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,215
Ouch!

555
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,359
-Who is it?
-lt's me.

556
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,297
Can I talk to you, sir?

557
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,707
What do you want, kid?

558
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,706
It's about your son.

559
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,583
Look, he's turning 18.

560
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,612
So what?

561
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,151
Well...
We're having a party for him.

562
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,085
Fine. Happy birthday.

563
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:28,456
At the field, next Saturday.

564
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,396
-You should come.
-lf I'm alive, I'll show up.

565
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:36,130
You'll be alive. You can make up
for the 17 others you missed.

566
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,758
I told your dad
we were having a party.

567
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,860
What party, man?

568
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,429
I didn't know what to say,
so I made it up.

569
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,960
You're crazy, man.
What are we gonna do now?

570
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,730
Do I have to think of everything?

571
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,568
I can't have a party
without Camila.

572
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,579
That's between you
and your cousin Midnight.

573
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,241
-Here, boss.
-Crazy, man!

574
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,509
This is good stuff.

575
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,118
-Get this rifle.
-And a pistol.

576
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,697
I love you so much, my son.

577
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,226
You're doing the right thing.
God be with you.

578
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,936
Let's go, Little Pelé!
Play hard!

579
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,081
Goal! Goal!

580
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,644
Over here!
Cocão, go! Little Pelé!

581
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,776
Press him, Cocão!

582
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,663
Over here, Cocão!

583
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,631
Yeah, Cocão, that's great!

584
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,537
Let's score now!

585
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,176
Run! Run, boys!
Quick, run!

586
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,815
You're the first to die,
you motherfucker!

587
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,247
-lt's Fasto! Let's go!
-Move!

588
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,481
Kill Fasto!

589
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,797
Show your faces!
Fasto is here, you fuckers!

590
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,108
Move it!

591
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,214
Move it!
For fuck's sake!

592
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,086
Hurry, in here!

593
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,656
Run!

594
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,499
Stay alert!

595
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,540
You're making too much noise!

596
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,636
Shut up!

597
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:44,278
He got away, dammit!
Keep your eyes open!

598
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,887
Move out!

599
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,989
-Run.
-Run!

600
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,584
Shoot'em!

601
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,126
Quick, up here!

602
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,640
-There, there!
-Fuck!

603
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,301
Stay alert!

604
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,471
It's getting bad!
Let's split.

605
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,716
No way!
We're gonna kill the motherfuckers.

606
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:17,045
They have machine guns!
They'll massacre us!

607
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,680
-Let's go, Midnight.
-Down here!

608
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,949
Down this way!

609
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,722
That's his grandma's house,
watch out!

610
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,665
Let's split!

611
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,566
-Where's Midnight?
-What is this?

612
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,305
Move! Get out!

613
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,637
-Where's my grandson?
-As good as dead!

614
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,574
Anyone in his family
has to leave the hill.

615
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,577
Burn the place down!
More alcohol!

616
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:48,250
Pour alcohol on everything!

617
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,465
Cris!

618
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:38,563
-You're destroying our lives.
-lt's for our house, for Clayton.

619
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,862
You want me
to bring Clayton up alone?

620
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,536
My dad and Valeria
are helping you.

621
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,332
But it's a mother's job.

622
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,306
It's my grandmother!
Open up!

623
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,550
I have to go
or I'll miss my plane.

624
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,748
I paid the overdue rent.
Now it's up to you.

625
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,392
But Cris...

626
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,331
Grandma!
Where are you going?

627
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,057
I'm leaving.
I can't live here anymore.

628
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,395
You should leave too.
You're his cousin.

629
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,594
Okay, grandma, calm down.

630
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:16,966
-Calm down?
-I found my dad.

631
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,267
Cris, I can't care
for Clayton alone.

632
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,006
Look after yourself, Wallace.

633
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,939
He's your son,
you can't leave him.

634
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,709
You're the one
who's leaving him!

635
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,086
Cris, don't do this to me!
Please!

636
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,323
-Cris left me, man.
-I can't stay in the hill.

637
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,466
She left me with Clayton.

638
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:54,039
-Where are you sleeping tonight?
-The guardhouse. Want to come?

639
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,969
No, that's okay.

640
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,346
See you.

641
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,743
You can sleep at your father's.

642
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,646
I'll see...

643
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,786
-See you later.
-See you.

644
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,486
Go, go. Stay alert.

645
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,527
Careful there, Midnight.

646
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,466
Fuck!
It's Fasto's guys!

647
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,163
Head for the tunnel!

648
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,082
-Run, Midnight! Run, it's Fasto!
-Midnight, it's Fasto.

649
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,747
Stop the car!

650
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,386
Stop the fucking car!

651
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,249
Let's go!

652
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,125
Fuck!

653
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,929
Keep your cool, Midnight!

654
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,270
Let's go, quick!

655
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,513
Come on! I'll take you on!
Motherfuckers!

656
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,512
Stop, you fucking asshole!

657
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,180
Get the fuck out!

658
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,358
Get out, fucker!

659
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,153
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

660
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,022
Get out!
Out of the car!

661
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,060
I'm gonna kill you!
Freeze! Stay there, fucker!

662
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,897
I'm the boss here!

663
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,336
Let's go! Get in!

664
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,404
Get in the car!

665
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,274
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

666
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,210
Let's get outta here!

667
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,343
Step on it! Go!

668
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,743
Fuck you all!
The hill is mine!

669
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:23,155
Please protect our homes, Jesus.

670
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:44,603
BALD HILL

671
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,851
-Hey, Midnight.
-Hey, bro.

672
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,788
Appreciate your help, man.

673
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,387
When we take back our hill,
we'll repay you.

674
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:05,720
-Was it Fasto?
-Yes.

675
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,898
I told you so many times.
Right is right, wrong is wrong.

676
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,760
I finally gave up.

677
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,492
Bebezão!
Get rid of that car, for chrissake!

678
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,866
I told you, bro,
that guy's a fucking Judas!

679
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,174
One thing I fucking hate,
Midnight, is a Judas.

680
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:22,668
If anyone here is a Judas,
he's dead!

681
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,346
Pisses me off.

682
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,244
Relax, bro.
We can chill at the party later.

683
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,943
Help these guys here!
They're messed up.

684
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,715
When we get more guns,
we'll take the hill back.

685
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:38,519
-I told you to kill the motherfucker.
-Thanks, bro, really.

686
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,494
Fuck, if I ever catch that guy...

687
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,300
Good morning, sir.

688
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,571
You were late again.
The place was unattended.

689
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:01,979
-There was a gang war on the hill.
-That's your problem, not mine.

690
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:05,279
It was a real war,
you probably saw it on TV.

691
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,355
You're fired.
Go collect your pay.

692
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,549
But sir...

693
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,091
-They're out to kill you.
-Me?

694
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,634
Fasto came for you.
Look what they did.

695
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,102
I swore you wouldn't
be back here.

696
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,467
I was working.

697
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,802
They think you're with Midnight.

698
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,841
I didn't even know...

699
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,748
Where is he?

700
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,276
Out the back...

701
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,515
Get him!

702
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,535
Your doorbell's busted.

703
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,034
Where's your friend?

704
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,640
-Who, Ace?
-Yeah.

705
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,436
I don't know.
We parted ways.

706
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,814
You know how to fix that?

707
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,616
Electricity? No...

708
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,285
I don't either.

709
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,518
May I use your bathroom?

710
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,891
At the end of the hall.

711
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,569
Excuse me...

712
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:59,680
-Hear about the war on the hill?
-I heard on the radio.

713
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:05,420
Things got ugly. My cousin,
Midnight, was the boss up there.

714
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,226
The other guys
took back the hill.

715
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,991
Our whole family had to split.

716
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,631
-Sheila's kid?
-What?

717
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,030
Sheila, your aunt.

718
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,873
Your mother only
had one sister, right?

719
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,269
You knew my aunt?

720
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,707
I went out with her.

721
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,339
You went out
with my mother's sister?

722
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:29,006
So? You mean you never
went out with two sisters?

723
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,954
Not at the same time,
one after the other.

724
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,059
Is she still pretty?

725
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,295
I see.

726
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,966
You hungry?

727
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:46,894
Have one...

728
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,708
Who took your cousin's place?

729
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,207
A guy named Fasto.

730
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:03,511
He was with Midnight,
but joined another gang.

731
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,280
He's a fucking traitor.

732
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,351
Traitor?

733
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,526
A fucking traitor.

734
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,719
But he won't last long.
Traitors die young.

735
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,524
Some get away.

736
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,311
Well, I'm going...

737
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,071
Okay.

738
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,013
Can I stay here?

739
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,486
Afraid not, kid.

740
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:46,086
I have other people living here.
There's no room.

741
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,932
Just one night, man.

742
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,764
Then the girl jumped on me
and began kissing me...

743
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,908
I totally didn't expect it!
She tore off my clothes.

744
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,738
I thought,
"Wow, this is my lucky day!"

745
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:08,742
Keep quiet, kid.

746
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,255
Get back there.

747
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:17,021
-Who is it?
-Me, Ace.

748
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,887
Hey, Ace!

749
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,957
-This isn't a hotel, kid.
-Can I talk to him?

750
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,895
Make it quick,
I don't want that guy in here.

751
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,568
Okay.

752
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,869
-What's up?
-Hey, how are you?

753
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:32,405
Not great, man,
I got nowhere to sleep.

754
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,200
You're not working tonight?

755
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,844
I lost my job.
Can I sleep here?

756
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,742
That's bad news.
What about Nestor's place?

757
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:43,043
-Can't go there.
-What's going on, Wallace?

758
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,711
-Why not?
-Because I can't.

759
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,117
-But why not?
-I can't, man.

760
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:51,188
You want to talk,
go somewhere else, Wallace.

761
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,087
Try Caju's place, man.

762
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,662
You staying or going with him?

763
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,075
Hey, Ace...

764
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,142
What are you doing over here?

765
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,007
You miss us already, Ace?

766
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,012
-I'm homeless, man.
-You're what?

767
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:57,345
-Crash with us up on the slab.
-Come on...

768
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,145
Thanks.

769
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:05,057
Ace!

770
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,662
What's up, man?
Come on up!

771
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:11,700
It was awful.

772
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,695
They trashed Cris' father's store.

773
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:17,428
The worst part is,
I don't even know what I did.

774
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,005
Listen, man...

775
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,176
Don't worry,
you know everyone here.

776
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:25,313
Stay with us on Bald Hill.
We'll help you anyway we can.

777
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:26,277
No, thanks.

778
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:30,179
Here are some sheets
and a change of clothes.

779
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,649
-Thanks.
-Sure.

780
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,420
-Good night.
-Good night.

781
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:41,452
Take your smile out of my way

782
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:47,234
Let me go by with my pain

783
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:53,470
If I' m a thorn to you today

784
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:59,043
Thorns can't hurt flowers

785
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:06,282
I made a mistake
Wedding my soul to yours

786
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:11,950
The sun cannot Iive
AIongside the moon

787
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,836
What the hell?

788
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,338
What are you doing, kid?

789
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,212
-Trying to fix it.
-But you don't know how.

790
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,817
-Shit!
-Turn that thing off.

791
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:39,482
-Sorry, man.
-Trying to burn the building down, kid?

792
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,050
Who is this boy?

793
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:48,090
Don't tell me it's your nephew.
That's what old fags say.

794
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,288
I'm not his nephew!

795
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,491
Not an electrician either.
Look what you've done.

796
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,168
It's a mess.

797
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,702
-You're not ready?
-I'll get dressed.

798
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,534
We're late.

799
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,910
Wait for me downstairs.

800
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,316
-Eat something, Ace.
-No, you eat...

801
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,388
Don't worry about me,
I've already eaten. Go on...

802
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,990
Okay, thanks.

803
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,418
How about going
through the woods?

804
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:25,761
Let's think about it. We have to
come up with a good plan.

805
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,169
Hey, Ace!
You here too, buddy?

806
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,567
Just for awhile, okay?

807
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,241
-Sure. We'll talk later, okay?
-Okay.

808
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,205
Okay, everyone?

809
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:38,312
-Okay, boss!
-Keep it up!

810
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,444
Awesome party here
on Friday, Caju...

811
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,778
with lots of hot chicks,
right guys?

812
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,020
-You going, Ace?
-Not me.

813
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:49,453
Such a pussy!
Have some fun. Funk music...

814
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:54,221
Show him, shorty.
Show him how it's done!

815
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,594
C'mon, Ace,
let's have some fun!

816
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,669
-You call that dancing?
-How is it then?

817
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:03,861
Okay! Okay!

818
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:06,940
What the hell was that, Caju?
Ace, let's party!

819
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,010
Look at you, girls think
you're good-looking, man!

820
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,772
I don't feel like dancing.

821
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:19,379
Get a whiff of this

822
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,085
It's spreading Iike an epidemic

823
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,920
And if you haven't heard

824
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:27,857
About the funk train

825
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:29,656
Everybody wants in

826
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:33,198
When the hill starts rocking

827
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,233
Everybody goes wild

828
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,100
To the sound of funk train

829
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:48,045
Hey, DJ!

830
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,343
In God we trust!

831
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,714
All you gangsters, life is crazy!

832
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,857
We want Midnight back
on Dead End Hill...

833
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,049
Heavyweight...

834
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,228
Like Afghanistan

835
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,259
Back to Dead End Hill
With Midnight's Gang

836
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:04,592
Midnight and his crew

837
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,531
Fasto, the traitor, decided to rebel

838
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:12,367
Midnight is back
To send you straight to hell

839
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,440
Heavyweight...

840
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,702
Like Afghanistan

841
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,944
With Birão's gang

842
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,615
And Midnight's crew...

843
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,477
And Midnight's crew...

844
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,448
And Midnight's crew!

845
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,644
And Midnight's crew...

846
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:31,190
That's right!
You did your part!

847
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,158
My man, Birão!
Glad to be here with you!

848
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,032
Here's the Pelé dribble!

849
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,872
He passes behind!
The fullback sucks!

850
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,044
Goal!

851
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:55,984
Your party's tomorrow, isn't it?

852
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,083
What party?

853
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:58,685
Tomorrow is Saturday, the 6th.

854
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:01,254
-Were you going?
-Of course!

855
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:05,517
I can't go back to the hill
because of the gang war.

856
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,424
-Want a glass of water?
-Sure.

857
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,511
Here, buy yourself something,
some clothes.

858
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,446
-Wow, $ 200?
-ls that enough?

859
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:34,054
Yeah! Who's Roberto
Carvalho de Mello, though?

860
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,716
My client.

861
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,484
What kind of client?

862
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,925
I buy building materials for him.

863
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,565
Oh, okay. Thanks.

864
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,902
Bring your girlfriend
over for dinner tomorrow.

865
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,731
She's at Dead End Hill.

866
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,671
Her brother's with the enemy.
I can't even talk to her.

867
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:58,711
I'll invite Ace, he's more
than a friend. He's a brother.

868
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,916
No, not him.

869
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,719
Think about it, three guys
eating together! No way!

870
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,225
Don't you know any other girls?

871
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,025
I'll see...

872
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,849
-Heraldo...
-What?

873
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,315
Thanks for the present.

874
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,982
No problem.

875
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:43,591
Can I ask one more favor?

876
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,223
Go ahead...

877
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,194
Heraldo Tome Coutinho.

878
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:54,229
So you're now
Wallace Silva Coutinho.

879
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,666
Here you go.

880
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,034
Let's go.

881
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:06,744
If you're not doing anything later,
come over, I'll make dinner.

882
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,577
-Sure, but I'll be there before you.
-Okay. Got the key?

883
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:10,547
No.

884
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,744
-Here.
-Thanks.

885
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,712
18 years old!

886
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:16,323
Yeah...

887
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:17,985
What now?

888
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:22,687
I'm going to look for a job,
a career, responsibility.

889
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,032
-I meant, right now.
-Oh, right now!

890
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:29,568
Buy some CDs, some clothes,
spend all this cash.

891
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,136
-You do that.
-See you.

892
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,080
I rounded it up to $ 200.

893
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,088
You can keep the change, okay?

894
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,056
Your phone number
on the back, please.

895
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:57,198
I don't have one.
When I do, you'll be the first to know.

896
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,162
Write your address, then.

897
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,399
Will you come visit me?

898
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,746
Midnight, the hardware has arrived.

899
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,139
Open it up.

900
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:15,943
The ammunition too.
Quick! My finger's itching.

901
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:17,812
Where's the machine guns?

902
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,885
Check this out, man!

903
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,080
Here, kid, take this pistol.

904
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:25,324
-And you?
-Call the other guys.

905
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:30,487
-Check this one out, Midnight.
-Cool!

906
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,930
Hey, Caju, I put batteries
in the walkie-talkies.

907
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,660
Good.

908
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,030
-What's that?
-A map.

909
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,209
Some of the guys don't know
their way around.

910
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:45,377
Look, here's the soccer field,
and here's the stairway.

911
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,640
That's not where the field is.

912
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,818
You're all mixed up.

913
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,146
-lt's not right?
-lt's over here!

914
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,685
-Fix it for me.
-I'll make another map.

915
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:00,394
-Okay, make 5 copies.
-5? What for, man?

916
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:04,088
And do it fast!
Midnight wanted them yesterday!

917
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,691
What a pain in the ass!

918
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,839
-For children or adults?
-Whatever.

919
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,166
For children, then.

920
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,966
Let me put a note in it.

921
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:16,976
Deliver it now, please.

922
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,580
It's for Miss Camila.

923
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,524
Camila!

924
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,494
Delivery for the lady.

925
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,689
I didn't order anything.

926
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,458
You crippled or what?

927
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,341
-No, don't...
-Let me see...

928
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,804
You look nice.

929
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,790
Is that a new backpack?

930
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,859
My dad gave it to me.
You like it?

931
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,624
I like it.

932
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,768
Ace is in deep trouble.

933
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,962
I know.

934
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:22,139
He came to my dad's place
and I let him down.

935
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:24,312
-No, not that.
-What, then?

936
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:30,444
Fielthinks Ace told Midnight
he was alive.

937
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:34,611
But he only told me,
and I only told you.

938
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:38,790
-So Fasto is out to kill Ace.
-What are you talking about?

939
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,123
And Ace is now with Midnight.

940
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,093
I got something for you.

941
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,136
Ace? He'd never do that.

942
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:51,431
-No, thanks, man.
-You're with us now.

943
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,505
I was just helping out.

944
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,872
I saw you needed a hand,
and you let me stay here...

945
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,512
so it was like an exchange.

946
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:02,047
It's not that simple.
You came. You chose to stay.

947
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:05,414
-Where is he?
-I think he's on Bald Hill.

948
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,783
I better go get him.

949
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:11,481
-No, don't.
-This is serious, I have to go.

950
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:15,925
-I've never fired a gun.
-Then you better learn fast.

951
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,767
You know who first
put a gun in my hand?

952
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:29,041
Your father.

953
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:33,211
It was your father's gun.
I was just a kid.

954
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,849
He was a security guard
in a steakhouse.

955
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,210
We'd go by at night.

956
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,148
-Hey, kids!
-Me and my gang...

957
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:43,654
-You're getting spoiled.
-He'd give us Iots of food.

958
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:49,058
I was a little punk.
I bugged him to let me use his.38...

959
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,494
to shoot cats in the parking lot.

960
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,140
We shot them all and
had enough barbeque...

961
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,206
for the whole week!

962
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,572
Real sinister.

963
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:07,011
Your dad was a cool guy.

964
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:10,708
A big black guy, a real man.
He was really cool.

965
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,211
He had a gun like this one.

966
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,717
A black.38, just Iike this one.

967
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,552
Here, feel it, man.

968
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,027
Where was this steakhouse?

969
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:26,724
Over in São Conrado.
Closed down a long time ago.

970
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:28,402
It's gone now.

971
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:30,333
What was it called?

972
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:33,505
Shit, man, I don't remember...

973
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:37,975
It was... Something with bull...
The Fine Bull?

974
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,272
The Fighting Bull...
Something like that.

975
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,972
The Fiery Bull?

976
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:44,916
Shit, yeah, that's it.

977
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,715
The Fiery Bull. Haven't heard
that name in a long time.

978
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:50,983
How long ago was that?

979
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:54,491
A while back, I was 7 or 8.

980
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:04,297
Come back here!

981
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:09,341
One thing I'll never forgive...

982
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:11,569
is what they did to your dad.

983
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:16,342
They set him up
and shot him in the back.

984
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,317
Only a fucking traitor
would do that.

985
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:24,082
Did you know Wallace's father
shot a man in that steakhouse?

986
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,488
-Whose father?
-Wallace's.

987
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,228
No way, man.

988
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,666
That's crazy.

989
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:37,236
You're imagining things.
Forget about it.

990
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,147
Wallace!

991
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:24,417
-They're after us!
-Not me, you!

992
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,484
You mean you're not gonna
help me?

993
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:29,623
It's your problem,
solve it yourself.

994
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,725
Aren't you my friend?
You ditching me, partner?

995
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:34,959
We'll do it my way?

996
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,197
We'll do it your way.

997
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,508
-What's that kid doing here?
-No idea, boss.

998
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,612
-What do you want?
-lt's cool, man.

999
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:54,782
-Speak.
-I wanna see Midnight.

1000
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,814
-Who are you?
-His cousin.

1001
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:00,280
So? Everyone around here
is somebody's cousin.

1002
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:04,255
I'm also looking for Ace,
a black guy from Dead End Hill.

1003
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,884
-The funk dancer?
-I don't know.

1004
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:10,428
A black guy, big eyes,
a mouthful of teeth.

1005
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,030
Never stops talking.

1006
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,725
Yeah, that's gotta be him.
What is he to you?

1007
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:16,870
He's my partner, my brother.

1008
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:20,303
It's cool, Dimas.
He's with us.

1009
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:22,033
Okay, then...

1010
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:26,505
Everything okay, buddy?

1011
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:34,782
He's cool,
he's always been our friend.

1012
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:39,522
-Why are you here?
-I came to talk to you.

1013
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,026
What?
You squealed to that girl.

1014
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,391
He's her brother,
what else could I do?

1015
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:48,399
Her brother happens to be Fiel.
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

1016
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,969
-I didn't mean to, man.
-You didn't?

1017
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:53,334
I couldn't lie!
Her brother was alive.

1018
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:54,600
You didn't mean to?

1019
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,607
Like your dad
didn't mean to kill mine?

1020
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:58,939
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

1021
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:01,547
Ask your dad who he killed!

1022
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,083
Ask him if the guy he killed
was the steakhouse guard.

1023
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:08,321
Ask him if the guy he killed
was my father!

1024
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:09,820
Come on, Ace...

1025
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:12,391
-Come on?
-Calm down.

1026
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,152
Who killed whose father?

1027
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:17,490
C'mon, let's go.
Let's get outta here.

1028
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:21,328
Outta here? You go!
You don't like it here, playboy?

1029
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,367
Then beat it!

1030
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:26,473
-Look at the playboy!
-Beat it!

1031
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,734
Beat it, sucker!

1032
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,139
Get out, asshole!

1033
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:34,748
Fuck off...

1034
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,237
Stay alert.

1035
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:15,414
Stay close, like flesh and bone.
We'll go in through the front.

1036
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:22,053
Hey, kid. The fun starts now,
and you're in.

1037
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,028
We're gonna take back
what belongs to us, okay?

1038
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:27,895
In God we trust.

1039
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:29,661
We're in this together, Ace.

1040
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:43,548
My boy!

1041
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:46,046
Happy birthday to you...

1042
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:48,882
Did you kill Ace's father?

1043
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,618
Did you kill Ace's father?

1044
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:53,895
Faith in God!

1045
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:57,690
Let's take down those traitors!

1046
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,992
Midnight, we're gonna
take it back!

1047
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,567
In God we trust, brother!

1048
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,931
We're gonna get Fasto!

1049
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,733
Come in the car with me, Ace.

1050
01:24:06,942 --> 01:24:10,935
Stop dreaming about
your mother and move!

1051
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,247
Tell me!

1052
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,974
Did you kill his father?

1053
01:24:25,327 --> 01:24:26,624
Sit down.

1054
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:36,830
We were friends, see?

1055
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:39,840
We worked together.

1056
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:47,514
He'd left the hill. He was living
somewhere else with another woman.

1057
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,946
I wasn't with your mother
anymore either.

1058
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:55,989
I set up this job
with some guys.

1059
01:24:56,858 --> 01:25:00,021
Shit, keep it down, man!
Open that thing up, dammit!

1060
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:02,560
He was the first guy I asked.

1061
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,026
But he was real stubborn.

1062
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,732
So we decided to do it
on his day off.

1063
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,408
He wasn't supposed to be there, but
he was crazy about the cleaning girl.

1064
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:24,951
I had no choice.

1065
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:30,483
-What are you doing?
-Luizão, you're here?

1066
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:32,421
Heraldo, are you crazy, man?

1067
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,151
Let's talk. Don't move.

1068
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,159
He came out shooting at me.

1069
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,630
Fuck, Luizão! Stop!

1070
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:47,167
He was going to kill me.

1071
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,640
So I defended myself.

1072
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,210
The guy was my friend.

1073
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:04,258
Ididn't want to kill a friend.

1074
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,025
I had to shoot,
it was either him or me.

1075
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:17,060
I got 20 years, and did 15.

1076
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:23,841
15 years in jail,
you have no idea.

1077
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:43,293
I'm going to buy cigarettes.

1078
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:10,980
Police!

1079
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,625
-Easy, man.
-Don't move!

1080
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,259
Pull up your shirt.

1081
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:16,089
Sit down, kid.

1082
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:18,996
-Where's Heraldo?
-I don't know.

1083
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,361
-Where the fuck is he?!
-I don't know!

1084
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,299
Look! Stolen cards and checks.

1085
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:42,022
It's him!

1086
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:52,196
Stop!

1087
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,698
Freeze!

1088
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:03,105
You piece of shit!

1089
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:05,472
What are you going to do now?

1090
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,342
Move!

1091
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:12,316
I said I'd get you, didn't l?

1092
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,786
You're going to fucking
rot in jail, buddy!

1093
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:18,515
Let's go!

1094
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,822
You're back to jail!

1095
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:55,957
I want action!
I want Fasto fucking dead!

1096
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,827
We have plenty of ammo,
so everyone do their job. Got that?

1097
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:02,935
Don't hurt the locals.

1098
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:05,229
Save your bullets for Fasto.

1099
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,408
-The hill is ours.
-Victory!

1100
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:08,701
Ace...

1101
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,902
What are you dreaming about now?
We're in this together!

1102
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,111
The hill is fucking ours!

1103
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:16,840
Let's do it, brother!

1104
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:19,477
-Birão!
-Let's do it!

1105
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,988
Fasto is fucking finished!
Midnight is the boss!

1106
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:43,672
-Hey, Birão...
-What?

1107
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,745
You go through here and
we'll meet at the Taliba, bro.

1108
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:49,246
-Alright.
-Victory!

1109
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:51,350
-You come with me...
-Stay alert!

1110
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:53,453
-Where are you, Bebezão?
-Let's go.

1111
01:29:53,655 --> 01:29:56,146
Come with me! Over here!

1112
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:02,823
Come on!
Down that alley there!

1113
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:05,727
One on the left, one on the right.

1114
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:08,300
Full attention, man.

1115
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:12,366
Birão, come with me.
The hill is ours!

1116
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,881
Come, come. Over here.

1117
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,951
Watch your back there.

1118
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,023
Shit!
We're surrounded!

1119
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:11,762
Turn off your lights, man!

1120
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:17,734
Stupid ass!

1121
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:23,802
You fucker!

1122
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:39,450
-Shit, Midnight!
-We're fucked!

1123
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,219
Let's go!

1124
01:31:42,397 --> 01:31:43,864
That fucker!

1125
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,636
-Shit, man.
-What?

1126
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:59,711
Let's go up...

1127
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:01,939
We're going up!

1128
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:04,243
Meet up at the top.

1129
01:32:30,812 --> 01:32:34,543
Easy, man...

1130
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,708
Ace?

1131
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,855
He's over there.
Go, get out!

1132
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,128
Hey, Ace...

1133
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:59,530
Let's get outta here, man.

1134
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:02,466
-Come on, Ace!
-Get out?

1135
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:04,577
Whose fault is it that I'm here?

1136
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:07,543
Whose fault is it?

1137
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:09,209
Tell me!

1138
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:12,449
I know my father killed yours.

1139
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,751
But it was in self-defense!

1140
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:18,551
Self-defense?
My father was shot in the back.

1141
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:22,351
-Shot in the back?
-He put a bullet in his back.

1142
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,558
What do you mean?

1143
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,167
He'd never have done that.
They were friends.

1144
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:31,702
Friends? Like you're my friend?

1145
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:34,773
What are you doing?

1146
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:41,711
Come on, Ace.

1147
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,249
Am I not your friend?

1148
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:49,482
I'm not your friend?

1149
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:51,419
Then shoot me.

1150
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:54,823
Shoot me.

1151
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:18,176
Let's get outta here.

1152
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:20,286
Let's go, Ace.

1153
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,158
If you die,
your son will be like us.

1154
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:30,724
Fatherless.

1155
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:34,226
Is that what you want?

1156
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:42,265
Let's go, Ace.

1157
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,177
Wait up.

1158
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,440
Go.

1159
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:33,783
-Where's everyone?
-Things are bad, bro.

1160
01:35:33,995 --> 01:35:36,896
We've killed most of them.
The hill is ours already.

1161
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:38,622
Did you kill Midnight?

1162
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:41,700
I killed that asshole
and had his body dumped.

1163
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,928
Everyone be careful now!

1164
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:49,039
We wiped them out.
Let's go up to the top now.

1165
01:35:52,647 --> 01:35:53,944
Shit!

1166
01:35:56,951 --> 01:35:59,977
-Shit! They killed Fasto!
-Fasto? Fasto!

1167
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:02,621
They killed the boss, man!

1168
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:21,131
-Daddy's coming.
-Give him to me.

1169
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:23,367
Come here, son.

1170
01:36:30,418 --> 01:36:33,478
Calm down, calm down.

1171
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:48,162
Sit down over here.

1172
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:50,769
I love you.

1173
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:54,202
From now on, it's you and me.

1174
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:59,779
I'm going to bring you up,
take care of you.

1175
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:05,881
Now it's just the two of us.

1176
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:16,592
We can't stay on the hill
anymore, Cris. It's anarchy.

1177
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:19,294
I'll handle things
till you get back.

1178
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:23,333
I' m taking CIayton.
I' IIcallyou when Ifind a place.

1179
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:25,061
Where will you take him?

1180
01:37:25,272 --> 01:37:28,298
Wherever I go.
He's my son.

1181
01:37:28,642 --> 01:37:30,735
Love you.

1182
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:35,280
Let's go.
Say bye-bye to auntie.

1183
01:37:35,483 --> 01:37:36,814
Say bye!

1184
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:47,389
Go now. God bless you.

1185
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:10,614
Take the message to Camila.
Here's $ 1 for you.

1186
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:13,309
-I'm there!
-Hurry, and don't stop.

1187
01:38:13,521 --> 01:38:15,113
Let's go.

1188
01:38:16,157 --> 01:38:17,954
C'mon, let's go!

1189
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:10,208
'"Idon't know
how Iong it will be.

1190
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:14,546
But now you're in there
and I' m out here.

1191
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,880
Away from the place
where Iwas born...

1192
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:21,650
the place where
everyone knows me...

1193
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,890
where everyone knows who I am.

1194
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:31,197
Away from the place
that used to be mine.'"

1195
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:41,907
What now, Ace?

1196
01:39:42,543 --> 01:39:44,204
What now, Wallace?

1197
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:46,208
What now, Clayton?

1198
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,685
Let's go to my dad's place.
I have the key.

1199
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:54,952
Why not?

1200
01:39:56,857 --> 01:40:00,657
Clayton, don't worry'cause
I'm gonna teach you all I know.

1201
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:02,761
-Let's cross.
-Okay.

1202
01:40:02,963 --> 01:40:05,693
Clayton, before you cross the street,
you have to look both ways.

1203
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,300
First this way, then that way.

1204
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,561
Let's go.
