1
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,839
That was your mother.

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,395
You must go straight away.

3
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,078
- I've nearly finished.
- Forget about that.

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,077
I don't think there's time.

5
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,439
INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,192
PAMPLONA, JUNE OF 2001

7
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,037
Through this Holy Unction
and His most tender mercy,

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,912
may the Lord help you
by the grace of the Holy Spirit.

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,314
Amen.

10
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,518
That, having cleansed you of all sin,

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,678
He may comfort you as you go forth
upon this journey and grant you

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,672
- His salvation.
- Amen.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,638
May God be our succour at all times,

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,273
who is our loving Father
and desires our happiness on earth

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,030
and for all eternity in Heaven.

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,389
Amen.

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,273
Someone's crying.
Why?

18
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,599
We're all crying, dear.

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,798
With joy, and envy.

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,031
With envy because you're going to Jesus.

21
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,230
Yes,

22
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,158
I want to be with him now.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,159
Do you want
to tell him how much you love him?

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,636
Yes. You help me.

25
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,280
Jesus, my little girl

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,870
loves You very much, more than
anything in the world.

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,992
Don't you, my love?

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,595
Yes.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,194
She is very weary

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,032
and can hardly speak,

31
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,796
but You know that
with every heartbeat

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,592
she is saying she loves You.

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,392
- Aren't you, my love?
- Yes.

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,029
He, too, is so looking
forward to being with you.

35
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,150
Yes.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,277
Now you have to open the window.

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,719
It's raining, my darling.

38
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,160
Now you all have to help me very much.

39
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,958
Are you frightened, sweetie?

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,635
No,

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,353
but you are.

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,196
Why, love? Why should I be afraid?

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,436
Because I can see an ugly face.

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,949
A very ugly face.

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,318
Know what we're going to do?

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,034
We're going to call your...

47
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,629
Mr. Meebles isn't there. He left.

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,795
I don't think so.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,629
A fine guardian angel

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,955
he would be if he left now.

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,633
Well, he's not there any more.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,273
Don't be silly, why would he leave?

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,392
Because the black one has come.

54
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,795
Blessed be God.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,877
And says: Break a leg, everyone.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,718
Blessed be His holy name.

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,669
Blessed be His most sacred heart...

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,119
and His most precious blood.

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,553
Blessed be Jesus

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,557
in the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,119
Isn't Daddy coming?

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,871
Daddy can't wait to be with you.

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,839
I hope he doesn't get muddled

64
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,917
because they're already
coming to get me.

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,993
Jose Maria, Alejandro,
come to help her,

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,078
don't leave her alone,
she's still just a child.

67
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,549
Lead her to the Gates of Heaven
so she doesn't go astray.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,874
Mummy, do you think

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,072
that in this state
they will let me join them?

70
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,239
You're already in.

71
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,548
Yes.

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,239
MADRID, 5 MONTHS EARLIER.

73
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,630
Darn it!

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,030
Yes,

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,514
it burns, doesn't it?

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,278
And what conclusion
can we draw from that, Elena?

77
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,916
You gotta be careful with hot things?

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,195
Camino,

79
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,714
why did Begona get burned?

80
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,275
The movement of her hand
was turned into heat.

81
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,393
That's right. Which means energy
is neither created nor destroyed,

82
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,830
merely transformed.

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,714
They've come for her.

84
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,997
Oh, yes.
Get your things, quickly now.

85
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,312
They won't jab me, will they?

86
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,748
Still harping on about that?

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,111
Begona says they may
take a blood sample.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,834
Even that wouldn't be
so serious, would it?

89
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,508
Mum, please.

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,071
I'll tell you what:
Why don't you ask Her?

91
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,789
It's nothing, lassie, you'll see.

92
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,559
Just a pinprick.

93
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,799
There, there.

94
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,312
This injection will ease
the inflammation where it hurts.

95
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,828
Wouldn't it be better
for her to have an X-ray?

96
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,954
Keep still, for heaven's sake,
you'll break the needle.

97
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,394
I have patients younger than you

98
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,272
who don't make half as much fuss.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,557
Look, Mum.
What I wanted to show you.

100
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,318
Nice, isn't it?
And simple.

101
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,189
Yes. It's pretty,
though I wouldn't wear it.

102
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,917
Come on.

103
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,274
Have you taken the water in?

104
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,555
Daddy!

105
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,796
How are you, precious?

106
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,908
Lord, we beseech Thee not to forsake
us and that Thy love be always among us.

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,717
Make our home Thy dearest task
and our hearts Thy tabernacle. Amen.

108
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,795
Mummy's going to make me a copy
of a great dress we saw. And I love it.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,912
- And we're going to improve it.
- Yes!

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,673
And what does
this pretty dress look like?

111
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,713
Ah, it's a secret.
Mummy, don't you dare tell him.

112
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,918
No, I promised her
it'd be ready for her birthday.

113
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,639
You've plenty of time, then.

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,514
It's red, with straps
and a short skirt...

115
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,631
- Silly me.
- Eat up now.

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,316
And what present
would you like from me?

117
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,830
Let's go on an excursion.
All four of us.

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,389
Where to?

119
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,318
It doesn't matter.
Anywhere.

120
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,159
Goodnight, Yeye.

121
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,430
Lord, you looked me in the eye,

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,195
smiling,

123
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,032
you said my name.

124
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,955
My boat I have left on the sand.

125
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,189
At Your side

126
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,918
I will seek another sea...

127
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,312
Do boys go there as well?

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,349
That means no, I guess.

129
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,677
There are only three girls,
but we have a great time.

130
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,353
What's this club all about?

131
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,438
Like a cookery course.
We've only just started.

132
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,679
But do you play anything?

133
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,718
They read us things
and give us talks...

134
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,911
- And brainwash you.
- Not at all.

135
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,111
But there aren't many of us.
If you came...

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,594
It's free, you know.

137
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,476
I can't.
Wednesday I go to the shrink.

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,270
- Why?
- I'm going through pre-adolescence.

139
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,390
What's that?

140
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,999
An illness I've got

141
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,758
but my mother suffers.

142
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,911
Does the psychologist help or what?

143
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,550
No, but my mother says while I'm
with him, I don't get under her feet.

144
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,233
Forget the cookery club
and join the theatre with me.

145
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,158
- You finally joined?
- Yes, my cousin persuaded me.

146
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,355
You and you.

147
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,515
And you.

148
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,278
Blimey, what did I do?

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,558
Wait here and we'll talk
when mass is over.

150
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,395
And you, get rid
of that chewing gum.

151
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,874
I ain't got anything.

152
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,798
Carry on like that and you just
might be repeating your course, dearie.

153
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,392
What's this theatre thing about?

154
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,870
Nothing, just
a cultural centre I go to.

155
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,274
Do boys go?

156
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,517
Elena, why don't you and me go
and sound it out?

157
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,756
I can ask my mum to go with us.

158
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,635
Oh yeah, to hold our hand
in case we get lost.

159
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,152
Have you chosen one?

160
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,708
What do you think?

161
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,349
"Mr. Meebles."

162
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,798
"Mr. Meebles

163
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,758
is a wise fellow who knows

164
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,076
everything about everything
but he has a problem."

165
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,918
This story sounds familiar.

166
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,553
Look what I found.

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,592
It looks really cute, Mum.

168
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,631
But it's a kiddie's story, love.

169
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,480
- Yeah, but, I dunno...
- This one's got pictures too.

170
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,912
I'm sure mummy
will let you choose today.

171
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,114
After all the trouble
it took me to find it!

172
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,115
Not again?

173
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,918
You can return the favour one day.

174
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,312
CULTURAL CENTRE

175
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,959
Come on! Let your body speak.
Release your body, move it!

176
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,077
Let it express itself!

177
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,912
Move your asses!

178
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,478
Come on... freedom!

179
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,469
Don't be shy.

180
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,278
You too!

181
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,272
No, she's come to see her friend.

182
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,314
Come on, get into pairs.

183
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,238
- Of two?
- No, of five.

184
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,078
Stop clowning around, Cuco!

185
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,199
Let yourself go,
she won't bite.

186
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,549
But she's groping me.

187
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,914
What's wrong with that?

188
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,389
- She's my cousin.
- For God's sake!

189
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,510
Okay, sit down.

190
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,512
Jonathan, let Begona show you.

191
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,990
Oh, to be twelve again, eh?
Hormones all over the place!

192
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,950
That Begona's cracks me up!

193
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,396
Okay, very good.

194
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,200
We need to decide on a play
for the end of term.

195
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,355
Mr. Meebles!

196
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,711
- What?
- It might work as a play.

197
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,469
Oliver and Benji!

198
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,038
Mr. Meebles is a very wise man
but he has a problem.

199
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,475
What problem?

200
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,878
Something simple, there aren't
many of us and five are white.

201
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,315
Count me in, mate.

202
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,830
If possible a story
that ends with a kiss.

203
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,793
- Not too corny like you lot.
- My goodness!

204
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,798
Cinderella, then.

205
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,910
- A bit sad, isn't it?
- At first, but not at the end.

206
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,833
I'm going to find you a soul.

207
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,637
- Ever heard of the Opus Dei?
- Beg your pardon?

208
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,839
Did you know you can become a saint
fixing a washing machine?

209
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,791
It's Saturday.
How come you're in?

210
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,031
Can't, my mother's got
her Circle this weekend.

211
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,754
- Circle?
- You know, retiring to a retreat...

212
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,832
I wouldn't mind retiring either.

213
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,316
You mothers who boast
of having a Christian home

214
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,795
must begin by sowing
the seed in your children.

215
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,032
When you supervise them

216
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,117
you are sowing seeds.

217
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,830
And when you choose their friends too.

218
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,157
Above all, instil in them
the practice of prayer.

219
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,628
I know that one of you is making

220
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,154
a good job of this.

221
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,911
Let me tell you

222
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,590
of a beautiful thing your daughter
told me in confession, Gloria.

223
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,791
Apparently, you took her
to the doctor

224
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,035
for an injection.

225
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,231
Yes, she's terrified of them.

226
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,752
Well, it seems, that just before that,
she'd asked Our Lady, who she adores,

227
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,870
not to stop her having the injection,

228
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,231
but, she said, for the strength

229
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,032
to accept God's will.

230
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,231
To accept God's will
without complaining.

231
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,869
And she was rather ashamed because
she cried a little in the end.

232
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,996
Isn't that so, Gloria?

233
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,595
You keep an eye on her, she's
very special and if I'm right

234
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,119
she'll follow in
her sister's footsteps.

235
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,394
A fabulous lot of books
we're collecting, aren't we?

236
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,470
My father used to take me to a place

237
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,429
with lots of stalls
full of second-hand books,

238
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,358
and he'd let me choose one.

239
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,233
It's funny but I remember

240
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,557
one story book that had
a pink cover, really twee.

241
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,832
The times I read it to my sister!

242
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,951
You talk a lot about your family.

243
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,878
That's normal, they're my family.

244
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,192
Your family is here now,
and it is large and very important.

245
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,591
- Yes, but...
- We show little love for God

246
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,109
if we don't detach ourselves
from what we leave behind.

247
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,199
Let me confess something:

248
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,030
Our former families are very selfish.

249
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,073
All they can say is that
little sentence "we miss you",

250
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,633
as if that helped us.

251
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,151
That's to be expected...

252
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,358
Exactly. And the devil,
who is no fool,

253
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,114
uses precisely the people

254
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,157
we love to keep us
away from the task

255
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,912
God has charged us with.

256
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,357
"Whoever has God lacks nothing.

257
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,078
God alone is enough."

258
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,308
How wonderful.

259
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,716
This gets a blue label.
Definitely.

260
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,797
You're right, Ines,
and I'm so grateful

261
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,911
that you make me see more clearly.

262
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,639
Oh, this one, what nonsense.

263
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,959
This man wrote well,
but always about grotesque things.

264
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,478
This is for you, for always.

265
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,590
Mum, think they'll let me join
the theatre group?

266
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,399
Bernadette was your age
when the Virgin chose her.

267
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,638
She was in love with Antoine,

268
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,956
- the miller's son.
- Who told you that?

269
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,278
They made her a saint

270
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,948
because she gave him up
to enter the convent.

271
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,388
No, sweetie.

272
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,315
She renounced all
in order to have all.

273
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,715
Is it too hot?

274
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,314
No, it feels like
there's a thorn in my neck.

275
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,395
We're seeing the doctor
tomorrow, don't worry.

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,672
And offer it to the Lord.

277
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,752
Never waste a chance
to tell Him you love Him.

278
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,597
They rehearse every Friday
and at the end of term

279
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,713
they're giving a performance for the
parents and anyone else who wants to go.

280
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,230
You've a lot
to study this year...

281
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,551
and you have cookery class
on Wednesdays.

282
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,678
What if I get up an hour earlier
every day to study?

283
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,313
I'll start tomorrow, promise.

284
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,669
You can't do everything.

285
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,237
Maybe right now theatre
isn't one of your priorities.

286
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,910
What if I drop cookery?

287
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,116
We don't really do
anything interesting.

288
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,276
To be honest,
it's a bit of a drag.

289
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,113
I'm sad to hear you say that.

290
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,355
No, it's just that...

291
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,552
When your sister felt
the call she had doubts

292
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,875
because God also asked her
to give up a lot of things.

293
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,628
Like Bernadette.

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,035
And what did she do?

295
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,349
She asked her Guardian Angel
to help her make the right decision.

296
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,757
That's what we'll do now with yours.

297
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,712
Let him be the one to decide.

298
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,239
- What do you think?
- Good idea.

299
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,439
And he must be fed up of us
calling him just "guardian angel".

300
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,039
I love you very much, Mum.

301
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,593
And I love you, my darling.

302
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,110
- Give Daddy a kiss when he gets in.
- Yes.

303
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,869
Guardian Angel,
dear companion night and day,

304
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,031
leave her not alone,
lest she go astray.

305
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,477
Do you think Cinderella
will work as a play?

306
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,551
God bless you.

307
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,554
- I was just thinking about you.
- That's exactly

308
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,836
why I'm here.
Didn't you realise?

309
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,475
Where were you?

310
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,838
No place, I suppose.
But why were you looking for me?

311
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,639
I have a problem.

312
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,996
Well, you're not the only one.

313
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,276
I've got one too, young man.

314
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,113
That's impossible.

315
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,757
You know everything
and can do everything!

316
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,873
Yes, that's true.

317
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,679
But I know what yours is:

318
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,356
You've set your eyes on someone.

319
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,273
Actually, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

320
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,629
This has never happened before.

321
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,319
Maybe when you think
of that person

322
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,114
you get butterflies in your stomach?

323
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,276
Yes. And I can't sleep.

324
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,151
Here.
Look among the audience.

325
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,919
Maybe there's some little girl

326
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,712
who can help us.

327
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,834
You just have to invite her
to come up on stage.

328
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,315
Yes!

329
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,759
Everything's fine.

330
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,513
You have a contracture,

331
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,914
here in the neck muscles.

332
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,713
Nothing serious.

333
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,313
Let's tell uncle Rafael.

334
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,189
No, he's a gynaecologist.

335
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,076
- Trust this gentleman.
- I'll give you

336
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,432
some exercises to correct
a slight curvature of the spine.

337
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,552
Once a week,

338
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,316
in the afternoon, after school.

339
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,795
That'll soon clear up the trouble.

340
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,072
Will I be able to do drama?

341
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,599
You can live a normal life.

342
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,994
Let's see, this place is open

343
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,758
- on Fridays.
- Perfect.

344
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,072
- Wednesdays as well, I think.
- Much better. Wednesday's

345
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,235
much better.

346
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,634
You decide.

347
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,518
She's joining the drama group
after all, the sly bitch.

348
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,310
- Why do you say that?
- She doesn't care about drama.

349
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,192
She's just after what she can get.

350
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,633
- Maybe they won't take her.
- They will, she's pretty.

351
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,150
The number of auditions
I had to do! Because I'm ugly.

352
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,919
You're not ugly, Begona.

353
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,997
Yeah, because of my braces...

354
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,716
- Your cousin's really cute.
- He's sweet.

355
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,911
Comes from having
a mother who works

356
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,678
- in a cake shop.
- Ah, really?

357
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,879
Near your house. He's there every day
till his mother closes up shop.

358
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,998
Have you decided on a play?

359
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,031
Ugh, don't remind me!

360
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,152
My cousin Cuco has suggested
the yuckiest thing.

361
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,676
- I'm sure it's something nice.
- For whoever plays Cinderella.

362
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,315
What?

363
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,677
I bet you I get lumbered
with being one of the Ugly Sisters.

364
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,749
Why do you call him Cuco?

365
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,399
Dunno, we always have.

366
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,828
But what's his real name?

367
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,110
His name's Jesus.
I prefer Cuco.

368
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,756
What a crappy day!

369
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,919
Obviously, instead of anisette,
we'll add the juice of two lemons.

370
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,473
Well, one is enough actually.

371
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,669
Maybe someone here
has the vocation to be a cook.

372
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,434
- Or an artist.
- Or an artist. Why not?

373
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,632
People say "so-and-so
is a born artist",

374
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,276
to underline the fact
that vocation is not achieved

375
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,398
by personal effort, but is received
from the very start.

376
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,398
To be more exact you can say

377
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,994
"so-and-so has been called
to be a great doctor",

378
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,795
because vocation means a calling.

379
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,515
Let's grate the peel

380
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,915
and add it to the eggs and sugar.

381
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,238
Is that all right, Mercedes?

382
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,669
That's fine.

383
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,952
Vocation is often clear
but may need to be discovered

384
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,354
with help from other people.

385
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,798
Let's beat the mixture.

386
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,869
Are you all right?

387
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,272
Yes, yes, my back's
bothering me, but I'm fine.

388
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,317
Shall we ask your mother
to come and pick you up?

389
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,953
No, I'll go home on my own.

390
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,388
Ah, okay.

391
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,950
I add it now, don't I, Mercedes?

392
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,510
And there's a vocation
we all have just by being born:

393
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,393
To be saints.

394
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,753
We must love God

395
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,793
because He loves us
and has created us to love Him freely.

396
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,599
We must show Him our love openly,

397
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,075
without shame.
If we love someone

398
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,675
and don't tell them,
what is the point of that love?

399
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,589
I don't know if I should
give you another pain killer.

400
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,871
- You'll soon get over it.
- Give me that.

401
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,276
I should have come to pick you up.

402
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,994
Sit up a little
and let's get your nightie on.

403
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,510
Your socks first.
You're soaking!

404
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,199
Don't cry, my darling.

405
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,277
Lift your legs up, dear.

406
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,713
Come on, don't be lazy.

407
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,076
- Do as Mummy says.
- Come on!

408
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,271
I'm trying to but I can't.

409
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,799
I'm so sorry for being such a burden.

410
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,315
Hold your breath.

411
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,991
Her spinal column is fractured

412
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,395
- at the third vertebrae. Look.
- But the little girl

413
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,670
was already X-rayed.
And no-one noticed?

414
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,989
I don't understand it.

415
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,674
Mum, I'm scared.

416
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,399
Let's pray to the Virgin
to give us strength.

417
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,668
No, not strength.
I'm going to ask Her outright,

418
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,313
if She doesn't mind,
to be spared any more injections.

419
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,871
- You're Camino's father, right?
- Yes.

420
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,116
She hasn't had a fall or a knock...?

421
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,191
Not according to her,
and we haven't...

422
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,833
She must be in a lot of pain.

423
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,192
We must operate immediately.
There's a very high risk of paralysis.

424
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,195
Hello?

425
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,269
Yes...

426
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,675
We were expecting the call.
Just a minute.

427
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,029
Yeye!

428
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,635
- Hi, titch.
- You're hard to get hold of.

429
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,115
You're worse than
a politician, always busy.

430
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,112
I always have things to do.

431
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,278
I've a surprise for you:

432
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,874
I spoke to don Francisco,
our spiritual director,

433
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,074
and he's dedicating
tomorrow's mass to you.

434
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,514
Everyone at the house

435
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,988
will be praying for you.

436
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,037
When are you coming to visit?

437
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,828
We miss you ever so...

438
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,635
Goodness... Oh, I've got
so much to tell you...

439
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,668
Put Mum on.

440
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,231
Bye, Nuria. And don't worry
about the operation.

441
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,434
Darling!

442
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,350
Yes...

443
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,711
Well, I'm sure you're right.

444
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,112
How nice.
Don Miguel Angel sends his regards.

445
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,919
He's charming.
Now don't you worry.

446
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,759
Do you want
a word with your father?

447
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,838
We'll call you when your sister

448
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,632
comes out.

449
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,715
Thanks, love, God bless.

450
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,557
She had to rush.
They were waiting for her.

451
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,275
I didn't get to ask her
if she wanted her guitar.

452
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,317
I don't think she's got time.

453
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,318
There are more than
18 men and women in her house.

454
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,635
She lives with men as well?

455
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,432
Pet, she isn't in a convent,

456
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,993
she's in the world.

457
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,035
Watch out!

458
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,110
- Do you know how long they'll take?
- No. They'll tell you when she's out.

459
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,833
This is as far as you go.

460
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,353
Entrust yourself
with all your heart.

461
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,996
Jesus is with you.

462
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,635
What year are you in?

463
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,912
- Fifth grade.
- Fancy that, fifth grade!

464
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,516
- I bet you have a boyfriend, right?
- Will I dream?

465
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,350
- Do you dream when you sleep?
- Sometimes I have nightmares.

466
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,758
What you have to do is think
of something you like ever so much.

467
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,156
Now count backwards from 10 to 0.
Off you go...

468
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,396
Ten, nine,

469
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,111
eight, seven...

470
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,315
six, five...

471
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,475
Tubes.

472
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,515
For the Prelate in Rome,

473
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,792
for our whole family
that its faith might grow daily

474
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,797
thanks to Your divine intercession.

475
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,354
For Camino... Fernandez,

476
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,556
sister of one of our numeraries,

477
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,513
who is at this moment
being operated on in Madrid,

478
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,596
and for future vocations.
And we ask You, Lord, to give us

479
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,589
the grace to be, each day,
a little less unworthy of You.

480
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,793
- Lord, hear our prayer.
- And let our cry come unto Thee.

481
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,594
Let's turn her over.

482
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,870
- On the count of three...
- Disconnecting.

483
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,270
One, two... three.

484
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,709
Diestock.

485
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,317
- How's the operation going?
- Fine.

486
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,318
Jesus is with me.

487
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,912
NO EXIT

488
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,516
We can't.

489
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,159
What's the time?

490
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,231
Yeye!

491
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,548
Daddy!

492
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,312
Now then, move your hand.

493
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,232
I want to go home.

494
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,919
We are in a hurry!

495
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,512
I want to celebrate my birthday with
my friends, like I do every year.

496
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,553
- When is your birthday?
- In spring.

497
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,638
There's still a month
and a half till spring.

498
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,354
Happy birthday to you...

499
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,079
THURSDAY, 22ND MARCH.

500
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,517
Happy birthday, dear Camino,

501
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,396
happy birthday to you.

502
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,158
Happy birthday, darling.

503
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,993
Thanks, thank you all.

504
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,198
- What a pretty dress.
- My Mum made it.

505
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,829
In secret, so it'd be a surprise.

506
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,634
She hasn't even tried it on yet.

507
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,314
And her classmates sent her
a very nice letter.

508
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,477
Everybody loves you a lot.

509
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,835
Well, I'm off.
Save me a piece of cake.

510
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,916
Daddy.

511
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,674
What is it, love?

512
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,314
This is the first birthday
you haven't filmed me.

513
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,796
You'd better go
or you'll be in trouble.

514
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,274
Camino, guess who's come
all the way from Pamplona.

515
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,198
Where's my little birthday niece?
Eleven whole years!

516
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,674
Hello, auntie.

517
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,469
Marita, what a surprise.

518
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,749
Hello, Jose.

519
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,189
For you.

520
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,030
You shouldn't
have bothered, really.

521
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,959
It's not a present, eh.
It's a loan.

522
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,310
Sit down, you must be exhausted.

523
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,993
Tell us about Nuria.
Do you see her?

524
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,599
Of course.
Once a month,

525
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,358
without fail, she comes to my house.

526
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,669
And busy as she is,

527
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,558
that makes it all the more commendable.

528
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,589
- It does.
- And she knows you're alone, right?

529
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,229
Me? Alone? Nonsense.

530
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,752
- I'm with Jesus at all hours.
- That is so true.

531
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,591
You're in for a big surprise.

532
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,155
- You won't recognise your room.
- Why not?

533
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,872
Would you like to stop off
and give thanks together

534
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,508
- before we go home?
- Okay, but there's something I fancy.

535
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,789
Turn here, Dad!

536
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,436
Since when were you
so fond of cream cakes?

537
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,799
Good grief, what a woman!

538
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,949
The story of her life in 5 minutes.

539
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,395
Look what she gave me, it's her son's.

540
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,751
She's separated and the husband
doesn't want to know about them.

541
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,033
CINDERELLA

542
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,515
Let's go home

543
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,755
now, Dad,

544
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,040
- and have the cakes.
- I bought hot cross buns.

545
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,754
It seemed more appropriate
with it being Easter.

546
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,754
Don't you like it?

547
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,430
Or what?

548
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,077
It's just that... this bed
must have cost you a fortune.

549
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,637
- And redecorating...
- No, pet, they've given us everything.

550
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,149
And if Nuria comes,
where will she sleep?

551
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,472
Look what I've got for you.

552
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,468
A strongbox!

553
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,796
Yes, but it's more than that.

554
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,713
CGS.
That's your office, isn't it?

555
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,108
What?

556
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,996
You don't know what CGS stands for?

557
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,039
"Camino's Greatest...

558
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,554
Secrets!"

559
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,876
It has a tune that
stops the secrets escaping.

560
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,959
Can we try it right now?

561
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,194
Got a little secret, have you?

562
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,993
Maybe a crush on someone?

563
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,715
Tap it, tap it.

564
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,389
Do you know why I wanted
to join the drama group?

565
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,874
Good night,

566
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,228
Cinderella.

567
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,399
Daddy.

568
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,676
What is it, love?

569
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,348
I'm not surprised
Mummy fell in love with you.

570
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,592
What about Nat Science?

571
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,553
Old "Penguin" has made us memorise

572
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,189
every single category of animal.
Just to annoy us.

573
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,153
I'm sure that's not why.

574
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,352
So what if the octopus
is an ovipidous invertebrate mammal?

575
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,674
She's battier than before
they removed her gall bladder.

576
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,678
She's out of her head.

577
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,117
I can't wait to get back to school.

578
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,914
And your cookery club must be
up to fried eggs by now.

579
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,715
Silly.
How's the drama group?

580
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,550
Friday it's the final auditions
to see who gets what part.

581
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,036
- You're still in time.
- Lf there's a part for a cupboard.

582
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,633
So, play a cupboard.

583
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,588
One year I played a tree and didn't move
for an hour because there was no wind.

584
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,955
I dunno.

585
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,589
Learn a few lines of the person
you most fancy playing.

586
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,908
I'll say you're coming. It'll be worth
it just to see Elena as Cinderella.

587
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,914
She's like a squid on heat
but la-di-da with it.

588
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,957
She's only there for my cousin.

589
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,513
- I bet he's happy. She's so pretty.
- No way.

590
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,392
He says he likes your hair.

591
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,474
And the best bit is...

592
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,950
- What?
- In grammar class, we have to learn

593
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,276
all the types
of pronouns and adjectives,

594
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,796
and if we get a single one wrong,
we fail the whole year.

595
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,158
Bit much, don't you think?
I'm gonna suggest she buys a "friend".

596
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,309
Does that hurt?

597
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,199
Mum, do you think you can fall in love
with someone you've only spoken to once?

598
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,193
That only happens in films.

599
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,033
Yes, but when you met Dad,

600
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,800
did you used to get
butterflies in your stomach

601
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,070
- when you thought about him?
- Don't be daft.

602
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,839
I remember Giuseppe a lot.

603
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,228
- Who?
- Giuseppe,

604
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,951
Nuria's friend. The actor.

605
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,229
Oh, yes.

606
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,277
He went back to Italy

607
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,397
and never wrote to her.

608
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,035
Odd, don't you think?

609
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,196
Nuria checked the mail every day.

610
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,436
- I felt sorry for...
- Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

611
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,433
Begona says I'm still in time
to audition for the play.

612
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,036
Let's not rush things, love.

613
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,789
In rehab they say I can start taking
my collar off for short spells.

614
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,433
Dad can drive me there.

615
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,150
- We'll ask him when he gets back.
- I already have.

616
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,275
Oh, well, who am I
to stick my nose in, then?

617
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,630
What can I wear, to look nice?

618
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,520
- Your new dress. If you like it.
- Of course I do.

619
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,671
It's lovely.

620
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,393
I just didn't remember.

621
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,000
Come now, it's not good
to be so vain.

622
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,589
What time is it?

623
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,635
Mum!

624
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,875
Do you know what time it is, lazybones?

625
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,751
I must get ready for the auditions.

626
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,512
You can't go to any audition.

627
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,312
- But I thought...
- You're not going

628
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,272
to school and you want
to go to drama class?!

629
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,759
You're a cripple!

630
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,189
No way, watch.

631
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,275
It's all right.

632
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,918
- And what is that?
- What?

633
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,157
- What's that you're wearing?
- A dress, ducky. You blind or what?

634
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,149
"You said..."

635
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,429
Oh, yeah.

636
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,029
You said I could go as well.
To the ball.

637
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,115
And I always keep my word.
What a totally

638
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,673
- appropriate necklace.
- Cool, innit?

639
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,549
Stop, stop, stop.
Listen, Elena, darling.

640
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,957
There's nothing in the script
about that necklace being "cool".

641
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,874
Keep your hair on.
After, I'll say it proper.

642
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,714
- From the start.
- What, again? Blimey!

643
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,989
Just start again.

644
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,754
I've cleaned all the floors,

645
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,234
I've polished

646
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,112
all the silver and I've fed

647
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,309
the chickens.

648
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,229
- Then wash the cat.
- Oh, sure. And what else?

649
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,990
I wouldn't ask if we weren't
so worried, Rafael, but...

650
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,590
we can't see
any improvement, really.

651
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,437
Yes. Yes...

652
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,637
No, she's been lying down
all afternoon.

653
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,394
I can't tell you how grateful we are.
All the best, Rafael.

654
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,349
Bye.

655
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,516
Well,

656
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,237
Rafael has managed to fix things.

657
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,309
Tomorrow the head of neurosurgery
at the Carmen Hospital is seeing her

658
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,393
and it's covered by our insurance.

659
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,113
From what he's been told,

660
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,198
he thinks it's something serious.

661
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,556
He can't understand
why we never said anything before.

662
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,190
Gloria.

663
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,748
I was thinking of Alejandro.

664
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,439
We have to pray hard

665
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,393
for Christ's will
to be done, not ours.

666
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,669
MONDAY, 16TH APRIL.

667
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,914
Hand it over,
you can't have anything.

668
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,113
Are you giving it to me or not?

669
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,599
- Bloody...
- Forgive me,

670
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,156
I tried to give it
to you but couldn't.

671
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,233
I don't have much experience
of being ill.

672
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,709
I'm so sorry.

673
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,309
Sorry!

674
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,395
How could they have missed it?

675
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,476
The tumour presses down
on the spinal cord.

676
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,319
It provoked the fracture
in her cervical vertebrae,

677
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,592
and is now the cause
of the paralysis in her upper body.

678
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,153
But she's only just been operated on.

679
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,757
I know, but we've no other choice
but to remove it immediately.

680
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,590
- Why are You punishing me, God? Why?
- Don't say that, love.

681
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,237
- What have I done to You?
- You're talking nonsense.

682
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,557
God is your father, and He's doing this
because He loves you, Camino.

683
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,028
He loves you deeply.

684
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,433
At least we know
what's wrong with you now.

685
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,995
This doctor is the best
and when they remove

686
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,431
what's causing the trouble,
you'll be as right as rain.

687
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,275
I know.
I won't say it again.

688
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,718
Shall we offer your operation

689
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,951
for all the children
suffering in the world?

690
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,830
Hello.

691
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,679
Let's see this little girl's

692
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,869
blood pressure.

693
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,509
- Are they going to cut my hair off?
- Just a bit

694
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,432
at the back.
You won't even notice.

695
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,832
They said she'll spend the night

696
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,389
- in the ICU.
- Lucky you.

697
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,471
They treat you like royalty there.

698
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,557
I wish all nurses were like you.

699
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,074
I know Mari Angeles
was a bit rough with you.

700
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,111
Her husband's left her, poor thing.

701
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,713
Oh, how awful.

702
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,192
Well, we know her name
now and can pray

703
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,550
- for her.
- Of course. We should pray

704
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,280
even for our enemies.
No food or drink...

705
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,869
She has the contrast X-ray
first thing tomorrow.

706
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,155
Dad,

707
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,234
bring me my music box, please.
It's in my bedside table.

708
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,317
I don't think you need it here.

709
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,755
The thing is...

710
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,716
Mum sometimes mentions the guardian
angel and I have weird dreams.

711
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,434
I think it bothers him
that we talk about him.

712
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,590
Oh, sweetie.

713
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,313
She needn't worry.

714
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,432
Today, I'm going to tell you a story.

715
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,194
Oh, yes.
About Cinderella.

716
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,038
But go straight to the end,
I already know the sad bit.

717
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,953
Of course, my little gift from heaven.

718
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,791
Mum says I'm not a gift,

719
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,230
I'm a precious loan that sooner
or later you'll have to give back.

720
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,034
Daddy, I really wish this was all over.

721
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,358
Right, let's prepare
our evening scrutiny.

722
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,679
Got your new motorbike?

723
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,629
I used it for the first time today.

724
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,193
What about the old one?

725
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,758
I'll try and sell it
or maybe give it away.

726
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,630
Get one with a sidecar
and take the wife out.

727
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,274
She'll look great in a helmet.

728
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,909
TUESDAY, 24TH APRIL.

729
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,709
Well,

730
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,069
it seems everything went fine.

731
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,516
She said she spent the whole
operation eating cream cakes.

732
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,555
Cakes?

733
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,117
- She's still very groggy.
- I'd like to stay with her tonight.

734
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,749
- No, not in the ICU.
- But yesterday they said...

735
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,315
One of you can go in for a moment.

736
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,235
Thank you.

737
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,068
If she has a good night we'll take her
to her room first thing tomorrow.

738
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,198
How are you feeling, sweetie?

739
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,078
They won't let me stay, love,

740
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,791
so I'll be in the other room, counting
the hours until I can be with you.

741
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,199
Do you remember "Gethsemane"?

742
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,869
So you know how lonely Jesus was
there, waiting for His hour to come.

743
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,356
Even His disciples fell asleep,

744
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,079
although I'm certain
that somewhere in Jerusalem

745
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,078
the Virgin was wide awake,
praying for Him.

746
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,749
Where was St. Joseph?

747
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,077
Wasn't he His father?

748
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,233
Try to get some sleep.

749
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,953
Now we're going to invoke
your Guardian Angel

750
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,676
so that he can protect you
and watch over you through the night.

751
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,550
Guardian Angel,
dear companion night and day,

752
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,990
leave her not alone,
lest she go astray.

753
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,278
Oh, no, no, it's true!

754
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,275
It's just no use.

755
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,399
No use at all.

756
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,671
I can't believe, not any more.

757
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,709
There's nothing left to believe in.

758
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,875
Nothing!

759
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,959
Nothing, my dear?

760
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,718
- Now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.

761
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,313
Nonsense, child.

762
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,751
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.

763
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,478
- And here I am.
- But...

764
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,948
Come here, dry those tears.

765
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,358
You can't start an adventure
looking like that.

766
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,357
- Adventure?
- Embarking on adventures

767
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,788
is stealing time from death.

768
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,394
- How could I...?
- You're well on the way

769
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,318
because you have faith.

770
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,909
Faith in love.

771
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,988
But I'm ill.

772
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,114
You're not ill, you're a person

773
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,038
who has a problem.

774
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,355
Like me.

775
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,678
- What's yours?
- Well,

776
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,598
the truth is I'm nothing

777
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,552
when you stop imagining me.

778
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,433
That's why we have to take advantage.

779
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,196
- But I'm so ugly...
- Don't talk nonsense.

780
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,835
By the end of the story you won't be.

781
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,918
So let's get a move on,
even miracles take time.

782
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,633
- Yes.
- And keep it a secret.

783
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,990
If you tell a dream,
it's not easy

784
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,275
to make it come true.

785
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,073
Where the devil did I put...?
Here it is!

786
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,838
- How would you like your dress?
- Red!

787
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,036
Of course, how absent-minded of me!

788
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,312
What were the words...?
Oh, yes!

789
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,915
Salacadula, menchicapula,
bididi-badidi-bum!

790
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,951
Daddy! Mummy!

791
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,959
What's the matter?

792
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,996
Baby Jesus came to fetch him.

793
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,751
It's a day of joy, not sadness.

794
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,712
He was so happy to leave.

795
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,956
And you let him go?

796
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,634
You don't know how excited
he was to leave, Nuria.

797
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,952
I couldn't refuse him.

798
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,309
The Lord surely has
more ambitious plans for your brother.

799
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,316
Did you let him go, too, Daddy?

800
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,309
Mummy!

801
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,836
- What's going on?
- Put this on.

802
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,952
You can't go outside like that.

803
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,674
But... Daddy.

804
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,312
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

805
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,476
- Yeye.
- Don't call me that!

806
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,188
And don't be so physical.

807
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,954
The Lord surely has
more ambitious plans for you.

808
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,309
Yeye!

809
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,432
Long live Sacred Jesus.

810
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,920
Daddy! Mummy!

811
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,559
Daddy!

812
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:13,951
No!

813
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,399
No!

814
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,872
I'm really glad you're here
with me, Mari Angeles.

815
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,873
- I've brought you back your rosary.
- No, you have it.

816
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,678
Unlike some people,

817
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,877
Jesus would never desert you.

818
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,869
My aunt Marita lost my uncle
many years ago,

819
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,036
but she says she's never alone.

820
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,233
You're an angel.

821
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,668
Do you know what I think?
That angels are like energy.

822
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,436
They're neither created
nor destroyed;

823
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,353
merely transformed.

824
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,433
My sister's out of intensive care,
recovering very quickly.

825
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,352
I'm so happy to hear that.

826
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,718
Do you think I could get a train
Thursday and come back on Friday?

827
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,878
I could sleep at the hospital,
give my mother a rest.

828
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,599
Know what I've heard?

829
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,314
The Prelate is coming here
for a General Council meeting

830
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,353
and will make a surprise visit
to one of our houses.

831
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,319
- Not here?!
- Yes, it seems like a dream to me, too.

832
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,390
Everything must be spotless,
just in case.

833
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,239
- I can't believe it.
- We'll be pushed for time.

834
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,755
- When are you going to see your aunt?
- Next week.

835
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,355
Very good.

836
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,358
It's a rhabdomyosarcoma.

837
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,475
A very aggressive form of cancer
and extremely serious at her age.

838
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,595
Very few people recover.

839
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,274
I think you should know that.
We're going to start

840
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,118
treatment to avoid it spreading.

841
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,515
- When?
- As soon as she regains her strength.

842
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,953
I'll take care of everything.
Rest assured she's in the best hands.

843
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,076
We'll do another scan in two weeks.

844
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,915
Well, the gentleman is entitled
to his opinion, but, believe me,

845
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,510
the best children's oncology team is
in Navarra. They're highly specialised.

846
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,835
They treat people

847
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,079
as people, not as mere patients.
Sugar?

848
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,114
Yes. Even so, it's a private clinic
and right now we can't...

849
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,158
I believe you should be
thinking of the girl.

850
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,230
Of course, but taking her away
from home now, weak as she is...

851
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,398
I doubt she'll like the idea.

852
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,756
Doubt, Jose, you said it.

853
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,669
As you doubted
your other daughter's vocation,

854
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,793
or when you lost your son,
or when you fail to support Gloria.

855
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,353
What is all this...?

856
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,078
You must broaden your vision.

857
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,114
As I see it,
you and Gloria are privileged.

858
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,555
It is not Camino
He has chosen, but you two.

859
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,230
Christ has visited you
with the Cross before.

860
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,352
He is putting your love
for Him to the test,

861
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,553
fathoming your innermost depths
to be sure you are both worthy of Him.

862
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,908
And I'd say it's mainly you
He is testing, Jose,

863
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,633
because Gloria's attitude

864
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,360
through all this
has been exemplary, superhuman.

865
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,028
God is doing a wondrous thing
with this little girl

866
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,673
and whatever He intends for her

867
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,154
is for her good.

868
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,792
You're giving me an injection.

869
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,468
- I know.
- Well, you know more than me...

870
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,711
With the catheter,
you can't feel a thing, sweetie.

871
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,834
No, no, it's very unpleasant.

872
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,269
Isn't it?

873
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,312
You complain all you want.

874
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,159
Shout if it bothers you.
Aaaaahh! Rebel,

875
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,675
- send us all packing.
- I won't hear of it.

876
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,037
You have to be up to what
the Lord expects of you.

877
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,954
He loves you, that's why

878
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,628
He requires more of you.
That's fair, isn't it?

879
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,474
Oooh, that one's green.
Must be mint.

880
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,878
It can't be because it tastes horrible.

881
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,830
That's normal, you get a taste
in the mouth almost immediately.

882
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,913
Are you okay, dearie?

883
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,718
There, there. Here we go.

884
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,953
My vision's clouding.

885
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,509
Try a bit harder,
you know how brave you can be...

886
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,874
Nearly done, petal.

887
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,959
For the Pope, the Church,

888
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,275
the Institution,

889
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,512
for those in need, for sinners,
for unbaptised children.

890
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,271
Just a little more, darling.

891
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,158
Go ahead and moan!

892
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,037
Long live Sacred Jesus!

893
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,199
Did you say something, love?

894
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,557
Long live Sacred Jesus,
may He be loved by all.

895
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,390
Shall we say the prayer
of Sacred Jesus?

896
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,398
No. Tonight I'm committing suicide.

897
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,676
- Stop talking nonsense.
- The devil's here.

898
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,515
He can't be here because you
and I are in the grace of God.

899
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,156
Behind you, covered in flies.

900
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,113
We'll sprinkle your bed
with holy water.

901
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,192
No, it bothers him and he'll get mad.

902
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,872
Let him get mad. That's what we want,
isn't it? We have nothing to fear.

903
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,716
He who is shepherd, is shepherd. He
who is calf, is calf. I am a shepherd.

904
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,075
Daddy is a shepherd.
Uncle Rafael too.

905
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,635
- I don't think he is.
- Yes, he's a shepherd.

906
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,632
- What about me?
- No, not you.

907
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,679
- So I'm a calf?
- You're not that either. You're nothing.

908
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,197
- And what do you shepherds do?
- Look after the calves. And sometimes...

909
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,914
we vomit.

910
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,633
Good morning, ladies.

911
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,909
Pax, aunt Marita.

912
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,439
In aeternum.

913
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,798
What a terrible thing
to happen to your sister.

914
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,638
I don't know what to think.

915
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,034
Haven't you been to see her yet?

916
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,988
This has all coincided with us being
snowed under with work at the house.

917
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,269
I imagined so.

918
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,869
Mum says Camino's
behaving like a saint.

919
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,396
If she were moved here,
I could be with her.

920
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,517
Your father's too stubborn...

921
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,030
I already told your mother
I can help them,

922
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,993
but Jose insists
she's better off there.

923
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,836
He has faith in the doctors
treating her.

924
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,153
He never had faith in anything.
Let's be honest.

925
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,352
That's why he can't bear
seeing you so happy

926
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,629
and fulfilled.

927
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,071
Here.

928
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,231
You don't know
how much good you're doing.

929
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,316
Ines sends you a very special greeting.

930
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,989
Staying for lunch?

931
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,272
We should be setting off now.

932
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,150
- But you've only just...
- There's so much to do.

933
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,718
Right then, go!

934
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,871
You got what you came for,
didn't you?

935
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,679
Off you go, then,
I have things to do as well.

936
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,635
I'm so glad to see you, Bego.
How are you?

937
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,637
They've finally found
what was wrong,

938
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,149
- haven't they, love?
- That's the main thing.

939
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,873
Last year I had
two operations for bunions

940
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,958
and my feet are like new.
When the weather changes...

941
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,754
So, what's the gossip?
How's the play coming on?

942
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,995
All right,

943
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,590
a bit naff...
But you must get better for the day.

944
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,552
We're reserving a seat
for you in the front row.

945
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,672
How's everybody doing?
How's Elena?

946
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,995
She's the absolute pits.

947
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,192
But because she's got boobs,
she's playing Cinderella.

948
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,234
- I'm sure it'll be a big success.
- Next week, after the rehearsal,

949
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,517
a group of us are coming
to see you. If you want.

950
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,039
- Here?
- Well, if you like

951
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,229
we can meet in the bar.

952
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,029
Silly,

953
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,553
it's just... well, look at me.

954
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,797
Don't worry, we're all coming
dressed up too, so you can see

955
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,798
the costumes.
The prince's is the best,

956
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,996
- my aunt's making it.
- Is he coming?

957
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,154
- How could he miss? It was his idea.
- You're joking?

958
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,834
I think he fancies you.
He wants to bring you a letter...

959
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,709
Me?

960
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,556
Hello.

961
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,314
Look, the appetisers.

962
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,070
Later on we'll lift you up

963
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,679
and change your sheets.

964
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,594
No need to lift her up,
she's about to levitate

965
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,199
all on her own.

966
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,394
- You look happy.
- You're going to be, too.

967
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,789
How so?

968
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,872
Because I'm going
to pray hard for you.

969
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,109
You'll see.

970
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,358
Look, sweetie, the tests
aren't very conclusive,

971
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,756
so the doctors are recommending
radiation therapy.

972
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,879
It's a much less aggressive
treatment than chemotherapy.

973
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,155
But, to be effective,

974
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,470
it has to be done
in the operating theatre.

975
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:40,236
Okay, but if they need to cut my hair
any shorter, they'll have to wait

976
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,475
until after Friday.

977
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,876
Why's that?

978
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,230
They're coming
to visit me, remember?

979
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,277
Mum can give me a special hairdo.

980
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:51,633
Apparently, there's a better place
where they carry out

981
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,114
this sort of operation.

982
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,235
Where?

983
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,198
In Pamplona. Your sister's over
the moon about you going there.

984
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,390
When?

985
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,312
Tomorrow.
Don Miguel Angel

986
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,994
has given us a lot of help
with all the formalities.

987
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,552
I'm not going to die,
am I, Daddy?

988
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,432
Honey, what's given you that idea?

989
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,153
It'd be a shame

990
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,158
to die now, when everything's
beginning to turn out right.

991
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,316
Camino has come to say goodbye

992
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,790
because she's going to Pamplona
to undergo a long treatment.

993
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,949
She wants to tell you
she misses you all

994
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,593
and promises to be back

995
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,313
before the school year is over.

996
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,514
Isn't that right, dearie?

997
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,596
Yes.

998
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,910
We won't interrupt you
any further.

999
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,516
- The letter. The letter.
- Oh, yes, yes.

1000
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,752
And if any of you want
to write her a letter or something,

1001
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,239
you can send it there.

1002
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,470
THURSDAY, 23TH MAY.

1003
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,199
How long do you think it takes

1004
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,834
a letter to get
from Madrid to Pamplona?

1005
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,519
I don't know, love.
It depends.

1006
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,110
If it's marked "Urgent", a couple
of days, if not, a week or so.

1007
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,309
That long?

1008
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,317
But sweetie, you've only just
told them to write to you.

1009
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,310
Give them time.

1010
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,590
Maybe somebody
already has one written.

1011
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,391
Ah, right.

1012
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,875
And I'm sure
it'll be marked "Urgent".

1013
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,632
Pity Daddy has to travel alone.

1014
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,394
I hope he's not held up,
he's bringing our things.

1015
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,794
And the film camera.

1016
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,389
Let's hope he remembers.
You know what he's like.

1017
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,875
Thank you.

1018
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,792
Could we visit the chapel
before we settle in?

1019
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,149
You can even attend mass.

1020
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,392
At 8 o'clock. But the chaplain
can also give her communion

1021
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,635
in her room.

1022
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,990
If any post arrives,
you'll tell us, right?

1023
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,599
Sweetie, you do go on!

1024
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,434
It comes at 12 o'clock.
Your mother can ask here.

1025
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,154
Yeye.

1026
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,869
You should have come here
from the start, lazy.

1027
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,797
I'll tell you all
about this place later.

1028
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,835
Mum.

1029
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,198
I was so looking forward
to seeing you!

1030
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,353
You look so pretty!

1031
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,113
- How's everything?
- Fine. Here we are at last.

1032
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,675
How's Aunt Marita?

1033
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:28,915
Hello, Dad.

1034
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,755
Nuria, love!

1035
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,149
How was the journey?

1036
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,276
Fine.
How's Camino?

1037
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,836
- Exhausted. Have you eaten?
- I had a sandwich on the way.

1038
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,509
- And you two?
- No, I haven't left her side.

1039
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,075
Well, I'm leaving.

1040
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,952
- Stay a while.
- I can't.

1041
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,634
Shall I go with you?

1042
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,071
No, I should have been back
at the house some time ago.

1043
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,675
I've got something of yours,
in the car.

1044
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,749
Give it to me some other time.
I have to dash.

1045
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,029
All right...

1046
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,675
I imagine your sister
was over the moon.

1047
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,873
She hardly saw her.
Camino's been asleep all afternoon.

1048
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,869
Mum, go down to the cafeteria
before they close.

1049
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,355
- I'm not really hungry.
- Go on, dear.

1050
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,869
Let's go down together.

1051
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,555
All right.

1052
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,515
I'll be back in a jiff, then you
can go. You must be tired as well.

1053
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,559
You found it.

1054
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,069
Darling.

1055
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,436
Mummy said you were asleep.

1056
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,279
Where's Nuria, Daddy?

1057
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,959
She had to leave.

1058
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,556
No, you don't understand me.

1059
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,030
She talked about
the father all the time,

1060
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,112
as if you didn't exist.

1061
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,669
She's changed.

1062
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,314
Well, Nuria has chosen
a different life.

1063
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,077
The main thing is that she's happy.

1064
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,474
Let it play.

1065
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,957
Why doesn't Nuria love you, Daddy?

1066
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,638
She does love me, dear.

1067
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,838
You see, Nuria was only 18
when she told us she was leaving.

1068
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,673
Suddenly.

1069
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,870
And you let her go, too, Daddy?

1070
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,198
- She was crazy about Giuseppe.
- Wasn't she just?

1071
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,839
He forgot her.

1072
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,958
Not a single letter.

1073
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,438
But that won't happen to me.

1074
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,555
Come on.

1075
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,193
I made an arrangement
with the Virgin.

1076
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,030
If I get the letter I'm expecting,
I'll never complain again.

1077
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,468
And what did She say?

1078
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,034
That if I start now,
the letter will get here quicker.

1079
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,191
It must be a very important letter.

1080
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,712
Ring Begona and make sure
she's got the hospital address right.

1081
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,480
- Didn't Mummy give it to your teacher?
- Yes.

1082
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,796
But now we know the room number.

1083
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,355
I've got a better idea.

1084
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,916
I'm going to tell her
to put "Deliver by hand" on it.

1085
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,754
Sometimes letters
get lost and never arrive.

1086
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,519
Thanks, Mr. Postman.

1087
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,595
Does it hurt?

1088
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,674
No. Not at all.

1089
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,874
Keep it, so it doesn't get lost again.

1090
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,075
Good morning.

1091
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,589
I wanted to give some things
to my daughter Nuria.

1092
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,039
- She's not in the house at the moment.
- I see...

1093
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,714
- When could I...?
- I'll see she gets them.

1094
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,517
Yes...

1095
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,069
Very well.

1096
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,234
- Please tell her I'll ring later.
- All right.

1097
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,319
And this, please.

1098
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,159
I can't take that without permission
and there's no one

1099
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,795
- here at the moment.
- Yes, but I'm sure

1100
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,350
you'll do me this small favour.
I have to go back to Madrid tomorrow.

1101
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,634
My Lord and God,

1102
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,475
I firmly believe that You are here,
that You see me, that You hear me.

1103
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,917
I adore You with the deepest reverence.
Forgive me my sins

1104
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,713
and give me grace
in this moment of prayer.

1105
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,999
Do you want to pray

1106
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,474
for something special, sweetie?

1107
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:05,030
Yes. For people
who don't have faith in love.

1108
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,029
Excellent.

1109
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,797
Spotless Virgin and mother,
St. Joseph my father

1110
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,673
and holy guardian angel,
intercede for me.

1111
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,633
Oh, good, you're here at last.

1112
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,479
Don Luis is the chaplain here
and has come to pray with us.

1113
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:29,156
- You must be Jose, the "missing" person.
- Don Luis will come whenever he can.

1114
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,673
Your daughter deserves it.

1115
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,076
Allow me...

1116
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,476
Allow me to congratulate
you both and bless you.

1117
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,719
Despite her illness,

1118
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,314
actually, thanks to her illness,

1119
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,274
this little girl
is taking Jesus very seriously.

1120
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,793
You can be thankful.

1121
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,030
Her defences are very low,
but she's happy.

1122
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,873
And so she should be.

1123
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,309
How pretty!

1124
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,952
NUMERARIES

1125
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,031
I hear you like looking
in shop windows.

1126
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:37,995
Well...

1127
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,470
they've always attracted
my attention, yes.

1128
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,791
- It's silly, but as you know...
- There you have something else to offer,

1129
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,471
another opportunity to tell God you're
prepared to sacrifice all for Him.

1130
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,551
When I get the bus,

1131
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,634
I always stand,
even if there are empty seats.

1132
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,279
That's beautiful, Ines.

1133
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,709
Here.

1134
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,554
This is for you.

1135
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,309
Well.

1136
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,953
What about your companions?

1137
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,513
They all seem very happy.

1138
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,753
Anything you might have seen
or they might have commented...

1139
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,713
The other day we did say we'd like
to listen to some music,

1140
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,919
for a while on Sundays,

1141
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,274
or after study perhaps.

1142
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,431
None of us will lose
our vocation over that.

1143
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:27,719
Vocation is never lost. If anything,
it gets thrown out of the window.

1144
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,476
We'll open the neck from the front
and we'll have to put her

1145
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,877
in a cast to totally
immobilise the head.

1146
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,878
It is rather cumbersome
but she won't be uncomfortable.

1147
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,834
It'll be a long operation
but we'll insert a portacath as well.

1148
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,078
Know what I don't like
about your films?

1149
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,952
- What?
- You're never in them.

1150
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,434
- Well, later you can film me.
- Include the Virgin.

1151
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,469
Hey...

1152
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,828
where are the flowers

1153
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,308
- I brought?
- We took them

1154
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,435
to someone more deserving.

1155
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,277
That way He'll be closer to you
during the operation, won't He?

1156
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,111
It's normal for you
to ask for a miracle.

1157
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,995
It's only human, you're her mother.

1158
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,031
But think that He is her father

1159
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,191
and we must accept His will.

1160
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,233
Let us put ourselves in His hands.

1161
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,034
He is all-knowing
and we poor souls

1162
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,749
know nothing.

1163
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,916
I'm so ashamed
of having been so weak.

1164
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,752
Oh, I'm weak too.

1165
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,150
Weaker than anyone.
That's why I pray.

1166
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,396
I pray and pray and pray.

1167
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,909
Let's go.

1168
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,555
Everything went well.

1169
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,879
Poor little thing.

1170
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,792
This...

1171
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,230
these, that, those...

1172
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:40,549
Very good, Anita.

1173
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,833
Those are the demonstrative pronouns.

1174
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,157
JESUS LOVES YOU

1175
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,476
Which room?

1176
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,398
- 208.
- Ah, yes.

1177
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,953
You enquired yesterday.

1178
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,394
And the day before.

1179
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,592
- How is your little girl?
- She's recovering splendidly.

1180
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,758
Yesterday she ate some soup
and a chicken breast.

1181
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:11,955
208.

1182
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,194
12 o'clock.

1183
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,836
Yes. Time for the Angelus.

1184
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,433
I long for those chimes every day.

1185
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,639
That's Jesus, who is nearer
to you every moment.

1186
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:28,955
I don't know.

1187
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,874
Maybe the same thing
will happen to me as my sister.

1188
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,959
You're still very young,
but perhaps, who knows?

1189
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,039
So what could I do?

1190
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,755
Love Jesus.

1191
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,999
That's what I do.

1192
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,356
- Haven't they finished?
- Is it for Camino?

1193
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,437
No, it's the anaesthetist's note.

1194
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,232
I'll give it to Marita this evening.

1195
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,793
Go when you like.
Nuria's trying to get away after lunch.

1196
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,791
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

1197
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,599
My sister's more than happy
to lend us the money.

1198
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,513
And we must keep our worries
hidden from the girls.

1199
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,240
What else do you want to keep
hidden from them, Gloria?

1200
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,873
Well now, Jose.

1201
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,477
I can imagine how hard
it must be for you to leave her.

1202
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,272
But that's God's will, right?

1203
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,033
The important thing now

1204
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,714
is for your daughter to see you both
more united than ever,

1205
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,993
rallying around her.

1206
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,389
I've seen so many marriages
break up

1207
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:39,675
in the face of adversity.

1208
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,551
It's the best gift
you could give her.

1209
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:47,079
Your little girl was telling me
that you've been making a video.

1210
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,755
Yes, well...
it's not video, it's film.

1211
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,039
Well, you can be sure that everything
you are taping will be a document

1212
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,316
of great worth.
This little creature

1213
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,671
is carrying out the mission
of an apostle without realising.

1214
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,598
Have a good journey, Jose.

1215
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,670
This should get rid
of that headache.

1216
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,514
If you need anything, just ring.

1217
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,638
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- There are blankets in there.

1218
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,231
Whoever has God lacks nothing:
God alone is enough.

1219
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,678
Exactly what we were reading.

1220
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,189
"Let naught dismay thee,
nor daunt thee,

1221
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,234
God changeth not, all things pass.

1222
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,313
God alone sufficeth."

1223
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,558
Doesn't it give you goose bumps?

1224
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,393
Did they take a photo
of St. Teresa when she died?

1225
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:46,995
What?

1226
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,793
I think you can tell
if someone's going to be a saint.

1227
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,313
That's why they take a photo.
Like with Bernadette.

1228
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,432
It has to do with people who die
in the fragrance of holiness.

1229
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,392
What did Bernadette smell of
when she died?

1230
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,551
- Flowers.
- When she went off to the convent,

1231
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,799
did you know she stopped by the mill
to say goodbye to Antoine?

1232
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,395
Yes.

1233
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,155
And what he said to her?

1234
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,152
"Goodbye, Bernadette,
I will never marry."

1235
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,429
And she left.

1236
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,389
Forever.

1237
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,679
- Without a word.
- And they'd never spoken before that.

1238
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,596
Doesn't that

1239
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,233
give you goose bumps, Nuria?

1240
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,268
WEDNESDAY, 23TH JUNE.

1241
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,953
You were a long time.

1242
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:54,351
She's still hoarse.
Her throat's raw from all the vomiting.

1243
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,039
It's been an awful week.

1244
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,989
My love,

1245
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,959
I've brought you something.

1246
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,476
How nice you smell.
I smell awful.

1247
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:08,229
- What are you talking about?
- I'm rotting.

1248
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,919
Come on, tell your dad.

1249
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,513
Has something happened?

1250
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,193
Remember the nurse
from the other hospital?

1251
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,079
She's made up with her husband
and is coming to visit us.

1252
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,674
I'm very glad.

1253
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,632
- Well, I'm not.
- How come?

1254
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,873
When I pray for others,
He answers my prayers,

1255
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,396
but when I pray for myself,
He doesn't.

1256
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,319
- It's not fair to say that, darling.
- I'm not asking Him

1257
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,433
to cure me, or to take away
this unbearable headache,

1258
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,359
or to let me walk again,

1259
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,319
or to give me my hair back...

1260
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:45,439
One thing, that's all I've asked
Him for. I've always loved Him.

1261
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,108
- Why doesn't He answer me?
- That'll do. We're offending Him.

1262
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,872
If He loved me,
He wouldn't do this to me.

1263
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,189
Camino, you're not to say that.

1264
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,954
Well, you know what?
I'm not going to love Him either.

1265
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,469
That's enough.
We're offending Him.

1266
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,312
Now we're going to thank Him
for everything He does for us.

1267
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,114
Thank Him for what?

1268
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,033
I thank Him every day
for our daughter's illness.

1269
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,593
Don't argue, please.

1270
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,555
God knows

1271
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:12,715
I don't really mean it.

1272
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,758
I know, love, I know.

1273
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,995
Let me get the chaplain

1274
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:18,798
and the three of us can confess,

1275
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,712
right now.
Don't you think?

1276
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,635
Daddy,

1277
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,633
if God is good and generous,

1278
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,871
and just, and I love Him

1279
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,792
with all my heart,

1280
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,071
why doesn't He want me
to get better?

1281
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,074
Where's the problem?

1282
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,394
Well, you see, sweetie, the doctors
are doing everything they can.

1283
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,071
The thing is,
your case is very difficult.

1284
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,996
You have a very serious illness
that little is known about.

1285
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,996
- We have to be... patient.
- Lf God can do everything

1286
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,755
and knows everything,
what's His problem, Daddy?

1287
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,875
I don't know.

1288
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,678
I wish I knew the answer.

1289
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,159
Maybe He's jealous.

1290
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,635
Maybe...

1291
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,912
But I don't want to die without Jesus
knowing how much I love him.

1292
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,269
Do you think He doesn't know that?

1293
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,353
Daddy, get me out of here.
You can.

1294
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,269
No, sweetie, I can't.
If I could, you wouldn't be here now.

1295
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,199
Daddy, get me out of here.
The two of us can run away.

1296
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,879
And where do you want us to go?

1297
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,789
To Vienna.

1298
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,719
Vienna? Why?

1299
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,235
I'll need the dress.

1300
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,039
Go on, buy it for me.

1301
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,309
I can't go like this.

1302
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,958
Let me know when everything's ready.

1303
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:42,789
Daddy,

1304
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,032
are you going to let me go too?

1305
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,918
Promise me you'll get well,

1306
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,515
otherwise the doctor
won't let you board the plane.

1307
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,909
I don't want to go by plane,
silly, or by car or by boat.

1308
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,838
So how do you want me to take you?

1309
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,355
Guess.

1310
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,834
SPECIAL OFFER
PRAGUE, VIENNA, SALZBURG

1311
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,314
What are you doing, Jose?

1312
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,038
Taking flowers to our daughter.

1313
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,073
And right now I'm going to Madrid.

1314
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,315
Now? Why?

1315
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,839
To get the dress.

1316
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,512
The red one, with the straps,
the low neckline

1317
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,153
and the short skirt.

1318
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,639
The shop on the corner
of Nunez de Balboa and Hermosilla.

1319
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,031
Let's hope it's still there.

1320
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,631
I'm doing what I can, too.

1321
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,190
- I'll come straight back.
- Yes.

1322
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,677
But don't leave
without reading her

1323
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,512
the story.
You promised

1324
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,119
and she's expecting you.

1325
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,876
"Mr. Meebles is a wise fellow who knows
everything about everything..."

1326
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,434
- Shall I read it some other time?
- Go on.

1327
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,670
"He does all sorts of magic tricks
and is always ready

1328
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,757
to accompany you
on a thousand adventures.

1329
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,113
- He just has one small problem."
- "He doesn't exist."

1330
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,673
- Did you know already or what?
- Yes. So did you.

1331
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,595
Not there, Mummy.

1332
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,879
- What?
- Don't put anything on the armchair.

1333
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,516
Daddy, film me.

1334
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,150
- Now?
- Yes, now. Quick.

1335
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,954
Here again.

1336
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:37,956
- Yes, I'm here again, sweetie.
- No. The one who laughs at us.

1337
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,109
Let's call on the Virgin
to come right now, shall we?

1338
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,033
Why's he laughing, Mummy?
What's he laughing at?

1339
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,437
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not. He can't do anything to me.

1340
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,113
Tell him we don't want him here.

1341
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,516
- He says we should pray for him.
- No!

1342
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:58,078
We must pray for our enemies.
The nun said so.

1343
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,959
Are you still filming, Daddy?

1344
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,872
Holy, immortal God,
protect us from all evil...

1345
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,554
It's all right.

1346
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:18,428
He's gone.
God is here now.

1347
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,518
Of course He is.
He has always been with us.

1348
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,073
No, you don't understand.

1349
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,673
He's here, in the room,

1350
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:26,909
sitting in the armchair.

1351
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,635
Film Him, Daddy.

1352
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,231
Lord, protect her every moment.

1353
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,595
Daddy!

1354
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,193
Take me to Vienna!

1355
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,868
Sweetie, how can Daddy
take you to Vienna?

1356
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,270
How else?
In his arms.

1357
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,358
SUPER 8 DEVELOPED

1358
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:52,114
We'll deliver it
to your house as usual.

1359
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,198
Thirty. You could celebrate
a wedding with all this.

1360
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,072
All you need now
are the bride and groom.

1361
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,954
- Is that your son?
- Yes. Say hello.

1362
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:11,876
Hello.

1363
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,355
Are you going to be

1364
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:16,199
- a baker too when you grow up?
- Him? No way.

1365
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:19,113
All he talks about is the theatre.

1366
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,711
My daughter's very fond of it, too.

1367
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,557
Is she?

1368
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:25,234
Aren't you in the group

1369
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:27,755
- that's putting on Cinderella?
- Answer, son.

1370
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,750
Yes, it's on the 26th June.

1371
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,951
It must be really something.

1372
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,354
All this rehearsing!

1373
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,675
You can come if you like.

1374
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,909
To be honest... I'd love to take
my daughter, she wanted to be

1375
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,269
in it,

1376
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,028
but unfortunately she can't...

1377
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,356
Are you Camino's father?
The girl who's in Pamplona?

1378
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,949
Yes, how did you know...?

1379
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,714
Is she okay?
Or is it true that she's...?

1380
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,396
The truth is she's very sick, yes.

1381
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:05,552
We're all hoping for a miracle.

1382
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,314
Oh, yes, my niece told me.

1383
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,313
On the house.

1384
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,279
We were going to see her
at the hospital, but since she left...

1385
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,630
Say hello to her
from the boy who plays the prince.

1386
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,068
You can be sure I will.

1387
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:23,594
I'm on my way there now.

1388
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:25,792
- Your name is?
- Cuco.

1389
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:28,269
- Cuco?
- His name's Jesus,

1390
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,708
but we've always called him Cuco.

1391
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:35,354
Bye, Jesus.

1392
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,396
Bye.

1393
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,831
VIENNA CAKES

1394
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,755
Jesus, you don't have
a letter, do you?

1395
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:12,357
I want to tell you something, Gloria.

1396
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,278
Don't worry, she's resting.

1397
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,832
You know that the Prelate
has spent a few days in Spain.

1398
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,838
I know, Camino and I have been
praying hard for you all.

1399
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:26,237
Well, I've had the chance
to mention your case to him,

1400
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,870
and he wanted to know everything,
down to the last detail.

1401
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:34,358
He feels there's something extraordinary
in your daughter's behaviour.

1402
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,195
The father wants saints,
as well you know.

1403
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,158
It is the best service we can
render him and, therefore, God.

1404
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:45,069
Examples of lives dedicated
without reserve, in real life, today.

1405
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,074
Can you imagine the positive impact

1406
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,754
your daughter's example
could have on young people,

1407
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:53,156
boys and girls of her own age?

1408
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:58,158
We may be talking of the first girl
from the Institution to be canonised.

1409
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,958
But that doesn't depend on us.

1410
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:05,351
Of course not. It is God who
chooses us, not we who choose Him.

1411
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:09,479
But we can help, smooth the way.

1412
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,513
- How?
- By doing what is most difficult:

1413
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,876
Allowing God to be the one to act.

1414
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:19,514
I mean, the very miracle you've
been praying for might be just that.

1415
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,559
Needless to say, Gloria,

1416
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,070
the father requires us
to be very discreet about this.

1417
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:27,113
The fame for holiness
must be spontaneous.

1418
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,956
Ah, and he suggests that if she
voluntarily sought admission with us,

1419
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,675
that in itself
would be a very valuable thing.

1420
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,512
- I understand.
- Gloria...

1421
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,957
The devil has a lot at stake here.

1422
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,192
And if we are right,

1423
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,557
you can be sure he'll be back
to tempt her a third time.

1424
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,553
FOR CAMINO

1425
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:41,953
I just spoke to don Miguel Angel.

1426
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,628
He's coming from Madrid
tomorrow to be with you both.

1427
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:48,037
I don't get it. And she was
beginning to put on some weight!

1428
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:51,152
That was the cortisone,
but the metastasis has appeared

1429
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:52,753
in her meninges.

1430
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,359
That's why she's losing her eyesight.

1431
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:55,828
No!
She's improving...

1432
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,069
Believe me,

1433
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,514
there's nothing we can do.

1434
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,036
Look, the Lord is wiser

1435
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,152
and if He chooses to take her,
it's the best thing for her.

1436
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,751
The whole staff of the clinic

1437
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,353
are shocked by the news.

1438
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,877
Don't let her see us cry.
Let her see us happy.

1439
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,235
And I think
the best thing is to tell her.

1440
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,153
- Not keep anything from her.
- I can't...

1441
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:18,799
Offer it, Gloria.

1442
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,039
Offer it.

1443
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:28,353
You've been a long time, Mum.
I was getting impatient.

1444
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,028
How are you, sweetie?

1445
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,677
- Fine. Or rather, excellent.
- Why's that?

1446
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:41,117
Look what they brought me.
From reception.

1447
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:46,676
- Shall we open it?
- Yes, yes, right away.

1448
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,519
You're burning up, darling.

1449
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:54,394
It's only a slight temperature.

1450
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,238
What a lovely smell.

1451
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:00,999
Who's it from?

1452
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,239
Your friend Begona.

1453
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,109
Begona?

1454
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,429
Let's see.

1455
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,199
You'll love this.

1456
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,919
It's about Jesus.

1457
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:21,989
Really?

1458
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,073
Put it where I can see it.

1459
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,910
Of course.

1460
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,113
Show it to me, please.

1461
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,159
Camino, love.

1462
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,916
We have a treasure in our hands.

1463
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,836
You more than anyone, but me too.

1464
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,793
Neither you nor I are going
to let it go to waste, are we?

1465
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,674
No. I can't wait to tell Daddy.

1466
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:19,589
Me too.

1467
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,233
Sweetie, do you want to cry?

1468
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:26,990
Me?

1469
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,508
No. Why?

1470
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:32,396
- That'll be Daddy.
- Yes.

1471
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:34,192
He must be about to arrive.

1472
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:38,436
Hello?

1473
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:40,756
Yes, speaking.

1474
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:43,957
Yes, I'm his wife.

1475
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,553
What?

1476
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,989
He has left us,

1477
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:01,353
and just when this family
most needed him.

1478
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,195
But Jose Maria's death
has not been in vain.

1479
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:11,475
His departure to Heaven makes us feel
even closer the presence of Christ.

1480
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,276
It is His way of stripping us
in order to make us immensely rich

1481
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,629
in His richness.

1482
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:22,473
God, our true father, asks of us
today, more strongly than ever,

1483
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:25,478
that we adore Him and sacrifice
ourselves for Him and that we never

1484
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,318
lose faith in His love.

1485
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,554
Because without Him,

1486
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,756
who is almighty and all-knowing,

1487
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:33,876
we are nothing

1488
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,030
and have nothing.

1489
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,275
Yeye is jealous of me.

1490
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,031
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1491
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,429
And yes,

1492
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,518
I am jealous of you.

1493
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,354
I'm jealous of
the enormous faith you have

1494
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:59,196
and I'm jealous because...

1495
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:02,031
you're going to heaven.

1496
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,752
That's why I'm jealous.

1497
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:08,713
Do you want me to pray
for you to die as well?

1498
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:16,550
Do you remember the stories
Daddy told us when we were little?

1499
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:18,714
I used to love them.

1500
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,912
The last one he read to me
is in my bedside table drawer.

1501
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,315
You have it.

1502
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,958
I just can't wait!

1503
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:32,757
- What day is it today?
- The 25th. Friday.

1504
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:37,838
They're coming for me tomorrow.
I must be wide awake.

1505
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,475
Yeye, could you do me a favour?

1506
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:43,669
What?

1507
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,868
Put the letter where I can see it

1508
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:49,679
all the time.

1509
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:57,595
SATURDAY, 26TH JUNE

1510
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:01,908
Kids, good luck to you all.

1511
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,513
In the theatre
you don't say good luck.

1512
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,591
- So what do you say?
- Where's the prince?

1513
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:06,869
Upstairs.

1514
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,430
Yes.

1515
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:38,589
That was your mother.

1516
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,069
You must go straight away.

1517
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,758
- I've nearly finished.
- Forget about that.

1518
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,069
I don't think there's time.

1519
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,188
I'll get ready and go.

1520
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,516
- You can take my umbrella.
- Ines...

1521
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:52,433
Maybe I should get a taxi to
the hospital, unless you consider

1522
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:54,676
- that inappropriate.
- Goodness me, girl.

1523
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,559
Who am I to say
if it's appropriate or not?

1524
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:23,470
Excuse me.

1525
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,235
Do you realise, all you
here present, how privileged

1526
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:32,915
we are?
We are not in a hospital room,

1527
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,353
we are in the ante-chamber to Heaven.

1528
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,910
It is Jesus who is calling you

1529
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,914
because He needs you there
more than here.

1530
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:06,796
How can you go to the ball if you don't
know how to dance? And what's this?

1531
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,792
A dress, innit?
You blind or what?

1532
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,309
I'll kill her.

1533
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:16,950
You said I could go...

1534
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,435
Oh, yeah.

1535
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:20,114
You said I could go

1536
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:21,350
to the...

1537
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:24,630
to the...

1538
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,514
To the ball.

1539
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,875
Well I always keep my promises.

1540
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:32,950
Oh, darling,

1541
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,951
what a totally appropriate necklace.

1542
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,069
Don't say it, don't say it...

1543
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:38,474
Totally cool, innit?

1544
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:39,795
She said it.

1545
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,360
Anastasia! Griselda!
My beautiful daughters,

1546
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:46,913
come and see this.

1547
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:50,918
Aren't I just
gorgeously gorgeous, Mother?

1548
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:51,637
And me?

1549
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,390
Isn't it true that the prince
will faint at my feet,

1550
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,431
dazzled by my beauty and style?

1551
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:09,431
Hey!

1552
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:11,318
That necklace is mine, Mummy.

1553
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:13,994
She stole it from me!
She's a dirty thief.

1554
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:15,795
And she's made that dress

1555
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,275
from my curtains.
I thought it looked familiar.

1556
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,797
My dears!
That's quite enough!

1557
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,393
Let's be off or we'll be late.

1558
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,078
Good night, Cinderella.

1559
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:35,556
Hell! It's not fair!
I won't trust anybody ever again!

1560
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:57,073
Mummy, my time has come.

1561
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,628
Yes, my darling.

1562
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:09,797
Through this Holy Unction
and His most tender mercy,

1563
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:13,154
may the Lord help you
by the grace of the Holy Spirit.

1564
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,116
Amen.

1565
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,197
That, having cleansed you of all sin,
He may comfort you

1566
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:18,237
as you go forth on this journey

1567
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,431
- and grant you His salvation.
- Amen.

1568
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:24,669
No fairy godmother, no transformation,
straight to the ball.

1569
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:27,480
Cuco, do what you have to
but bring me Cinderella!

1570
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,798
You lot, help me put the throne
with the back facing the audience.

1571
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,035
Come on.

1572
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:46,189
What are you doing?
You have to go on.

1573
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:47,469
You go on alone.

1574
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:50,599
But we need you.
Without Cinderella we can't finish.

1575
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:52,235
Come on!

1576
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,955
You go, with that tacky costume. Or put
on your baker's apron. It suits you

1577
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:57,388
down to the fucking ground.

1578
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,155
Shame old "Baldy-locks"
didn't come to see you.

1579
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:17,154
Someone's crying. Why?

1580
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,473
We're all crying, dear.

1581
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,319
With joy,

1582
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,273
and envy.

1583
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:28,350
With envy because
you're going with Jesus.

1584
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,909
Yes, I want to be with him now.

1585
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:36,148
Sweetie, do you want to tell Him
how much you love Him?

1586
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,637
Yes. You help me.

1587
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,591
Jesus,

1588
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,594
my little girl loves You very much,

1589
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:48,271
more than anything in the world.
Don't you, my love?

1590
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:50,310
Yes.

1591
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:52,868
She is very weary

1592
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,558
and can hardly speak,

1593
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,395
but You know
that with every heartbeat

1594
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:00,874
she is saying she loves You.

1595
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:03,118
- Aren't you, my love?
- Yes.

1596
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:07,754
He, too, is so looking forward
to being with you.

1597
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:08,870
Yes.

1598
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:31,152
Now you have to open the window.

1599
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,193
It's raining, my darling.

1600
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:41,718
Now you all have
to help me very much.

1601
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,357
Are you frightened, sweetie?

1602
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:47,114
No, but you are.

1603
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,036
Why, love?
Why should I be afraid?

1604
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:53,955
Because I can see an ugly face.
A very ugly face.

1605
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:56,033
Open the curtain.

1606
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:57,271
Go on!

1607
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:06,470
Go on!

1608
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,076
Come on, dammit!

1609
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,753
He left.

1610
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,276
Don't be silly.

1611
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:33,429
Why would he leave?

1612
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:35,119
Because the black one has come.

1613
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:40,355
Blessed be God.

1614
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:43,075
Misses Anastasia
and Griselda Gremein...

1615
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:44,190
Break a leg.

1616
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:47,238
...daughters of the widow
of Monsieur Gremein Gremein.

1617
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,878
What about Daddy?
Isn't he coming?

1618
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:57,156
Daddy can't wait to be with you.

1619
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:01,077
I hope he doesn't get muddled because
they're already coming to get me.

1620
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:05,198
Jose Maria, Alejandro,
come to help her,

1621
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,270
don't leave her alone,
she's still just a child.

1622
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:14,268
Lead her to the Gates of Heaven
so she doesn't go astray.

1623
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:19,356
Mummy, do you think that in this state

1624
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:21,039
they will let me join them?

1625
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,398
You're already in.

1626
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,235
Yes.

1627
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,993
Hello, titch.

1628
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:05,394
It's as if she were no longer with us.

1629
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:09,996
- I have to go now.
- Don't go.

1630
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:11,753
I've no choice.

1631
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,598
I always knew this story was crap.

1632
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,392
How can you say that?

1633
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:19,110
I could never have dreamed
of such a nice ending.

1634
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:53,635
Jesus,

1635
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:56,553
I know You love her very much.

1636
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,558
More than anyone else in the world...

1637
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:03,796
though it's hard to believe anyone
could love her more than I do.

1638
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:06,635
I know the best place for her
is in Your arms.

1639
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,353
It smells of flowers!

1640
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:51,715
Sweetie,

1641
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:52,995
are you happy?

1642
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:09,672
Daddy!

1643
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:24,115
Sweetie, are you happy?

1644
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:26,995
Yes.

1645
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:30,909
Very.
I've never been so happy.

1646
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:52,953
JESUS LOVES YOU

1647
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:02,269
I think we should take
a photograph, don't you?

1648
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,593
She looks so pretty.

1649
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,756
MONDAY, 28TH JUNE.

1650
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,031
She said she would die on the 26th,

1651
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:29,356
the anniversary
of Don Jose Maria's death,

1652
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:31,639
and she did.

1653
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,637
This girl fulfilled
everything she promised.

1654
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:38,033
No, not everything.
But we'll do it for her.

1655
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:11,439
UNSUITABLE

1656
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:14,637
IN LOVING MEMORY OF ALEXIA GONZALEZ,
WHO DIED IN PAMPLONA IN 1985

1657
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:17,070
AND IS CURRENTLY IN
THE PROCESS OF BEATIFICATION.
