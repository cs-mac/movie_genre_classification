{15711}{15800}You didn't see the look|on this young man's face, Linda.
{15809}{15853}He was terrified.
{16195}{16236}Coach Jones?

{23182}{23211}Come on, Harold.
{23216}{23276}lt's bad enough when a parent|misses a conference.

{23513}{23537}What?
{23561}{23628}Please just tell me|that you forgot to go.

{25215}{25309}l want you to picture your man|right across from you.
{25374}{25417}You see him?

{25513}{25575}You play smart,|you're gonna outthink them.
{25580}{25635}You play with heart and character...
{25642}{25712}...and give your teammates everything|you've got on every play...
{25716}{25805}...you can walk off the field calling|yourselves a football team.
{25891}{25985}Let's play with Hanna pride and never|stop believing in each other.

{26448}{26484}Let's go, Jackets!
{26500}{26539}<i>The kickoff is high and deep...</i>
{26544}{26632}<i>...and sends the Jackets' Johnny Clay|back near the goal line.</i>
{26656}{26762}<i>Johnny Clay behind a convoy of Hanna|blockers. Heads up the right sideline.</i>
{26767}{26800}Go! Go! Go! Go!
{26812}{26836}Get up there!

{26958}{26982}Come on!
{26987}{27028}<i>First and 1 0 for the Jackets.</i>
{27042}{27076}<i>Marcum back to pass.</i>
{27081}{27160}<i>Finds Hawkins in the right flat|for another Jacket first down.</i>
{27165}{27217}Get over here. Come on. Come on.
{27232}{27272}Thirty-six crossbuck.
{27277}{27371}Once you get the ball, l don't wanna|see nothing but the back of your jersey.
{27376}{27419}All right. Get out there.
{27445}{27476}<i>The handoff is to Clay.</i>
{27481}{27582}<i>Finds a big hole. Now cuts outside.|Beats one tackler. And another.</i>
{27584}{27673}<i>-Get upfield, son. Turn it on!|-He may go all the way.</i>
{27702}{27752}<i>-Touchdown, Hanna!|-Yeah! All right.</i>
{27786}{27857}<i>Johnny Clay with a 30-yard run|gives the Jackets the lead!</i>
{27869}{27939}<i>-Less than two minutes to play.|-That's what we want.</i>
{28030}{28071}That's a 30-yard run, son!
{28126}{28188}That's our ball game!|That's our ball game!

{29229}{29253}Well...
{29301}{29346}...didn't exactly thump them...
{29351}{29442}...but it wasn't too bad|as far as season openers go.
{29447}{29507}Frank, your boy, Johnny,|had a heck of a run.
{29512}{29572}Give him the ball,|he'll make you a smart man.
{29579}{29603}That's right.
{29610}{29680}Did notice a few things|we need to work on.
{29684}{29764}You reckon these are the boys|gonna take us back to state?
{29768}{29852}Come on, Clive. Little early|for that kind of talk, isn't it?
{29857}{29931}l hear Easley has a pretty|decent crop of speed this year.
{29934}{29991}l guess we'll see about that|next week.
{29999}{30061}Think you might want to throw|the ball a bit more?
{30063}{30104}l think about a lot of things.
{30109}{30231}Listen, boys. Last thing coach needs|is us asking him a slew of questions.
{30236}{30317}Especially after how he got|those young men to play.
{30322}{30365}We got them revved up, didn't we?
{30370}{30444}So how do you plan on beating those|Easley boys Friday night?
{30449}{30514}Well, Frank, if l was to tell you|that...
{30531}{30596}...y'all wouldn't have a thing to talk|about all week.
{30754}{30809}Boy, that's a good cup tonight, Del.

{36031}{36120}-He tell you his name yet?|-He doesn't talk too much.
{36129}{36196}But he's sure taken a liking|to that radio of yours.
{36235}{36271}Radio.

{36451}{36508}You know, it's just sitting there.

{36686}{36774}Coach Honeycutt says you can take|that home with you if you like.
{36786}{36813}Hey, are you hungry?
{36844}{36875}Would you like a hambur--?
{37021}{37119}You want something to wash it|down with too? Root beer? Coke?

{38623}{38688}There's nothing wrong|with a good country station.

{43010}{43118}Defense, containment. We gotta|keep them from getting outside.
{43123}{43224}Offense, ball control. We'll grind it|out, keep their offense off the field.
{43265}{43315}Now, there's one other thing.
{43320}{43365}See the young man over there?
{43392}{43485}Believe some of you already|know him. He goes by Radio.
{43492}{43543}He'll be helping us out for a while.
{43607}{43655}We will not have a problem with that.
{43660}{43701}No, sir.

{47290}{47369}Hi, everybody. Hi, everybody.|Hi, everybody.
{47571}{47621}Quite a show you put on tonight.
{47626}{47719}Just wondering if you were running|a football program or a social club.
{48259}{48324}Radio, l need to talk to your mama.|That okay?
{48355}{48395}She right there.
{48513}{48590}-Hi, Mama.|-There's a sandwich in there for you.
{48633}{48688}-l'll be in there directly.|-Okay, Mama.
{48762}{48793}Ma'am.
{48906}{49024}l was wondering if we might carry|your son tomorrow on the team bus.
{49031}{49062}Got us a football game.
{49084}{49151}What your boys done to my son|was wrong...
{49156}{49211}...but l don't expect you|to make up for it.
{49237}{49285}The boys are taking to him real good.
{49299}{49357}They're still boys, now, ain't they?
{49367}{49412}l'll keep a good eye on him.
{49462}{49520}l guess it's all right with me.
{49625}{49683}l don't mean to pry, ma'am...
{49702}{49741}...but l was hoping...
{49779}{49858}...l might be able to ask you|what exactly is wrong with him.
{49899}{49964}Well, the doctors never could|give me a name for it.
{49968}{50069}Say he the same as everybody else,|just a little slower than most.
{50074}{50153}l got a older boy, Walter.|He's fine and all.
{50194}{50227}And their daddy?
{50381}{50414}He died a while back.
{50465}{50491}l'm sorry.
{50544}{50575}You got your hands full.
{50587}{50688}Well, they got me working 1 0 hours|a day at the hospital. Some days more.
{50695}{50772}So l'm wondering where he's at|half the time...
{50779}{50829}...and worrying all the time.
{50834}{50913}Because l figure they only gonna need|one excuse to put him away.
{50973}{51100}James is a good boy, coach.|He got himself a good heart.
{51107}{51186}Most folks just don't take the time|to see it, is all.
{51196}{51225}James.
{51270}{51321}James Robert Kennedy.
{51371}{51400}Thank you, ma'am.
{51570}{51635}<i>No, he is not getting on that bus.</i>
{51639}{51697}Harold, he is not a student.
{51707}{51769}You don't even know how old he is.
{51774}{51843}Look, he has a handicap|we know nothing about.
{51848}{51906}What if he has some kind|of a seizure?
{51910}{51966}He's not the one who's|gonna have the seizure.
{51970}{52018}This has nothing to do|with any of that.
{52023}{52076}lf you're saying|l'm overly concerned...
{52081}{52167}...about my students being with|a severely handicapped black man...
{52172}{52215}...l assure you that l am.
{52217}{52296}But my concern is not necessarily|for my students.
{52352}{52416}l'm not so sure we're trying to help|somebody here...
{52419}{52505}...or whether he's being used as|nothing more than a glorified mascot.
{52527}{52599}You know me a hell of a lot|better than that.
{52759}{52807}Put your game face on.
{52822}{52920}Wipe your smile off your faces.|Start thinking about football.
{52946}{53013}-Coach Jones. lt raining hard.|-Radio. Radio.
{53018}{53064}-Gonna be wet out there.|-lt sure is.
{53068}{53150}Listen, we're not gonna be able|to take you on the bus today.
{53191}{53291}Some folks, they don't think|it's a good idea.
{53301}{53385}They just don't understand yet,|but they'll catch on. Believe me.
{53397}{53430}l'm sorry.
{53452}{53488}l'm really sorry.
{53548}{53598}l'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

{67198}{67320}Well, l know a .500 season|isn't what we all had in mind...
{67325}{67399}...but l did see some things tonight|l think we can build on.
{67418}{67485}The boys made good adjustments|at halftime...
{67488}{67552}...and Danny Marcum finally got|the offense moving.
{67557}{67605}-He sure did.|-He sure did, coach.
{67620}{67675}l'm real proud of all the boys.
{67716}{67809}Always good to beat Westside,|and it's nice to win the last one.
{67821}{67891}Wasn't long ago|we were winning most every one.
{67910}{67962}There something you need|to say, Frank?
{68015}{68039}Well...

{68423}{68471}lt's all right, you can speak up.
{68538}{68624}Well, if nobody else is gonna|say anything, l sure as hell will.

{69538}{69574}Sorry, coach.
{69873}{69924}Well, now you show up.
{69929}{69957}You chickenshit.

{70410}{70538}Yeah, he says we got a problem|with Radio being on the sidelines.
{70669}{70713}What do you think?

{71077}{71151}Just fine long as Johnny|stays healthy. Why?

{108698}{108792}-ls that what you're thinking, coach?|-That's what l'm saying.
{108801}{108883}Well, then, seeing that Coach Jones|is the athletic director...
{108887}{108931}...l say you are not playing.
{108935}{109015}Ma'am, this is Westside.|lf we win, we're in first place.
{109027}{109113}That's all the more reason for you|to cheer on your teammates, isn't it?
{109118}{109158}Anything else?
{109233}{109288}Yeah, tell your boy that l said thanks.
{109293}{109348}Radio didn't sell you out, son.
{109360}{109425}There are plenty of other people|willing to do that.
{109612}{109650}Yes, sir.
{109672}{109727}Well, l appreciate|your understanding.
{109746}{109806}We'll talk soon. Thank you.
{109909}{109952}That's the last of them.

{110002}{110072}Yeah, she's fine. She knows|it wasn't Radio's idea.
{110077}{110110}Oh, Harold.
{110115}{110187}Harold, you are too close|to this.
{110194}{110283}lt's not that Johnny talked Radio into|doing it, it's that he did it.
{110288}{110350}What if it's something worse|next time?
{110379}{110448}-He'll know.|-Are you sure?
{110470}{110527}Hell, l'm already|under a microscope anyway.
{110532}{110604}l got a school to run, a thousand kids|l'm responsible for.
{110609}{110662}l need to know|where all this is going.
{110667}{110714}l don't know, Lou.
{110738}{110791}That may not be|good enough anymore.
{111009}{111108}l'm sorry. l've been trying to call, and|l haven't gotten ahold of either of them.
{111112}{111165}l tried several different places.
{111170}{111230}Here he comes right now.|l'll tell him.
{111278}{111347}-What's the matter?|-lt's Radio's mama, Daddy.
{111355}{111405}-What happened?|-She had a heart attack.
{111410}{111455}Oh, no. ls she all right?
{111477}{111508}No, she's gone.
{111522}{111626}l was trying to call you or Mom,|but l couldn't reach anybody.
{111630}{111736}And they're telling me|that he won't come out of his room.
{111745}{111784}l don't know what to do, Daddy.
{111789}{111834}All right. Put your coat on.
{111839}{111906}He's just sitting there in his room.
{111916}{111944}You got it?
{112283}{112306}lrv.
{112311}{112362}Coach, thanks for coming.

{112424}{112505}-How's Radio?|-He's pretty upset.

{113951}{113994}lt's just me. lt's Coach Jones.
{114246}{114280}lt's just coach.

{114433}{114457}Yeah.
{114496}{114560}-That's you.|-Radio right there.
{114812}{114920}There's Mama there. Mama said|we got good football this year.
{114925}{114949}Yes. Yeah.
{114953}{115009}That's what Mama said.|We got good--
{115287}{115368}Radio, ain't nothing l can say is|gonna make you feel any better.
{115407}{115443}Mama.
{115447}{115510}Your mama was a fine,|beautiful woman.
{115515}{115579}She loved you with all her heart,|didn't she?
{115584}{115642}Oh, boy, did she love you.
{115694}{115766}-She still does.|-She love the Radio.
{115853}{115929}She said she's always gonna|be there for Radio.
{116040}{116071}James...
{116114}{116150}...look at me.
{116174}{116205}Look at me.
{116222}{116308}She will always be there for you.|All right? She will.
{116325}{116366}You understand that?
{116375}{116464}Always be with you inside,|right in your heart. All right?
{116721}{116764}We're gonna be all right.
{116809}{116862}All right, boy. Come here. Come here.
{116903}{116953}Where's my mama?
{117248}{117289}Hold on just a second.
{117397}{117440}l want to tell you something.
{117507}{117560}Something l never told anybody.
{117622}{117701}When l was about 1 2,|l had a paper route.
{117751}{117802}Crack of dawn every day.
{117855}{117927}Wasn't many houses|around here then...
{117931}{117998}...so l had to cover quite a lot|of territory...
{118003}{118123}...and l used to cut through|the woods on this little dirt road.
{118133}{118231}And one morning, l was riding|through there...
{118236}{118301}...and l heard this noise.
{118332}{118459}Sounded like a rabbit or something,|you know, caught in a trap.
{118480}{118576}And then l realized it was coming from|one of the houses set back in there.
{118629}{118670}l kind of walked over there...
{118675}{118763}...and didn't seem like anybody|was home, so l walked on up.
{118768}{118893}lt had, you know, chicken wire and|barbed wire around the bottom of it.
{118898}{118957}l figure to keep the critters out,|you know?
{119027}{119140}And then all of the sudden, l saw|these fingers coming through the wire.
{119180}{119233}And l put my bike down...
{119252}{119315}...and got down|on my hands and knees...
{119334}{119451}...and l looked under there,|and there was this boy about my age.
{119473}{119557}l don't know what was wrong|with him. Something was.
{119576}{119626}They used to keep him under there.
{119636}{119730}And l looked right at him.
{119761}{119811}He looked back at me.
{119888}{119962}We just sat there staring|at each other for a while.
{120092}{120168}l ran that route for two years,|Mary Helen.
{120331}{120382}And l never did a thing.
{120681}{120734}l just wanted you to know that.
{120787}{120825}Thanks, Daddy.
{121425}{121489}-How long before he comes back?|-l'm hoping tomorrow.
{121492}{121547}His brother Walter's moved in|with him.
{121552}{121626}Honeycutt says he let loose|on that house pretty good.
{121640}{121705}Says he's not the only one|that knows about it either.
{121710}{121756}The man had just lost his|mother, Lou.
{121760}{121866}l didn't ask why he took a swing at his|wall. l asked you if you knew about it.
{121871}{121916}Why are you asking me that?
{122024}{122094}Our friend from the board is back.|He wants to see you.
{122132}{122209}With his mama gone, it's all different.|Every bit of it.
{122285}{122312}Good luck.
{122367}{122484}ln the last month, how much time|has Mr. Kennedy spent alone?
{122513}{122559}During the day at least.
{122614}{122647}Mr. Jones.
{122662}{122755}Past few weeks? Everybody's been|keeping a pretty steady eye on him.
{122786}{122839}So we talking an hour a day?|Or two?
{122844}{122916}An hour, maybe.|Well, it could be a half-hour.
{122985}{123029}Well, as you may have guessed...
{123033}{123122}...the board has received reports of|Mr. Kennedy's inconsistent behavior.
{123127}{123173}What kind of reports? From who?
{123177}{123228}Reports of resisting arrest...
{123249}{123321}...tearing up his home,|barging into the girls' locker room.
{123326}{123357}Oh, barging?
{123364}{123475}-Who's been feeding you this crap?|-l'm not here to argue with you.
{123479}{123573}l'm not arguing. lt's a simple question.|Who's been feeding you this crap?
{123609}{123736}l ask because those were all instances|in which he wasn't being supervised.
{123738}{123762}Says who?
{123822}{123853}Says who?
{123875}{124002}Bottom line, with Ms. Kennedy gone,|James faces some rough times ahead.
{124009}{124086}-To keep him in a school setting--|-Let me tell you something.
{124091}{124160}This school is the reason he's doing|as well as he is.
{124172}{124232}But to keep him in a school setting--
{124237}{124314}You take him out of this school,|you may as well take his life.
{124362}{124458}-l've compiled a list of care agencies.|-Oh, l'll bet you have.
{125021}{125091}Yes, ma'am, l will take care of it|personally.
{125095}{125131}Yes, l will.
{125143}{125167}Yes, ma'am.
{125254}{125287}Yes, ma'am.
{125302}{125338}ls that a fact?
{125381}{125429}That's some serious money.
{125433}{125496}Well, all right. Yes, l will.
{125508}{125541}All right, now, you too.
{125601}{125644}-Harold.|-Hello, Frank.
{125649}{125745}-lt's been ages since you were here.|-Yeah, it sure has been.
{125891}{125920}So...
{125956}{126021}-...what can l do for you?|-What are you trying to do?
{126030}{126074}l'm afraid l don't understand.
{126078}{126179}Yeah, you do. Calling the school board,|making complaints about Radio.
{126196}{126273}This is you getting back at me|for cracking down on your boy.
{126277}{126349}Now, let's not go off making this|all personal.
{126352}{126424}-lt is personal.|-lt's not. Besides which, if it was...
{126431}{126510}...most of the guys at Del and Don's|wouldn't feel the way l do.
{126534}{126570}Yeah, what way is that?
{126620}{126685}You're one of the finest coaches|in the upstate.
{126690}{126769}And with Johnny and the boys|we got coming back next year...
{126803}{126898}...it's just better if we do things|the way we used to.
{126946}{127021}You just want to be the one|runs Radio out of Hanna.
{127157}{127215}At least l know where you stand.
{127277}{127328}Radio. That's the O.
{127332}{127412}Big, round circle.|Yeah, you try it now.
{127443}{127507}Come on, it's all right. lt's okay.
{127515}{127560}There you go, take the pencil.
{127606}{127658}You can do it, l know you can.
{127702}{127726}That's it.
{128032}{128054}There.
{128085}{128145}Look at that. You did it.
{128164}{128239}Congratulations. Good job.

{128627}{128675}Johnny, welcome back, man.
{128706}{128733}What's this?
{128740}{128795}He brought that in a little while ago.
{129557}{129632}Sorry Coach Jones got mad at you.
{129636}{129684}He got real mad.

{131857}{131909}Well, l don't want to talk about him.
{131962}{131991}Harold.
{132039}{132075}l know what you're thinking.

{133777}{133835}Settle down, settle down, settle down.
{133840}{133911}Now, l've coached a lot of basketball|over the years.

{134624}{134705}With the defense they were playing,|you could have gone for 50.

{134784}{134823}-Bye, everybody.|-See you, Radio.
{134827}{134873}Bye, Johnny. Bye, now.|See you later.
{134878}{134914}What's that?

{135026}{135132}Look, son, we got a whole lot|to look forward to next year.
{135137}{135235}And l don't want anything or anyone|getting in the way. You understand?
{135276}{135340}Radio's not the one getting|in the way, Dad.
{135515}{135631}That Frank, he's just scared|you got it in for his son, is all.
{135638}{135693}<i>When Gloria was a baby,|I never left her alone.</i>

{136050}{136146}Yeah, l don't think they're interested|in your side of things, do you?

{136494}{136578}Radio would've been better off|if we'd just gotten him some help.
{136585}{136674}Help? And what you've been|giving him has been...?
{136683}{136741}Couldn't have been easy|on you and Mary Helen...

{136815}{136856}Harold, wait.

{140095}{140150}That's right. We'll go all the way.
{140155}{140234}-That's right, Radio.|-We gonna go all of the way.
{140239}{140304}Because we got the spirit.
{140493}{140589}We gonna go all the way.|We gonna go all the way.
{140632}{140718}This man is a disruptive force|in our community...
{140723}{140785}...and represents a threat|to our students.
{140807}{140833}Thank you, Mr. Clay.
{140838}{140944}Okay, Okay. l understand how|some of you might be feeling.
{140948}{141064}All l am asking is that if we decide|that there's no other way around this...
{141068}{141131}...that we dole out as little hurt|as possible.
{141133}{141207}Fine. Honeycutt, is there anything|you'd like to add?
{141342}{141411}-Evening, Del. Don.|-Harold.
{141416}{141471}-Evening, everyone.|-Evening.
{141543}{141574}Hi, Lou.
{141593}{141639}-How you doing?|-l'm good. l'm good.
{141644}{141692}-How are you?|-Good.
{141709}{141759}l was gonna call you.
{141785}{141872}-You got a crowded shop tonight, Del.|-Yeah, coach.
{141876}{141967}l think y'all know my wife, Linda,|and my daughter, Mary Helen.
{142015}{142044}-Evening.|-Evening, ma'am.
{142078}{142157}Well, l had a talk with Radio|this morning.
{142178}{142296}l told him, in not so many words, that|we might be looking at some changes.
{142318}{142375}lt didn't take long to see|the more l talked...
{142380}{142428}...the more he didn't understand me.
{142454}{142507}We got a lot of that going on around.
{142648}{142701}When l was playing, l had a coach...
{142708}{142775}...he used to tell me to keep|my priorities straight.
{142795}{142852}He'd say, ''Son, you figure out what's|important.
{142857}{142915}You push everything else aside.''
{143025}{143066}l love football.
{143111}{143154}l love everything about it.
{143195}{143253}l love Friday nights when|you look for a win...
{143255}{143320}...and Saturday morning|when you found one.
{143430}{143507}But that's not what's important|right now.
{143559}{143639}We got ourselves a young man|we're not thinking about.
{143689}{143768}The same young man who could|hardly talk when we first met him...
{143773}{143842}...and now he's making|announcements over the loudspeaker.
{143900}{143974}Same young man who got himself|a football letter last fall...
{143979}{144051}...but never wears it, because|he can't afford a jacket.
{144130}{144173}Now we're asking him to leave.
{144178}{144252}-Harold, we are not asking--|-The man's not done, Frank.
{144336}{144415}l know some of you don't know|or don't care...
{144420}{144507}...about all that Radio's learned|over these past few months.
{144559}{144593}Well, the truth is...
{144612}{144674}...we're not the ones|who've been teaching Radio.
{144725}{144777}Radio's the one been teaching us.
{144859}{144902}The way he treats us all the time...
{144907}{144988}...is the way we wish we treated|each other even part of the time.
{145077}{145187}l know something's gotta happen here.|l know some changes gotta be made.
{145238}{145343}And l know l can't let what happened|last season happen again.
{145442}{145506}So l've decided to step down|as head football coach.
{145792}{145837}See what you've done, Frank.
{145940}{146003}l'd like to keep teaching,|if that's all right.
{146017}{146103}l'll keep an eye on Radio,|make sure he stays out of trouble.
{146123}{146163}And l'd like to spend more time...
{146168}{146240}...with a few other folks|l've neglected over the years...
{146247}{146295}...while l still have a chance to.
{146391}{146516}Much as l love this game, it's not|half as important as setting that right.
{146621}{146662}That was a pretty good cup, Del.
{146722}{146768}-Thank y'all.|-Good night.
{146938}{146978}This what you wanted?
{146983}{147019}ls this worth it?
{147113}{147192}-That was a crazy idea.|-Weren't expecting that, were you?
{147197}{147276}l can't believe you're gonna stop|coaching football.
{147446}{147547}Found it. Under the mattress|with everything else.
{147561}{147592}All right.
{147621}{147686}You look great, Radio.
{147691}{147715}Thanks, Mary Helen.
{147717}{147760}-l'll see you out there.|-All right.
{147765}{147808}-There she go.|-Get your collar down.
{147813}{147868}You look good, now.|You look really good.
{147873}{147914}You know where we'll be, right?
{147918}{147942}All right.
{147950}{148031}-Do a good job. l'm awful proud of you.|-Okay, coach.
{148036}{148081}-There l go.|-Hey, Radio.
{148105}{148153}Oh, hey, Johnny, how you doing?
{148163}{148249}-l heard you got yourself a letter.|-Yeah, they gave me a letter.
{148256}{148338}Me and the boys thought you might|need something to put it on.
{148381}{148434}-That for Radio?|-Yeah.
{148559}{148616}-How you like that one?|-Looks good on you, man.
{148621}{148688}Thanks, Johnny. Thanks, Johnny.
{148729}{148796}Hey, congratulations, man...
{148822}{148851}...and thanks a lot.
{148858}{148877}Patricia Ann Yearwood.
{148877}{148921}Patricia Ann Yearwood.
{148990}{149043}Thanks, Radio. You're the best.
{149064}{149096}Thank you.
{149100}{149206}l would also like to extend|a special thank-you...
{149211}{149271}...to our honorary graduate...
{149275}{149352}...Mr. James Robert Kennedy.
{149486}{149527}Yeah, Radio! All right!
{149532}{149628}Who has decided to return|this coming fall...
{149633}{149714}...as an 1 1 th-grade student|at Hanna...
{149719}{149841}...where he will be welcome for|as many such years as he so chooses.
{149954}{150026}-You got your assistant coach back.|-Yes, we did.
{150095}{150148}<i>In that moment,|my husband was prouder...</i>
{150153}{150222}<i>...than if his team had won|a state title.</i>
{150333}{150409}<i>Radio was now officially|a part of Hanna...</i>
{150414}{150469}<i>...and a part of our lives forever.</i>
{150563}{150649}<i>So if you're ever in Anderson on|a Friday in the fall, get there early.</i>
{150654}{150707}<i>You'll see the man|they call Radio...</i>
{150709}{150779}<i>...leading the Yellow Jackets|onto the field.</i>
{150791}{150836}<i>Radio's in his 50s now...</i>
{150841}{150937}<i>...and he's the most beloved coach|Hanna's ever had.</i>
{150949}{150992}Coach Harold Jones.
{150997}{151021}<i>Harold Jones?</i>
{151026}{151138}<i>He was recently inducted into the|South Carolina Coaches Hall of Fame.</i>
{151143}{151241}<i>He's retired from teaching but still|maintains his special friendship...</i>
{151246}{151318}<i>...with Hanna's favorite 1 1 th-grader.</i>
{151546}{151649}Ready? Ready! Set!
{151759}{151800}Touchdown!
