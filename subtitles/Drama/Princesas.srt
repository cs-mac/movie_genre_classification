1
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,034
Room 207?

2
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,593
Are you a relative?

3
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,073
Visiting hours end at 8:30.
You'll hear the announcement.

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,273
You can use those elevators.

5
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,193
Here she comes!

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,550
Hi.

7
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,795
Hi.

8
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,559
Hi.

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,518
Are you the birthday boy?

10
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,679
Who is this?

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,315
Listen up.
There's nothing to it.

12
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,718
First, the 60 euros.
Second, nobody touches anything.

13
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,350
Except me.

14
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,517
You wanna touch, you pay more.

15
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,472
And nobody goes near my backpack.

16
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,070
And by nobody l mean nobody, okay?

17
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,357
Let's celebrate your birthday.

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,032
if life gives you

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,030
more than five reasons to go on.

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,997
if life gives you

21
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,069
more than five corners to sleep in.

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,032
if life gives you

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,914
more than five million to die...

24
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,917
You strain yourself.

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,197
Night and day.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,716
You strain yourself.

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,038
Night and day.

28
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,678
if life gives you

29
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,914
more than five bastards
to put up with.

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,519
if life gives you

31
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,715
more than five lessons
to not go on...

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,672
You strain yourself.

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,032
Night and day.

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,591
You strain yourself.

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,878
Night and day.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,752
if life gives you

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,829
more than five reasons to go on.

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,598
if life gives you

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,795
more than five corners to sleep in.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,911
You strain yourself.

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,312
Night and day.

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,751
You strain yourself.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,077
Night and day.

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,670
You strain yourself.

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,511
You strain yourself.

46
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,073
-How's it going?
-Better.

47
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,998
Having lunch with your mother?

48
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,879
And give me some pessaries.

49
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,310
And four twelve-packs.
Supersensitive.

50
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,075
Was it Canesten?

51
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,996
Yes.

52
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,909
Zero kilos. You're so light.

53
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,838
That means you're an angel.

54
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,119
You have to put a coin in
for it to work.

55
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,397
lt's from a local store.

56
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,669
What does it say?

57
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,916
''With love.'' The fourth one.

58
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,233
Must be a neighborhood fan.

59
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,512
-Let me see the handwriting.
-Wine?

60
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,838
He could be from the senior center.

61
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,878
What about the guy
from the 5th floor?

62
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,640
Him? He hardly says hi
when he sees me.

63
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,034
Exactly.

64
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,150
Someone older.

65
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,709
Maybe they have the wrong address.

66
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,989
What?

67
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,474
Mother can't have an admirer?

68
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,999
Of course she can.

69
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,918
She can have as many as she wants.

70
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,239
You get them,
that's what matters.

71
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,672
We exist because someone
thinks about us, not vice versa.

72
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,477
Someone said that,
l don't remember who.

73
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,636
Someone wise.

74
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,512
Wise and corny.

75
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,552
Aren't you going to answer?

76
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,275
What if it's for me?

77
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,191
For you?
lt's my cell phone.

78
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,475
Since they keep ringing...

79
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,511
lt might be important.

80
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,828
How's your teaching?

81
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,078
She's not teaching anymore.

82
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,834
l'm the principal now.

83
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,397
Congratulations.
That's good, right?

84
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,911
Yeah.

85
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,076
Since 2 years ago.

86
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,672
Really? Congratulations.

87
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,838
Maybe it's Dad.

88
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,034
Sending the flowers.

89
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,509
Why not? Maybe he felt guilty.

90
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,949
Maybe.

91
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,872
lf he hadn't died 3 years ago.

92
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,429
That's not certain.

93
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,391
You identified him at the morgue.

94
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,395
l didn't look that close.
l said yes without looking.

95
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,629
Mother, please.

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,631
We didn't check his DNA.

97
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,400
With DNA you can tell
who it is right away.

98
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,396
Dad is dead,

99
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,635
period.

100
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,509
Maybe he ran off with a woman
and doesn't dare come back.

101
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,874
Hence the flowers.

102
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,758
To say he's sorry and thinking
of me, without saying it.

103
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,195
Your father was always a coward,
Cayetana. A good man,

104
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,994
but a coward.

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,154
Answer the phone!

106
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,551
l get nervous
when you don't answer!

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,669
Who is this?

108
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,629
Lima.

109
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,269
Lima.

110
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,913
No. Why?

111
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,429
So they say.

112
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,669
Brunette.

113
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,075
Average.

114
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,911
100. The works, 100.

115
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,839
Blowjob, 50.

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,438
Anything except in the ass.

117
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,799
As long as it takes,
half an hour.

118
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,479
Half an hour, tops.

119
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,150
Who is it?

120
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,270
What?

121
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,032
What else can l say?

122
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,797
At Vidal's on Providencia.

123
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,875
They're the worst.

124
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,350
The worst, Gloria.
Since they came, this is a jungle.

125
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,952
They'll fuck for 20 euros.
Some even for 15.

126
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,555
Blowjobs for 10, like junkies.

127
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,988
But guys like them.

128
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,315
lt must be the novelty.

129
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,916
Gloria,

130
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,033
l only work half as much
since they came.

131
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,755
They have to do something.
There's no work in their countries.

132
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,350
Don't people fuck there?
They must have learned somewhere.

133
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,795
lf they were hairdressers,
you wouldn't be defending them.

134
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,394
What racists.

135
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,678
That's not it. You're wrong.

136
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,513
lt's not racism.

137
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,792
The problem is the market.
The laws of the market.

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,676
Not the supermarket, the other one.
lt's demand and competition.

139
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,520
There's not enough demand
and there's no competition.

140
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,756
The Minister of Economics
said it on TV.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,912
They come here and do
as they fucking please.

142
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,953
The Minister said that?

143
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,996
Not the ''fucking'' part,
but he definitely thought it.

144
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,633
And he's a minister.

145
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,076
He must know
what he's talking about.

146
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,557
You know more
about blowjobs, Caye.

147
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,872
But the Minister of Economics
knows more about economics.

148
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,271
Rosa's the expert on ministers.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,913
No comment.

150
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,190
And the cops.
What good are they?

151
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,908
These girls don't even know
what working papers are.

152
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,679
Don't be mean, Caren.

153
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,915
Believe me.

154
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,153
lf they were lawyers...

155
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,191
Have you really
screwed ministers?

156
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,628
A bit of everything.

157
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,554
And ministers too?

158
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
The secret service followed me
and my phone's been bugged

159
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,908
so many times...

160
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,510
You wouldn't be here if you screwed
a minister. You'd have a nice house.

161
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,550
Hello?

162
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,715
l didn't want a house,
but l had plenty of offers.

163
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,109
With ducks and everything.

164
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,514
Who did you screw?.

165
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,028
You'd never believe me.

166
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,515
45.

167
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,710
How big?

168
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,598
How much were these?

169
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,631
2,000 euros. 2,500.

170
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,639
The bastard was jerking off.

171
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,194
l know where you get a perfect
boob job for 1 ,000.

172
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,358
1 ,000? lf you're going to get one,
do it right.

173
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,915
But smaller tits are in right now.

174
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,155
lt gets you more work.

175
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,515
Look how she walks,

176
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,593
sticking her ass out.

177
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,753
They learn how to do it as kids.

178
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,957
They put stuff in their shoes

179
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,673
to make them walk like that.

180
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,756
Come on.

181
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,518
l saw it on the BBC.

182
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,837
And they smell different.
Hormones.

183
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,590
The strong smell attracts the guys.

184
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,156
They don't bathe.
lt's a cultural or religious thing.

185
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,236
Almost finished?

186
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,034
Let them wait.
Good things are worth waiting for.

187
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,390
Like cleavage and a G-string,
but in hormones.

188
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,395
-Hi, Caye.
-Hi.

189
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,752
Are you meeting Lima?

190
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,670
At five.
And it's ten past already.

191
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,989
Yeah. l got held up.

192
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,834
One minute.

193
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,189
Shall we go?

194
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,714
You're too late.

195
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,038
Couldn't you wait 10 minutes?
l came from the other side of town.

196
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,789
Give me the bill.

197
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,068
At least pay for my taxi.

198
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,673
l'm not paying you anything.

199
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,789
What about you?

200
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,359
Didn't you hear the Minister?

201
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,508
Can't you talk?

202
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,479
There are rules around here.
This isn't the jungle!

203
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,632
You come to this country
and do whatever you fucking want!

204
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,152
Watch. Nothing will happen.

205
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,199
They take the one in blue away
every 3 days.

206
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,710
lf they take them away
l'll blow them myself.

207
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,078
You have loose ends.

208
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,599
She's got everything loose.

209
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,916
Angela's very loose in general.

210
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,153
Well? Why don't you try it?

211
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,674
She's got a good ass.
You could make some extra cash.

212
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,471
Forget it.

213
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,110
Another one.

214
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,032
Mamen's very popular.

215
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,071
Guys like piercings.

216
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,078
What about my boyfriend?

217
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,235
Look after him.

218
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,034
l'm as faithful as they come.
l can screw 30 guys

219
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,152
and l'm still faithful.
lt's just a job.

220
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,075
Maybe you go to a club
with your friends,

221
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,475
have a few drinks,

222
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,875
see someone you like
and fuck him.

223
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,909
Nice and tan.

224
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,310
Well-built.

225
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,838
With his tongue pierced.

226
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,119
l'd fuck him.

227
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,351
You see? l wouldn't.

228
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,838
Bring him in sometime to meet us.

229
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,111
Who, my boyfriend?
No way.

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,228
What does he do?

231
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,955
He takes pictures.

232
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,229
Of who?

233
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,756
l don't know, of nobody.
He likes it.

234
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,115
Hey!

235
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,435
Hey!

236
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,396
Hello?

237
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,430
Hello?

238
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,388
Hello?

239
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,513
Hold your breath.

240
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,399
l don't have papers.

241
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,479
They won't ask for them.

242
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,034
lf they do, say you left them
at home, but they won't.

243
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,239
Do l have to pay for this?

244
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,274
lt's free.

245
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,868
Do you know him?

246
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,793
From before.

247
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,836
He's getting me a work permit.

248
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,914
A customer?

249
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,675
l fuck him for free.

250
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,392
Down payment for my papers.

251
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,914
What happened today?

252
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,748
l said no.

253
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,314
The same thing happened
the last time.

254
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,270
l had to screw him
so he would go.

255
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,073
ls he a cop?

256
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,955
My friend says he is,
but l don't know.

257
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,434
Your friend introduced you?

258
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,277
Sulema?

259
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,591
Where do you buy your clothes?

260
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,159
l'll take you one day.

261
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,308
He's a bastard.

262
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,751
He can't hit you.

263
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,870
Press charges.

264
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,119
We have rights, you know?.
They said it on TV.

265
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,356
Without papers, l can't.

266
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,559
How long you been here?

267
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,589
Ten months.

268
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,671
l applied for residence.
l didn't get it.

269
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,719
Are you in the park?

270
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,279
That's where l found out
about the apartment.

271
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,756
From Marga, a Colombian.
You know her?

272
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,479
l want to move. lt's expensive.

273
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,317
l have a kid back home,

274
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,509
with my mom.

275
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,199
l send them money.

276
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,315
l want to save up and bring him here
so he can take care of me.

277
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,435
He's handsome.

278
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,839
Looks like a little monkey.

279
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,269
Edward.

280
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,399
Little Edward.

281
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,954
Do they know what you do?

282
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,472
Mom would die if she knew.

283
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,870
l say l work in a bar.

284
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,708
What about your family?

285
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,155
They don't know either.

286
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,119
This is temporary.

287
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,433
l'm saving up, too.

288
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,195
To buy a pair of tits like yours.

289
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,235
What?

290
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,919
Did you see him?

291
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,678
l saw him on the stairs.

292
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,268
l bet it was the mob.

293
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,950
She owed them money
and they collected.

294
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,358
How long has she been here?

295
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,472
Maybe she tried to rob him.

296
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,589
ln her apartment?

297
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,279
They're not too bright.

298
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,989
Look who's here.

299
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,076
Miss Methadone.

300
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,759
You're so mean, Angela.

301
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,394
Once she was so pretty,
she drove the neighborhood crazy.

302
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,113
And now look at her.

303
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,469
Hi, Gloria.

304
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,829
Hi, girls.

305
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,510
Can l use your bathroom?

306
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,469
lt's broken.

307
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,715
l'll only be a minute.

308
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,875
Try Jose's.

309
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,792
l was already there.
His is broken, too.

310
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,755
Hi, Caye.

311
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,231
You look so pretty.

312
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,834
How's your morning going?

313
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,508
Okay, turned a few tricks already.

314
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,999
Gloria, let me in, please.

315
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,155
l can't.

316
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,673
Fuck, l won't mess it up.

317
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,189
lt's broken.

318
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,033
Piece of shit bathrooms.

319
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,999
They're always broken.

320
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,189
That's the way it is.

321
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,953
Yeah, whatever.

322
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,469
See you later, Gloria.

323
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,157
l like the ones with cross-straps
and with single straps, too.

324
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,030
Those are the colors l like.

325
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,673
l want this color.

326
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,879
Perfectly made, honey.

327
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,559
And they're on sale.

328
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,628
How pretty!

329
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,990
How much?

330
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,559
Two for a euro.

331
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,636
lt's banana leaf with corn
and a little meat. You'll love it.

332
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,552
Comfortable panties. Flexible ones,
light ones, quality ones.

333
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,598
Ladies, try them on.
Make yourselves at home.

334
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,870
Come, sinners, if you're not wearing
panties, you're going to hell.

335
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,552
Look at these panties!

336
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,072
My son's birthday is on the 12th.

337
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,754
He's turning five.

338
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,679
Take care, okay?

339
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,719
Take care.

340
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,550
Do everything Grandma tells you.

341
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,352
Are you behaving yourself?

342
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,511
Mommy misses you a lot too.

343
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,079
We'll see each other again soon,
you'll see.

344
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,713
Real soon, my darling.

345
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,834
Listen.

346
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,197
How was school this week?

347
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,349
How was it?

348
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,358
Me too, my darling.
Hang on just a little longer.

349
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,755
Tell Grandma to sing you
the song you like.

350
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,033
You'll love it, you'll see.

351
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,469
Zulema!

352
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,236
lt's been so long!

353
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,309
How are you?

354
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,832
You're nearly as tall as l am.

355
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,350
lt's been a long time, Walter.
How are you?

356
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,318
Since Juancito's birthday.

357
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,073
The black guy likes you.

358
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,718
Forget it. l don't like them.

359
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,834
To fuck, l mean.
lf it's work, l don't care,

360
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,110
but not for free.
l prefer white guys.

361
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,155
But it's the same thing.

362
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,115
No, it isn't.

363
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,637
How could it be?
There are differences.

364
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,035
Pigments and stuff
l won't mention here,

365
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,237
but you see it in documentaries.

366
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,152
l used to feel that way too.

367
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,914
lt put me off, their whiteness.

368
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,755
You do everything?

369
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,115
Just about.

370
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,116
Me, too.

371
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,555
Except swallow, it makes me puke.

372
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,468
And not up the ass.

373
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,029
Me, neither.

374
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,639
l let them watch videos.

375
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,348
They come faster.
Girl on girl action, cum shots...

376
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,512
They freak at the video store.

377
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,309
l tell them things.

378
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,635
Like what?

379
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,358
All kinds of filthy shit.

380
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,149
Stick it to me. Deeper.
Fill me up with cream.

381
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,634
Fill me up with cream?

382
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,156
l swear. They love it.

383
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,431
l don't know why.
Works like magic.

384
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,834
l say it and they're off.

385
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,871
l'll try it.
Fill it up with cream.

386
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,712
Fill me up with cream.

387
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,079
Fill me up with cream.

388
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,710
And always with a rubber,
or no deal.

389
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,829
Do you take tests?

390
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,997
They used to test us at the club,
but not anymore.

391
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,469
l'm clean.

392
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,473
Are you working today?

393
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,275
l'm going out.

394
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,795
Does it make you nostalgic?

395
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,115
What?

396
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,515
Everything. The food.

397
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,795
A little.

398
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,712
Weird, isn't it? Nostalgia.

399
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,674
lt's not a bad thing in itself.

400
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,999
lt means you had good times

401
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,235
and you miss them.

402
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,471
Me, l don't feel nostalgic.

403
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,237
Nothing worth missing
has ever happened to me.

404
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,069
Talk about shitty.

405
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,110
Can you feel nostalgic over
something that hasn't happened yet?

406
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,833
Because sometimes, l do.

407
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,754
l imagine how things
are going to be,

408
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,118
with boys, for example,

409
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,312
or life in general.

410
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,557
And l feel sad when l remember
how nice they were going to be,

411
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,037
because they were going
to be beautiful,

412
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,839
really beautiful.

413
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,798
Then, l feel nostalgic

414
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,995
because they were
going to be so beautiful.

415
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,750
And when l realize
they haven't happened yet,

416
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,678
that they may never happen,

417
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,832
l get really sad.

418
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,838
Really sad.

419
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,997
lt's like a down payment
of sadness.

420
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,436
Like a deposit on
a rented apartment,

421
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,073
but of sadness.

422
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,513
And you advance it
because you know eventually

423
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,153
you'll use it up anyway.

424
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,114
l've got another question.

425
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,432
When you're kids do they put
stuff in your shoes

426
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,715
to make your ass stick out?

427
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,716
Who?

428
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,594
l don't know. Someone.

429
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,869
Whoever.

430
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,349
Cream?

431
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,355
Yes, please. Cream.

432
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,596
-What was it?
-Fill me up with cream.

433
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,028
Fill me up with cream.

434
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,715
Fill us up with cream.

435
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,514
Fill us both up!

436
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,990
Bring us cream, please!

437
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,358
At least let me tell them.

438
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,590
l'm with my friends
and they're already inside.

439
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,392
l don't care.
You can't go in.

440
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,275
They just went in.
A tall guy and two others.

441
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,549
They just went in.

442
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,915
Nobody's gone in.

443
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,189
You just let three guys in.

444
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,196
Let him in.

445
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,189
Stay out of this.

446
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,389
l'm trying to help.

447
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,998
-ls he with you?
-No, l'm not.

448
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,351
l came with friends.
They'll be waiting for me inside.

449
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,112
Can l go in?

450
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,151
No.

451
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,832
You see?

452
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,231
lf you were with me,
you'd already be inside.

453
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,553
But l don't know you at all.

454
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,759
Can l speak with your superior?

455
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,714
l don't have a superior.

456
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,955
Who are you, God?

457
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,798
You're not missing anything.

458
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,514
-There's hardly any chicks.
-Was l talking to you?

459
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,236
No, right?

460
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,755
Are you coming?

461
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,915
What if they come out?

462
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,994
They're not coming out.

463
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,389
Why are you alone?

464
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,908
l like going out alone.

465
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,069
lsn't it boring?

466
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,874
At least no one
leaves me waiting outside.

467
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,829
What's your name?

468
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,955
That depends.

469
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,309
On what?

470
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,308
On the day.

471
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,558
l've got two names.
Which do you prefer?

472
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,909
Which one do you like?

473
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,435
Caye.

474
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,799
Cayetana, Caye.

475
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,233
You're weird, Caye.

476
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,795
Do l scare you?

477
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,555
A little.

478
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,155
Want to go back?

479
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,875
What do you do?

480
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,838
l work with computers.
l'm a programmer.

481
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,191
But l want to set up
my own business.

482
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,151
Like Bill Gates. He started
from scratch and look at him.

483
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,875
ls he doing well?

484
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,917
Well? He's a fucking genius.

485
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,317
He built an empire from nothing.

486
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,431
You know how hard that is?

487
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,275
Very, right?

488
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,998
He's a god. He's passionate.

489
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,159
That's why he's been successful.

490
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,672
You have to be passionate
about everything. Computers, life...

491
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,108
everything.

492
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,748
Are you passionate
in your work?

493
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,795
Very.

494
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,349
Great. lt's the only way.

495
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,676
Like l say, whatever you do,
do it with passion.

496
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,279
lf not, don't bother.

497
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,631
-Do you like computers?
-The new ones, especially.

498
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,875
l can give you software.

499
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,594
Design, music...
whatever you want.

500
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,676
Great.

501
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,154
What do you do?

502
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,993
l'm a whore.

503
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,834
That's funny.

504
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,429
A whore.

505
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,748
Hilarious.

506
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,509
Zulema?

507
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,356
Yes?

508
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,110
Who is it?

509
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,670
Zulema?

510
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,076
She's not here.
Try again in the morning.

511
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,995
l pay half.
One shift, until eight.

512
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,393
l get it in the daytime.

513
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,392
lt's called the warm bed
because it's never empty.

514
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,878
lt's better than sharing a place.

515
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,069
That's half the time.
Some beds you only get for 8 hours,

516
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,589
just to sleep in.

517
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,994
Are they nice?

518
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,395
They're from back home.

519
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,035
We hardly talk.

520
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,990
The less they know the better.

521
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,398
They might know someone back home

522
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,470
and gossip.

523
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,508
Do you like them?

524
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,958
Guys like them big, right?

525
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,994
Since her operation,
Angela's working a lot more.

526
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,630
There can be a psychological
reaction. Rejection.

527
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,154
Self-rejection.

528
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,476
Your body says no,

529
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,393
so you have to get them removed.

530
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,717
How does Manuel like them?

531
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,116
l don't know. l'll ask him.

532
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,915
You might scare him.

533
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,193
He's already scared.

534
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,948
He's a bit weird.
Always talking about computers.

535
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,792
l think l scare him.

536
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,716
But l like him, he's very funny.

537
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,989
You told him?

538
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,349
l told him

539
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,675
but he didn't believe me.

540
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,598
But you told him.

541
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,991
lf l told him

542
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,475
that l was a cashier or whatever,
he'd believe me.

543
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,714
And you know what
really pisses me off?

544
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,116
They can't pick you up
after work.

545
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,958
l'd really love that.

546
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,640
l'd work in an office
doing whatever, l don't care,

547
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,956
but l want to be picked up
after work.

548
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,669
Can you imagine?

549
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,396
See him there waiting,
from the window.

550
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,913
And he's really hot and
the other girls are green with envy.

551
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,876
Just think.

552
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,511
Just saying it is amazing.

553
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,514
''Pick me up.''

554
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,513
That's what love is, right?
Being picked up after work.

555
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,593
The rest is bullshit.

556
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,154
Forget flowers and rings.

557
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,311
They can stick that up their ass.

558
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,671
l just want to be picked up
after work.

559
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,918
ls it the same in your country?

560
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,190
Have you ever
been picked up after work?

561
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,155
A few times.

562
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,275
How lucky.

563
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,116
Do you eat chicken there as well?

564
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,914
Chicken, rice, corn...

565
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,111
But we don't eat that much.

566
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,235
The heat?

567
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,634
No, the government.

568
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,191
Do you have cinemas
and shopping malls?

569
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,310
Mother, please.

570
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,396
What?

571
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,517
She's from Santo Domingo, not Mars.

572
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,676
For me, Santo Domingo
and Mars are the same.

573
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,192
How long does it take
to get there?

574
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,828
Ten hours by plane.

575
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,479
That's not so far.

576
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,916
l thought it would be farther.

577
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,189
Who wants dessert?

578
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,230
l'll help you, Pilar.

579
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,749
Do you miss it?

580
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,028
Mostly my son.

581
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,678
lt might be someone from across

582
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,111
because l get them
only when l'm home.

583
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,156
She gets flowers
from a secret admirer.

584
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,035
How lucky.

585
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,468
lt's not your father.

586
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,558
He would write something.

587
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,916
Maybe he's in Santo Domingo.

588
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,275
ls your father away?

589
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,113
As away as can be.

590
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,033
He's been buried for 3 years.

591
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,069
She can't accept it.

592
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,154
She misses him.

593
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,913
She's lonely, Carlos.

594
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,635
-Being lonely sucks.
-And she misses him.

595
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,713
But they were constantly
at each other's throats.

596
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,279
They weren't.

597
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,910
Are you like her now?.
You make up whatever you don't like.

598
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,592
But they weren't. You just
choose to remember it that way.

599
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,631
l remember it the way
it really was.

600
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,354
You left home.
You don't know what it was like.

601
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,039
lt's like the flowers,
or am l making that up too?

602
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,468
She sends them to herself.

603
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,716
She orders them from the florist's.

604
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,790
Really?

605
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,672
And she writes the cards.

606
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,956
ln capitals so we won't realize.

607
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,391
And they're playing along.

608
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,749
They told us to
at the senior center.

609
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,918
Whatever, Carlos, but it scares me.

610
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,314
lt's a fantasy.

611
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,839
Sending flowers every 3 days.

612
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,395
180 euros of fantasy a month.

613
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,995
What does she write?

614
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,635
On the cards.

615
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,838
What does she write to herself?

616
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,837
Do you like sweets, Zulema?

617
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,511
A lot.

618
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,593
You don't answer either?

619
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,515
Why do you even bother
buying cell phones?

620
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,069
l was telling Pilar
we need a lecturer.

621
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,309
What's the seminar about?

622
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,994
Sex education.

623
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,513
l know a lot about that.

624
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,359
l've done it a lot. Back home.

625
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,470
Seriously?

626
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,190
Sex education?

627
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,749
l'm an expert.

628
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,114
How much does it pay?

629
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,959
They're hypnotized.

630
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,358
l can do your makeup later.

631
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,672
l took a state course

632
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,199
in makeup for movies.

633
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,872
And another in catwalk modeling
but l couldn't keep my balance.

634
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,799
How's your balance?

635
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,835
Fine.

636
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,193
Mine's really bad.

637
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,751
As a kid, l was always falling.

638
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,757
One day l fell seven times.

639
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,518
My mother'd fill my pockets
with sand to make me heavier

640
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,869
so l wouldn't fall over.

641
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,473
So yeah, l couldn't do the catwalk.

642
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,555
That's why l love tightrope walkers.

643
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,879
l should marry one
to make up for it.

644
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,278
Are there any in your country?

645
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,515
Ten million of them.

646
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,753
Like princesses.

647
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,197
They're so sensitive
they can feel the earth rotating.

648
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,636
That's why they're dizzy
all the time.

649
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,670
Didn't you know?.

650
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,031
They say they're so sensitive

651
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,276
they get sick
away from their kingdoms.

652
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,631
And they can even die of sadness.

653
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,115
All set.

654
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,628
Can l look?

655
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,675
Do you like it?

656
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,197
Do you think Manuel will like it?

657
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,313
He's no tightrope walker
but l like him a lot.

658
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,393
Maybe he's the one.

659
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,551
Can you imagine?
The man of my life.

660
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,078
l'd love to be
the woman of his life.

661
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,397
Even for just one day.

662
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,755
l want to ask you a favor, Zule.

663
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,634
lt's really important to me.

664
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,116
Smell.

665
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,549
Perfume.

666
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,194
lt was in the bathroom.

667
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,716
Adobe Premiere 5.1 .

668
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,633
lt just came out.

669
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,109
And an Office upgrade.

670
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,432
l thought it was music.

671
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,353
lt looks better on Zule.

672
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,316
She has bigger tits than me.

673
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,757
Guys like big tits, right?

674
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,951
Mine are pretty small.

675
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,115
They're normal.

676
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,269
Shall l get them done?

677
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,751
l'm saving up for implants.

678
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,392
How big do you like them?

679
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,069
Tell me.

680
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,039
l'll get the size you like.

681
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,151
The size of your hands.

682
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,391
So they'll fit nicely inside.

683
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,029
lt's yours.

684
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,669
Would you like dessert?

685
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,958
Tonight l'm your dessert.

686
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,074
What's your other name?

687
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,229
You said you had two.

688
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,633
l can't tell you.

689
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,519
Why not?

690
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,511
lt's my secret identity.

691
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,159
No one can know it.

692
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,679
Like Superman?

693
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,429
Something like that.

694
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,109
Are you a superhero?

695
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,474
A superheroine.

696
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,116
Which one?

697
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,992
lt's dangerous.
No one can know

698
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,316
because they could hurt us.

699
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,949
You too.

700
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,909
l'm protecting you.

701
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,269
Thank you.

702
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,555
lt's my job.

703
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,515
Do you change in phone booths,
like Superman?

704
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,268
Sometimes.

705
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,354
Do you have superpowers?

706
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,994
Can you fly?

707
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,509
Even better.

708
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,588
l can make you fly.

709
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,509
Manuel.

710
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,068
Would you pick me up?

711
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,835
Where?

712
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,599
After work.

713
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,989
Of course. Where?

714
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,668
Anywhere. Doesn't matter.
Would you?

715
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,796
Of course. What's wrong?

716
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,553
Nothing. Not anymore.

717
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,108
Don't wait for me.

718
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,034
What are you doing?

719
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,074
ls that guy paying you well?

720
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,315
Hey, l'm with someone.

721
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,114
Come party with us.
l'll pay you well.

722
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,714
Let go of me!

723
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,433
You got the wrong person.

724
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,631
100 euros to suck me off.

725
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,995
No, please, no.

726
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,315
Just a blowjob.

727
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,714
Not tonight, please.

728
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,397
Not tonight.

729
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,593
Then jerk me off.

730
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,916
Please.

731
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,277
Use your hand, like that.
l'll come real fast. l swear.

732
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,712
120. 120. Here.

733
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,075
-Not tonight, please.
-200 and l'll come real fast.

734
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,029
-No, please.
-l'll come real fast, l swear.

735
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,232
Come on, use your hand.
Use your hand, that's it.

736
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,429
Use your hand.

737
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,429
Like that. Squeeze it.

738
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,155
Suck my dick.

739
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,679
That's it.

740
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,273
l know everything.

741
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,159
You didn't go to the bathroom.

742
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,798
You went to save the world.

743
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,152
To stop a train from derailing.

744
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,831
You went, saved everyone,
and came back.

745
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,756
Am l right?

746
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,228
Are you okay?

747
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,238
Get the check, please.

748
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,435
l'm on my way out.

749
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,474
No hurry.

750
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,513
Stay there.

751
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,395
Excuse me.

752
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,918
My wife wants me to ask you
to please change the sheets

753
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,439
after sleeping in them.

754
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,115
Why doesn't she do it?

755
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,952
Because she's not the one who's
screwing 10 men a day in them.

756
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,036
She also told me to ask you
to leave the house before 8.

757
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,711
So that our son won't see you.

758
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,678
My darling.

759
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,074
Star without a candle.

760
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,600
Blood of my wounds.

761
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,073
Don't make me suffer anymore.

762
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,193
My darling.

763
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,953
A stray bullet

764
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,274
on Main Street.

765
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,150
Puddle in the slums.

766
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,759
i don't want you to go.

767
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,079
i don't want you to go away.

768
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,474
More and more each day.

769
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,479
My darling.

770
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,909
Star without a candle.

771
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,753
My darling.

772
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,279
Little puddle of cloudy water.

773
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,635
Soap bubble.

774
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,035
My last refuge.

775
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,588
My last hope.

776
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,189
Whore!

777
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,549
Fuck you!

778
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,836
My darling.

779
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,193
Little puddle of cloudy water.

780
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,276
Soap bubble.

781
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,040
My last refuge.

782
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,235
My last hope.

783
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,190
i don't want you to go.

784
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,708
More and more each day.

785
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,799
My darling.

786
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,428
You want some?

787
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,952
Something good from the Caribbean?

788
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,032
l'll give you 20.

789
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,629
No, 30. Come on.

790
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,190
Asshole!

791
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,960
Hey, guys. Looking for company?

792
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,475
Hello?

793
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,435
Good.

794
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,114
No, l can't.

795
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,875
Because l can't.

796
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,868
l don't believe you.

797
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,513
Because l don't.

798
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The guy's a piece of shit.
He doesn't have

799
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,300
any papers for you.
He just wants to fuck you,

800
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,400
period.

801
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,500
He's taking them to the Cuesta.

802
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,300
Today?

803
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,900
At nine.

804
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,100
And you're going?

805
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,500
You said you'd go?

806
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,800
l don't know what to do.

807
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,600
He says they're valid
for 6 months.

808
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,100
Yeah, and he'll get you
an apartment.

809
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,600
He'll say anything.

810
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,000
Whatever you want to hear.

811
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,900
The guy's a pig.
He's out there fishing.

812
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,500
He's got ten others like you

813
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,400
who'll lose their shit for papers.

814
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,800
Yeah, l'll lose my shit.

815
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,300
You can't imagine what 6 months
would mean to me.

816
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,700
Don't go, all l'm saying
is don't go.

817
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,500
l'm the one getting
beaten, remember?

818
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,800
You can't let him beat you up
and then run back

819
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,300
for more when he calls.

820
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,700
What l can't do is stop going
out in the street.

821
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,000
Or go to see my son because
if l leave l can't get back in.

822
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,200
Your son needs a mother without
papers more than a dead one.

823
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,700
Don't tell me what my son needs.

824
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,300
You have no idea.

825
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,900
Zule!

826
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,800
No, how can you think that, Mom?

827
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,800
Everything's fine.

828
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,100
lt's just that l thought about you.

829
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,200
Did you get the money l sent?

830
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,800
Did you get the money?

831
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,700
How's little Edward eating?

832
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,800
ls he eating well?

833
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,600
Don't give him sweets, Mom.

834
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,600
Anyway, Mom. You too, take care.

835
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,800
i'll call again soon.

836
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,000
Talk to you soon.

837
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,300
Bye.

838
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,800
How are you?

839
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,300
Water.

840
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,900
Another one.

841
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,600
Can l see them?

842
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,800
They've given me a lot of trouble.
You have no idea.

843
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,300
l needed a duplicate
with a signature...

844
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,800
And my friend in the registry,

845
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,200
he's not here.

846
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,200
He took a few days off.

847
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Can l see them?

848
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,800
Did anyone see you?

849
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,400
Are you meeting anyone later?

850
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,700
l want to see my papers.

851
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,900
They're not yours.
Remember that.

852
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,300
Show them to me.

853
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,100
Not here.

854
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,000
Someone can see me.

855
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,900
Let's go to my place. We have time.
When are you going out?

856
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,100
Show them to me
and l'll go with you.

857
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,200
Hello?

858
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,800
Okay.

859
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,400
Yes.

860
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,600
Where?

861
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,300
Okay.

862
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,200
Okay.

863
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,800
Let's go.

864
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,600
Where?

865
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,800
l'll tell you outside.

866
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,100
Do you want your papers?

867
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,300
How do l know
you're telling the truth?

868
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,400
You have no other choice.

869
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,300
-Come on.
-Let go of me.

870
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,000
Walk ahead of me.

871
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,900
l'll tell you what to do.

872
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,200
Let go.

873
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,000
Take it easy!

874
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,700
l said let go!

875
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,000
Sorry l'm late.

876
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,200
Hi.

877
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,300
Did he bring them?

878
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,800
Who are you?

879
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,300
Caye, nice to meet you.

880
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,600
And you are?

881
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,900
He says at his place.

882
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,500
Great. Let's go.
Where do you live?

883
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,600
Just you. That's the deal.

884
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,700
Well?

885
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,100
l'll go up. She can wait downstairs.

886
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,000
ln the street?

887
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,000
Just you.

888
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,800
l'll go up alone
and you get half an hour.

889
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,100
-Half an hour in the street?
-An hour!

890
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,600
Well?

891
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,700
Well?

892
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,300
Hey!

893
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,600
Son of a bitch.

894
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,700
The jerk treats me
like l stink or something.

895
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,200
lf you'd left with him,
anything could've happened.

896
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,700
But l'm left wondering.

897
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,400
Wondering what?

898
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,000
The usual.

899
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,700
Whether he had them or not.

900
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,400
lt's unhygienic.

901
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,900
Whatever they say.
And it damages your hair.

902
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,200
And you don't do them.

903
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,300
l know how.
l don't on principle.

904
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,200
l didn't say you don't know how,
l said you don't do them.

905
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,600
On principle.

906
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,300
The hairdresser's principle?

907
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,800
Hairdressers have principles?

908
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,400
Like you and everyone else.

909
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,300
You don't screw without a condom,
l don't do braids.

910
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,200
l don't out of common sense,
not principles.

911
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,400
Very bad. You should
do it out of principle.

912
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,100
What's the difference?

913
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,400
lt's not the same.

914
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,600
You can not do something
for many reasons.

915
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,000
There's a big difference.

916
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,600
You look black. Who did these?

917
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,600
You're a traitor, Caye.

918
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,700
They're comfortable.

919
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,300
And l get twice as much work.

920
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,000
They don't look good on you.
l have to tell you that.

921
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,400
She has to tell you
that on principle.

922
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,300
Right. On principle.

923
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Because it's my job.

924
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,300
You think principles
come free with condoms.

925
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,100
But either you have them or not.

926
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,600
Not like tits which you can get
if you don't have them.

927
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,200
l'm gonna charge
for touching my hair.

928
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,800
Let's give them a fright.

929
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,200
What are you doing?

930
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,100
lt's my job. They're taking it away.

931
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,500
ls this the police?

932
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,700
Some black girls are fighting.

933
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,600
Providencia Street. ln the square.

934
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,000
Africans. Look like whores to me.

935
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,900
She's faking it.

936
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,100
No, she's really calling.

937
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,600
A neighbor.

938
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,000
Three minutes. Thanks.

939
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,300
Thanks.

940
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,300
How can you be like that?

941
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,000
What about them?
l'm defending what's mine.

942
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,700
Hi, girls.

943
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,000
Can l use your bathroom?

944
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,200
lt's still broken.

945
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,600
Just for a minute.

946
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,600
lt's broken.

947
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,000
Fuck, Gloria, l won't mess it up!

948
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,600
Come to my place, if you want.
l'm heading that way.

949
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Cool!

950
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,800
See you later.

951
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,900
To the right, Blanca.

952
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,800
30, my love.

953
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,700
ln a hotel, 30.

954
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,500
Of course.

955
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,100
No, my love, 30.

956
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,500
You won't forget it.

957
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,300
You'll want to be my boyfriend.

958
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,600
Tell me, my love.

959
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,800
Okay.

960
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Okay.

961
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,700
Okay, ciao, my love.

962
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,300
Who's Zulema?

963
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,900
Are you Zulema?

964
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,000
Caye says come right away.
lt's really important.

965
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,600
Come straight over.

966
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,200
She's on the corner.

967
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,000
ls something wrong?

968
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,800
That's all she told me to say.

969
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,500
What?

970
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,900
What's up?

971
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,500
What's up with you?

972
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,100
What's up with your friend?

973
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,500
l saw you talking to him.

974
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,000
l wanted to know if you were okay.

975
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,300
Are you okay?

976
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,300
Like always.

977
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,000
Come to my place?

978
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,500
We're going to her bathroom.
Gloria's is broken.

979
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,300
Lucky you weren't there.

980
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,300
Fuck, you're right.

981
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,600
lf it wasn't for Caye,
they'd have busted you.

982
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,700
You knew, didn't you?

983
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,600
You knew and sent her.

984
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,300
Who?

985
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,700
They're the ones who called.

986
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,400
lt was Angela. She's not working.

987
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,500
She says it's because of you.

988
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,900
The bitches!

989
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,000
She wouldn't listen to me.

990
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,800
That's the way things are.

991
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,300
Maybe for you, not for me.

992
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,500
Try to understand.
Before she had a lot of work.

993
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,200
Why did you warn me then?

994
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,900
Don't l take away her work?

995
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,300
You're my friend.

996
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,700
So why didn't you come yourself?

997
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,900
You save her and she complains!

998
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,600
Unbelievable!

999
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,300
They should have taken her too.

1000
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,700
And fucked her up.

1001
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,700
Do you have Chanel?

1002
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:01,600
Perfume?

1003
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,300
Can l try it?

1004
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:04,900
Thank you.

1005
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,700
Smells great.

1006
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,900
lt's number 5, right?

1007
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,600
Can l try a little more?

1008
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,900
You weren't here last month,
were you? A little more.

1009
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,200
Thank you.

1010
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,000
Can l see the bottle?

1011
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,700
They make them so pretty now.

1012
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,400
if life gives you

1013
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,300
more than five reasons to go on.

1014
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,300
if life gives you

1015
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,200
more than five corners to sleep in.

1016
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,900
if life gives you

1017
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,000
more than five million to die...

1018
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,300
You strain yourself.

1019
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
Night and day.

1020
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,100
You strain yourself.

1021
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,400
Night and day.

1022
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,400
if life gives you

1023
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,800
more than five bastards
to put up with.

1024
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,400
if life gives you

1025
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,600
more than five lessons
to not go on...

1026
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,600
You strain yourself.

1027
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,900
Night and day.

1028
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,500
You strain yourself.

1029
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,800
Night and day.

1030
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,100
if life gives you

1031
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,500
more than five minutes
of pleasure.

1032
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,300
if life gives you

1033
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,300
more than five minutes
to forget.

1034
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,500
You strain yourself.

1035
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,800
Night and day.

1036
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,300
You strain yourself.

1037
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,600
Night and day.

1038
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,300
You strain yourself.

1039
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,100
You strain yourself.

1040
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,100
Papi?

1041
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,100
Don't be shy, papito.

1042
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:10,700
Papi?

1043
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,200
No, please.

1044
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,700
Take it easy.

1045
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,200
Take it easy.

1046
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,200
Please.

1047
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,500
Where are you going?

1048
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,300
Stay.

1049
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,900
lf l see you around here again,
l'll call the police.

1050
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,300
Yes?

1051
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,000
How many are you?

1052
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,100
Two?

1053
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,200
Together, 100.

1054
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,800
100. 50 per head.

1055
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:50,900
50.

1056
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,100
Where are you?

1057
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,200
Caye!

1058
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,400
You work around here?

1059
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,600
Across the street.

1060
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,900
Caye...

1061
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,500
Friends of mine from work.

1062
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:58,700
Hi.

1063
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,200
Hello.

1064
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,600
How are you?

1065
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,000
Fine.

1066
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,700
Like always.

1067
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,800
l'm meeting someone.

1068
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,700
Here?

1069
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,600
A friend.

1070
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,600
Manuel.

1071
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,800
l'll be right back.

1072
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,100
He's the one
that gives me the software.

1073
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,400
What about you?

1074
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,700
Me?

1075
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,300
They have liqueurs inside,
they're my favorites.

1076
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,400
That means he knows you well.

1077
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,200
l prefer flowers,
they're less fattening.

1078
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,900
Have one, Caye.

1079
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,800
The red ones are delicious.

1080
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,500
Next week we have to go see Dad.

1081
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,700
Well, Mom?

1082
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,800
l don't know if l'm going.

1083
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,400
Why?

1084
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,600
lt's inconvenient.

1085
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,600
Anyway, he won't know.

1086
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,300
But we go every year.

1087
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,400
That's another reason. lf l don't
go this time it doesn't matter.

1088
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,700
And l don't want to talk about it.

1089
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,000
But we have to talk about it

1090
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,900
and decide how to do it.

1091
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,700
And we have to take flowers.

1092
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,700
Anyone know a florist?

1093
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,300
Mom?

1094
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,800
You could get them.

1095
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,900
Maybe they'll give you a discount.

1096
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,900
l don't understand you.

1097
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,700
Obviously you don't.

1098
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,500
l don't understand you either.

1099
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,700
There's a day, you'll see.

1100
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,700
One awesome day.

1101
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,600
On that day
everything is good.

1102
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,100
You see the people
you want to see,

1103
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,200
eat your favorite food,

1104
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,600
and everything that happens
is what you want to happen.

1105
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,800
if you turn on the radio,
your favorite song is playing.

1106
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,000
if you go on a TVgame show,

1107
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,700
you win everything.

1108
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,600
Money, trips... everything.

1109
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,200
Mark my words...

1110
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:31,900
everything.

1111
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,400
it happens once in a lifetime,
so you have to be ready.

1112
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,100
Or you'll miss it.

1113
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,000
it's like a detour.

1114
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,500
Like when you're on a road
and come to a detour

1115
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,600
but you're talking on your cell

1116
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,200
or arguing or thinking
about something

1117
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,100
and don't realize
and you miss it

1118
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,800
and you're screwed
because you can't turn back.

1119
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,000
Well, that day is the same thing.:

1120
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,200
a detour.

1121
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,500
And you can choose how things
will be from that day on.

1122
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,000
Either you take the new route,
or you don't.

1123
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,000
That's why we have
to be ready, Zule.

1124
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,200
There are too few
good things in life.

1125
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,800
And if you miss them because you're
thinking about something else,

1126
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,000
that would suck.

1127
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,800
That would really suck.

1128
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,600
They call me Caye,
walking the street.

1129
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,000
The mischievous, the oh-so-lost.

1130
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,800
They call me street.
Street by night, street by day.

1131
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:57,900
They call me street,
today so tired, today so empty.

1132
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,000
Like a little machine
walking the big city.

1133
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,700
They call me street,
i get in your car,

1134
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,000
they call me street
ofjoy and sorrow,

1135
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:09,800
aching street, tired street
from so much loving.

1136
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,500
i go down the street, up the street,

1137
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:16,000
i won't come down,
not even for life.

1138
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,600
They call me street
and i'm proud of it.

1139
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
i know my day will come.

1140
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,600
Luck will find me some day.

1141
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,000
One day he'll be there
to pick me up,

1142
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,300
after work, that good man,

1143
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,800
my lifelong love
who won't need to pay.

1144
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,300
My heart's not for rent.

1145
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,300
They call me street.

1146
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,500
They call me street.

1147
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,100
Suffering Street,
Sad Street from so much loving.

1148
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,000
They call me street.

1149
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,600
Street and street.

1150
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,000
Are you going to charge yours?

1151
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,000
Tonight we're not whores.

1152
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,000
Tonight we're princesses.

1153
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,100
EXOTlC AFRlCAN BRAlDS

1154
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,700
You must teach us
how to walk like you.

1155
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,900
Maybe then we'll get more work.

1156
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,900
There are ways...

1157
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,200
But you have to start
when you're young.

1158
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,100
Was it scary on the raft?

1159
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,800
You don't have to use
sign language, Caren.

1160
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,200
And people come
from America by plane.

1161
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,500
l flew into Holland.

1162
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,600
From there l came down here.

1163
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,800
Rosa, you can help her out.

1164
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,100
With her papers. You have contacts.

1165
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,000
Rosa has screwed ministers.

1166
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,200
And gone to parties
and seen all kinds of things.

1167
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,700
Why don't you call someone?

1168
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,000
lt's not the way things are done.

1169
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,400
And it's a load of bull.

1170
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,000
Tell us one name.

1171
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,000
Just one name that we can believe.

1172
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,800
l can't.

1173
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,200
Because you're lying.

1174
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,800
l can't.
l signed a contract.

1175
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:31,900
Really?

1176
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,200
A non-disclosure form.

1177
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,700
They made you sign?

1178
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,400
And they always frisk me before,
just in case.

1179
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,700
He's that important?

1180
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,500
One day l'll bring it
and you'll be sorry.

1181
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,300
The phantom menace.

1182
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,300
She's said it so many times.

1183
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,300
Know what their problem is?

1184
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,100
They haven't traveled like us.

1185
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,300
What do you expect?

1186
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,300
Where are you from?

1187
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,900
The Dominican Republic.
Boca Chica.

1188
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,900
l'll see what l can do.

1189
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,500
While you're at it, can you check
my business license too?

1190
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,700
Somebody wants you, Zule.

1191
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,500
Can you take over?

1192
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,100
l'll give it a try.

1193
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:23,800
She's all right.

1194
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,900
You don't come from
Santo Domingo on a raft, Caren.

1195
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,300
lt's in America.

1196
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,300
l know.

1197
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,900
l got nervous.

1198
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,300
What's that?

1199
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,200
lt belongs to my friends.

1200
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Are you here alone?

1201
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,300
l'm with you.

1202
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:05,800
You like it?

1203
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,000
Very much.

1204
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,900
lt's sancocho.

1205
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,600
We cook it for our boyfriends
as a sign of commitment.

1206
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,700
l'm kidding.

1207
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,900
Why do you work in the van?

1208
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,200
lt's not work. l'm a volunteer.

1209
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,600
l'm still a student.

1210
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,200
Then why do you do it?

1211
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,000
l like it.

1212
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,700
l like you girls.

1213
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,600
Well, some more than others.

1214
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,400
A volunteer...

1215
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,800
How lucky.

1216
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,900
Just when l needed one.

1217
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,600
Turned out tasty.

1218
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,100
We have to leave at 8, volunteer.
l can't explain.

1219
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,200
Gently.

1220
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,900
Gently, papa, please.

1221
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,100
What's wrong?

1222
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,000
lt's difficult for me.

1223
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,000
Vallejo, Zulema?

1224
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,200
Yes?

1225
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,100
When they come out, you can go in.

1226
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,300
l went for some tests.

1227
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,000
What kind?

1228
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,800
Everything.

1229
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,900
How's Manuel?

1230
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,800
The same.

1231
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,900
Sometimes l get carried away.

1232
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,600
We're taking a little time off.

1233
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,700
And your volunteer?

1234
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,000
Just as bad.

1235
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:56,800
Did you know that the sea here
is very important?

1236
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,900
There's no sea here.

1237
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:00,700
Exactly.

1238
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,000
That's why everyone
thinks so much about it.

1239
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,200
Things are not important
because they exist,

1240
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,500
but because people
think about them.

1241
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,300
Like your son.

1242
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,700
He's not here but you think
about him every day, don't you?

1243
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,200
That's why he exists.

1244
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,300
Because you think about him.

1245
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,100
That's what my mother says.

1246
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,100
We exist because someone thinks
about us, not vice versa.

1247
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,300
She says someone said it,

1248
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,200
but l think she made it up.

1249
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,200
She makes everything up,
when it's convenient.

1250
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,100
Actually, l...

1251
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,500
l don't believe in God much,

1252
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,300
and l'm not religious or anything.

1253
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,300
My mother is,

1254
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,300
but l'm not.

1255
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,500
The only thing is...

1256
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,400
l've been thinking, you know...

1257
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,900
And l think that...

1258
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,600
Well, the worst thing isn't...

1259
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,600
wouldn't be if there was
nothing after death.

1260
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,900
The worst thing would be
if there was another life.

1261
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,800
Another life like this one.

1262
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,500
Zulema Vallejo.

1263
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,900
Go through. The doctor
will be with you shortly.

1264
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,500
Where are my results?

1265
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,400
They'll bring them now.

1266
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,200
Make sure she looks great.

1267
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,300
She has to knock them
off their feet when they see her.

1268
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,600
Are you glad about leaving?

1269
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,000
l'd like to leave too.

1270
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,800
And open an eating house.

1271
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,200
Yeah, a cock-eating house.

1272
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,000
Hey, l'd be great at it.

1273
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,100
And Mamen would come with me.
Wouldn't you, Mamen?

1274
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,600
What's this?

1275
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,900
l can't believe it.

1276
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,900
lt's too much!

1277
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:39,100
What a bitch!

1278
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,500
Unbelievable! lncredible!

1279
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,700
How fancy!

1280
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:44,600
l knew it!

1281
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,400
How cool!

1282
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,500
Well, l never!

1283
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,600
How fancy!

1284
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,200
Where did that car come from?

1285
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,400
lt's for me while l'm waiting,
to take me shopping.

1286
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Cool!

1287
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,700
Want to go for a ride?

1288
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,500
There's no room for me.

1289
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,100
This is great!

1290
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,900
The ladies are my friends, Joaquin.

1291
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,600
Did she screw him here, Joaquin?

1292
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,400
Some oil tycoon gave the Princess
of Monaco a car like this.

1293
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,100
l heard it on the radio.

1294
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,600
Put down the windows
so they can see us.

1295
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,000
Where to, madam?

1296
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,500
Let's go to the park
so the girls can see us.

1297
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,300
Neli, go to the park. You'll flip.

1298
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,800
l'm with Joaquin,

1299
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,500
a friend of mine.

1300
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:00,100
Go to Alameda
and we'll pick you up.

1301
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,400
Mom, look out the window.

1302
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,600
Secret documents!

1303
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,800
Wow!

1304
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:06,700
Angela, put that down.

1305
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,800
lt's top secret.

1306
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,400
We won't wrinkle them.

1307
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,600
Caren, stop it.

1308
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:13,500
''Confidential''!

1309
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,800
Put it down.

1310
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,400
Joaquin, who is Rosa seeing
and won't tell us about?

1311
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,500
l have to be with my son.

1312
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,900
After that, l don't know.

1313
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,100
l might come back someday.

1314
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,100
lt's normal.

1315
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:05,300
That's your kingdom, Zule.

1316
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,000
Princesses can't live away
from their kingdoms.

1317
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:12,100
They're so sensitive
they die of nostalgia.

1318
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,200
l told you once, remember?

1319
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,500
lt happens to me sometimes.

1320
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,800
l miss things
that haven't happened yet.

1321
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,100
lt's yours.

1322
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,100
So l'm giving it to you.

1323
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,200
lt's for your operation.

1324
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,000
lt scares me.

1325
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,400
Besides, Manuel's right.

1326
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:44,400
l'm weird.
l'd probably self-reject.

1327
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,900
And if you self-reject,
the sooner the better, right?

1328
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,400
Remember me, okay?

1329
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,800
We exist because someone thinks
about us, not vice versa.

1330
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,300
Never forget that.

1331
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,000
Of course, baby.

1332
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,000
We'll see each other really soon.

1333
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,700
Really soon.

1334
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,400
l'm bringing you a present.

1335
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,400
A present.

1336
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,900
l can't tell you.

1337
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:32,500
lt's a surprise.

1338
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,000
Don't wait around, okay?

1339
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:51,800
Okay.

1340
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,600
Maybe today's the day.

1341
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,400
The day of the detour, remember?

1342
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,700
The one you said
we have to be ready for.

1343
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:17,700
Maybe it's today.

1344
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,500
My friend. She's leaving
because she wants to.

1345
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,000
Excuse me?

1346
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,600
She's leaving.

1347
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,400
No one's kicking her out.
She wants to be with her son.

1348
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,500
Great.

1349
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,500
That's all.

1350
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,200
if life gives you

1351
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,300
more than five reasons to go on.

1352
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,400
if life gives you

1353
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,400
more than five corners to sleep in.

1354
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,000
if life gives you

1355
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,900
more than five million to die...

1356
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:39,300
You strain yourself.

1357
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,500
Night and day.

1358
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,500
The check, Jose.

1359
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,100
How are you?

1360
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,100
Great.

1361
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:48,900
l met a boy, you know?.

1362
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,800
We're seeing each other.

1363
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,200
Good for you.
Where did you find him?

1364
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,900
At the methadone clinic.

1365
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,500
He's great.

1366
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,500
He holds my hand and everything.

1367
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,800
And calls me ''sweetheart.''

1368
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,900
The first day l almost
slugged him, but now,

1369
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,400
l'm used to it.

1370
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,400
You know what l'm sorry about?

1371
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,200
That l didn't meet him before,

1372
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,500
when l was whole.

1373
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,500
Because l was really hot.

1374
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,100
Really hot.

1375
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,400
Anyway.

1376
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,200
He missed it.

1377
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,700
Well...

1378
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,100
That's his fault.

1379
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,900
He should've showed up sooner.

1380
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:38,800
Cool.

1381
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,300
The jerk.

1382
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,100
He should've showed up sooner.

1383
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,100
l'll tell him that.

1384
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:46,700
Here.

1385
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,700
By the way,

1386
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:52,900
the bathroom looks great.

1387
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,400
Cool.

1388
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,100
About fucking time, Jose.

1389
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:58,300
lt's been broken for over a year.

1390
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,200
Maybe l'll buy one too.

1391
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,200
No one calls the other phone.

1392
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,600
That's not because
of the phone.

1393
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,200
Who knows?

1394
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,000
Being so expensive,

1395
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,700
more people might call.

1396
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:28,900
And they can call when l'm out.

1397
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:30,100
But you never go out.

1398
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:32,000
lt would get me out.

1399
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,800
To test it, see if anyone calls.

1400
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,900
Can you hear well with this one?

1401
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,300
They all sound the same.

1402
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,300
You haven't had
any flowers lately.

1403
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,800
He must be on vacation.

1404
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,300
How's Zulema?

1405
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,800
What?

1406
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,500
Zulema. How is she?

1407
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,200
She left.

1408
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,100
To her country?

1409
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,100
This morning.

1410
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,000
On vacation?

1411
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:32,200
She couldn't take it anymore.

1412
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:34,800
She couldn't.

1413
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:37,100
She was a whore...

1414
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,300
and she couldn't take it anymore.

1415
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,400
And she had some guy after her.

1416
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,500
Some asshole who had it in for her.

1417
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:54,000
So she left.

1418
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,500
She wanted to be with her family.

1419
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,500
How did you meet her?

1420
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,900
Once l took her to the hospital.

1421
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,700
The guy had beat her up.

1422
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,100
Until today.

1423
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:17,900
Until today.

1424
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,300
l don't want any more.

1425
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:57,000
Caye!

1426
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,500
Caye, your phone!

1427
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:07,900
Caye!

1428
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,600
You answer it, Mom!
