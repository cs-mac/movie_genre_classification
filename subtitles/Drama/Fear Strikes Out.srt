1
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:11,742
Hi, Dad.

2
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:12,944
Hello, Jim.

3
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,035
You're home early.

4
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,346
Yep.

5
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:17,373
Hey, I'm going to work
on that slide again.

6
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,546
Can you watch me?

7
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,199
Later. Go on.

8
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:25,514
Okay.

9
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:04,864
I told you that squirt of a foreman
was going to be trouble.

10
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:08,533
He talked to the wrong man
when he talked to me like that.

11
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,609
There are other jobs.

12
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:12,562
Hey, Dad, watch!

13
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:20,434
I'm the union steward.
The men expect me to speak up.

14
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:27,802
There'll be other jobs.

15
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:34,455
See the farther away
you take off

16
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,763
the sooner you get in there,
and then you hook it in.

17
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:38,366
Now you try it. Come on!

18
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,234
Zip up in there.
Come on now!

19
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:43,036
The sooner you take off,
the faster you get in there.

20
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:44,893
All right, now,

21
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,841
don't forget... as you come in,
you fall away from the bag.

22
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,790
Let's go.

23
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:50,268
Move!

24
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:54,438
Oh! Hey, that was pretty good.
You hooked in there nice.

25
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,804
But, you know, a low throw
would've nailed you.

26
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,816
Don't give me that look, now.
A low throw would've nailed you.

27
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:03,016
It wasn't bad, though.
Keep it up.

28
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,918
Yeah, you'll be able to do it...
just keep at it.

29
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,724
That old trouble again?

30
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:34,278
Yeah. Too much gabbing today,
I guess.

31
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:38,723
I'll fix a cup of tea.

32
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,226
I don't like the look of it.

33
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:45,622
I've been after you to get
a checkup, haven't I?

34
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:52,430
I don't want you
going away again.

35
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:03,649
Jimmy always looks so
serious when he plays.

36
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:05,935
He's a good boy;
he tries hard.

37
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,482
Too hard sometimes.

38
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,304
Nothing comes easy,
and you know it.

39
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,473
If we work hard enough he
could be a great ball player.

40
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,774
- Just like his dad.
- Nah.

41
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:23,832
- You were the best I ever saw.
- No, nothing like that.

42
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:26,343
Playing for a factory team?

43
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,856
Making a few dollars
on my spare time? Oh, no.

44
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:33,105
What I'm thinking about
is the big leagues.

45
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,007
Boston Red Sox.

46
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,631
That's where Jim's going.

47
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,455
Jim!

48
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:48,892
That's enough, of that, Jim.

49
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:53,915
Come on, let's toss a few.

50
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,835
Right in the old mitt.

51
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,369
Right in there, now, Jim.
Come on!

52
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:05,247
Come on, Jim, like a big leaguer

53
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,944
a big leaguer now.

54
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,237
Come on, let's go now!

55
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:36,180
Come on, Jim!
Let's go, let's go!

56
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:37,374
Hustle in there!

57
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:41,743
Right here, now,
right to me, Jim.

58
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,345
Come on, Jim, come on.

59
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:44,912
That's the one. That's it.

60
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,685
We'll show 'em, Jim.

61
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:51,389
That's it, come on, now...
right to me!

62
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,537
You're out!

63
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,655
Your kid played a great game.

64
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,020
What an arm!

65
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:44,579
What a bunch of bums.

66
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:47,578
Great throwing, Jimmy.

67
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:49,018
You saved the game for us.

68
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,578
If you're going to play,
Mr. Tracy

69
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,214
you might as well win, you know.

70
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:53,224
That's right.

71
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:54,225
Bernie!

72
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,692
That was a good game, boy.

73
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,194
Hey, Mr. Piersall,
your boy played

74
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:58,719
like a real pro
today, didn't he?

75
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,827
Now we made it, huh?

76
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:05,837
Yeah, you made it.

77
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:08,533
With luck you made it.

78
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:11,701
It's a good enough game
for high school, but, uh...

79
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:14,837
you weren't on your toes all
the time, and you know it.

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,074
Don't you think?

81
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,322
Jimmy, you got to think ahead.

82
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:26,915
You got to be
ahead of the play.

83
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,550
For instance,
in the fifth inning

84
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,652
when the ball got away
from your shortstop

85
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:32,663
why weren't you
backing him up in there?

86
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,329
You got to think ahead.

87
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:40,804
Come on, take your shower.

88
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,033
Don't catch cold.

89
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:51,601
Hey, Jimmy.

90
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:53,068
Hurry up, boy,
I'll give you a ride

91
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:54,229
over to the party.
Come on.

92
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,068
Oh, I got two gas pumps
waiting, you know.

93
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:57,937
Aw, come on,
this is a celebration.

94
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:58,999
Skip work for once.

95
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,634
I can't skip work for a party.

96
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:01,701
Oh, come on, huh?

97
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:36,436
We won.

98
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,447
Oh, that's wonderful.

99
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:38,914
I thought we were
going to lose it.

100
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:39,916
I really did.

101
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,917
I knew you would.

102
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,680
But the third and fourth
inning, I thought

103
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,050
we were going
to lose it, but...

104
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:46,055
Mrs. Piersall,
your son made a play

105
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,387
like a big leaguer today,
and don't think

106
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,052
they don't know it up there.

107
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,060
Where?

108
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:53,255
Boston.

109
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:56,592
What's that?

110
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,464
I didn't want to tell you
during the season.

111
00:09:58,502 --> 00:09:59,799
I was afraid you'd get nervous.

112
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,463
Tell me what?

113
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:03,496
The Boston Red Sox
are interested, Jim.

114
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,777
Tracy's heard from them.

115
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,018
The Red Sox are
sending down scouts

116
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:20,455
next year to see me?

117
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:25,955
Ma.

118
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:28,089
The Boston Red Sox are
sending down scouts

119
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:29,291
next year to see me.

120
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,096
What do you think
about that, huh?

121
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:33,125
You deserve it, Jimbo.

122
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,137
What do you think, Dad?

123
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:43,408
Well, we're on our way, Jim.

124
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:46,442
Big leagues...

125
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,711
big money.

126
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:50,811
Everything we've ever
dreamed about.

127
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:52,116
We're going up fast

128
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,622
no ten years
in the minors for us.

129
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:57,126
Hanging around
Louisville, Scranton.

130
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:59,787
No small towns,
none of that for us.

131
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,764
We'll give them one year

132
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:04,266
and then the Boston
Red Sox, right, Jim?

133
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,563
Right, Dad.

134
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:12,071
First we got
to be great next season

135
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,600
when the scouts come down.

136
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:18,274
You got to stay in shape,
keep healthy

137
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:21,443
then nothing can stop us.

138
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:22,918
Right, Jim?

139
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,749
Right.

140
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,781
Jimmy, you're going
to be late for work?

141
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,094
Yep.

142
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:33,096
Straight home
after work, son.

143
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:34,653
Oh, doesn't he always?

144
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:38,658
Can I have the letter?

145
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,967
Jim!

146
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,066
Jim!

147
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:49,636
Hey, Jim! Don't lose the letter!

148
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,011
And bring it home!

149
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:33,218
Hey, how about a little
service here, huh?

150
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:34,780
Get that heap out of here.

151
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:36,452
Gives the place a bad name.

152
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,757
How's the big leaguer?

153
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:40,786
Heard from the Red Sox again,
huh?

154
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,093
Yeah.

155
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:43,929
Great, Jimmy.
It's really wonderful.

156
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,197
They're coming all the way down
from Boston

157
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:47,260
huh, for the opener.

158
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:48,635
That's what Tracy says.

159
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:50,401
Well if he says it, it's fact.

160
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,032
How about celebrating, huh?

161
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,099
Oh...

162
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,541
Aw, come on, Jimmy, once, huh?

163
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:55,943
No, I should go straight home.

164
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:57,708
Come on, do a little
ice-skating, huh?

165
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:00,444
Oh, Bernie, I'm not supposed
to ice-skate, you know that.

166
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:01,746
Oh, come on, Jimmy, relax.

167
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,548
You should relax
once in a while.

168
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:05,179
No, I got...
I got to get home.

169
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:06,484
Come on, boy. Once, huh?

170
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:08,855
I'll have you home
before you know it.

171
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:10,757
Come on.

172
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:12,056
Ten minutes.

173
00:13:12,162 --> 00:13:13,390
Okay, ten minutes.

174
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,988
- Okay?
- Yeah.

175
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:17,397
Come on, hurry up,
then, ten minutes.

176
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,925
- Let's go, huh?
- Let me just lock up.

177
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:24,398
Maybe he had to work
overtime.

178
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:28,241
I tell you, there was no answer
at the gas station.

179
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:30,940
Why don't you call
some of his other friends?

180
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:33,313
I did... nobody's home.

181
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,410
Nobody's seen him.

182
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm going to call
the police.

183
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,715
John, for goodness sake,
he's an hour and a half late.

184
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,725
That's like 24 hours
with anybody else.

185
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,090
John, will you
be sensible?

186
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,287
Now, you know Jim...
he's never been late before.

187
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:48,058
I know.

188
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:52,030
The gas station.
It's the gas station.

189
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,730
I should never have let him take
that job at the gas station.

190
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:57,001
- John, will you stop it?
- Stop what?!

191
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,305
He's probably out with Bernie
and just forgot the time.

192
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:04,302
He knows how important it
is for him to get his sleep.

193
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:06,315
If he's not ready
when those scouts

194
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:09,045
come down from Boston...

195
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,551
Have you seen Jim?

196
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:16,183
Yes, sir.

197
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:18,217
Well, where is he?

198
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,229
He's downstairs
in the car, sir.

199
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:21,662
What happened?

200
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:24,861
We went skating,
sir, and...

201
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:26,459
Sorry, Mrs. Piersall.

202
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:44,987
Jimmy.

203
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,386
I'm all right, Mom.

204
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:09,344
Now, Pop, it's okay.

205
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:12,314
I'm... I'm going to play.

206
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,666
John!

207
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:38,035
Dad.

208
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,041
I'll be back the first thing
in the morning

209
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:51,178
and we'll have a cardiograph
down at the office.

210
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:53,519
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

211
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:08,750
Jimmy... Dad's going to be
all right.

212
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:12,250
Doctor says it wasn't really
a heart attack, just a warning.

213
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:15,993
He'll have to take it easy
for a while.

214
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,263
It was my fault.

215
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:21,203
Oh, Jimmy, it wasn't your fault.

216
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:23,069
Doctor says it could've happened

217
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,700
any time and for any reason.

218
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:32,038
Try and get some rest, son.

219
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:34,073
And don't worry.

220
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,215
Say, are there scouts
out there or not?

221
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,513
Yep.

222
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:11,180
Dad, no bending, you know
what the doc said, huh?

223
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,449
That was two months ago.

224
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,855
Well, you still
got to be careful.

225
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,054
I think you ought
to skip the game.

226
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:21,621
Are you going to play?

227
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,826
- Yes.
- Then I can watch it.

228
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:25,994
Okay, let's get out there
and play a little ball.

229
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,505
Jim... no sliding today.

230
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:38,810
Keep your weight off that ankle
as much as you can.

231
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,579
Come on, Jim!
Come on, boy!

232
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:43,483
Come on, Jim!
Come on, Jim!

233
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:48,791
Wait for a good one, baby!
Take it easy!

234
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:50,952
You're out of there!

235
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,374
All right, this is our
last inning, fellas.

236
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:08,969
Get a hit, kid.

237
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:10,274
Now, we're in trouble.

238
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:12,373
Those two strikeouts,
they don't like it.

239
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,542
I'm trying, Dad.

240
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,141
I know you're trying, I know.

241
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:17,551
But we've got to show
them that you can hit.

242
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,316
Now, you've got
to get your hit.

243
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,723
Come on.
Get your hit now.

244
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,634
Come on!

245
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:39,233
Come on!

246
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:41,039
Stee-rike!

247
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,739
Come on, stay in there...

248
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,805
Keep your eye
on the ball, Jim!

249
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,887
Go! Go!

250
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:57,757
Go!

251
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,325
No! Don't slide!

252
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:02,923
Safe!

253
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,602
Jim!

254
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:09,127
Jim, are you okay?

255
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:13,404
I told you, Dad, worry
about nothing, huh?

256
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,207
- This is Jim.
- Hello, Jim.

257
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:17,838
Sakulavich and Silvera. Scouts.

258
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,042
- Nice hit, kid.
- You made a nice slide there.

259
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,983
Keep your weight off the ankle.
Come on.

260
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,487
Sit down.

261
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:53,543
Well, good-bye, Dad.

262
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,811
Good-bye, Jim.

263
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,045
Now, Scranton's a good beginning

264
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:57,075
but it's only the beginning.

265
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,985
Remember, next year,
it's got to be the Boston...

266
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,182
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, wish me luck.

267
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:01,281
No, luck won't do it.

268
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:02,484
You're going to have to think.

269
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:04,721
You're going to have to work
hard and think for yourself.

270
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:06,092
Remember, no one's
going to be there

271
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,288
doing your thinking for you.

272
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,388
Board!

273
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:14,370
Good bye, Jim.

274
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:21,435
Dad!

275
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:23,503
Next year!

276
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:26,641
Next year the Red Sox!

277
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,015
Huh?!

278
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,846
Next year.

279
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,829
Where's that arm?

280
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,040
- Watch it, Jim!
- Hey, look out!

281
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:57,142
Hey, are you okay?

282
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:00,011
What are you trying to do,
ruin the customers?

283
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,540
Hmm?

284
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:04,076
Look at your skirt,
it's a mess.

285
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:06,247
Holy cow,
what do I do now, Sandy?

286
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:08,883
Tell her you're sorry.
Come on, I'll introduce you.

287
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:11,450
They're friends of mine.
Nurses at St. Vincent's.

288
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:14,089
Come on.

289
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,631
Girls...
this is Jimmy Piersall

290
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:18,634
- our latest misguided missile.
- Hello.

291
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,533
- This is Joan Kelly
- Hi.

292
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,664
Doris Fleming, Edna
McGuire, and, uh...

293
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:25,231
Oh, Mary Teevan.

294
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:26,242
Mary's new in town.

295
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:27,937
She just started
at the hospital.

296
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:29,502
You almost put her back
in there.

297
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,446
That's a nice way
to treat a stranger.

298
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:34,279
I'm-I'm very sorry,
Miss...

299
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,978
- That's all right.
- Uh, let me...

300
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:38,044
It doesn't really
make any difference.

301
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,112
No, that's terrible.

302
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,384
Let me get you another
mirror, all right?

303
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:43,016
Oh, no, really,
please, I'm so...

304
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,924
I guess I got in the way
or something.

305
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,690
Oh, you didn't...
get in the way.

306
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,992
Thank you.

307
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:50,431
Well, you know,
I shouldn't go running...

308
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:53,994
Hey, Piersall, get it! Piersall!

309
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:25,089
Well, I like the way
you play baseball.

310
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:28,797
Well, now if one of
us could only cook.

311
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:29,896
Cook, yeah.

312
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,532
Where are your friends?

313
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:34,703
Oh, they're busy.

314
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,408
Well, good-bye.

315
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,541
Oh. It was nice talking to you.

316
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:42,518
Good-bye.

317
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,016
That's all for today.

318
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:48,388
Okay, men, let's hit
the showers.

319
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,425
Jimmy.

320
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,123
Get out of that hotel room, man.

321
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:55,687
Get yourself a date.

322
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,229
Miss Teevan?

323
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,164
Miss Teevan?

324
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:25,574
Who is it?

325
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:27,674
- It's Jim Piersall.
- Who?

326
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:29,015
Uh, Jim Piersall.

327
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:31,577
You remember?
From the ball park?

328
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:34,112
Oh. Hi.

329
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:36,386
How are you?

330
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:40,886
Fine. How did you find out
where I lived?

331
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:42,091
I called the hospital

332
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:44,327
- and told them I'm your brother.
- What?

333
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,858
Called up the hospital and

334
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,870
- told them I was your brother.
- Oh.

335
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:50,702
Say, can I come in?

336
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:53,369
Well, I guess
it'll be all right.

337
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,144
Uh, I-I wanted to ask
you out to dinner

338
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:00,615
and then I figured maybe
if I brought dinner here,

339
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,674
you'd let me cook it.

340
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:02,946
- You brought what?
- Dinner.

341
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:03,975
Remember you said

342
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:06,080
- if one of us could only cook.
- Oh.

343
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:08,020
- Remember you said that?
- Yes.

344
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:10,219
Well, as it so happens,
I can cook.

345
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,227
Oh.

346
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:15,288
Well, I, I was going out.

347
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:18,095
Oh, you have a date.

348
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:20,399
Well, no. Not exactly.

349
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:21,870
Well, you don't have
to go out, then.

350
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:22,963
No.

351
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:24,735
Well, look, I've got
a perfectly good steak here

352
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:27,403
and asparagus and olives
and muffins

353
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:30,106
and ice cream and stuff
like that... what do you say?

354
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:32,113
I mean, I'm very
tired of eating out

355
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:35,514
at all these restaurants around
here all the time, aren't you?

356
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:37,520
And you won't have
to do anything.

357
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:40,284
I'll cook it all myself.
I'm a very good cook.

358
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:43,850
I'm practically a chef.

359
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:47,022
I need a couple of saucepans
and a double boiler

360
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:48,622
and Worcestershire sauce

361
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:50,132
and muffin tins and...

362
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:55,298
and, uh... well,
to light the oven to 450.

363
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,737
Oh, and the ice cream...

364
00:24:56,773 --> 00:24:59,173
maybe it should go
in the icebox right away.

365
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:10,777
It should go in there
right now.

366
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,812
Oh, yes, sir.

367
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:24,729
The trick is to do these
before you get comfortable.

368
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:26,633
All right.

369
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:30,639
Here, come on,
you got to wear this.

370
00:25:41,284 --> 00:25:43,684
How long do you expect
to be in Scranton?

371
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,244
Just one year.

372
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:46,915
Then Boston if
I'm good enough.

373
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:48,447
You'll be good enough.

374
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:49,925
You think so?

375
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,121
Well, sure.

376
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:54,823
You know, you can't just stand
there and watch

377
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:56,355
while I do dishes.

378
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,766
Okay. Let's go.

379
00:26:07,077 --> 00:26:08,066
Come on!

380
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:09,510
Get over there!

381
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:11,514
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!

382
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:12,879
Hurry! Hurry!

383
00:26:15,485 --> 00:26:16,747
Come on!

384
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:20,714
Okay, Piersall, that's all.

385
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:21,917
That's all?

386
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:31,534
Jimmy?

387
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:32,626
What's the matter?

388
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:34,432
Well, you saw me at the plate.

389
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,336
Well, you hit almost every one.

390
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,102
With no power, with nothing.

391
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:39,403
Aw, Jimmy, now

392
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:42,639
are you or are you not the third
leading batter in the league?

393
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:43,941
What league?
What league?!

394
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,471
I've got to get out of the
minors this year, Mary.

395
00:26:46,516 --> 00:26:47,847
This year.
No more of this.

396
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:49,511
Well, I know it,
but my goodness

397
00:26:49,553 --> 00:26:51,578
you have an off day,
you'll get over it.

398
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:53,418
It's a double hitter tomorrow.
Pop's coming down.

399
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:55,754
It's the first time he's ever
seen me play professional ball.

400
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,453
Listen, I'm in trouble,
I'm in real trouble!

401
00:26:57,494 --> 00:26:59,621
Jimmy, your father
knows baseball.

402
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,494
He knows how these things are.

403
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,261
He knows what it takes
to make the big leagues

404
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:05,563
and so do these guys.

405
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:07,729
Every week a fat report
goes up to Boston

406
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:09,033
how I'm running up bases

407
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:10,903
how I'm feeling,
how I'm hitting...

408
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:13,273
There's only 15
games left, Mary.

409
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,574
I've got to make
a showing or...

410
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:16,943
- Jim!
- Don't...

411
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:20,045
Hi, Dad!

412
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,573
Hey, everything under control?

413
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:22,585
Sure. How are you?

414
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:23,950
Fine. You look all right.

415
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:24,954
You look good.

416
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:26,751
Yeah, I feel good.

417
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,758
Well, I'm having
a great year, Dad.

418
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,760
Yes, you are.

419
00:27:30,794 --> 00:27:32,284
There's 15 games to go

420
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:34,763
and I'm batting third
in the league.

421
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:37,460
Well, that isn't first.

422
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,098
Mary...

423
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:45,697
I'd like you to meet my dad.

424
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:56,511
Give me that beautiful cup.

425
00:27:56,553 --> 00:27:59,113
Oh, look at that baby.
Oh, baby, I love it.

426
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:00,211
I love it.

427
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,058
Jim, Jim, look,
you got a telegram.

428
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:09,428
Wow, look at that.

429
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:11,434
Come on, what do you say?

430
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:36,982
What's the matter, Jimmy?

431
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:04,132
What's wrong, Jim?

432
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:10,968
I wish I didn't have
to go home tomorrow.

433
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:21,115
I-I-I wish we had more
time to think things out.

434
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:23,147
There's time.

435
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,002
Listen, you...

436
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,807
you don't want to be tied down
to a ballplayer all your life

437
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:46,940
living in trains and hotels;
no, you don't.

438
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:48,609
It doesn't make any difference.

439
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,244
There's no security
in it and-and...

440
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:53,777
one bad year
and I'd be out of it.

441
00:29:53,822 --> 00:29:56,985
You'd do something
else for a while.

442
00:29:58,994 --> 00:30:01,690
Well, there's a great career
waiting for me

443
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,528
loading freight cars
for the international...

444
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:06,295
but I... I can't
do anything.

445
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:08,632
I don't know how
to do anything else.

446
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,161
You're going to make
the Red Sox.

447
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:15,040
Mary, you don't understand,
the competition is terrific.

448
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:17,705
You're terrific.

449
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:20,044
I've got my folks
to support.

450
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:22,380
If I got married, I'd
have to live with them.

451
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,942
That would mean four people
living in that house.

452
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:26,851
It wasn't even
big enough for three.

453
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:31,792
It's not possible.

454
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:34,694
It's impossible.

455
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:04,954
I have to go in now.

456
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:17,528
Mary.

457
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:30,181
I don't care what happens,
I love you, Mary.

458
00:31:30,218 --> 00:31:32,948
- Oh, Jimmy, I love you!
- You know I love you.

459
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:39,890
Let's get married.

460
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:42,556
Let's go back to Waterbury
and get married, okay?

461
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:43,564
Okay?

462
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:44,895
- Yes.
- Right now.

463
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:48,391
But I-I can't just walk
out on my job here.

464
00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:50,734
Why not? You talk
to them, you can do it.

465
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:51,898
Just talk to them.

466
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,908
All right, I'll, I'll ask
the head nurse tonight.

467
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:55,603
- I'll wait.
- Oh, no, it may take a while.

468
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:56,770
I'll call you.

469
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:58,336
No, I'll wait right here.
You go ahead.

470
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,177
Well, maybe you'd better
go back to the hotel

471
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:01,182
and I'll call you there.

472
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:02,774
- You promise?
- Yes.

473
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:07,477
Oh!

474
00:32:08,657 --> 00:32:10,318
Hey, Jimmy! Come on,
the old ball game.

475
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:11,882
Just what we need,
a center fielder.

476
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:13,451
No, no, no, I got...
Come on, Jimmy.

477
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:15,087
- No, I got to get upstairs.
- Come on.

478
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,563
I got a phone call coming,
please.

479
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:18,566
- Phone call.
- Come on, Jimmy, come on, Jimmy.

480
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,090
Play a little ball, will you?

481
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:21,432
Foul ball!

482
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:55,702
The weatherman says tomorrow
will be fair and slightly warmer

483
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,295
with probable evening showers.

484
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:59,830
We now bring you
Hal Morrison's sports review.

485
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,137
Good evening, fans.

486
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:03,440
With no ball game scheduled
today in the majors

487
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:06,276
the rival manager spent the time
juggling their lineups

488
00:33:06,314 --> 00:33:07,713
for the crucial games ahead.

489
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:10,377
Locally, the whole town is
talking about Jim Piersall

490
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:11,749
a flashy, young outfielder

491
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:13,845
of our pennant-winning
Scranton Club.

492
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:16,084
Bug-eyed Piersall fans
are boosting him

493
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,921
as a hot major-league prospect.

494
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:21,326
Some are even comparing him
to the immortals of yesteryear.

495
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:23,729
Now let's get a few things
straight, folks

496
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:25,096
in all this hullabaloo.

497
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,465
Young Piersall has had
just one simple...

498
00:33:27,502 --> 00:33:28,799
Hey, uh...

499
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:31,362
Scranton is a long, long way
from Fenway Park...

500
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:33,340
Will you turn that down
in there, please!

501
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,344
More than one rookie has flashed
like a comet in the minors.

502
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:40,178
Uh... your radio's on
awfully loud!

503
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:42,809
Will Jim Piersall
make the Red Sox?

504
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:44,182
Uh, turn it down!

505
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:46,152
Has he the wrist power,
the stamina...

506
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:49,953
Your radio's on a little bit
loud in there, you know!

507
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:51,185
Here's my prediction...

508
00:33:51,226 --> 00:33:52,784
Turn it off, will you please?

509
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:55,387
...will not be wearing
the major-league uniform.

510
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,397
Turn it...

511
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:57,591
Turn it off!

512
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,842
Hello?

513
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:19,410
Hello, darling.

514
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:20,682
It's all fixed.

515
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:23,054
I can go with you tomorrow.

516
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:24,581
That's great.

517
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:29,623
It's 25 minutes
since we became engaged.

518
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:31,655
You love me?

519
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,101
I love you, Mary.

520
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,104
I love you, Jimmy.

521
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:39,606
I love you, Mary.

522
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:41,108
I love you.

523
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:56,954
Get up.

524
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:58,459
Oh, Jimmy...

525
00:34:58,493 --> 00:34:59,460
You know?

526
00:34:59,494 --> 00:35:00,461
Jimmy...

527
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:01,553
Why, you got to, that's all.

528
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:02,790
I can't.
No, no, you have to.

529
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:05,629
Jimmy, why, why, why does
breakfast have to be at 7:00?

530
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,635
Well, it just does, so
come on, get up, okay?

531
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:09,296
Oh, Jimmy, I can't.

532
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:11,100
You can't?

533
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:12,265
Please.

534
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:13,604
- You just...
- Oh, please...

535
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:14,630
You just stay there.

536
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:16,871
I'll tell you what,
you stay there and, uh...

537
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:19,505
and I'll bring you some
breakfast in bed, all right?

538
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:20,514
How would that be?

539
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:21,515
Oh...

540
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:22,516
On a tray?

541
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,517
Marvelous.

542
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:24,518
On a tray?

543
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:25,519
Yes.

544
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:26,884
What would you
like to have most?

545
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:28,081
- Oh, wh-what...
- Most of all.

546
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:29,249
What are you doing?!

547
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,917
Oh, Jimmy!

548
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,790
The ice, no!

549
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:34,624
Oh... oh, oh, oh!

550
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:37,261
That's not funny.

551
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:39,027
- Is it cold?
- Oh, God, ice.

552
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,364
Oh, it's freezing!

553
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,699
Oh!

554
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:43,067
Hey, let go of the arm,
will you?

555
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:45,368
I'm going to need that in
a couple of months, please.

556
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:46,669
Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right, then.

557
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:47,732
All right, all right.

558
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,607
You can tell me what team
you're going to be with

559
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:50,804
and I might mail it
to you. Oh!

560
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:52,312
Okay, if it isn't Boston,
don't bother.

561
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:53,314
Oh!

562
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:54,838
Ugh! Ugh.

563
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:56,510
Ugh!

564
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,643
Really!

565
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:01,279
Really!

566
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:03,256
Oh...

567
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,758
Um...

568
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:06,886
You know, we need
traffic lights already

569
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:10,091
and I have to know what we're
gonna do when the baby comes.

570
00:36:10,131 --> 00:36:11,723
Find a bigger house.

571
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:12,733
Mmm... oh...

572
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:13,791
You cold?

573
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:15,962
I think it's kind of cozy
like this, don't you?

574
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:17,130
Oh, the ice. Ah...

575
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:18,762
You warming up in there?

576
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:19,774
No.

577
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:21,537
All right. Okay.

578
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:22,668
Dirty trick.

579
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,677
Shh. Ready?

580
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:24,700
Yes.

581
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,922
Oh... Good morning.

582
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,154
Good morning!

583
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:42,253
Your son put
an entire window sill

584
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:44,162
filled with snow down my back.

585
00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:46,029
- Oh, Jimmy!
- Yes, he did.

586
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,558
I'll take him over my knee.

587
00:36:53,074 --> 00:36:55,702
We missed the boat, Jim.

588
00:36:55,743 --> 00:36:58,576
We didn't make it.

589
00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:02,709
"No trip to the majors
for Jim Piersall."

590
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,688
"The Boston Red Sox
have decided

591
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:12,659
the outfield flash isn't ready
for the big leagues yet."

592
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,821
"He'll be sent
down to Louisville

593
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:17,161
next spring
for further training."

594
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,863
Well, what do they want, Dad?

595
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:42,573
I was the best fielder
in the league:

596
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,441
I stole bases, I scored runs.

597
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,174
What do they want from me?

598
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:48,444
What you didn't give them:
Hitting.

599
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:49,950
That's what they want.

600
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:55,385
"What do they want from me?"

601
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,528
A man can rot in the minors.

602
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:09,496
Jimmy, Jimmy, it's not
the end of the world.

603
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:20,144
It's another year.

604
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,334
Jim...

605
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,341
Come on, sit down.
Feeding time.

606
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,036
Sit down, come on.

607
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,645
Fine little girl, Jim.

608
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:57,878
Six pounds, eight ounces.

609
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:58,886
Well, how's Mary?

610
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,909
Okay, she's okay.

611
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:02,115
Well, why can't I
go in there?

612
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:03,747
You'll be in soon.

613
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,555
Your mom's with her now.

614
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,618
Well, uh...

615
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:11,063
you know how I feel,
don't you, Jim?

616
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,259
Thanks, Dad.

617
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:32,448
How did you make out
after the fifth?

618
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,352
I got my hit in the seventh.

619
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:35,856
Great.

620
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,687
That's fine, great, great.

621
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:40,319
That makes 15 straight
days in a row.

622
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:46,499
We're going to double it.

623
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,593
Come on in.

624
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:53,472
Hello, Daddy.

625
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:54,532
Are you okay?

626
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:57,043
Yes.

627
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:59,410
Look.

628
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,642
Well, she's beautiful.

629
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:06,914
Isn't she, Dad?

630
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:09,582
You're a lucky boy, Jim.

631
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,922
And you've got to
give her the best.

632
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:15,554
Jimmy, you really think
she's beautiful?

633
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:16,995
Yeah.

634
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,100
She's pretty small.

635
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:24,570
You'd be surprised
how those small ones

636
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:25,572
can fill up a room

637
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:26,937
once they start crawling around.

638
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:30,205
You know what we
need is a new house.

639
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:34,008
I mean, a... a place she
can really grow up in...

640
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,380
with rooms for everybody.

641
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:39,813
What do you think, Mary?

642
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,984
I think it would be wonderful,
but we can't afford it.

643
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,390
Sure we can.

644
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:46,586
Look at the way I'm hitting.

645
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,060
I got the whole league
on the run.

646
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:49,188
I'm going to make the majors...

647
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,197
I can't miss.

648
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,493
Why shouldn't we live
in a nice place?

649
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,124
Well, why shouldn't we have
a nice place?

650
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,464
We're going to have
a nice place.

651
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:56,732
Jim's right.
The way we're going

652
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,137
it's about time we got out
of that dump.

653
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,197
Sorry, folks.

654
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:03,073
My girl needs her beauty sleep.

655
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:04,078
Oh...

656
00:41:04,112 --> 00:41:05,841
Well, see you in
the morning, dear.

657
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,869
Bye.

658
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:10,914
I'll see you in the car.

659
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,912
Jimmy...

660
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:27,395
Are you really serious
about getting a house?

661
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:28,925
Sure I am.

662
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,530
I've never been more
serious in my life.

663
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,870
You-you just hurry up and
get out of the hospital

664
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,172
and get back up to Waterbury
and find one, okay?

665
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,199
Okay.

666
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,837
And I'll keep on
hitting, okay?

667
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,869
Okay.

668
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,177
Jim!

669
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:11,176
Hi, Dad.

670
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:12,439
Jimbo...

671
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,504
Great season.

672
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:15,607
Hey, you look wonderful.

673
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:18,948
Oh... where's Mary?

674
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,681
She has a meeting
with a contractor.

675
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:22,586
Wait till you see
the new house, Jim...

676
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,715
real high class.

677
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,157
We're moving in tomorrow.

678
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:26,182
Tomorrow?

679
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,194
Uh-huh.

680
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:30,992
Have you heard from Boston?

681
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:32,499
You will.

682
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,091
Reporters.

683
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,195
Come on... I'll introduce you.

684
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,933
Ed Slate from The Sentinel.

685
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,032
Hello, Jim.

686
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:42,702
Hank Gibbons
from the Danbury Globe.

687
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:44,176
Okay, fellows, start pitching.

688
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:46,077
Say, what's the story
about Boston, Jim?

689
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:47,774
Are you going up
there next season?

690
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,444
Well, I guess you'll have to ask
Mr. Cronin that.

691
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,975
Buying a house, aren't you?

692
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,817
Does that mean you're set
with the Red Sox?

693
00:42:57,058 --> 00:42:59,390
Papers up there say the Sox
would like to have you

694
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:01,224
if you can hit
the big-league pitching.

695
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,923
Well, it'd be
a lot tougher, okay...

696
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:04,693
We can out-hit
anybody in the league.

697
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:06,359
Lots of stars in
that Sox outfield.

698
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,027
We can outplay anybody
in the business

699
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:09,468
and I don't care who it is.

700
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,171
The boy's had a long trip,
Slate.

701
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:16,608
You've got your story,
right, Jim?

702
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:17,872
Thanks, Jim, very much.

703
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:19,140
Good bye, Mr. Piersall.

704
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,169
Thanks for coming.

705
00:43:20,248 --> 00:43:21,545
Thanks for calling us.

706
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:27,181
We're on our way, Jim.

707
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,748
Come on, you want to drive?

708
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,190
No, you drive.

709
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,194
I'll take you to the new house.

710
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:35,320
You'll like that.

711
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,524
Oh, no, Dad. Uh...

712
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,733
Let's go home.

713
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:42,235
I want to see Mary.

714
00:43:43,938 --> 00:43:45,735
I want you to see Eileen.

715
00:43:58,619 --> 00:43:59,586
Mary?

716
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,349
Yes?

717
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,879
Listen...

718
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:04,447
Finally, finally.

719
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:07,484
I've got to finish packing.

720
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:11,897
Jimmy...

721
00:44:11,932 --> 00:44:14,162
I bought a new high chair
today for Eileen.

722
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,533
As soon as we move in,
I thought I'd put it

723
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,969
Mary, Mary...

724
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:20,064
right in the room
that's going to be hers.

725
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:21,699
What?

726
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,403
We're not moving in.

727
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,651
What?

728
00:44:33,688 --> 00:44:35,815
We're not taking the house.

729
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:37,483
What happened?

730
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:43,725
I don't understand.

731
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:48,499
What happened?

732
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,333
It's too expensive.

733
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,034
I thought it was a bargain.

734
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:05,112
Uh, yes... uh...

735
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:06,949
but it's too much.

736
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:14,824
Jimmy, what's the matter?

737
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,124
Nothing.

738
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:17,596
Jimmy, please, Jimmy.

739
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,360
I know something's wrong.

740
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,833
Now, please tell me.

741
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:25,296
Jimmy...

742
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:39,708
Jimmy...

743
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,772
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,142
I can't.

745
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,572
It's his nerves.

746
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:26,209
That's what it is: Nerves.

747
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,550
He'll be all right the minute
he hears from Boston.

748
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:49,800
Good morning, gentlemen.

749
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:50,934
Morning...

750
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:53,707
Honey, can I get
a spring training roster?

751
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:55,907
Here. I'll write you
from Florida.

752
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:03,347
Send Piersall in.

753
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:04,754
Mr. Cronin will see you now.

754
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:19,195
Hello, Jim. How's the boy?

755
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:20,431
Fine, Mr. Cronin.

756
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:21,440
Good.

757
00:47:21,474 --> 00:47:22,907
Sit down.

758
00:47:24,477 --> 00:47:26,069
Have a good winter?

759
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:27,841
Yes, sir.

760
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,643
Keep in shape?

761
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:30,910
Yeah. Yes, sir.

762
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,215
Jim, we want you to start
the season with the Sox.

763
00:47:40,126 --> 00:47:43,391
Mr. Cronin...
ever since I was a kid

764
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:47,195
I've wanted to play
in the Red Sox outfield.

765
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:49,531
You ever think
about the infield?

766
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:50,866
No.

767
00:47:50,903 --> 00:47:54,430
We got a big hole
at shortstop, Jim.

768
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:56,600
With your speed and your arm,
you could fill it.

769
00:47:56,642 --> 00:47:57,631
And as an infielder

770
00:47:57,677 --> 00:47:59,508
you wouldn't be expected
to hit so hard.

771
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:01,240
You know, the pressure
would be off.

772
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,908
What do you say?

773
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,714
Uh... I don't know.

774
00:48:06,752 --> 00:48:08,413
I do.

775
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:10,115
You can do it.

776
00:48:10,156 --> 00:48:13,523
Um...

777
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:16,050
I've-I've been trained
for the outfield.

778
00:48:16,095 --> 00:48:18,086
And... I've never played
shortstop

779
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,291
and I don't know
anything about it.

780
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,734
We'll have you in the Red Sox
lineup opening day.

781
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:26,761
Hmm?

782
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:29,206
Now Monday,
you'll leave for Florida.

783
00:48:31,978 --> 00:48:33,639
Arrange transportation

784
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,203
for Piersall to Sarasota.

785
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:36,475
Yes, sir.

786
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:37,607
Um, Mr. Cronin...

787
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,174
Hmm?

788
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:42,153
You mind if I call
my father first?

789
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:44,486
Oh, sure, Jim.

790
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:47,782
Here you go.

791
00:48:51,764 --> 00:48:55,393
Uh, Waterbury, Connecticut,
2095J.

792
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:58,892
Glad this spot
opened up for you, Jim

793
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:01,338
because we want you with us.

794
00:49:01,374 --> 00:49:03,535
We're loaded
with outfielders.

795
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:05,407
You'll do okay at short.

796
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:07,605
You'll pick it up
in no time.

797
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,983
Be out in a minute, boys.

798
00:49:17,323 --> 00:49:18,915
Hello, Dad.

799
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,653
Jim.

800
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:24,129
It looks like I'm going to make
the Red Sox, Dad.

801
00:49:26,432 --> 00:49:28,195
We finally made it.

802
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:31,294
We made it, Jim...
Great... that's great.

803
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:32,736
Great, Jim, great.

804
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:36,799
Now listen, Dad, they want
to put me at shortstop.

805
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:39,333
Shortstop?

806
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:43,373
Hello?

807
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:44,940
Jim...

808
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:49,683
Yeah, Mr. Cronin says they've
got an opening for me there.

809
00:49:49,722 --> 00:49:51,349
We made it, Jim.
We made it.

810
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,722
Short, outfield,
what's the difference?

811
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:56,023
It needs a little work,
that's all.

812
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:57,996
Just a little hard work, Jim.

813
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:01,966
Come home fast... next train.

814
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:04,834
Okay.

815
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:08,622
Jimmy.

816
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:14,997
You made it.

817
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:17,229
Oh, Jimmy, where have you been?

818
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:19,066
We've been worried sick.

819
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:20,629
What took so long?

820
00:52:22,241 --> 00:52:23,208
Where's Dad?

821
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:24,231
He's at the bus station.

822
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:25,537
We were waiting all afternoon

823
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:26,738
and he went down there

824
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:27,939
to see if he could find you.

825
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,709
What happened?

826
00:52:31,484 --> 00:52:33,111
Listen, listen.

827
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,587
I went to Boston.

828
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:36,588
Yes, yes.

829
00:52:36,622 --> 00:52:37,919
They don't want me there.

830
00:52:37,957 --> 00:52:39,356
What? They... they...
who doesn't?

831
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:40,585
No, they don't want me there.

832
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:41,593
Who doesn't, Jim?

833
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:44,187
Cronin and the Red Sox,
they... Mary?

834
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,255
They want to get rid of me.

835
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:47,265
Oh, Jimmy...

836
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:48,630
Yes, they do.

837
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,726
They're trying to put me
at shortstop

838
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:51,929
and I can't play it.

839
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:52,995
I can't play it.

840
00:52:53,038 --> 00:52:54,596
Oh, Jimmy, no, no, no, no.

841
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,607
I can't play that.

842
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:57,575
I don't want to go
to spring training.

843
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,907
I don't want to go there.

844
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:00,275
All right...
all right then.

845
00:53:00,379 --> 00:53:01,437
You don't have to go.

846
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,742
I don't have
to go, do I?

847
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:03,907
No, no, you don't.

848
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:06,383
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

849
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:07,646
I don't want to be hurt.

850
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:09,381
Okay, Jimmy,
you don't have to go there.

851
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:11,542
I don't want to be hurt.

852
00:53:11,675 --> 00:53:12,937
Mary?

853
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:17,173
Jim!

854
00:53:17,214 --> 00:53:18,272
Oh, Dad, Dad...
he's sick

855
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:20,078
and we've got to get
him to a doctor.

856
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,085
Well, I just talked
to him this afternoon.

857
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:23,108
How can he be sick?

858
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:24,485
Oh, Dad, Dad,
he doesn't even want

859
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:25,750
to go down
to spring training.

860
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,779
He doesn't.

861
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:37,064
Jim!

862
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:38,432
Jim!

863
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,438
Jim!

864
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:09,423
Jim?

865
00:54:25,483 --> 00:54:27,246
What are you doing here?

866
00:54:35,593 --> 00:54:36,787
What's this I hear

867
00:54:36,827 --> 00:54:39,796
about you not going
down to spring training?

868
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:42,822
Is that right, Jim?

869
00:54:45,669 --> 00:54:47,159
That doesn't sound like you.

870
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,695
We don't go in for that
kind of stuff, do we?

871
00:54:52,076 --> 00:54:56,308
Now, it's no time
to get cold feet.

872
00:54:56,347 --> 00:54:58,406
Well, sure, they put you
in the infield

873
00:54:58,449 --> 00:55:01,043
so you'll have to work
a little harder, so what?

874
00:55:01,085 --> 00:55:02,450
You're making
the majors, Jim.

875
00:55:02,486 --> 00:55:04,283
That's what counts.

876
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:08,186
What have we been
fighting for

877
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:10,193
and scraping for
all these years?

878
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:12,923
And what have we been
pouring our blood into?

879
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:14,123
Oh, Jim.

880
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:21,463
Now... boy, this is
no time to buckle up.

881
00:55:21,505 --> 00:55:23,598
You want them
to call you yellow?

882
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:25,165
Well, if that's what you want

883
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:26,574
you're no son of mine then.

884
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,668
Now you promise me

885
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:29,440
you'll be on that
train tomorrow.

886
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,970
Come on, Jim, promise me.

887
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:37,447
I'm waiting, Jim.

888
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:42,292
Okay.

889
00:55:42,326 --> 00:55:43,657
I'll go.

890
00:55:43,694 --> 00:55:45,491
Oh, now, that's more like it.

891
00:55:47,464 --> 00:55:48,829
For a minute there, you know

892
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:51,164
I thought you were going
to ditch everything.

893
00:55:53,938 --> 00:55:55,565
Fine thing, trying
to put a scare

894
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:56,664
into your old man.

895
00:56:12,823 --> 00:56:16,054
That's not good enough,
that's not hard enough...

896
00:56:16,093 --> 00:56:17,253
Take it easy!

897
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:18,283
You take it easy.

898
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,393
Come on, throw harder,
throw harder.

899
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:22,399
Show me more.

900
00:56:22,433 --> 00:56:24,264
We've got games to win.

901
00:56:24,335 --> 00:56:25,700
Take a break now,
huh, Jimmy?

902
00:56:25,736 --> 00:56:28,000
No, I... I...

903
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:31,641
Cool off, huh?

904
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:33,836
Yes, sir.

905
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:36,641
Yes, sir...
yes, sir.

906
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,773
Gotta work!
Gotta work!

907
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:42,274
Gotta work...
gotta work.

908
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:49,893
The Boston Red Sox Baseball Club

909
00:56:49,927 --> 00:56:53,522
of the American League
welcomes you to Fenway Park

910
00:56:53,564 --> 00:56:57,796
for this season's opening game
with the Chicago White Sox.

911
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:01,362
This is the first
of a four-game series.

912
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:24,192
Play ball!

913
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:51,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

914
00:57:55,993 --> 00:57:57,426
Can you see me
back there?

915
00:57:57,461 --> 00:57:59,429
Can you see me
standing back there?

916
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:02,557
What do you think we're playing
here, high school ball?

917
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:04,226
Huh, huh?

918
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:05,529
Keep your eye on me, mister.

919
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:06,934
Knock it off.
Let's play ball!

920
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:32,623
Watch 'em play, will ya?

921
00:58:45,476 --> 00:58:47,467
Come on, come here!

922
00:58:47,511 --> 00:58:48,978
Come here, you're up!

923
00:58:50,214 --> 00:58:52,273
Boy, we need a hit, man,
and you've got to get it!

924
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:53,748
You haven't had one
for four days.

925
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:55,115
You've got to get
one now, okay!

926
00:58:55,152 --> 00:58:56,449
Huh, you're going
to get a hit?

927
00:58:56,487 --> 00:58:57,613
You're going
to get one?

928
00:58:57,654 --> 00:58:59,019
I'll get my hit, kid;
you get yours.

929
00:58:59,056 --> 00:59:00,580
Okay, go get it.
That's all I'm asking.

930
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:01,648
Aw, shut up.

931
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:07,524
Jimmy!

932
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,670
I said, break it up!

933
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:22,236
I won't stand
for this kind of fighting.

934
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:24,440
You're up.

935
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:25,880
You end in the dugout, Jim.

936
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,406
You're benched for the day.

937
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:32,080
You can't bench me,
Mr. Cronin.

938
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:33,749
I said you're benched.

939
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:35,053
You're out of the game.

940
00:59:37,694 --> 00:59:39,855
You're suspended, Piersall.

941
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:42,491
As of right now,
you're suspended.

942
00:59:42,533 --> 00:59:44,660
Now get to the showers.

943
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:25,400
Jimmy?

944
01:00:25,442 --> 01:00:27,171
Mary. Wha?

945
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:29,042
Well, now, w-w-what
are you doing here?

946
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,444
I wanted to see you.

947
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,447
Well, how come?

948
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:32,948
I just wanted to see you.

949
01:00:32,983 --> 01:00:35,247
Are you all right?

950
01:00:35,285 --> 01:00:37,014
Sure I'm all right.

951
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:38,282
I'm fine.

952
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:40,187
I'm fine.

953
01:00:45,996 --> 01:00:49,056
You were there today?

954
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:51,966
Yes.

955
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:55,460
See what he did to me?

956
01:00:55,505 --> 01:00:57,336
That Cronin suspending,
suspending me

957
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:59,432
kicking me off the team
for two weeks.

958
01:00:59,476 --> 01:01:01,068
I'm the one player
on that team

959
01:01:01,111 --> 01:01:02,408
that plays to win games.

960
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:04,380
I play to win games.

961
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:05,540
He won't let me play.

962
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,174
- Oh, Jimmy.
- He won't let me play.

963
01:01:07,217 --> 01:01:08,275
Jimmy...

964
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:11,821
maybe you should take
a rest for a while.

965
01:01:18,495 --> 01:01:21,658
Don't you turn
against me, Mary.

966
01:01:21,698 --> 01:01:24,724
Don't turn against me.

967
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:33,301
I won't lift the suspension

968
01:01:33,377 --> 01:01:34,844
until Jim's ready
to settle down.

969
01:01:34,878 --> 01:01:37,210
He'll settle down, Mr. Cronin

970
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:39,238
if you put him in the outfield.

971
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:41,274
You put him in the outfield
where he knows everything

972
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,309
and I'll...
listen, I'll guarantee you

973
01:01:43,387 --> 01:01:44,752
he'll play a whale of a game.

974
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:46,221
I guarantee that.

975
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:53,482
What do you say, Jim?

976
01:01:55,919 --> 01:01:59,082
You ready to cut out the yelling
and play ball?

977
01:02:05,262 --> 01:02:07,560
Well, you heard Mr. Cronin.

978
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:15,736
Yes, sir.

979
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,240
...will be starting
in center field.

980
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:26,749
In right field for Boston...

981
01:02:26,783 --> 01:02:28,717
Jim Piersall.

982
01:02:34,624 --> 01:02:36,421
Jim!

983
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,291
Jim.

984
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:44,022
Now you show them, Jim.

985
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:45,261
Don't let me down.

986
01:03:28,912 --> 01:03:30,277
I said you were at bat, Jim.

987
01:03:30,313 --> 01:03:31,644
Let's go, huh?

988
01:03:49,866 --> 01:03:52,460
You can do it.
Come on, Jim, you can do it.

989
01:03:52,502 --> 01:03:54,197
Use your head, Jim.

990
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:55,465
You can do it!

991
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:56,699
We're with you, Jim.

992
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,868
Come on, Jimmy, show them how.

993
01:04:39,616 --> 01:04:41,049
Come on, Jimmy, boy!

994
01:04:46,923 --> 01:04:48,515
Show them, Jimmy!

995
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:00,666
Strike!

996
01:05:03,773 --> 01:05:05,297
Come on, Jim, let's go!

997
01:05:15,485 --> 01:05:17,783
Ball!

998
01:05:28,732 --> 01:05:30,791
Strike!

999
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:33,803
Come on there, Jimmy!

1000
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:55,122
All the way!

1001
01:05:56,026 --> 01:05:57,960
All the way!
All the way!

1002
01:05:59,062 --> 01:06:00,188
All the way!

1003
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,629
All the way!

1004
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:06,095
All the way!

1005
01:06:08,505 --> 01:06:10,132
How was that?

1006
01:06:10,173 --> 01:06:11,197
How was it?

1007
01:06:11,241 --> 01:06:12,606
Was it good enough?

1008
01:06:17,347 --> 01:06:18,439
Get in the dugout.

1009
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:19,470
Did I show them?

1010
01:06:19,516 --> 01:06:20,574
Get in the dugout, Jim!

1011
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:22,209
Answer me, Pop,
did I show them?

1012
01:06:22,252 --> 01:06:24,243
I showed 'em.
I showed 'em.

1013
01:06:24,287 --> 01:06:26,812
Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop,
I showed them.

1014
01:06:26,856 --> 01:06:29,222
Pop... Pop... Pop...

1015
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:31,420
Was that good enough?

1016
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:33,224
Was that good
enough for you?

1017
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:36,493
Come on. Let's go.

1018
01:06:46,977 --> 01:06:48,740
Don't let them take me!

1019
01:06:48,778 --> 01:06:50,575
Oh, God!

1020
01:06:56,286 --> 01:06:58,311
I don't want to go! No!

1021
01:06:59,723 --> 01:07:01,782
Come on.

1022
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:03,019
I don't want to go!

1023
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:04,583
Jimmy, let's go!
Come on!

1024
01:07:04,627 --> 01:07:07,721
Don't hurt him!

1025
01:07:07,764 --> 01:07:09,823
Don't... Jimmy!
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1026
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:17,899
Let me out there!
I'm Piersall!

1027
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:26,546
Get away!

1028
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:28,915
Get away!

1029
01:07:28,952 --> 01:07:31,079
I'm Piersall!

1030
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:33,885
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

1031
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:35,151
I want to play!

1032
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:48,463
Let him go! Don't hurt him!
Don't hurt him!

1033
01:07:48,505 --> 01:07:49,870
Let me play!

1034
01:08:03,753 --> 01:08:05,812
Ticket these for Piersall.

1035
01:08:12,362 --> 01:08:14,023
- Mr. Piersall...
- Yes.

1036
01:08:14,064 --> 01:08:15,053
I'm Dr. Brown.

1037
01:08:15,098 --> 01:08:16,429
I'll be taking care of Jim.

1038
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:18,525
Now where is he?
Can I see him?

1039
01:08:18,568 --> 01:08:20,195
Your son's a pretty sick boy.

1040
01:08:20,236 --> 01:08:22,170
He's had a breakdown,
Mr. Piersall

1041
01:08:22,205 --> 01:08:24,537
a mental breakdown.

1042
01:08:24,574 --> 01:08:26,405
- Can I see him?
- No.

1043
01:08:26,443 --> 01:08:27,774
Just for a minute.

1044
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:29,745
No, no, I'm sorry.

1045
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:31,576
I suggest you go home.

1046
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:32,774
I'll get in touch
with you tomorrow.

1047
01:08:32,816 --> 01:08:35,284
We may have a clearer
picture then.

1048
01:08:35,351 --> 01:08:37,342
Excuse me please.

1049
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:41,252
Doc.

1050
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,551
You handle Jim easy,
won't you?

1051
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:49,619
I know.

1052
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:01,926
Hello, Jim.

1053
01:09:11,075 --> 01:09:14,010
I'm a doctor, Jim.
I'm here to help you.

1054
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:15,376
I'm going to give you
something

1055
01:09:15,413 --> 01:09:17,847
that'll make you relax
and feel better.

1056
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,422
Jim, Jim...

1057
01:09:28,459 --> 01:09:30,791
first I want to take
the straps off.

1058
01:09:33,598 --> 01:09:37,193
Would you like me to take
the straps off, Jim?

1059
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:45,801
I want you to trust me, Jim.

1060
01:09:45,843 --> 01:09:49,711
I mean to help you.

1061
01:09:49,747 --> 01:09:54,684
I have a feeling
we're going to be friends, Jim.

1062
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,812
I want you to trust me.

1063
01:10:02,427 --> 01:10:08,297
You know, you've had
a rough couple of hours.

1064
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:10,264
Would you like to rest, Jim?

1065
01:10:13,704 --> 01:10:16,264
Would you like to have
some sleep?

1066
01:10:18,776 --> 01:10:19,936
I can help...

1067
01:10:19,977 --> 01:10:22,377
I can help you
have some sleep, Jim.

1068
01:10:27,718 --> 01:10:31,449
Give me your arm, Jim.

1069
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:35,823
I'm not going to hurt you.

1070
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,555
Give me your arm.

1071
01:10:52,276 --> 01:10:54,801
I want to help you,
Jimmy Piersall.

1072
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:59,174
Can you hear me?

1073
01:10:59,217 --> 01:11:00,684
Jimmy Piersall?

1074
01:11:03,454 --> 01:11:08,858
You know that name,
that's your name, Jim.

1075
01:11:08,893 --> 01:11:10,292
Jimmy Piersall...

1076
01:11:10,394 --> 01:11:14,296
can you hear me?

1077
01:11:14,398 --> 01:11:16,798
Jim?

1078
01:11:28,346 --> 01:11:30,314
I got here as
quickly as I could.

1079
01:11:30,414 --> 01:11:31,938
Thanks.

1080
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:34,679
I'm sorry this
couldn't wait.

1081
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,710
Sit down.

1082
01:11:39,423 --> 01:11:41,414
I need your help.

1083
01:11:41,459 --> 01:11:42,790
What is it?

1084
01:11:42,827 --> 01:11:44,556
We're not getting anywhere.

1085
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:45,619
It's three weeks

1086
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,494
and I still haven't
been able

1087
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:49,193
to make contact with Jim.

1088
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:53,226
I tried almost everything

1089
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:56,206
and there's only
one other possibility.

1090
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,573
I need your consent
for that... electroshock.

1091
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,005
I can't even
promise anything.

1092
01:12:05,049 --> 01:12:07,677
And I won't
minimize the risk.

1093
01:12:07,718 --> 01:12:09,083
I can tell you

1094
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,283
if we don't, if we don't
make contact with Jim soon

1095
01:12:12,356 --> 01:12:13,721
he may withdraw so far

1096
01:12:13,758 --> 01:12:15,851
he'll never be
able to reach you.

1097
01:12:17,828 --> 01:12:23,095
That doesn't leave me
much choice, does it?

1098
01:13:26,797 --> 01:13:29,960
He may not
recognize you, Mary.

1099
01:13:47,418 --> 01:13:49,477
Hello, Jimmy.

1100
01:14:01,913 --> 01:14:04,016
It's so good to see you.

1101
01:14:10,343 --> 01:14:12,540
Everybody sends
their love to you.

1102
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:17,904
Mom and Dad and Eileen.

1103
01:14:21,841 --> 01:14:23,784
You should see Eileen now.

1104
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:26,902
She's walking, Jimmy.

1105
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:33,928
We're all fine, Jimmy.

1106
01:14:36,284 --> 01:14:39,495
The Red Sox have taken care
of everything for us.

1107
01:14:41,138 --> 01:14:44,592
And Mr. Cronin calls all
the time to see how you are.

1108
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:50,014
Mary.

1109
01:14:51,889 --> 01:14:53,373
Jimmy.

1110
01:14:58,689 --> 01:15:00,687
Oh, he wanted
to get rid of me.

1111
01:15:00,717 --> 01:15:01,664
He, uh...

1112
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:07,559
Mr. Cronin wanted
to hurt me.

1113
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:13,023
- He wanted to hurt me, didn't he?
- No.

1114
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:21,391
Um, he wanted to... hurt me...

1115
01:15:24,265 --> 01:15:25,560
Put me in here.

1116
01:15:26,894 --> 01:15:30,054
Oh, Mary, why did you let him put me in here?
Oh, Jim... no!

1117
01:15:30,084 --> 01:15:33,277
That was wrong. That was wrong.
He shouldn't have done that to me, Mary.

1118
01:15:33,307 --> 01:15:36,573
You shouldn't have done that to me, Mary.
Mary, why did you put me in here?!

1119
01:15:36,603 --> 01:15:40,216
M-M-Mary? Mary! Mary!
M... Mary!

1120
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:50,296
I don't understand it.

1121
01:15:52,832 --> 01:15:54,700
I don't understand.

1122
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:58,335
What's that, Jim?

1123
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,290
I don't understand
the things I do.

1124
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:13,161
Maybe I could
help you understand

1125
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:15,611
if you want me to.

1126
01:16:22,182 --> 01:16:23,806
Hello, Jim Piersall.

1127
01:16:28,478 --> 01:16:30,103
How are you this morning?

1128
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,031
Getting used
to these sessions?

1129
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,730
Got a letter.

1130
01:16:57,527 --> 01:16:59,020
Anything interesting?

1131
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:06,565
Yes, a picture
of my baby, Eileen.

1132
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,375
Pretty little thing,
isn't she?

1133
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,117
You know, Jim,
she's got your eyes.

1134
01:17:25,571 --> 01:17:27,693
My wife says she has
my appetite.

1135
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:31,085
I bet her grandma takes
good care of that.

1136
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:32,830
Quite a cook your mom,
isn't she?

1137
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:33,956
Oh, yeah.

1138
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:36,194
I remember when
I was a kid

1139
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,826
I couldn't get home

1140
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:39,598
from school
fast enough.

1141
01:17:39,637 --> 01:17:42,162
Pretty good pals,
you and your ma?

1142
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:46,644
Oh, we were a regular team.

1143
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:49,200
We did laundry and, uh...

1144
01:17:50,393 --> 01:17:54,020
and, uh, I'd pour the hot water
over it, and...

1145
01:17:56,142 --> 01:17:57,870
I remember once
when I was a kid...

1146
01:18:02,581 --> 01:18:04,741
Uh, she was away a lot...

1147
01:18:06,844 --> 01:18:08,384
And then your father
took care of you.

1148
01:18:11,545 --> 01:18:14,682
Yeah, well, we were
a regular team, too.

1149
01:18:15,306 --> 01:18:17,604
We'd, uh, play baseball

1150
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,139
all the time.

1151
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,726
You were happy
with your father?

1152
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:24,219
Sure.

1153
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,182
He's a wonderful man.

1154
01:18:28,231 --> 01:18:31,264
Well, when I won
a big game or something

1155
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:33,422
nothing was too good for me.

1156
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,642
How about when you lost?

1157
01:18:38,684 --> 01:18:40,036
No, I didn't lose.

1158
01:18:43,548 --> 01:18:45,632
You mean you, you won
every game you played?

1159
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:54,471
Well, no, I mean,
you don't win every game.

1160
01:18:57,429 --> 01:18:59,178
I lost sometimes.

1161
01:19:01,516 --> 01:19:02,821
What happened then?

1162
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:10,959
What did they say, Mary?

1163
01:19:10,995 --> 01:19:12,155
Can we see him?

1164
01:19:12,197 --> 01:19:13,416
No.

1165
01:19:13,594 --> 01:19:16,228
Well, what are they
doing to the boy?

1166
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:17,928
Why can't I see
my own son?

1167
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:20,130
Dad, Dr. Brown is doing
all he can.

1168
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:22,196
We've got to go
along with it.

1169
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,504
There must be
something I can do.

1170
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:25,634
I know Jim.

1171
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:28,669
He's up there alone,
nothing but strangers.

1172
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:32,649
Oh, Mary, if... if they'd just
give me a minute with him

1173
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:35,016
I know I could
help that boy.

1174
01:19:35,053 --> 01:19:38,545
Dad, we've got to leave
that to Dr. Brown.

1175
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:54,037
You know the rule
in these sessions, Jim.

1176
01:19:54,072 --> 01:19:55,972
This time is yours.

1177
01:19:58,309 --> 01:20:01,437
You don't have
to say a thing

1178
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:03,709
but if there's anything
on your mind.

1179
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:10,278
Look, uh, I like you, Doc

1180
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:14,087
but I don't think we're getting
anywhere with this thing.

1181
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:16,685
It's just going to be
like last week

1182
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,195
and the week before.

1183
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:29,870
Well, since we have to spend
this hour together anyway, uh...

1184
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,502
how about watching
the ball game?

1185
01:20:44,556 --> 01:20:45,955
It's been a long time

1186
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:49,153
since you've seen
a ball game, hasn't it, Jim?

1187
01:20:57,902 --> 01:21:00,200
It's outside and high.

1188
01:21:04,242 --> 01:21:07,541
There's the ball going
into right field, and it's...

1189
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:08,910
foul, by inches.

1190
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:13,945
It's a long belt
down the left-field line.

1191
01:21:13,985 --> 01:21:17,921
It's a hit!

1192
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,287
Come on, make your turn.

1193
01:21:19,324 --> 01:21:21,258
It's a stand-up double.

1194
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:22,919
Oh, go to third.

1195
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,553
He made it to second fine.

1196
01:21:24,596 --> 01:21:26,928
Yeah, but he should've gone
all the way to third.

1197
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,296
He played it safe.

1198
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:29,991
Oh, Doc, don't make me laugh.

1199
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:31,262
Say he made a mistake.

1200
01:21:31,302 --> 01:21:33,862
He made a mistake,
he should've gone to third.

1201
01:21:33,905 --> 01:21:35,270
If I'd a done
something like that

1202
01:21:35,306 --> 01:21:36,739
I would've heard
about it for days.

1203
01:21:36,774 --> 01:21:38,435
Dad would've made
my life miserable.

1204
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,568
How, Jim?

1205
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:48,012
Well, oh, Doc, he would've...
I don't know

1206
01:21:48,052 --> 01:21:51,078
not talk to me, something,
I don't know.

1207
01:21:51,122 --> 01:21:54,250
That would've been
pretty tough, huh?

1208
01:21:55,927 --> 01:21:58,327
Yeah, but, he's my father

1209
01:21:58,363 --> 01:22:01,423
and I wanted to do good for him.

1210
01:22:01,466 --> 01:22:04,299
I owe him something, don't I?

1211
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,268
You have a little girl, Jim.

1212
01:22:08,306 --> 01:22:10,501
Would you like her
to grow up feeling

1213
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:11,599
she owed
you something?

1214
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:13,770
Now, look, Doc,
let me tell you something...

1215
01:22:13,811 --> 01:22:15,472
let me get you
something straight.

1216
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:16,571
I love my dad.

1217
01:22:16,614 --> 01:22:18,275
He's the biggest thing
in my life.

1218
01:22:18,383 --> 01:22:20,374
He taught me,
and he straightened me out

1219
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:21,578
and he kept me in line.

1220
01:22:21,619 --> 01:22:23,917
If it hadn't been for him
standing behind me

1221
01:22:23,955 --> 01:22:27,220
and pushing me and driving me,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

1222
01:23:36,081 --> 01:23:37,810
Hello, Doctor.

1223
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,980
How are you, Mr. Piersall?

1224
01:23:44,123 --> 01:23:46,284
Mary tells me that
Jim is feeling better.

1225
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:49,954
There's, there's been
considerable improvement, yes.

1226
01:23:49,995 --> 01:23:52,088
Good.

1227
01:23:56,335 --> 01:23:58,235
Sit down.

1228
01:24:03,709 --> 01:24:07,372
Well, I, uh,
I want to apologize

1229
01:24:07,413 --> 01:24:10,974
for busting in
on you this way.

1230
01:24:11,016 --> 01:24:13,382
And, uh, well, we
appreciate everything

1231
01:24:13,419 --> 01:24:14,647
you've done for Jim.

1232
01:24:14,687 --> 01:24:16,245
We appreciate it
very much.

1233
01:24:16,355 --> 01:24:18,152
But now that the boy
is feeling better

1234
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,782
isn't it about time
he came home?

1235
01:24:19,825 --> 01:24:23,761
Well, no.

1236
01:24:23,796 --> 01:24:25,593
It's not that simple.

1237
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:27,997
Physically,
Jim is getting back to normal

1238
01:24:28,033 --> 01:24:30,160
but he's not nearly ready
to go home.

1239
01:24:30,202 --> 01:24:33,365
When will he be ready?

1240
01:24:33,405 --> 01:24:35,805
I can't tell.

1241
01:24:37,776 --> 01:24:39,767
Do you know what
they're saying?

1242
01:24:40,846 --> 01:24:42,370
"He'll never be ready.

1243
01:24:42,414 --> 01:24:45,406
"That mental institution
looks like it'll be

1244
01:24:45,451 --> 01:24:47,749
Jim Piersall's
permanent address."

1245
01:24:47,786 --> 01:24:48,912
That's not true.

1246
01:24:48,954 --> 01:24:50,717
Well, three million
readers think it is.

1247
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:52,280
Every day that you
keep him in here

1248
01:24:52,357 --> 01:24:54,951
it makes it a hundred times
harder for him to come back.

1249
01:24:54,993 --> 01:24:57,723
Mr. Piersall, Jim has been sick.

1250
01:24:57,763 --> 01:25:02,029
Mental illness is no different
from any other kind.

1251
01:25:02,067 --> 01:25:05,002
Try and tell that
to the people outside!

1252
01:25:05,037 --> 01:25:07,665
Dr. Brown, you let my boy
come home!

1253
01:25:07,706 --> 01:25:08,673
I'm sorry.

1254
01:25:08,707 --> 01:25:11,232
It's out of the question.

1255
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:12,607
Jim is coming home, Doc

1256
01:25:12,644 --> 01:25:14,578
even if I have to go
to the papers

1257
01:25:14,613 --> 01:25:16,137
and the ball club
about it.

1258
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:21,050
Mr. Piersall, Jim is my patient,
my responsibility.

1259
01:25:21,086 --> 01:25:23,520
He's making progress here

1260
01:25:23,555 --> 01:25:25,489
and I won't have that progress
interrupted.

1261
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:29,016
Why don't we go and ask Jim how
he feels about it?

1262
01:25:33,232 --> 01:25:36,759
Jim isn't ready to talk to you

1263
01:25:36,802 --> 01:25:38,793
or even see you.

1264
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:46,334
I'm sorry, Mr. Piersall.

1265
01:26:52,477 --> 01:26:54,342
It's me, Jim.

1266
01:27:01,186 --> 01:27:04,349
You know they tried
to keep me out of here?

1267
01:27:04,389 --> 01:27:06,880
Fat chance.

1268
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:09,018
How are you, boy?

1269
01:27:19,004 --> 01:27:21,097
You know, I... I was...

1270
01:27:21,139 --> 01:27:24,131
I was just telling
the doc

1271
01:27:24,176 --> 01:27:26,440
what's the sense in hanging
around here

1272
01:27:26,478 --> 01:27:29,777
when you got a family can give
you everything you need?

1273
01:27:29,815 --> 01:27:33,979
Come on, Jim.

1274
01:27:34,019 --> 01:27:35,782
You stick around here

1275
01:27:35,821 --> 01:27:39,257
and they'll make you
an invalid for life.

1276
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:40,280
We know that, don't we?

1277
01:27:42,461 --> 01:27:46,591
You've got to fight this thing,
Jim, just fight it.

1278
01:27:46,632 --> 01:27:49,567
Start feeling sorry for yourself
and you're through.

1279
01:27:49,601 --> 01:27:53,264
You know that's what
the sports writers are saying...

1280
01:27:53,338 --> 01:27:54,771
that you're through?

1281
01:27:54,806 --> 01:27:59,004
That you're washed up,
you'll never play again.

1282
01:27:59,044 --> 01:28:02,741
You put your things together
and go down there

1283
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:06,308
and tell that doc
that we've got to get back

1284
01:28:06,351 --> 01:28:10,310
so we can tell those wise guys
we're not through.

1285
01:28:10,355 --> 01:28:12,414
We're not washed up!

1286
01:28:12,457 --> 01:28:16,223
Oh, you just listen
to me, Jim.

1287
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:19,719
We can still make it.

1288
01:28:19,765 --> 01:28:22,029
No, Dad, um...
it, uh, it won't

1289
01:28:22,067 --> 01:28:23,728
it won't work anymore.

1290
01:28:23,769 --> 01:28:25,930
I... I can't make it.

1291
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:30,340
It's all right, Jim,
you're okay.

1292
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:31,399
I'm trying, Dad.

1293
01:28:31,443 --> 01:28:33,911
I'm really trying,
but it's very hard

1294
01:28:33,946 --> 01:28:35,914
and it takes
everything I got.

1295
01:28:35,948 --> 01:28:37,006
Jim, listen to me.

1296
01:28:37,049 --> 01:28:38,016
Dad, please.

1297
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,017
Listen to me, now.

1298
01:28:39,051 --> 01:28:41,246
You've always listened to me,
haven't you?

1299
01:28:41,286 --> 01:28:43,151
Yeah.

1300
01:28:43,188 --> 01:28:45,486
Haven't you?

1301
01:28:45,524 --> 01:28:48,925
All my life, I've been splitting
my gut to please you

1302
01:28:48,961 --> 01:28:51,987
and I never could.

1303
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:55,397
No matter what I do,
it's not enough.

1304
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:57,402
Dad...

1305
01:28:57,436 --> 01:28:59,233
you're killing me.

1306
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:02,104
No, I'm... I'm trying
to help you, Jim.

1307
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,608
No, you're not!

1308
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:08,204
You don't care about me!

1309
01:29:08,313 --> 01:29:10,611
You never gave a damn!

1310
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:11,775
"Win, Jimmy, win!"

1311
01:29:11,817 --> 01:29:13,808
That's all you
ever cared about.

1312
01:29:13,852 --> 01:29:15,217
And you're killing me.

1313
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,379
You've been killing me
for years.

1314
01:29:17,422 --> 01:29:19,413
Yes, you have,
and it's too much!

1315
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:21,085
I can't give you
any more!

1316
01:29:21,126 --> 01:29:23,720
I've got nothing
left to give!

1317
01:29:25,464 --> 01:29:28,092
Now get out of here, Dad.
Get away from me.

1318
01:29:28,133 --> 01:29:30,761
Get away from me.
Go on. Get away from me.

1319
01:29:30,802 --> 01:29:33,600
Get away from me.

1320
01:29:33,638 --> 01:29:34,798
Get out!

1321
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,495
Get that guy
out of here!

1322
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:40,392
Get him out!

1323
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:28,705
Jim, Jim, Jim.

1324
01:30:34,751 --> 01:30:36,878
I wanted to kill him.

1325
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,218
But you didn't, Jimmy.

1326
01:30:39,256 --> 01:30:43,659
Everyone... all of us,
we have irrational impulses.

1327
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:46,754
It takes a sane man
to control them.

1328
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:53,568
Help... me.

1329
01:30:53,603 --> 01:30:56,663
Help me.

1330
01:30:56,707 --> 01:30:58,368
Help me.

1331
01:30:58,408 --> 01:31:01,275
All right, Jimmy...

1332
01:31:01,311 --> 01:31:04,940
I'll... I'll try to help you.

1333
01:31:04,981 --> 01:31:07,313
You wanted to hurt your father.

1334
01:31:07,351 --> 01:31:09,546
There was a reason.

1335
01:31:09,586 --> 01:31:11,577
You know the reason.

1336
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:14,681
Uh-uh... uh-uh.

1337
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,551
You know the reason, Jim.

1338
01:31:28,405 --> 01:31:30,236
I wanted to s...

1339
01:31:30,273 --> 01:31:32,264
tell him no...

1340
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:38,608
Tell him I couldn't...

1341
01:31:38,648 --> 01:31:41,242
I couldn't do it.

1342
01:31:41,284 --> 01:31:43,684
Tell him I couldn't.

1343
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,349
I wanted to say no
for all the...

1344
01:31:47,391 --> 01:31:52,829
every time... that he wanted me
to do something

1345
01:31:52,863 --> 01:31:56,026
and he wouldn't let me say no.

1346
01:32:06,543 --> 01:32:10,240
You couldn't satisfy that man.

1347
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,680
I couldn't satisfy him.

1348
01:32:16,253 --> 01:32:18,881
He wanted good things for me.

1349
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:24,025
Big league baseball, big money.

1350
01:32:25,529 --> 01:32:28,293
It was for me he wanted that.

1351
01:32:30,967 --> 01:32:33,435
He's a good man, Doc.

1352
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,597
Yes, he is.

1353
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:37,470
He didn't want to hurt me.

1354
01:32:37,507 --> 01:32:39,134
No.

1355
01:32:40,644 --> 01:32:43,772
Jimmy, your...
your father had his dreams.

1356
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:45,907
He wanted you to make them
come true.

1357
01:32:48,318 --> 01:32:50,286
But it didn't work.

1358
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,153
It never does.

1359
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:57,286
You had dreams of your own
and needs of your own.

1360
01:32:57,327 --> 01:33:00,524
You couldn't go on living out
someone else's dreams.

1361
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:10,102
I can't ever see him again.

1362
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:12,404
What'll I ever say to him?

1363
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:17,671
When you're ready to see him,
you'll know what to say.

1364
01:33:20,116 --> 01:33:22,584
What about baseball?

1365
01:33:22,619 --> 01:33:24,484
What'll I do?

1366
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:28,013
Well, that's up to you, Jimmy.

1367
01:33:28,058 --> 01:33:30,049
Do you want to be a ballplayer?

1368
01:33:30,093 --> 01:33:32,459
Huh?

1369
01:33:32,496 --> 01:33:36,398
Is that what you want,
to be a ballplayer?

1370
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:43,301
Yeah.

1371
01:33:45,175 --> 01:33:47,109
Yeah.

1372
01:33:47,143 --> 01:33:50,476
But I don't know if I can.
There's...

1373
01:33:50,514 --> 01:33:56,282
Everybody... knows about me.

1374
01:33:56,319 --> 01:33:58,844
Where I've been.

1375
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:05,451
He's right down there.

1376
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:13,761
You sure it's okay?

1377
01:34:18,942 --> 01:34:21,968
Jim wants to see you,
Mr. Piersall.

1378
01:34:22,012 --> 01:34:24,378
He asked for you.

1379
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:32,379
Mary.

1380
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,617
Hi, Dad.

1381
01:35:08,658 --> 01:35:10,853
Hello, son.

1382
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,257
You have a good trip up?

1383
01:35:15,298 --> 01:35:18,358
Fine, fine.

1384
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:21,768
How's the family?

1385
01:35:21,805 --> 01:35:25,366
Okay. Fine, fine.

1386
01:35:32,349 --> 01:35:35,716
I'm trying to get
back into shape.

1387
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:45,289
It's, uh, pretty tough.

1388
01:35:45,328 --> 01:35:48,092
Dr. Brown... Dr. Brown
comes out sometimes.

1389
01:35:48,131 --> 01:35:51,259
We throw it around a bit.

1390
01:35:51,301 --> 01:35:53,929
You think I'm out of shape,
you should see him.

1391
01:35:53,970 --> 01:35:57,337
Just stay well, Jim.

1392
01:36:05,315 --> 01:36:08,284
You know, I was
thinking, uh...

1393
01:36:08,318 --> 01:36:11,583
it might be good to take another
try at the Red Sox outfield.

1394
01:36:15,525 --> 01:36:17,618
Even if I don't make it.

1395
01:36:21,965 --> 01:36:23,899
I might not make it.

1396
01:37:08,798 --> 01:37:11,198
Opening day next spring

1397
01:37:11,234 --> 01:37:13,429
he wants to be
in Fenway Park.

1398
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:18,037
It won't be easy.

1399
01:37:59,315 --> 01:38:00,976
Good crowd out there.

1400
01:38:01,017 --> 01:38:04,145
Yeah.

1401
01:38:04,187 --> 01:38:06,178
Good luck, Jim.

1402
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,282
Jimmy.

1403
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,129
Hi!

1404
01:38:17,166 --> 01:38:18,656
Jimmy.

1405
01:38:20,203 --> 01:38:23,900
Oh, Jimmy,
don't go out there today.

1406
01:38:29,312 --> 01:38:31,439
Oh, you're scared.

1407
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:35,546
Yes.

1408
01:38:37,854 --> 01:38:40,846
Well, uh, I'm scared too.

1409
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:49,162
Oh, Mary, I love you.

1410
01:38:52,568 --> 01:38:55,059
You don't know
how much I love you.

1411
01:38:58,207 --> 01:39:03,668
Look, uh... I know it's not
going to be easy out there

1412
01:39:03,713 --> 01:39:06,079
but I... I want to.

1413
01:39:06,115 --> 01:39:08,310
I want to play.

1414
01:39:09,852 --> 01:39:13,083
So? Huh?

1415
01:39:25,034 --> 01:39:27,059
So go ahead.
