1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,509
Come on, great.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,500
Hang on, hang on...

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,500
What the hell are you doing?

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,499
You took the rubber off?

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,509
- Are you fucking crazy?
- I guess it slipped off.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,499
'Slipped off' my ass.
You think I'm a moron or what?

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,509
Sorry. Don't be silly,
I'll pay you extra.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,500
Fuck that.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,510
What the hell are you
looking at, asshole?

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,510
- You know him?
- Mind your own fucking business.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,520
Fucking hell.

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,500
What's up?

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,510
Ruined your gig, huh?

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,509
Does that upset you a lot?

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,630
I need to ask you something.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,620
When you were with Sikora...

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,510
Did he want any...

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,499
extras?

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,520
Like... When we fucked?

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,500
I told you he was rough.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,500
Maybe anal or something?

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,500
No.

23
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,520
Why?

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,499
You still don't remember what time
when he picked you up that day?

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,520
I already told you.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,499
Sometime in the afternoon.
It was getting dark.

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,510
First you said around three.
Now you're saying it was getting dark.

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,700
I just can't remember exactly.

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,510
It was after 5 p.m. when you called
that Rudi of yours to come get you.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,509
So it couldn't have been
getting dark, could it?

31
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,519
I was scared. I can't
remember any more.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,510
See you later.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,509
- That cop came to see me.
- What?

34
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,500
The cop!

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,499
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing, like we agreed.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,509
- That I don't remember.
- You keep your mouth shut, is that clear?

37
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,510
I'm not getting dragged in to anything
just because of some syphilitic shithead!

38
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,510
Is that clear?

39
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,520
Now fuck off.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,520
HBO Europe presents

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,500
WASTELAND

42
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,509
What do you mean by that?

43
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,500
They won't lock him up?

44
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,520
After all that?

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
So, they just let him go, right.

46
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,500
So he can roam around the village.

47
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,520
That's brilliant.

48
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,510
I guess they have no evidence
against him, do they?

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,510
Please! What more evidence do you want?

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,520
They found Misha at his cottage!
In the well!

51
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,500
And Hana?
How's she managing?

52
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,499
How do you think?

53
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Look, there's still going to be lots
of bullshit around the referendum.

54
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,509
You think she can handle it?

55
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,499
So you can finally be rid of her?

56
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,509
Fuck's sake, Jitka.
Her daughter just died!

57
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,499
We can't ask her to pop in
to sign some stupid papers.

58
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,519
Well then what?

59
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,510
You want to ask her to resign?

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,509
You really believe she'll keep at it?

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,500
If Karel is proven
to have killed Misha?

62
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,520
Well none of us know
anything yet, do we?

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,510
You told us yourself about what
he did at Lukas's party.

64
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,510
That he scares you.
He's a madman.

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,510
You know what, Pavel?
Go fuck yourself.

66
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,499
He should have been under
watch a long time ago.

67
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
If it were anyone else, Hana
would have seen to it herself.

68
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,630
But with this, we have to
walk on eggshells, don't we?

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,510
Hi there.

70
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,500
We're having a meeting
about the referendum.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,510
We didn't want to call you.

72
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,500
We thought...

73
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,510
We just didn't want to bother you.

74
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,500
Hi Hanka.

75
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,520
My condolences.

76
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,510
I want to bury Misha here, in Pustina.
I need permission.

77
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,510
You can't. Burials aren't allowed here.

78
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,499
You signed the ordinance yourself.

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,660
You can vote on an exception.

80
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,510
What exception? We can't.

81
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,500
- Until the referendum is over, we...
- I can't wait that long.

82
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,500
Hana...

83
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,510
The whole graveyard is probably
going to move soon.

84
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,510
Everyone in our family has been buried
there. I want Misha to be with them.

85
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,499
We can't do anything about that.

86
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,700
You can vote for an exception.

87
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,520
Hanka, for Christ's sake.
Pavel is right.

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,509
That whole graveyard is probably
going to move soon.

89
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,500
You have a child, too, don't you?

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,499
- This isn't fair, Hanka.
- No, it's not.

91
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
- Misha should be home right now.
- We didn't kill her.

92
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Did you never visit your
father at the cottage?

93
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,510
No.

94
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,510
What happened between you?

95
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,510
I was glad we didn't have to deal with him.

96
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,580
Is that so hard to believe?

97
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,510
Hello.

98
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Klara, would you leave us
alone for a while, please?

99
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,500
Thank you.

100
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,510
Do you have anything new?

101
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,510
We have a timeline. We know where
Misha was before her death and when.

102
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
She was still alive just before 4:30 p.m.,
since she phoned a girl from school.

103
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,509
The perpetrator had relatively little time
to commit the crime and hide the body.

104
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,500
It had to have been someone who knew
the cottage and environs very well.

105
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,499
Your husband doesn't have
an alibi for that time.

106
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
And we know he was
at the cottage that afternoon.

107
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,510
- But you let him go, didn't you?
- That was the court's decision.

108
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Ms Sikorova, how long has
your husband been ill?

109
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,500
About four years.

110
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,500
Did it crop up overnight, or...

111
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,500
did something happen?

112
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Ms Sikorova, it's very important
that you tell me everything, now.

113
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,660
We were on vacation in Spain.

114
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,499
One night we went down
for dinner in the hotel.

115
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,510
Karel stayed in the room,
finishing something.

116
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,510
We waited for him, but he didn't come.

117
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
So I sent Klara upstairs to get him.

118
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,499
She was away for a while, and then she came
back terrified, saying dad was standing

119
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
in the open window and wouldn't speak.

120
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,520
I ran upstairs.

121
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,500
He wouldn't respond to anything.
He just stood there looking down.

122
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,700
Then he began to speak.
His voice was totally different.

123
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
He said how beautiful it was down there,

124
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,510
with the lights on the sea.

125
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,510
I don't know how long
I talked him down for.

126
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,500
It was like...

127
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,510
He got down...

128
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,510
He said he was really tired
and needed to lie down.

129
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,510
He slept through the rest of the vacation.

130
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,499
When we got home, I convinced him
to see a doctor,

131
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,499
and they found out what
was wrong with him.

132
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,620
It was because of the illness
that he left the school?

133
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,630
Or was there something else?

134
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,510
No.

135
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
He didn't have any problems at the school?

136
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,499
No, no.

137
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
The principal wanted him to stay.
He'd been just fine until then.

138
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,500
He kept busy.

139
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Either he was at school or with us,
or working on his statues at the cottage.

140
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Your husband sees prostitutes.

141
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,500
You didn't know?

142
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Sees prostitutes... what does that mean?

143
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,500
He is very well known
at the local night clubs.

144
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,510
He's banned from some of them
for being aggressive towards the girls.

145
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,510
I'm telling you he's ill.

146
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,510
He can't control himself at times.

147
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,510
But someone killed Misha and hid her
so we couldn't find her!

148
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,020
Karel isn't able to think like that
when he's having an episode.

149
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,499
He's been lying to us the entire time.

150
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
He was even with a prostitute
on the day Misha disappeared.

151
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,510
Excuse me.

152
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,500
- Where are you going?
- Out for a cigarette.

153
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,510
Originally, the girl claimed

154
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,499
she was with him at the
time of Misha's death.

155
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
But now she's withdrawn her testimony.

156
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,509
She isn't even sure what time it was

157
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,500
when she got into his car by the border.

158
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,500
On the border?

159
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,499
- At the gas station? Aren't there
cameras there? -Yeah, well...

160
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,620
Unfortunately, they delete
the footage every two days.

161
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,520
Ms Sikorova, I'm sorry to have to ask...

162
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,520
Did your husband have any
peculiar sexual preferences?

163
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Did he ever want you
to do anything unusual?

164
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,499
No.

165
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
He never wanted anything of the sort?

166
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,500
Are you asking because of Misha?

167
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,620
What really happened to her?

168
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,700
Why don't you want to tell us?

169
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,510
We don't have the autopsy report yet.
I can't tell you anything for now.

170
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,500
That's all.

171
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,510
And tell Klara to come to the station
around four o'clock.

172
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,500
Thanks. Goodbye.

173
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,520
Klara.

174
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,510
What did he ask about before I got here?

175
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,520
About how dad treated us.

176
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,520
What did you tell him?

177
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,510
Why do you always take his side, mom?

178
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,660
You know best what he's like.

179
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,500
What's he like?

180
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,510
You know what he did
to you a few days ago.

181
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,520
That was nothing.

182
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,520
What do you mean nothing?

183
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,510
He was strangling you.

184
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,520
No one was strangling me.

185
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,740
You have no idea what happened.

186
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,510
- Lukas saw it, too.
- I don't care what he saw.

187
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,510
Your father did nothing wrong.

188
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,500
I was there when they pulled
Misha out from the well.

189
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,520
Someone hid her there
so we wouldn't find her.

190
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,510
It was planned.

191
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,500
Yes, your dad is ill.

192
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,500
But he would have never laid
a finger on you, do you get that?

193
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,500
I've known him for twenty years
I know what he's like.

194
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,510
He would never do this.

195
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,520
Never.

196
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,510
You've met Dr. Cikrtova already.

197
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,510
Take a seat.

198
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,500
- Hello, Klara.
- Hello.

199
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Thank you very much for coming.

200
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,509
If it were at all possible,
we'd leave the interview for later.

201
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,510
Unfortunately, we can't afford to wait.

202
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,500
Are you willing to answer a few questions?

203
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,509
Hana?

204
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,499
If you're looking for Karel
he's probably asleep in his car.

205
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
The police have sealed the whole place off.

206
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,510
Is there anything we can do for you?

207
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,510
No, thanks.

208
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,500
Rajner told me about the girl.
You lied to me the whole time.

209
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Were you with her when Misha died?

210
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,509
Do you hear?

211
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,500
When did you get back to the cottage?
What time was it?

212
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,510
You have to remember what time it was
when you picked up that girl!

213
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,519
Did you meet anyone there?
Did you speak to anyone?

214
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,510
Do you hear me?

215
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,660
You had bruises on your face.

216
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,510
Did someone beat you up?

217
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,520
What happened that day?

218
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
You have to remember. Was it
because of her? That girl?

219
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,550
She's told the police she doesn't
remember anything!

220
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,500
But I don't know.

221
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,520
I don't know if...

222
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I didn't do something bad to Misha.

223
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,509
Did your relationship with your dad
only get worse when he got sick?

224
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,500
Or did you not get along before that?

225
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,510
It was before that.

226
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,510
Did something happen between you?

227
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,510
We're just very different.

228
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,510
- Did you ever talk about it
with your sister? -No.

229
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,500
- You never talked about
your dad together? -No.

230
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,510
Why do you keep asking what he did
when he was alone with us?

231
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
You think he molested us?

232
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,520
Klara, we're just trying to get all
the information we can about your father

233
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,510
and his relationship with
you and your sister.

234
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,510
He had a totally normal
relationship with us.

235
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,620
He never did anything to us.

236
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,510
Your father left the high school just before
you began attending it. Is that right?

237
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,500
Yeah, so what?

238
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,520
Do you know why he left?

239
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,510
What really happened to my sister?

240
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,510
Was she raped?

241
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
This is all still a subject
of investigation.

242
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,500
Yeah but this you already know.

243
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,510
She's my sister.

244
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,500
What happened to her?

245
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,500
Your sister was sexually abused.

246
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,500
That's why we called you in.

247
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,499
And why we need to know everything
about your relations with your father.

248
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,540
Only you can help us here.

249
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,510
Stop here.

250
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,499
Wait here for me.

251
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,780
How long do you think you'll be?

252
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,519
Have you ever seen him here?

253
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,499
Yeah.

254
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,520
He was here a few times.

255
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,500
The police already asked us.

256
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,500
I don't know anything.

257
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,500
He's my husband.

258
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,510
Last Wednesday he picked up
one of the hookers here.

259
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,510
- I need to find her.
- I wasn't here.

260
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,510
- I had the night shift. -You know them,
don't you? You're here every day.

261
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,499
- You really think he did it?
- Who else? No one else was there.

262
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,499
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

263
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,499
Pump number three.
And some LM Lights, please.

264
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,510
Sure.

265
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,509
- But he wouldn't steal anything, would he?
- He did the same thing at the tool shop!

266
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,510
I'm telling you, he's a thief.

267
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,510
1,280, please.

268
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,500
Thanks.

269
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
- And your change. Bye.
- Bye.

270
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,660
I told Vasek not to hire him.

271
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,510
I have to talk to her.
Do you know which one it is?

272
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,510
Yeah.

273
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
The police asked us about her.

274
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,509
She's outside.

275
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,500
She was just here a moment ago.

276
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,510
Which one is she?

277
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,520
I don't know.

278
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,510
Under thirty,

279
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,620
she's here almost every day.

280
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,590
She has a kid, sometimes
she buys him something here.

281
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,510
Could you...

282
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,499
Could you point her out to me?

283
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,540
I can't leave the station.

284
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,500
She has this beige fur coat, waist length.

285
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,580
Brown hair about this long.

286
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,520
Slim.

287
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,500
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

288
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,500
Now where the fuck is she going?

289
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,499
Let's go, come on, take it and go.

290
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,510
You can go jerk off at the circus
for 400, you fucking idiot.

291
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,510
Wait.

292
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,510
Hey, wait.

293
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,500
Do you know who I am?

294
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,519
You were with my husband last Wednesday
at a cottage near Pustina.

295
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,509
They said he hurt you.

296
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,499
I already told the cops everything.

297
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,499
Are you taking revenge because he hurt you?
Is that why you changed your statement?

298
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,499
What revenge? I just don't remember
what time I was with him.

299
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,500
How long were you together?
An hour? Two?

300
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,509
That's what you're paid for, so you
must know how long you were together.

301
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,500
Did he drive you back here?
What time was it?

302
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,509
If I knew, I would've told the cops.
Leave me alone.

303
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,509
You have a child too, don't you?

304
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,509
Does social services know
how you make your living?

305
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,500
They may be interested to hear!

306
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,509
I'm the mayor, I know them there.
All it takes is one phone call.

307
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,500
Go to hell.

308
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,500
You lying whore!
Why are you lying?

309
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,500
Leave her alone, bitch.

310
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,499
Take it, hurry up.

311
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,510
Come on, fuck it.

312
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,500
What are you looking at?

313
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,520
So where to now?

314
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,510
You know how mom was
in Prague before Christmas?

315
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,510
Yeah.

316
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
I wanted to help her with
the Christmas cookies.

317
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,500
To get it done in time and all.

318
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,510
So I made gingerbread.

319
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,510
I decorated it.

320
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,510
I really went all out on it.

321
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,520
My sister wasn't at home.

322
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,510
I went to take a shower.

323
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
She came back in the meantime.

324
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,510
She was hungry.

325
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,510
So she started eating
the gingerbread cookies.

326
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,500
She ate almost half of them.

327
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,520
When I came back to the kitchen

328
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,500
and saw her

329
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,500
sitting there stuffing her face

330
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,519
with the gingerbread I'd
spent so much time on...

331
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,510
I just got so mad.

332
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,510
I wanted to say something

333
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,500
to really hurt her feelings.

334
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,500
So I told her

335
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
that I never liked her.

336
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,510
And that I prayed as a kid

337
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
that something would happen
to her, so I'd be rid of her.

338
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,510
And she acted like she didn't care.

339
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,500
But...

340
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
then I heard her crying in her room.

341
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,510
And I was glad.

342
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,520
I'm sure she knew
you didn't mean it like that.

343
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,520
Well, come in.

344
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,510
Do you even realize what
you were trying to do?

345
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,500
You tried to blackmail a witness.

346
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,499
- The girl was with Karel.
- Ms Sikorova!

347
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,510
You threatened to have
her kid taken away!

348
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,500
That you're the mayor
and you can arrange it.

349
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Honza, could you fuck off with that now?

350
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,510
Sorry.

351
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,509
What did she tell you?

352
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,510
Does she finally remember
when she was with him?

353
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,499
What's going to happen to Karel?

354
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,781
Why didn't you tell us the truth
about why he left school?

355
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,499
You're trying to cover up for
your husband, I understand.

356
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,020
And what else are you keeping from us?

357
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,519
Karel left school because of his illness.

358
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,500
There was nothing more to it.

359
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,510
You think this is going to help him?

360
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,510
Ms Sikorova,

361
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,510
you know perfectly well
what happened at that school.

362
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,500
Could you hold this, please?
Thanks.

363
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,500
It's not straight.

364
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,520
Like this?

365
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,520
Yeah.

366
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,510
- Thanks.
- Bye.

367
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,500
Shit.

368
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,500
Hanka?

369
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,510
I'm so sorry.

370
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,499
My condolences.

371
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,509
I need to know the name of the girl
Karel had the affair with

372
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,500
before he left the school.

373
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,500
What girl?

374
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,509
Milan, you know perfectly
well who I'm talking about.

375
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,500
You shared this office
with him for 15 years.

376
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,500
But I really don't know.

377
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,620
What's the name of the girl?

378
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,510
Where can I find her?

379
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,510
It's been four years, Hana.

380
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,520
Why do you want to know?

381
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,500
Because I didn't want
to know all that time.

382
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,500
Where do I find that girl?

383
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,510
Great!
Again!

384
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,510
Lovely.

385
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,510
Make a few rounds, girls.
Practice your crossover.

386
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,520
I'm Sikorova.

387
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,520
What do you want from me?

388
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Do you know what Karel is suspected of?

389
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,510
I know he had an affair with you.
Four years ago, at the high school.

390
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,519
This isn't about you.

391
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,509
I don't want anything from you,
and I won't tell anyone anything.

392
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,519
I just want to know what
happened to my daughter.

393
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
I don't know anything about that.

394
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,499
Misha was just a little younger than you.

395
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,519
I'm sorry about your daughter.
But I can't help you.

396
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
I've known about you the whole time.

397
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,509
What exactly happened between you?

398
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,509
His illness didn't start
just all of a sudden.

399
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,500
Illness, huh?

400
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Did he write you love poems?
Romantic letters?

401
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,510
I'm sure he did.
He's such a huge romantic.

402
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,499
But do you know what else he is?
Maybe you wouldn't expect it of him.

403
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Practical. Really practical.
He thinks of everything.

404
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,519
He knows that if he happens to
get a dumb16-year-old pregnant,

405
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
the whole thing will come out.
So you know what he tells her?

406
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,580
That it'll be better if he
sticks it up her backside.

407
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Because she should save her first time
for her boyfriend, which he is not.

408
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,510
I hope he rots in that prison.
He deserves it.

409
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,510
Now the spin, girls.

410
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,510
Wicked, man.

411
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,500
Turn the lights on.

412
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,500
Show your tits!

413
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,510
Can I touch?

414
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,500
Well go on, blow them out!

415
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,500
Oh shit...

416
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,510
- Hi.
- Hey. Man, what happened?

417
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,510
Take a guess.

418
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,509
Did you call anyone?

419
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,499
Yeah, Venca Pistek is
on his way with a tractor.

420
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,510
That's some boar.

421
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,510
Help me drag it off. I need to get by.

422
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,510
Here, hold it.

423
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,499
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

424
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,510
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

425
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,700
Don't blow it all on bullshit.

426
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,500
Sign this here.

427
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,510
Pay the rent, first.

428
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,590
And buy yourself some food.

429
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,520
Look, Tibor...

430
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,510
The offer still stands.

431
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,500
You can stay if you want.

432
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,499
You're two months away
from finishing your training.

433
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,510
I've studied enough.

434
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
You're going to throw away
three years of work?

435
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,520
Whatever.

436
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,500
Call him.

437
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,509
He's a buddy of mine.

438
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,500
He has a pub, on the way to Ostrov.

439
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,499
It's called "U Velblouda".

440
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,520
He's looking for a cook.

441
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,510
Thanks.

442
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,500
Good luck.

443
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,520
See you.

444
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,510
You here to say goodbye?

445
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:55,520
Well you know, we're going to miss you.

446
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,510
You can come visit me.

447
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,700
There's one more thing I want.

448
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,499
You know what, Pasek? We'll meet up
on the outside, and there we'll talk. Okay?

449
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,510
Well, Tibor?

450
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,510
You don't want to leave?

451
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
I know you didn't do anything.

452
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
You're a sorry piece of shit.

453
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,520
Your pot brimmed over.

454
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,520
Why are you here?

455
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,500
Ms Sikorova, does your
husband use any drugs?

456
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,510
- No. Why?
- We got the autopsy results.

457
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,510
There were traces of meth in Misha's body.

458
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,520
Rather large traces.

459
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,519
We can't tell if it was
the first time she took it

460
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,519
- or if she took it regularly.
- That's complete nonsense.

461
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,510
One more thing.

462
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,510
The coroner found something
else on your daughter's body.

463
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Specific biological samples.

464
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,520
What biological samples?

465
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,500
We assume they belong to the perpetrator.

466
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,500
We compared them to
your husband's DNA.

467
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,510
They don't match.

468
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
You may prepare your daughter's
body for the funeral now.

469
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,520
Goodbye.

470
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,510
Can't you play with something else?

471
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,500
- Whose apple is that?
- Mine.

472
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,509
- Well pick it up then.
- I don't eat apples.

473
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,510
- Pick it up.
- Fucking hell.

474
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,500
How much water should I take?
Is this enough?

475
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,509
- Have you never gone to the woods before?
- I don't know if there's a pub there.

476
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,510
What time are we getting back?

477
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,510
Hang on.

478
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

479
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,510
- Is something wrong?
- Come with me.

480
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,520
Open your mouth.

481
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,510
That's it.

482
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,510
You can go.

483
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,510
Come on.

484
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
This one was released yesterday?

485
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,509
Yes.

486
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,500
Tibor Balog.

487
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,500
He turned 18.

488
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,510
Vasek?

489
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,510
This one was on the run
when Sikorova disappeared.

490
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,499
Take his address,
we'll find him at his place.

491
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,510
Sure.

492
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,510
Long time no see, huh?

493
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Did the counselor tell you why we're here?

494
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,510
We're taking DNA samples from all the boys
who were out when Misha Sikorova was lost.

495
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,510
Sit down.

496
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,500
Open up.

497
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,510
That's it.

498
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,520
- Can I go?
- Yep.

499
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,500
I thought you cared about her.

500
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,510
But she meant nothing to you.

501
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,499
You were seeing her just so
you could get high together.

502
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,499
- What do you mean get high?
- Oh sorry...

503
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,510
You don't know anything
about drugs, right?

504
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,509
Misha didn't do any drugs.

505
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,499
I wish she didn't.

506
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,499
If she didn't, she might have
ended up differently that day.

507
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
But she had the bad luck
to come across you.

508
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,520
Bring the next one in.

509
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Now you want to cross it over
the narrow end with your forefinger...

510
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,510
twist it around, first the back side,
then the front one.

511
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:25,499
That makes a loop through which
we can pull the tie through...

512
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,510
What a smartass.

513
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,499
Now all we have to do is
to tighten it so we get

514
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,510
a small, firm, slightly
asymmetric knot.

515
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,500
That sucks.

516
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,500
I can never remember...

517
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,500
Would you tie it for me, bro?

518
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,510
The police were at the juvie today.

519
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,510
They took DNA from the boys who
were out when Misha went missing.

520
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,510
They said she was high when she got killed.

521
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,509
- Jesus, bro...
- I was looking into Pasek's face

522
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,500
when the cop told him.
He didn't know anything.

523
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,510
She didn't have that shit from him.

524
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,499
It wasn't from me either.

525
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,509
- You idiot.
- Cool it.

526
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,509
- What's going on?
- Calm down.

527
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,500
What is this?

528
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,500
Nothing.

529
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,500
Mom...

530
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,510
Lukas wants to tell you something.

531
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Lukas doesn't work at the car shop.

532
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,510
- He makes drugs. Meth.
- That's not true.

533
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,509
One of the boys from
juvie is in it with him.

534
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,510
I slapped the bastard around a bit
and now he's talking shit about me.

535
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,510
- And your money comes from where?
- What money?

536
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,499
Mom just had to give me
a loan, wake up man!

537
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,499
He has a lab in the city.
I can take you there.

538
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,520
- What are you out of your fucking mind?
- Stop it! Stop it!

539
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,510
Mom, the police were at the juvie today.

540
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,509
Misha Sikorova was high when she died.

541
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,510
I don't know anything about her, man!

542
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,509
Go now, they're waiting for you.

543
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,510
- Mom, this is all bullshit.
- I said, go. Get out.

544
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,510
Lukas makes drugs?

545
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,510
Is he taking them too?

546
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,500
I don't know.

547
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,510
Who all knows about this?

548
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,500
I don't know.

549
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,500
I hope you're not planning
on telling someone.

550
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,520
- Mom, do you understand...
- Look, Adam...

551
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,500
either you come with us now
and say goodbye to Misha,

552
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,510
or go

553
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
and rat your own brother
out to the police.

554
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,509
But in that case,

555
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,500
don't plan on setting foot
in this house ever again.

556
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,500
Understood?

557
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,520
- You got it?
- Yeah.

558
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,499
- How much is that one?
- 350 for the big one.

559
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,500
- And the smaller one?
- That's for 180.

560
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,500
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

561
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

562
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:03,510
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

563
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,520
- That's fine, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's enough.

564
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,510
What a rip-off here.

565
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,510
Did you know Misha personally?

566
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,499
Well, we're in the same year together.

567
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,520
She... was really nice.

568
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,520
She would do anything for other people.

569
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,520
She always helped out, we all liked her.

570
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,509
When did you last see her?

571
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,510
Right before she disappeared.

572
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,500
She was at school as usual,
we talked and everything.

573
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,660
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

574
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,520
Excuse me.
Move.

575
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,500
Turn it off.

576
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,520
Play this.

577
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,510
Play it.

578
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
- I'm telling you, play it.
- What is this?

579
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,499
This is what Misha listened to.

580
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
Not some stupid Beethoven.

581
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,510
- It's Mozart.
- Play it, then.

582
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,510
Go away, Karel.
I don't want you here.

583
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,510
I don't want to see you.

584
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,500
Hana?
Is everything alright?

585
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,510
Did you hear me? Get out.

586
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,500
- Karel!
- Don't touch me.

587
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,500
Hanka doesn't want you here.

588
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,520
- Stay the fuck out of this.
- OK, I told you, come on.

589
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,510
Lojza!

590
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,510
Don't you dare come back in.

591
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,509
Go away, Karel.

592
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,500
Leave us alone at last.

593
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,520
I spoke with that Kristyna of yours.

594
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,499
I always wanted to believe
that it wasn't your fault,

595
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,510
that it wasn't you, just the illness.

596
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,500
But that was foolish.

597
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,500
This is you.

598
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
It's been you the whole time.

599
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,520
Just leave us be.

600
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,500
Get out of our lives. Stop hurting us.

601
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

602
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,510
I'll go first.

603
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
- Your ID.
- Right...

604
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,509
NO / YES

605
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,510
YES

606
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:16,510
Is it so hard for them
just to say goodbye?

607
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

608
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:34,510
Lukas, under Section 76 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, you're under arrest.

609
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,510
This is warrant from the state prosecutor.
Please, come with us.

610
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,509
What?

611
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,499
- Why? What's happened?
- We'll tell you at the station. Let's go.

612
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,510
Wait, what did I do?
