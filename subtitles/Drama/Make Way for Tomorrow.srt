1
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,142
(Chuckles) Well !

2
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,519
Gee, it's good to see you !

3
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,606
Hey, you'll catch your death of cold.
Go on, get in there.

4
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,693
- Gosh, you're looking well, Ma.
- Oh, so are you, George.

5
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,195
Well, I got a little cold, but I'm all right.

6
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,490
I think you look better
than you did five or six months ago.

7
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,617
You looked a little peaked then,
I thought.

8
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:45,164
- I see the others got here before me.
- Yes. Your pa's waitin' for you, though.

9
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,834
What do you mean, Ma?
Say, what is this gathering of the clan?

10
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,670
- Well, I'd rather Pa told you.
- Hm-hm.

11
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,465
- How's Anita and the baby?
- Oh, they're just fine.

12
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,969
Only Rhoda isn't a baby any more.
She's thinking of going to college.

13
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,763
Oh ! Oh, Pa, here's George.

14
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,643
Well, there's a familiar sight,
Pa in the same old chair.

15
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,771
- Hello, George.
- Don't get up, don't get up.

16
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,024
Gee, it's good to see you, Pa.

17
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,318
Gosh, I haven't seen you since...

18
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:19,281
Well, it's been too long, anyway.
I don't know. We plan, we plan...

19
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,451
- Hello, Nellie.
- Hello, George.

20
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,746
As for you, you know,
I don't know when I saw you last.

21
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,707
Oh, I forgot. I can't kiss you, Cora.

22
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,502
I got a nasty little cold.
I shouldn't have kissed you either.

- Here you are, Mother.
- No, dear.

37
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,757
That don't go
with standing over a hot stove.

38
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,218
OK, it'll just be two for me.
How about you, George?

39
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,136
You're still the best-looking one
in the family, Robert.

40
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,556
Yeah? The day I was born,
Pop took one look at me and said,

41
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,018
- "That did it. No more Coopers!"

00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,313
Cora?

00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,649
Here you are, Nellie.

00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,361
- (Gasps)
- Oh ! I got somethin' on you, Nellie.

45
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,405
- Here ya are, Pa.
- Thanks.

46
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,992
Try that on your ulcer.
Wait a minute, now. Nobody drink.

47
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,328
I always make it a point
to drink to somethin'.

48
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,497
Let's see. Now, let me think.

49
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,709
(Chuckles) Don't think too hard, Robert.
You might hurt yourself.

50
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,295
- Oh...
- (Laughs) Why, Pa !

51
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,423
Let's see now, uh...

52
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,009
Here's to our house,

53
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:08,724
through sunshine or showers,
be it ever so humble, by golly, it's ours.

54
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,852
- (Chuckling) Good, huh, Pop?
- (Cora) Yeah.

55
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,440
Ah, it's all right.
Only the last line don't make sense.

56
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,442
- Does it, Ma?
- No.

57
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,445
- You see, the house...
- Don't tell 'em now, Bark.

58
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,822
- Wait till after dinner.
- What is it?

59
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,576
Why not now?
That's why we got 'em down here.

60
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,579
You see, the house isn't ours any more.

61
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,082
- The bank is taking it over.
- The bank?

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,918
- You mean you've lost it?
- Oh, that's awful !

63
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:42,549
- Bank? Well, there's a bank for you !
- What happened, Father?

64
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:47,512
Well, as you know,
I haven't been working for, uh...

65
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,807
Well, it's almost four years now.

66
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,312
- That's right, ain't it, Ma? Four years?
- Four years, 5th June, Pa.

67
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,649
And with everything going out
and nothing coming in,

68
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,111
I couldn't keep up the payments.

69
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:09,159
So long as I never sent them anything,
they sent for me.

70
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,496
The head of the bank, Randy Dunlap,

71
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,582
asked me to drop in to his house
for a little chat.

72
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,877
You remember him? Randy Dunlap?

73
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,589
He used to keep company with your mother
before I cut him out.

74
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,466
Bark!

75
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:29,471
So, I dropped in
and he asked me to sit down.

76
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,598
(Chuckling)

77
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,977
George, do you know what he was wearing?
A kimono.

78
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,729
- No!
- Yeah.

79
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,233
Oh, now, Bark.
It must have been a dressing gown.

80
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,820
I know a dressing gown when I see it.

81
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,072
It was a kimono, George.

82
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,493
Well, he asked me to sit down.
Then he offered me a cigar.

83
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:59,167
- Do dressing gowns have...flowers on 'em?
- Oh, Bark!

84
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,633
- Never mind that, Father. What did he say?
- Oh, he was nice enough.

85
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,723
He put his arm around me and he said,
"Bark, I hate to have to do this to you."

86
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:20,355
But deep down in his heart,
I think he was saying, "Goody."

87
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:25,444
Oh, now, Bark. He did say that
we could take our time about moving out.

88
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,112
(Bark) Yeah, he did.

89
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:31,616
- How much time did he give you, Father?
- Six months.

90
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,787
Oh ! Oh, well, then,
there's no immediate rush.

91
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,832
When are the six months up?

92
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,626
Tuesday.

93
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:45,130
But...but why didn't you tell us sooner?

94
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:50,135
Well, your father and I were hoping
that something would turn up

95
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,472
and we wouldn't have to tell you at all.

96
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,058
Tuesday. Doesn't give us much time, does it?

97
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:03,315
Well, this house has been too big
for your mother to take care of anyway.

98
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,109
Yeah, Father, but what I mean is,

99
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,070
if we'd known sooner,
we could have all chipped in

100
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,616
and found you a little place somewhere.

101
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:17,579
(Chuckles) Or...I know Nellie will tell you
Harvey's business never was worse.

102
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,332
That's right. You'd be surprised
if you knew how bad things are.

103
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,211
Oh, sure. Who gave you that dress,
the Salvation Army?

104
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,921
(Chuckling)

105
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,507
And Cora will tell you
that if Bill doesn't get a job soon,

106
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,550
she'll have to go to work herself.

107
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,345
And, uh... Yeah.

108
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,472
Well, I can't do it alone.

109
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:40,060
And there's no point in writing to Addie,
way out there in California.

110
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,646
No, she's never even sent us an orange.

111
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,024
And in as much as Anita and I
are planning to send Rhoda to college,

112
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,567
now, the only thing I can suggest

113
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,779
is that you come to live with one of us
until we get ourselves straightened out.

114
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,281
No, your father and I
were talking about that, and we...

115
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,242
I know what you're thinking about, Mother,

116
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,536
but you're more than welcome
with any one of us.

117
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,872
Now, Nellie, after all,
there's only you and Harvey.

118
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,958
Yes, but what about Harvey?

119
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:07,128
- Oh, we wouldn't want to ask Harvey.
- Oh, no, we wouldn't ask Harvey.

120
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,966
No, we asked Harvey to marry Nellie. We
can't expect the guy to do more than that.

121
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,843
Father, will you make him
stop talking like that?

122
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,388
Robert, stop talking that way.

123
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,098
Cut it out, Robert.

124
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,060
I haven't room for both of you. There's
only a small couch in the living room.

125
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,605
Mother, there's an extra bed in
Rhoda's room, and she'd love to have you.

126
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,734
If Father doesn't mind going to Cora's for a
while, why don't you come on a visit to us?

127
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,073
Well, that's awfully nice of you, George,
but, well, your father and I thought

128
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,160
that no matter what happened,
we'd always be t...

129
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,706
Oh, well, never mind what we thought.

130
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,419
Nellie, can't you and Harvey...

131
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,922
Yes, I can.
I plan to do more than you and Cora.

132
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:55,051
I can practically promise that within
three months they'll be together again.

133
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,721
Of course,
I'll have to speak to Harvey about it.

134
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,432
(Chuckling)
Will you put that in writing, Nellie?

135
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,809
Well, that's more like it.

136
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,645
Well, I...I guess everything's settled.

137
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:11,860
Mother comes for a visit to us
and Father goes to Cora's for a while, hm?

138
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,195
Well, Bark?

139
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,283
- Maybe it'll work out all right.
- Sure.

140
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,579
It'll be very nice
living with the children for a while.

141
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,955
Of course.

142
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,958
- Yeah, except...
- Except what?

143
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:31,129
Except it never has worked out
for anybody else.

144
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:35,925
- Father, there's nothing to worry about.
- Now, Bark, you ought not to say that.

145
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,228
Well?

146
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,980
- (Chuckling)
- And what are you up to?

147
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,901
I just had a feeling that
Grandpa's picture really belonged in here.

148
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,277
Oh, you did?

149
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,907
Yesterday it was this old, ancient antique,
and today it's Grandpa's picture.

150
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,203
Oh, I've got Grandma in my room,
and that's enough.

151
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:49,666
I know how you love your own room, honey.
It's tough on all of us.

152
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,753
- Even Grandma, you know.
- (Creaking)

153
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,216
But it'll only be for three months,
and then Aunt Nellie will take her.

154
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,344
Well, OK.

155
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,514
I'll have Mamie take these things
back to my room.

156
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,267
Oh, bridge class tonight?

157
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,936
Mob of them.

158
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,899
By the way, I haven't seen any
of your friends lately. What's the matter?

159
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,112
Grandma. She talks an arm
off everyone I bring around.

160
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,323
I know. I've had a taste of it.

161
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,951
But you must bring your friends home.

162
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,371
I won't have you going out
with boys I've never met.

163
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,833
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello, George.

164
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,128
- Hello, Daddy!
- Dear.

165
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,631
Oh, you're gonna put Pa's picture in here!

166
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,842
That's fine. Mm.

167
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,556
Darling.

168
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,437
Oh, say, what about Mother tonight,
with this bridge and everything?

169
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,106
She's going to be in the way, isn't she?

170
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,402
Wait.

171
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,121
(Whispers) Is she asleep?

172
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,046
Hope I don't get Harvey.

173
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,090
Oh, hello, Harvey. Hiya, boy.

174
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,097
Put Nellie on, will you, Harvey?

175
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,392
Nellie.

176
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,520
It's George.

177
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,400
Hello, George.

178
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,862
Oh, hello, Nellie. I...

179
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:47,492
Nellie, Anita's having
her bridge class tonight.

180
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,663
And I know Mother's going to be
bored to distraction. I thought...

181
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,960
Oh, I...I'm so sorry, but Harvey's bought
some theatre tickets for tonight.

182
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,586
Well, you know how it is.

183
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,339
We have to entertain
the people he does business with,

184
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,967
and I guess that's what it is tonight.

185
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,512
Oh, no, no, George,
I couldn't possibly take Mother tonight.

186
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,889
- Tell him you can't take her any time.
- Shh !

187
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,142
What's the use of stalling?
I'm not going to have your parents here.

188
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,270
- George, I would if I could.
- But you can't.

189
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,230
- Will you shut up?
- You'll have to tell him sooner or later.

190
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,441
- What, George? Just a minute, George.
- I married you. I didn't marry your folks.

191
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,569
I didn't ask my mother to live here, did I?

192
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,030
- (Voice cracks) Did I?
- What, George?

193
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,784
- Oh, George, I am willing to do my part.
- No roof is big enough for two families.

194
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,412
No, George, no,
I couldn't possibly take Mother tonight.

195
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,706
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

196
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,087
Satisfied? Incidentally,
who are we going out with tonight?

197
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,548
My mother. But that's different. I...

198
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,720
(Sighs) Hm. I was so afraid
it was someone I didn't like.

199
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,681
Mother just won't fit in at all, will she?

200
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,604
You don't suppose
she'd stay in her room, do you?

201
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,523
- (Creaking)
- No.

202
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,151
I don't see how we could...

203
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,656
(George) Oh, hello, Mother. It's Mother.

204
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,368
George, I never heard
such nonsense in all my life,

205
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:16,581
trying to get Nellie to take me,
and talk of me staying in my room.

206
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:21,377
- It's only because you'd be bored.
- (Snorts) Well, don't you worry about me.

207
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,756
Folks'd think it was pretty funny
if I wasn't around.

208
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,133
- They'd think you were ashamed of me.
- Ho-ho.

209
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,387
George was only trying
to be kind to you, dear.

210
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,557
My bridge pupils drive him mad.

211
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:40,021
(Mother) I guess you won't ever
have to explain George to his mother.

212
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh, Pa's picture. You gonna put it in here?

213
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,694
Aw, that's fine.

214
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:53,076
Another day has gone by and no word
from him. Do you suppose he's all right?

215
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,538
Of course he's all right.
We'd hear fast enough if he were ill.

216
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,749
Well, I guess that's true.

217
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,503
Is, uh...my tuxedo laid out?

218
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,631
- Yes. I couldn't find your shirt.
- Did you send it to the laundry?

219
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,591
- No.
- I did.

220
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,177
- But, Mother...
- I took it to the laundry around the corner.

221
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:16,724
They've got a sign in the window, "Bring
your own bundle and save 20 per cent."

222
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,142
- Yes, but we...
- Besides, George,

223
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:22,188
your shirts haven't looked
as crisp and fresh as they should.

224
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,899
These people do lovely work.

225
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,611
Yes, except that
I won't have a shirt for tonight.

226
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,156
- Well, I didn't know that.
- Now look here, Mother C.

227
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,867
- I know you like to look after George.
- Yes.

228
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,537
- Well, so do I.
- Of course.

229
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,750
And though I don't do much talking about it,
I like to run my house too.

230
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,545
- Oh, well, I only wanted to help.
- Of course.

231
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,131
And you're so busy playing bridge...

232
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,592
I don't play bridge, I teach bridge.

233
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:57,056
There's a difference that you'd notice if
you had to meet the bills of this apartment.

234
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,894
Well, it's all very simple.
I'll just run out and buy another shirt.

235
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,813
Mm-hm.

236
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,945
Oh, well.

237
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,948
I guess I'm not much help around here.

238
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,950
Oh, Mother C!

239
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,162
(Sighs)

240
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,677
- I could make the sandwiches, couldn't I?
- They're coming from the delicatessen.

241
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,972
- It's cheaper to make 'em at home.
- I know.

242
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:42,226
But we couldn't do so well.
These are going to be fancy.

243
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,355
How fancy can a sandwich be?

244
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,899
You'll see.

245
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,904
Any bid made subsequently
to an opponent's bid

246
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,116
is known as an overcall or a defensive bid.

247
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:02,497
An overcall may be made with
a much weaker hand than an original bid,

248
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,542
a fact which the partner must bear in mind.

249
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:12,882
As a rule, it is inadvisable to make
an overcall on two of a four-card suit...

250
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,804
- (Sighs)
- (Rocker creaks)

251
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,233
...or to overcall with a no-trump bid

252
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,904
without a double-stopper in the suit
bid by the opponent.

253
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,703
It requires more strength...

254
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,377
I know you'll forgive me
if I interrupt myself for a moment,

255
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,298
but I do so want you all
to meet my husband's mother.

256
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,051
(Others) How do you do?

257
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,267
Well, um...anyway...

258
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,436
suppose we, um...play the hands?

259
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,732
Uh...suppose we play them.

260
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,319
- I'll bid one spade.
- One spade.

261
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,947
- One spade.
- Two hearts.

262
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,158
(Guests chattering)

263
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,462
(Rocker creaking)

264
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,775
(Creaking continues)

265
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,239
(Creaking stops)

266
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,662
(Creaks)

267
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,333
She didn't show up, so I'm playing this.
Three spades.

268
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,293
Do you play cards?

269
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,005
- (Rocker creaks)
- Well, it's, uh...it's funny,

270
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:20,259
but, you know, with a teacher
right here in the family,

271
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,929
I don't believe
I could ever learn to play bridge.

272
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,473
(Others chuckle)

273
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,685
Well, maybe a little hearts.
I used to play a lot with my husband.

274
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:34,023
I always gave him the Queen of Spades.
We called her Dirty Dora.

275
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,025
(Laughter)

276
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,737
Say, by the way, that's a good heart hand.

277
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,823
(Laughs) And you haven't got Dora.
Let's see who has.

278
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,034
(Laughing) Oh ! You !

279
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,667
Honey, you're going to the movies
alone tonight, aren't you?

280
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,794
- Well, aren't you?
- Uh-huh.

281
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,170
If you love me,

282
00:20:56,296 --> 00:21:00,174
if I've ever done anything for you
that you appreciated even a little bit,

283
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,551
for heaven's sake,
take your grandmother with you.

284
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:07,932
Oh, that's no fair. And anyway,
she likes the company here.

285
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,892
Well, maybe I can fix that.

286
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,605
(Door opens and closes)

287
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,863
Mother C, Rhoda's set on going
to the pictures tonight.

288
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,824
Do you think it's all right
if she goes alone?

289
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,285
- Oh, I should say not.
- That's what I thought.

290
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,414
Would you go with her? Or would that
be too much of a responsibility?

291
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,792
Why, anything I can do to help you,
dear, I'll be glad.

292
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,461
What a load off my mind !
Will you tell Rhoda?

293
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,006
- Why, certainly.
- Thank you, dear.

294
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,477
(Upbeat orchestral music)

295
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,470
(No audible dialogue)

296
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,541
(Dramatic orchestral music)

297
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,463
Can you give me a rough idea
of what the picture's about?

298
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:08,803
Yeah. It's the old gag about the guy that
takes the blame for a job his pal done.

299
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,139
The pal's a rat
and lets the nice guy go to the pen.

300
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:17,186
But when he's dyin', the rat confesses
and the boy and girl wind up...

301
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:21,524
- Well, is it sad in any place?
- Some of 'em cry when his dog dies.

302
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,944
- Thanks!
- There's a newsreel and "Betty Boop".

303
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,739
(Chuckles) Oh. There you are.

304
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,203
- It was a good show, wasn't it?
- Yes.

305
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:38,707
I liked the boy very much. Didn't you?

306
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:45,339
Why, I don't know. I only caught a swift
glimpse of him as you got out of his car.

307
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,133
As I got...

308
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,635
Oh. You saw me.

309
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,470
Mm.

310
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,556
Are you gonna tell?

311
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,019
Are you gonna do it again?

312
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,897
Uh-uh. Are you gonna tell?

313
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,695
No.

314
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,408
(Chattering)

315
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,875
- Oh, here's your mother.
- Oh ! Hello, Mother.

316
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,501
- Hello.
- Like the picture?

317
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,880
- Oh, it was fine.
- Uh-huh.

318
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:30,384
A little sad in places,
but it had a happy ending.

319
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,346
Uh, a young man was taking the blame
for his friend,

320
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,932
who wasn't a very strong character.

321
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,978
But the girl believed in the young man.
The nice young man, I mean.

322
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,274
And you know,
no matter how black things looked...

323
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,734
(Chuckles)

324
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,071
I guess I shouldn't be telling you this,
'cause it might spoil the picture for you.

325
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,615
(Others chuckling)

326
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,953
Oh, I guess I should go to bed.
It must be after 11.

327
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,123
- What time do you got?
- Why, I have only 10.30.

328
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,834
Oh. Well, then, I can stay a little while.

329
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,173
(Phone rings)

330
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,467
(Anita) Excuse me, please.

331
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,764
Hello.

332
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,391
Oh, hello, Father C. Just a minute.

333
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,978
I forgot. He called while you were out.

334
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,695
(Loud) Hello? Is that you, Bark?

335
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,198
This is Lucy, Bark!

336
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,701
How are ya? I say, how are ya?

337
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:42,039
Well, I was worried about you.
Why didn't you write?

338
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,500
You ought to write. You know I worry.

339
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,088
Oh, I'm fine.

340
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,800
I got some friends in tonight, playing cards.

341
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,094
Oh, some lovely people, Bark.

342
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,722
How's Cora?

343
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,683
How are the children?

344
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,143
Really? Well, how's Bill?

345
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,731
Well, how are you, Bark?
You know what I mean.

346
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,650
How is everything?

347
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,070
Oh, of course, of course.

348
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,739
But three months isn't so long, Bark.

349
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,578
Bark, it's getting cool now.
Don't go out without your coat.

350
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,247
And if it rains, don't go out at all.

351
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,751
Oh, I'm...I'm happy as a lark.

352
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:32,339
Course, I...I miss you, Bark.
That's the only trouble.

353
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,384
I know you do.

354
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:41,348
Uh...don't forget what I told ya.
We'll soon be together for always.

355
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,479
And you won't worry, will ya?
And please take care of yourself.

356
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,610
Uh...it's been good
to hear your voice, Bark.

357
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,739
Must have cost you a lot to call me.

358
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,118
Well, that's...

359
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,621
that's a lot.

360
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,374
You could have bought yourself a...
a good, warm scarf for that.

361
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,714
All right, Bark.

362
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,509
Goodbye, Bark.

363
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,889
Goodbye...

364
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,974
my dear.

365
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:39,573
I guess I'll go to bed,
if you'll all excuse me.

366
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,242
I'm tired.

367
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,911
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

368
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,038
Good night, Mother.

369
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,840
- Sorry. Very sorry, Mrs Carr.
- (Shop bell)

370
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,926
Ah, how are you today, Mr Cooper?

371
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,053
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- (Shop bell)

372
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,890
And then when you order the paper
by the week, Mrs Carr,

373
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,852
I save it for you no matter
how many people are asking for it,

374
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,854
and that way there are
no disappointments.

375
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,399
All right. Shall I pay weekly or monthly?

376
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:18,779
Well, if you are honest by the week,
I guess you can be honest by the month too.

377
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,699
- So we'll make it by the week.
- All right.

378
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,708
- (Shop bell)
- (Door closes)

379
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,335
Saved the paper for you,
all right, Mr Cooper.

380
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,463
Yeah? Well, I can't read it.
I broke my glasses again.

381
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,758
(Chuckles) Oh !
What did Cora say this time?

382
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:44,847
You should have heard her. Or maybe
you did. She hollered loud enough.

383
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:50,644
(Chuckles) And you say it is nice
to live with your children, huh?

384
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,106
Well, yes, it is, Mr Rubens, in a way.

385
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,902
I hope I didn't give you the wrong
impression about Cora. She's a fine girl.

386
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,115
I guess I'm pretty bothersome
to have around.

387
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,826
- Ah.
- (Shop bell)

388
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,788
- Well, what do you want?
- I want a stick of gum.

389
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,124
(Rubens) Take it from the counter.

390
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:20,716
All in all, my children are pretty fine
and I'm proud of 'em.

391
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm proud of mine too.

392
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,053
They leave me alone.

393
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,140
They don't need me, and I don't need them.

394
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,559
I got enough to live from my store,

395
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,396
and I got my Sarah,
and I make a little music with my violin.

396
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,274
That's all I want from life, and I got it.

397
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,279
Well, my life is just the same as yours,

398
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:48,160
except I don't have a store,

399
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,371
my wife is 300 miles away,

400
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:55,042
and I...I can't play the violin.

401
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,002
(Laughing)

402
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,130
Hey, hey, hey.

403
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,344
- Ha-ha-ha-ha !
- Heh-heh-heh !

404
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,638
Go on, go on.

405
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,306
- You know...
- (Shop bell)

406
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:14,311
...I sometimes think that children
should never grow past the age

407
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,606
when you have to tuck 'em into bed
every night.

408
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,900
That's right.

409
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:24,071
When they get older and you can't
give them as much as other children,

410
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,406
they're ashamed of you.

411
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:31,578
And when you give them everything
and put them through college

412
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,040
- they're ashamed of you.
- Yeah.

413
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,628
I guess the world is filled with
what you call schmi...schmills...

414
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,047
- Schlemiels!
- (Both laugh)

415
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,176
- And somebody has to raise 'em.
- (Laughs)

416
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,345
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

417
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,180
(Shop bell)

418
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,518
What do you want?

419
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,354
Have you "Sincere Confessions"
for November?

420
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,857
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah.

421
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,363
Thank you.

422
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:11,326
Are you gonna be nice to your mother
when you grow up?

423
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,623
- Jimmy, why don't you answer the man?
- What do I say?

424
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,500
- Oh !
- (Chuckling)

425
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,336
You say yes, of course!

426
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,380
- (Door closes)
- (Shop bell)

427
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:29,344
I'll miss our talks when you go away,
Mr Cooper, but I'll be glad for you.

428
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,600
- You'll be with your wife again.
- Thanks. And I'll be with her soon.

429
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,478
Maybe you could be sooner with her,
and right in this town.

430
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,855
Huh?

431
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,816
There's a lawyer, Mr Hunter, from New York.

432
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,444
He just bought the Harrison farm,

433
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,615
and he'll need caretakers,
a man and his wife.

434
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,910
- Caretakers?
- I hear about things, you know.

435
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,288
Oh, I wouldn't want to ask
my wife to do that.

436
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,207
Anyway, my children would have a fit.

437
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,877
So let them have a fit.

438
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:06,340
You and your wife would be together
and you would earn your own living again.

439
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,970
It's nice of you to suggest it,
but you understand, don't you?

440
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,389
What difference does it make?

441
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,143
Maybe it would be a home
for the rest of your life.

442
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,565
But, say, everybody's got to do
what they think is best.

443
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,402
Mr Rubens, I, uh...
I wonder if you'd do me a favour.

444
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,488
Sure. Why not?

445
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,698
Uh...it's from my wife.

446
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,577
I... Would you read it to me,
on account of my...

447
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,788
(Chuckling) Is that a favour, Mr Cooper?

448
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,543
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

449
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,130
"Thursday night.

450
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,634
"Dear Bark, I've been thinking of you all day

451
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,762
"and have wanted to talk to you
worse than ever before."

452
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,639
(Bark chuckles)

453
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:59,059
"They say that you don't miss people
so much after a while,

454
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:04,356
"but I think I miss you more than I did
at the beginning of our separation.

455
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:09,945
"Do you realise that when you get this letter
it will be George's 46th birthday?

456
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,864
"It seems like yesterday he was born.

457
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,284
"We were so happy then
that it hurts to remember it.

458
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,998
"I hate to give in and sound so weak,

459
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,459
"but you understand me
and won't think less of me,

460
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,837
"and this is just between us two."

461
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,716
Yeah.

462
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:36,430
"Harvey and Nellie know a woman who
is in the home for the aged women here.

463
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,766
"They thought it would be
nice for me to know her,

464
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,853
"so that I would have
someone my own age to talk to.

465
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,147
"So Nellie took me there to meet her.

466
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:50,235
"Oh, Bark, that home for the aged
is so dreary and dismal.

467
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,739
"It was all I could do not to ask
Mrs Timmons how she stood it.

468
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,325
"Nellie kept saying how lovely the place was.

469
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:03,373
"I thought she said it to cheer Mrs Timmons up,
but she kept saying it after we left,

470
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,836
"so I guess she really thought it was nice."

471
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,842
I guess those places must be terrible.

472
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,762
Go ahead.

473
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,434
(Sighs)

474
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,021
"Poor Nellie.
She hasn't been herself at all lately.

475
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,567
"Her doctor wants her to have
a complete change. Nellie said Europe.

476
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,863
"She's very worried,
not about herself, but...

477
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,867
"but because that would mean
she couldn't take us like she promised.

478
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,370
"But I told Nellie her health comes first.

479
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,414
"Oh, Bark dear,

480
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,795
"if only something would turn up
so that we could be together.

481
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,838
"I love you so that..."

482
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,976
Maybe you'd better wait
until you have your glasses fixed.

(Sniffs)

485
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,895
Mama.

486
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,907
Sarah !

487
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,118
So, what do you want?

488
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,581
I just wanted to look at you, Mama.

489
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,499
To look at me?

490
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,711
With all the work to be done,
you just wanted to look at me?

491
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,173
Yes, Mama.

492
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,884
I wanted to make sure you were here.

493
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,272
I...I broke my glasses this morning.

494
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:36,985
Would you mind telling me if there's
any bookkeepers wanted there?

495
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,073
No. Why? Were you a bookkeeper?

496
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,117
I am a bookkeeper.

497
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,254
Well, you see, before she come here,

498
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,841
when you all went out at night,
I always had the nights off.

499
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,429
But, uh...well, all I mean is,

500
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:09,100
if this keeps up,
I may have to seek other employment.

501
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,439
Mamie,
Mrs Cooper doesn't stay up very late.

502
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,736
Wait until she gets to sleep, and then
you can have the night off. All right?

503
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:23,031
All right with me. But she ain't sleepy.

504
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,916
Oh, you're all ready to go.
My, you both look awful nice!

505
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,752
- Thank you, Mother C. You'll be all right?
- Of course.

506
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,671
- Well, good night, Mother.
- Good night.

507
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,631
Sure you'll be all right?
Rhoda's going out too.

508
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:45,720
This isn't the first time you've left me
alone. Go ahead. Don't worry about me.

509
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,764
But you'll be busy with your rug, won't you?

510
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,685
Well, no, my head started to ache
a little while ago...

511
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,229
- (Rocker creaking)
- ...and I think I'll stop.

512
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,899
I'll find something to do.
There's always the radio.

513
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:02,320
Oh, no, it isn't working, is it?
Well, I'd forgotten. No matter.

514
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:06,741
You go ahead and enjoy yourselves.
Don't you even think about me.

515
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,705
- Well, good night, Mother.
- Good night, dear.

516
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,040
There's bicarbonate in the house,
isn't there?

517
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:18,962
I feel just a mite as though
I'd have a little dyspepsia tonight.

518
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,509
I know how you feel.

519
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,512
Yes, dear, there's bicarbonate
in the medicine chest.

520
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:32,225
- Well, just so I know, in case it gets bad.
- Well, maybe we'd better stay.

521
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,227
Oh, no!

522
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,439
You go right ahead and enjoy yourselves.

523
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,983
- (Rocker creaking)
- We will.

524
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,112
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

525
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,701
Maybe if you take a little walk, huh?

526
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,871
Can't, on account of my arches.

527
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,832
- (Rocker creaking)
- Oh. Good night, Mother.

528
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,917
Good night.

529
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,097
Mamie!

530
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,267
- Yes, ma'am?
- You can have the night off.

531
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,480
Oh, thank you very much.

532
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,148
Good night.

533
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,405
(Rhoda humming tune)

534
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,830
(Chuckles) Oh, hi.

535
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,626
I hope the boy you're going out with
tonight will get you home earlier, Rhoda.

536
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,921
He's not a boy. He's 35.

537
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,423
(Tutting) Thirty what?

538
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,593
Well, that's a dangerous companion
for a young girl.

539
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,637
Oh, you think so, huh?

540
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,640
I guess you haven't been out
with any collegians lately.

541
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,726
But at least among the boys your own age,

542
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,938
you'll find the one you'll fall in love with
and want to marry.

543
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,982
I'm going to look around a bit
before I get married.

544
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,028
But a man doesn't want a girl
that runs around with everybody.

545
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,781
I've seen plenty of swell fellows
walk down the aisles

546
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,075
with girls that had done
everything but murder.

547
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,453
Why, men get together and talk about girls.

548
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,416
Yeah, and then they all make a dash for
the one that's been mentioned the most.

549
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,168
Next lecture at half past Tuesday.

550
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,382
Well, I won't be pickin' on you much longer.

551
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,552
You'll soon have your room
to yourself again, Rhoda.

552
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,887
Have you got some kind of a plan,
Grandma?

553
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,891
Well, I haven't, but your grandpa has.

554
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,728
His letter says that he's, uh...

555
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:46,192
negotiating a piece of business
with some lawyer,

556
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:52,782
and if it works out satisfactory,
then everything is gonna be all right.

557
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,951
Oh.

558
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,911
What's the matter?

559
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,081
Why kid yourself, Grandma?

560
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,959
You know he can't get a job.
He's...he's much too old.

561
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:07,589
Well, I still have faith
in your grandpa's ability.

562
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,341
That's just fooling yourself.

563
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,011
Why don't you face facts, Grandma?

564
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,555
Oh, Rhoda.

565
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,642
When you're 17 and the world's beautiful

566
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:27,525
facing facts is just as slick fun
as dancing or going to parties.

567
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:33,323
But when you're 70...
well, you don't care about dancing,

568
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,827
and you don't think about parties any more.

569
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,372
And about the only fun you have left is

570
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,460
pretending that there
ain't any facts to face.

571
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:53,009
So would you mind
if I just kind of went on pretending?

572
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,604
Grandma?

573
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,732
I...I didn't mean to...

574
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,984
Oh, I...I know, honey.

575
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,951
Why don't you try to relax?
You'll wear yourself to a frazzle.

576
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,203
But she could telephone or something.

577
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,539
Don't you see?
Something terrible must have happened.

578
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,626
I know Rhoda so well. I know
she wouldn't do a thing like this willingly.

579
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,966
She must have met with an accident.

580
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,930
I'll finish dressing in case
George wants me for anything.

581
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,850
(Door opens and closes)

582
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,144
(Phone ringing)

583
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,108
Hello. Yes?

584
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:35,069
This is Mrs Cooper.

585
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,197
What? Don't talk so fast.

586
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:47,123
You don't want me? Uh...hello?

587
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,917
(Clicks receiver cradle)

588
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,878
It was for you.

589
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,547
Well, why didn't you let me talk?

590
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,008
She hung up. She called about Rhoda.

591
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,719
- What did she say? How is she?
- Oh, uh...

592
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,145
I'll tell you.

593
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,230
(Tuts) Oh, dear.

594
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,776
Oh, my, oh, my.

595
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,321
(Door closes)

596
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,713
You don't know
how awful I feel about this, Anita.

597
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,300
Let's not talk about it, if you don't mind,
at least not until we know more.

598
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,803
Well, I just got to talk about it.

599
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,598
I feel a little guilty.
I feel that I'm to blame a little bit.

600
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,810
You see, I could have told you,
and maybe I should have told you.

601
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,144
Told me what?

602
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:56,025
Well, that Rhoda isn't always
just absolutely honest.

603
00:44:56,151 --> 00:45:01,030
One night when she and I went to the
movies, she met a boy. You didn't know.

604
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,491
- Why didn't you tell me then?
- Well, I promised Rhoda.

605
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,911
You promised Rhoda? What right had you
to assume that responsibility?

606
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,331
- Rhoda promised that she'd never...
- What Rhoda promised is beside the point.

607
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,834
What right have you to keep
Rhoda's actions a secret from me?

608
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,587
- She's my child, not yours.
- Well, you were so busy with your...

609
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,216
Oh, I'm so busy with my bridge and things.
I thought we'd get to that sooner or later.

610
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,261
So, this is all my fault because
I try to make a few extra dollars.

611
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,555
If it's anybody's fault, I know who to blame.

612
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,391
Why do you suppose Rhoda stopped
inviting her friends here to the house?

613
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,894
Why do you suppose she started meeting
them on the outside? I'm going to tell you !

614
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,523
You like to entertain them ! They were
her friends, and you did all the talking!

615
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,526
Why, Anita, I didn't know
I was doing anything wrong.

616
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,653
You must have known
you were doing something wrong

617
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,156
when you deliberately concealed
Rhoda's actions from me.

618
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,159
You must have known you were doing
something that you had no right to do.

619
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,912
You raised five children of your own.
You might let me raise one.

620
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,498
- But you've got to butt in. You've got to...
- Anita !

621
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,964
I'm sorry.

622
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,135
I know how you feel.

623
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,471
You're worried about Rhoda,

624
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,892
so there won't be any hard feelings.

625
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,402
(Coughing)

626
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,321
I'll be glad when you go back to work.

627
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,865
(Loud coughing)

628
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,368
(Groans) I wish your mother was here.

629
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:33,080
She'd get me on my feet so quick,
it'd make your head swim.

630
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,584
You've only got a little cold.
What's the good of worrying Mother?

631
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,377
(Doorbell)

632
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,338
- Oh...
- Who on earth's that?

633
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,131
(Doorbell)

634
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,303
- Well, it must be the doctor.
- Good heavens! He got here quick enough.

635
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,263
No, but... Wait a minute.

636
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,850
- Come on.
- Huh?

637
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,811
- Come on.
- All right.

638
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,657
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning, Mr Payne. Who's ill?

639
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,201
This way, Doctor.

640
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,953
Here he is.

641
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,624
Hm. So this is the patient.

642
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,884
He's shivering.

643
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,556
You would, too, if you'd run through
the house in your nightshirt with bare feet.

644
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,558
(Chuckles)

645
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,395
- I, uh...I wouldn't let him do that.
- No.

646
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:47,488
Your mother knows more about medicine
than all these young doctors put together.

647
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,783
Ha-ha.

648
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:54,495
Ha-ha. Well, we'll, uh...
We'll have a look at him.

649
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,041
When a man's sick, he don't want a...

650
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,336
How long have you been practisin'?

651
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,964
Oh, for several, uh...

652
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,216
That is, for some time now.

653
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,135
How did you come to take it up?

654
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,346
Why, my father's one of the biggest doctors
in this city.

655
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,520
Why didn't you get his father?

656
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,022
I'm sick.

657
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,524
- Put that thermometer back in your mouth !
- (Groans)

658
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,443
(Bill) Cora !

659
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,111
Excuse me, Doctor.

660
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,533
(Clears throat)

661
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,247
(Groans)

662
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,086
I wanted to talk to you
when your old man wasn't around.

663
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:48,674
You think we ought to send for
your mother? I'm kind of sorry for him.

664
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,428
So am I, but we haven't got room.
Once we got 'em both, we've got 'em.

665
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,598
George would try and talk us into
keeping 'em. Nellie's run out on her.

666
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,435
I burn when I think of her.
And Addie's doing nothing to help.

667
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,395
Yeah. What about Addie?

668
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,941
Hm.

669
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,443
What about her?

670
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,791
It's only a little over a hundred.

671
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,044
If it goes any higher,
will you send for his dad?

672
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,714
- (Chuckles) Now we'll do a little listening.
- Hm?

673
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,635
- Sit up, please.
- (Grunts and coughs)

674
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,888
- I suppose I'll get pneumonia now.
- That's it.

675
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:40,059
Hm. Ooh ! That thing is cold as ice.

676
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,355
Take a deep breath.

677
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,899
(Grunts and coughs)

678
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,444
Say 99.

679
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,323
What for? That can't cure a cold.

680
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,492
I'd rather say 23 to you,

681
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,953
but I guess you're too young
to know that means "skidoo."

682
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,330
Father, behave yourself and say 99.

683
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,500
Darned if I will. I'd feel foolish.

684
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:09,088
I'm too old to play games
with the neighbours' youngsters, Cora.

685
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,049
- You mustn't mind him, Doctor.
- That's quite all right.

686
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:16,971
Going around as I do, I run into all kinds
of patients. Come on, Mr Cooper, say 99.

687
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,141
I will not,
and I'll bet you haven't got many patients.

688
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,354
I've had lots of colds,
and I always got over 'em all right before.

689
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,065
And I never had to say...

690
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,817
that number.

691
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,737
All right.

692
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,905
Now we'll listen to your heart.

693
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,283
Yeah. I didn't say it.

694
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,827
(Doorbell)

695
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,958
- Yes? What do you want?
- Excuse me.

696
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:50,296
My name is Max Rubens. I have
the paper store down on Graham Street.

697
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,590
We have a boy who delivers 'em.

698
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,217
(Doorbell)

699
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,681
(Chuckling) I...
I wasn't trying to do business.

700
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,933
But it is always a good idea, huh?

701
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,773
- You're Cora, no?
- Yes.

702
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,651
Mm-hm. Your father speaks of you.

703
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,906
It's on account of him I come like this.
I heard he was sick.

704
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,868
- A slight cold. It's nothin'.
- Oh. Could I see him?

705
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:24,830
The doctor don't want him to have
any visitors. Visitors would upset him.

706
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,208
It's more likely your father
would upset the visitors.

707
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,168
Certainly they won't hurt him.

708
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,883
- All right. If the doctor says so. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

709
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,635
Right in there.

710
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:43,766
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Nothing to be alarmed about, Mrs Payne.

711
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:48,270
I...I was looking at your father's throat,
and he bit me.

712
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,481
I'm sorry.

713
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,734
Keep him in bed
and put mustard plasters on his chest.

714
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,118
About his cold...

715
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:06,288
This winter weather and everything.

716
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,875
Wouldn't it be a good idea
if I sent him to California?

717
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:14,839
(Chuckles) I...I'd think it'd be a good idea
if you could send him almost anywhere.

718
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,966
I felt sure you'd say that, Doctor.

719
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,219
All along, I felt that Father
couldn't stand these awful winters,

720
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,013
and California'd be better.

721
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,934
- It certainly is wonderful soup, Mr Rubens.
- Sure.

722
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,645
Yeah, I can feel it warming me all over.

723
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:33,440
Sure it's wonderful. My wife made it
as soon as she heard you were sick.

724
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,110
- Hm?
- Just like me, she wants you to get well.

725
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,362
(Chuckling) Yeah. That's nice of her.

726
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:45,119
Now, if somebody
would only call up my wife.

727
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,417
But your daughter
can take good care of you,

728
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,211
and maybe she don't want
her mother around, kibitzing.

729
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,547
You know how it is.

730
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,009
- Now, I've got to fix your mustard plaster.
- Mm.

731
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,928
- What are you eating?
- Some soup Mrs Rubens made for me.

732
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,264
- Wasn't that nice?
- That's fine, isn't it?

733
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,641
- Mm. You bet it is.
- (Laughs)

734
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,060
The neighbours think
I don't feed you properly, I guess.

735
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,730
- Hm?
- Don't eat it. How do I know what's in it?

736
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,983
There's nothing in that soup
but good chicken.

737
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,068
- Mm-hm.
- When my Sarah makes...

738
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,113
Your Sarah can mind her own business.
I cook for my father.

739
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,200
You should live
until you can cook like my Sarah.

740
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,743
Oh?

741
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,245
Don't put any more of that in your stomach.

742
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,456
Yeah. I'm afraid it's all gone, Cora.

743
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,374
You mean you ate all this mess?

744
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,714
Mrs Payne, for myself I don't care. Mm-hm.

745
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,510
But my Sarah, when she makes a soup,
a king can eat it, and she worked...

746
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,139
You can tell your Sarah if he's sick tonight,
she can come take care of him.

747
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,476
- Goodbye, Mr Cooper.
- Goodbye.

748
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,354
And thanks for coming.

749
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,314
And thanks for the...

750
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,566
Thanks.

751
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,365
(Mouths words)

752
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,203
(Chuckling)

753
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,205
(Coughing)

754
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,674
What's the matter with you?

755
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,175
Nothing.

756
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,433
- Will you please stop worrying, Mother?
- Oh, I can't.

757
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,144
But Cora said
his temperature is normal tonight.

758
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,022
But it may be up again tomorrow.

759
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,900
Anyway, your father
doesn't like his doctor.

760
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,779
Look, Mother,
his temperature is normal tonight.

761
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,323
But it may be up again tomorrow.

762
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,325
Isn't this where we came in?

763
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,620
(Whispers) Shut up.

764
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,915
Mother, will you please
stop borrowing trouble?

765
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,168
Oh, dear. I guess I'll go see how Anita is.

766
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,462
Uh...no, no, no.

767
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,381
I'd better go, Mother. Hm?

768
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,637
(Rocker creaking)

769
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,100
Now, stop it, honey.

770
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:17,021
- You're just going to make yourself ill.
- I can't seem to help it.

771
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,441
But Mrs Claire promised to keep
Rhoda's name out of the case.

772
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:24,486
Everything is going to be all right.
It's you that I'm worried about.

773
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,947
Gosh, I never saw you give in so completely.

774
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,283
But everything's gone wrong.

775
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,786
I care as much about your mother
as any daughter-in-law can, but...

776
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,205
- What's Mother got to do with it?
- Well, didn't she tell you that I...

777
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:40,210
Oh, yes, she said something about
an argument, but never mind that, dear.

778
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,339
But there's no place for your mother to go,
now that Nellie's backed out.

779
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:47,718
And Rhoda positively refuses to bring
her friends home while she's here.

780
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,512
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

781
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,182
Take this business today,
it never would have happened

782
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,810
if Rhoda had been able to entertain
her friends at home as she used to.

783
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:01,315
I used to know all of Rhoda's men friends
and what was going on, but now...

784
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:05,527
I know. Rhoda used to have
the house full of her friends.

785
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:10,240
She's got to have them again, George.
She's got to. Don't you see?

786
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,244
What happened today is just a sample.
She'll be leaving us next.

787
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,121
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, yes, she will.

788
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,124
She'll get a job
and an apartment of her own.

789
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,503
- Those things happen, don't they?
- And we're helpless to stop it.

790
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:29,760
We can't turn your mother out into
the streets, and yet she's driving Rhoda...

791
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,513
I know. I...I know.

792
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,143
- Maybe...
- What, dear?

793
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,271
Hm? Oh, nothing. Nothing.

794
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,651
(Swingtime jazz on radio)

795
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,368
(Vocalising)

796
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,376
- Did I awaken you, Grandma?
- It doesn't matter.

797
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,254
- Is there any mail?
- I think so.

798
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,297
(Music continues)

799
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,485
(Rocker creaks)

800
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,664
- Good evening, Mother C.
- Hello, Ma.

801
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,333
Hi.

802
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,679
(Rocker creaks)

803
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,059
(Anita) Rhoda.

804
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,978
(Radio off)

805
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,951
(Rocker creaks)

806
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,460
I spoke to your father today, George.

807
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,048
He told me that he's perfectly well again.

808
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,467
Yes.

809
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,469
We've got to keep him well, Mother.

810
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,890
The trouble is,
that can't be done in this climate.

811
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:28,564
Cora's doctor says that Father positively
has to go where there are no hard winters,

812
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:35,279
and we thought, on account
of Addie living in California...

813
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,948
He's going out there to live?

814
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,826
Just for a little while,
for his health, dear.

815
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,495
Oh, of course.

816
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,373
I want him to be well.

817
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,500
There isn't anything I...I want as much,

818
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,837
unless it's that you children
should be healthy and happy.

819
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,259
Cora thought
that Addie would take you both.

820
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,512
Addie says she can't.

821
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,226
As long as she takes Father, that's enough.

822
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,563
Well...

823
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,859
He'll be leaving soon?

824
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,694
I guess so.

825
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:21,366
Maybe I'll be able to see him
to say goodbye?

826
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,119
Oh. Of course.

827
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,290
Mother.

828
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,793
There's something else I've got to tell you.

829
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,088
Well, there's something
I'd like to say to you first.

830
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,258
Let me do it while I can. You tell me later.

831
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,385
- (Rocker creaks)
- Well, it's only this.

832
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:47,142
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but I haven't been too happy here.

833
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,518
(Sniffs)

834
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:53,148
It's lonesome in this apartment
with everybody gone all day.

835
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:58,195
Uh...would you mind terribly

836
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:05,077
if I decided to leave you
to go to the Idylwild Home?

837
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,463
Well, it's a fine place.

838
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,842
I'd meet friends my own age, and...

839
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:24,513
- But, Mother, I didn't...
- No, now, let me finish, dear.

840
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:32,062
Once I thought that your father and I
might get together again,

841
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:38,402
but, well, I...
I see that it'll never turn out that way.

842
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,280
So I want to go to the home.

843
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,535
(Sighs)

844
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,871
- (Rocker creaks)
- Well, I'm glad that's over.

845
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:57,963
I hated to tell you as much as you would
have hated to tell me anything like that.

846
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,717
Oh, there's just one more thing, dear.

847
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:07,389
I'd like to stay here
until your father's on his way to California.

848
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,058
He's funny about things, you know.

849
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:13,812
He'd never believe
that the home was a grand place.

850
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:18,108
- (Rocker creaking)
- He's a little old-fashioned, Father is.

851
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,195
Those places seem terrible to him.

852
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,075
He must never know that I'm going.

853
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:35,542
And you tell Cora and Nellie and the others
that he must never know.

854
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:39,421
This is one thing
that has to be handled my way.

855
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,133
Yes, Mother.

856
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:48,305
Just let him go on thinking
that I'm living with you and Anita.

857
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,225
You can always forward my letters.

858
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,896
(Chuckles)

859
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:00,400
It'll be the first secret
I've ever had from him.

860
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,655
It'll...It'll seem mighty funny.

861
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,240
(Chuckles)

862
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,327
Oh, well.

863
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,037
(Sighs)

864
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:22,589
Here's another little secret,
just between us two.

865
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:31,223
You were always my favourite child.

866
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,652
Well, that's that.

867
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:50,700
As the years go by,
you can always look back on this day

868
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,953
and be mighty proud of me.

869
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:05,298
- (Rocker squeaking)
- Take it easy there.

870
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,260
(Rocker squeaking)

871
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,860
- Oh, come in, Mamie.
- Thank you.

872
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,490
- You going down to meet the bus, huh?
- Mm-hm.

873
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,617
And won't you be glad to see your husband?

874
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,327
Yes, indeed.

875
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:38,081
Oh, Mamie, you won't be here tonight
when I come back to get my things

876
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,334
and I want to give you
a little remembrance I made for you

877
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,963
- and to thank you for everything.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs Cooper.

878
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,715
But there's nothing to thank me for.

879
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,719
Oh, I'll always remember
how nice you were to me.

880
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:56,016
(Chuckles) Oh, by the way, Mamie, you'll
be getting some nights off from now on.

881
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,184
- (Chuckles) Oh.
- I know.

882
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,688
Yes, ma'am.
They even give me the afternoon off.

883
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,190
In fact, I'm going right now
to meet my husband.

884
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,570
- So am I.
- Yeah.

885
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:41,478
Will you stop lookin' at your watch?
We've got five whole hours.

886
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,065
We mustn't even think about the time.

887
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,701
I guess you're right, Lucy.

888
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:06,419
Well, Bark, I figure that everyone is
entitled to just so much happiness in life.

889
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,966
Some get it in the beginning, and some
in the middle, and others at the end.

890
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:17,555
And then there are those that have it
spread thin all through the years.

891
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,352
The trouble is, I was a failure.

892
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:28,108
I suppose you liked me because I knew
a couple ofjokes and could make you laugh.

893
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,735
I was the town clown,

894
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:36,658
but there wasn't much room in the business
world, Lucy, for that kind of a fella.

895
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,661
I won't let you call yourself
a failure, Bark.

896
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:44,416
I think I slipped up some place,

897
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:50,922
though I tried always to be
a good wife and mother.

898
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:57,804
But if I'd been all that I thought I was,
things would be different now.

899
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:03,768
You don't sow wheat and reap ashes, Pa.

900
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,651
Oh, come on.

901
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,487
Let's get out of here.

902
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,202
(Traffic)

903
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,433
- (Bell)
- (Whistle blows)

904
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,148
Excuse me a minute, Ma.
I want to get something. I'll be right out.

905
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,735
(Horn sounds)

906
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,509
(Whistle blows)

907
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,178
(Doorbell)

908
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,224
Come on, Pa.

909
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,643
- They didn't have my size.
- Uh-huh.

910
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:38,154
- Fine time to tell us.
- Hm.

911
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:57,465
You know,
I always wanted to buy you a nice car,

912
01:08:57,591 --> 01:09:01,511
but it seems we always had to use
the money for something else.

913
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,639
- Do you see the old couple out there?
- Uh-huh.

914
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:08,101
It's always those kind
that have a million bucks salted away.

915
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,728
Well, I'm going out
and pry them loose from some of it.

916
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,522
(Chuckles)

917
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,484
If he's got a million bucks salted away,
I'll bet he's forgotten where he put it.

918
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:22,657
Uh...my name's Ed Weldon. Of course,
you don't know me from Adam's father.

919
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:24,659
But you can judge
something of my character

920
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:28,163
when I tell you I'm permitted
to represent this automobile.

921
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,915
Of course, the car sells itself.

922
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:34,043
When I tell you it's considered
the mechanical wonder of the age,

923
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,628
you'll be surprised.

924
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:40,592
But when you ride in it and find
how smooth it runs, you'll be astonished.

925
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,386
I don't expect we'll get to ride in it.

926
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,347
Well, why not?
Have you a little time right now?

927
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:49,475
Now, my car's right there,
exactly like this one.

928
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,478
How about it?

929
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:58,067
Oh, well, we couldn't.
We're having dinner with our children.

930
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,197
- Well, but I can take you there.
- Oh, no. You needn't bother about that.

931
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,073
A ride up the drive, perhaps.

932
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,452
Oh, we couldn't, Bark.

933
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:14,000
- Why not?
- Now, that's the proper spirit.

934
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,085
- Come on. Let's go.
- Well !

935
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,637
- Pretty nice, isn't it, Bark?
- Yes, indeed.

936
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,640
- Are you warm enough?
- Uh-huh. Are you?

937
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:32,310
Oh, yes. I'm very comfortable.

938
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,396
- Say...
- Weldon.

939
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:40,109
- Say, this is awful nice of you, Mr Weldon.
- That's nothing, Mr Cooper.

940
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,154
I only hope the children aren't worried
about us. You know, we really...

941
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,157
You remember,
we took a ride up the Hudson

942
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:48,534
when we came to New York
on our honeymoon.

943
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,827
Of course I remember.

944
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:53,331
I always intended
we should do it again some day,

945
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:57,669
but we never got anywhere much
after our honeymoon, did we?

946
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:06,886
I guess this is the first time that we've
been away from home together since, uh...

947
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,890
...our honeymoon.

948
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,643
It doesn't matter, Bark. I had the children.

949
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:18,314
Yeah, and I used to go down
to the barbershop every night with the boys

950
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,942
and left you at home to sew and...

951
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,570
I'm ashamed of myself, Lucy.

952
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,783
I've been trying to recall
the places we went on our honeymoon.

953
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:30,994
We went to the theatre twice, I remember.

954
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,997
Uh...three times.
We went to a matinée one day.

955
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,790
Oh, so we did.

956
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,251
And then we went to the park
to hear the band,

957
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:41,170
and we took a drive over Brooklyn Bridge.

958
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,632
- In a hansom cab.
- Mm. On a Thursday.

959
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:47,468
No, that was Wednesday.

960
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,595
I can remember too.

961
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,890
Yeah. Never mind.

962
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,227
- Do you remember going to the museum?
- Of course I do.

963
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:58,271
You do not. You never went.

964
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,107
You said you didn't like museums.

965
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,318
(Both chuckling)

966
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,863
I wonder if the Hotel Vogard
is still standing.

967
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,157
Yeah, the Vogard's on lower Fifth Avenue.

968
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:14,037
I remember it was a very nice place
run by nice people.

969
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,248
Say, Lucy, what about going down,
taking a look at it and having a cup of tea?

970
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:19,792
- It'd do you good.
- Oh, no, Bark. We couldn't.

971
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,295
- Why not? Who's to stop us.
- Well, the children are...

972
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,421
Mr Weldon.

973
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:25,965
- I certainly can, Mr Cooper.
- He's gonna take us.

974
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:29,510
How do you like this car's performance?
Isn't it smooth?

975
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,637
Oh, it's perfect, Mr Weldon.

976
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,892
We never rode
in a better automobile in our life.

977
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,311
- Thanks.
- Have we, Ma?

978
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,530
- My, it's nice to see it again.
- Yeah.

979
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,991
- How about the car?
- Oh, it's fine.

980
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,078
You think you'd be interested
in buying a car like this?

981
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,412
In buying one?

982
01:12:56,538 --> 01:13:00,875
Oh, we couldn't buy an automobile,
but we do appreciate the compliment.

983
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:06,339
Well, why not? A car's no longer a luxury.
It's, uh...it's a necessity.

984
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:10,093
Why, were you expecting
to sell us an automobi...

985
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,888
- (Bark chuckles)
- Oh, I'm so sorry we took your time.

986
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:17,058
Why, we thought that you were
really proud of your automobile

987
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,852
and just sort of wanted to show it off.

988
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,815
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You know, I enjoyed myself too.

989
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:28,319
I didn't have anything to do. In fact, you...
you were right in the first place.

990
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:32,031
(Chuckles) I, uh...
I just wanted to show the car off.

991
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,534
Oh, well, that makes me feel better.

992
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,578
- Thank you and goodbye.
- You're more than welcome.

993
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:39,080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

994
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:42,166
- We...we didn't touch anything anyway.
- No.

995
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,966
(Chatter)

996
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,474
(Small orchestra playing)

997
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:03,354
- Oh ! Oh !
- (Chuckling)

998
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:05,815
- May I have your coat?
- Thank you.

999
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,526
- Did you see what I did?
- Yes, dear.

1000
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:11,571
I never was so embarrassed in all my life.

1001
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,116
Well, get out. You were too.
I could tell you several times.

1002
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,285
- (Laughs)
- Thank you.

1003
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:22,874
Oh, I better get a cheque right here.
Could I have a cheque, please?

1004
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,293
- Oh, you won't need one. I'll remember you.
- Oh, thank you.

1005
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:29,547
- You're strangers here, aren't you?
- Well, not exactly.

1006
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:33,634
We spent our honeymoon here
50 years ago.

1007
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1008
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:38,306
Well, then you must remember this,
our old lobby.

1009
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,854
Remember, Ma?

1010
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,939
I should say we do.

1011
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:52,069
It certainly is different than it was then.

1012
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,530
(Chuckles) Yeah, so are we.

1013
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,282
(Chuckling)

1014
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:18,346
(No audible dialogue)

1015
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,835
Well, what'll it be?

1016
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,630
- Well, uh...
- Cocktails maybe?

1017
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,840
Well, he's gonna have one.

1018
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,843
Well, why don't you have one, Ma?

1019
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,388
Ladies are drinking here.

1020
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,611
Hm? Two cocktails.

1021
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,322
- What kind... How about old-fashioneds?

1022
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:22,410
Yeah. Two old-fashioneds
for two old-fashioned people.

1023
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:25,329
- (Both laugh)
- Say, that's all right.

1024
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,000
Are you sure there's no calls for me?

1025
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,876
OK.

1026
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:35,464
- Well, that's funny.
- No, it isn't. That roast'll be ruined.

1027
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,175
I don't care about the roast.
I'm worried about Father and Mother.

1028
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,969
I wonder where they can be.

1029
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,054
Ah, they're probably having a grand time

1030
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,349
talking about the few hours they got left
before Pop's train leaves.

1031
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:46,684
Some fun, huh?

1032
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:51,272
Crenshaw hotel chain has owned
the Vogard since shortly after the war.

1033
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,815
But that doesn't mean, Mr and Mrs Cooper,

1034
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,068
we're not just as glad to see you
as the old management could have been.

1035
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:59,488
Well, we just think it's awful nice of you
to bother to see us, Mr Norton.

1036
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,823
- Ah, yes, indeed.
- Not at all.

1037
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,325
The hotel's friends are my friends.

1038
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,704
Well, I never thought
I'd be sitting here, drinking like this.

1039
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,290
You know, ladies never used to.

1040
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,335
Why, you wouldn't believe it if I told you

1041
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:16,172
that on the first Thursday,
we were here on our honeymoon,

1042
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,341
we just started for Brooklyn Bridge.

1043
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,428
The aquarium, uh...was Wednesday.

1044
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:27,308
Ain't it funny how women always get the
weekdays mixed up along with other things?

1045
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,436
It was Wednesday.

1046
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,773
I remember we started out.

1047
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:38,027
I got lost right away.

1048
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,863
- (Chuckling)
- But it was Thursday.

1049
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:44,742
- Now, look, Bark, we got married on...
- Tuesday.

1050
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:46,577
(Chuckling) Oh, no, no.

1051
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:51,957
We were going to be married on Tuesday,
and then we postponed it,

1052
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,503
so my sister could get there
from New Hampshire, remember?

1053
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,171
- Mm.
- She was snowbound, with the mumps.

1054
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:59,215
- Mm.
- (Laughing)

1055
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:04,553
Remember, she was visiting that girl
who was married to that fellow

1056
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,181
who was related to those people
who had a daughter in the south.

1057
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:09,517
- Without the mumps.
- (Chuckling)

1058
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:15,564
- Well, the point is that we were married.
- (Chuckling)

1059
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,775
Yeah, we were married, all right.

1060
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,819
(Laughing)

1061
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:24,240
Well, the point is, we were married
on Wednesday instead of Tuesday.

1062
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,702
No...no. That's not the point at all.

1063
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:32,707
We were trying to figure out
which day we went to the aquarium.

1064
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,126
Oh, well, that was Thursday.

1065
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:39,755
(Chuckling) I'm sure
it must have been, Mrs Cooper.

1066
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,716
I wonder if you'll excuse me now.

1067
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,469
If you want anything, just ask for it,
and let me know if you don't get it.

1068
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:48,681
- Now, you shouldn't have done that.
- It was my pleasure.

1069
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,683
- Thank you, Mr Norton.
- (Crowd applauding)

1070
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,269
(Orchestra playing)

1071
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,231
(Laughs) Was it Wednesday?

1072
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:59,108
(Chuckles)

1073
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,362
Lucy, are you getting a little tipsy?

1074
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,991
(Both chuckle)

1075
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:13,372
Let me hear you say this.
Betty Botter bought a batch of bitter butter.

1076
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,627
Betty Botter bought a batch of bitter butter.

1077
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,005
- (Both chuckle)
- Now say this one.

1078
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:25,593
Betty Botter bought a batch
of baby buggy rubber bumpers.

1079
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:32,266
Betty Botter bought a batch of baby bu...

1080
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,602
- (Both laugh)
- You can't do it.

1081
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,646
You got that one at the barbershop.

1082
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,774
(Chuckles) Yeah, I guess so.

1083
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,819
- Oh, Bark, we've got to go.
- Why?

1084
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:47,823
Well, the children are waiting,
and Nellie's gonna cook dinner.

1085
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:51,243
Well, we're not going. We're having fun.

1086
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:54,371
And how many times
have we had to wait dinner for them?

1087
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,751
I think I can fix it up.

1088
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,213
In a nice way.

1089
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:08,260
Hello. Hello, Nellie.

1090
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,679
This is your father. Remember me?

1091
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:17,394
No, there hasn't been any accident,
except that we're having a good time.

1092
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,649
(Chuckles) Your dinner?
Oh, isn't that too bad?

1093
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:25,903
No, I'm not fooling. No, we're not coming.

1094
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:28,364
You heard me.

1095
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,992
Oh, I'm sure you went
to a lot of trouble in cooking it.

1096
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:36,121
Yeah, it sounds swell. A roast, eh?

1097
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,583
- Bark.
- Uh...uh, wait a minute, Nellie.

1098
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:43,337
- Maybe we should...
- Excuse me, young lady. This is private.

1099
01:20:46,132 --> 01:20:48,050
(No audible dialogue)

1100
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,734
- Was it all right?
- She took it very nicely.

1101
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,028
Shall we join the others?

1102
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,533
(Orchestra plays dramatic music)

1103
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,748
- So, you're having dinner with us.
- Yeah, we thought we would.

1104
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,751
That's fine. Step right upstairs.
I'll be in to see you later.

1105
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,587
Thank you very much.

1106
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,820
Better hurry along with your drink.
Your husband and I are one up on you.

1107
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:53,657
Oh, well, you go right ahead.
I kind of like to dawdle.

1108
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:56,577
- Are you having a good time, Lucy?
- Oh, yes, Bark.

1109
01:21:56,703 --> 01:22:00,706
You wouldn't think, would you, to look at
her, that she was a mother of five children?

1110
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,000
- Not really.
- She's a grandmother too.

1111
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:06,003
Oh ! Well, that I just can't believe.

1112
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:08,297
It's kind of hard for me to believe.

1113
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:12,301
- Fifty years go by pretty fast.
- Only when you're happy.

1114
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,053
- How many children have you?
- Five of 'em.

1115
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,014
Really? I'll bet they've brought you
a lot of pleasure.

1116
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:21,685
- I'll bet you haven't any children.
- Don't you pay any attention to him.

1117
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:25,064
Then I'm sure it was Mrs Cooper
who made the 50 years go so swiftly.

1118
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,483
- Oh, that's very nice.
- Yes, it was.

1119
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,568
Best thing I ever did, marrying her.

1120
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,613
Randy Dunlap was courting her
at the same time that I was.

1121
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:36,325
- Oh, Bark. Will you stop that?
- He was. He proposed to you, didn't he?

1122
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,535
Yes, he did, but you don't have to tell it.

1123
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:42,414
I guess I looked like the best bet
so she took me.

1124
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,750
- Randy Dunlap's the banker in our town.
- Really?

1125
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:48,337
- I got his girl, but he's got my house.
- You do go on !

1126
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,799
Well, if you'll pardon me.
We've enjoyed having you.

1127
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,592
- Yeah.
- Next time, don't stay away so long.

1128
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,761
- Goodbye, Mr Norton.
- Mrs Cooper.

1129
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,266
(Low chatter)

1130
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,227
(Orchestra playing waltz)

1131
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:11,443
You know, Lucy, I often wonder what I'd do
if I was a young fella nowadays.

1132
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,612
I guess I'd have to be a bachelor.

1133
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:17,408
There are no girls around
a man would want to take a second look at.

1134
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:20,244
Oh, shucks, Bark.
There are plenty of mighty pretty girls.

1135
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,204
Not as pretty as you. And you know what?

1136
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,873
You've held your looks
better than anyone I know.

1137
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,250
Ah.

1138
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:31,839
Right now I don't see any girl
that looks half as nice to me as you do.

1139
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,343
Bark, you're sweet.

1140
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:38,095
So are you.

1141
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:55,529
You know, the more I think of it,
the fella who wrote that poem...

1142
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:58,449
- You know, your favourite?
- Mm-hm.

1143
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:02,369
I think he must have got
a peek into our future.

1144
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:08,167
You know, the poem in the book where
you marked the place with a rosebud?

1145
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:11,795
Or did the bank get that too?

1146
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:15,466
They took the book,
but they couldn't take the poem from me.

1147
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:24,725
A man and a maid stood hand in hand
Bound by a tiny wedding band.

1148
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:33,233
Before them lay the uncertain years
That promised joy and maybe tears.

1149
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,987
"Is she afraid?"
Thought the man of the maid.

1150
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:46,205
"Darling," he said in a tender voice
"Tell me, do you regret your choice?

1151
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:52,252
"We know not where the road may wind
Or what strange byways we may find.

1152
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:56,673
"Are you afraid?" said the man to the maid.

1153
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:02,721
She raised her eyes and spoke at last.

1154
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:05,557
"My dear," she said, "the die is cast.

1155
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:09,436
"The vows have been spoken.
The rice has been thrown.

1156
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:13,607
"Into the future we'll travel alone.

1157
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:20,823
"With you," said the maid, "I'm not afraid."

1158
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,371
Would you like to dance, Bark?

1159
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:30,082
- Huh?
- It's a waltz.

1160
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:48,183
(Tune ends)

1161
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,146
(Upbeat tune)

1162
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,953
(Tune ends)

1163
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:13,458
(♪ Let Me Call You Sweetheart)

1164
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,862
Good evening, everybody.

1165
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:46,241
This is Carlton Gorman coming to you
from the Vogard Hotel in New York City.

1166
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,871
It's nine o'clock. It's now nine o'clock,
and is everybody happy?

1167
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:53,415
Smile, and the world smiles with you, folks.

1168
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,629
Goodbye.

1169
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,425
The evening's fun is about to start,

1170
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,595
and you can't go wrong
with a song in your heart.

1171
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:19,107
♪ Let me call you sweetheart

1172
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:24,279
♪ I'm in love with you

1173
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:31,286
♪ Let me hear you whisper
That you love me too...

1174
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:32,704
(Whispers) I love you too.

1175
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:41,588
♪ Keep the love light glowing
In your eyes so blue

1176
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:45,884
(Both) ♪ Let me call you sweetheart

1177
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:49,721
♪ I'm in love

1178
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:52,808
♪With you ♪

1179
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:00,399
(Chuckles) Oh. That's funny, isn't it?

1180
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,942
We've known all along that we're probably

1181
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:04,194
the most good-for-nothing bunch of kids
who were ever raised,

1182
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,572
but it didn't bother us much
until we found out that Pop knew it too.

1183
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,409
Doesn't look as though
they're even coming by.

1184
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,618
No, I don't think so.

1185
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:14,538
Well, we ought to be getting to the station.
How much time have we got?

1186
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,164
- About a minute and a half.
- (Cora and Nellie) What?

1187
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,917
- Well, two minutes maybe.
- Two minutes?

1188
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:22,504
Why on earth didn't you tell us?
That wasn't a very nice thing to do, George.

1189
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:26,383
I think so. I kind of thought
they'd like to be alone.

1190
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:29,928
But if we don't go to the station,
they'll think we're terrible.

1191
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,348
- Aren't we?
- You're tellin' us right, brother.

1192
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:43,567
I can't understand
what happened to the children.

1193
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,903
Right here.

1194
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:50,032
Well, I...I guess this is it.

1195
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,326
- It looks like a very nice train.
- Uh-huh.

1196
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,746
I hear they serve very good food on trains.

1197
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:57,289
(Bell rings)

1198
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:03,920
Well, give Addie my love,
and tell her to take good care of you.

1199
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,381
Well, you'll very likely
see her soon yourself.

1200
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:09,926
I'll get a job out there,
and I'll send for you right away.

1201
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:13,889
I don't doubt that, Bark.
You'll get a job. Of course you will.

1202
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:16,683
- (Conductor) All aboard.
- They didn't give us much time, did they?

1203
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:19,728
- Goodbye, Lucy dear.
- Goodbye, darling.

1204
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:26,360
In case I don't see you again...

1205
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,904
- What?
- Well, anything might happen.

1206
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:32,199
The train could jump off the track.

1207
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:35,243
If it should happen
that I don't see you again,

1208
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:39,247
it's been very nice knowing you,
Miss Breckenridge.

1209
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:43,001
Bark, that's probably
the prettiest speech you ever made.

1210
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:46,880
And in case I don't see you a...

1211
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:50,342
(Clears throat) Well, for a little while.

1212
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:54,763
I just want to tell you, it's been lovely.

1213
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,807
Every bit of it.

1214
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,934
The whole 50 years.

1215
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:05,732
I'd sooner have been your wife, Bark,
than anyone else on earth.

1216
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:08,151
Oh, thank you, Lucy.

1217
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:10,112
(Conductor) All aboard !

1218
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:13,824
Get going, Pa.

1219
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,000
(Train door closes)

1220
