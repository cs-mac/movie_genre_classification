1
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,293
It has to be done.

2
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:09,621
- Leave me be.
- Stop that!

3
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:53,742
- Have you seen my sister?
- She's in the hot room.

4
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:56,543
Tell her I'm cooling off.

5
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:19,414

22
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:30,659
Hey there.

23
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,018
Drop dead.

24
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,417
- What a beauty!
- A real peach.

25
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,782
Such beautiful eyes.

26
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,857
The veil suits you.

27
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,377
Don't be shy.

28
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,732
You don't like us?

29
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,655
Mr Bechir, come here.

30
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:49,541
But it's only you we want.

31
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,775
Need some help, boys?

32
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:56,060
Beat it, Noura.
This isn't kids stuff.

33
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,259
It's no use, forget it.

34
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:00,652
Already?

35
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:02,622
She's looking at us.

36
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:05,901
- Shall we go to the beach?
- Get lost.

37
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,175
The holidays are almost over.

38
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,459
Go and dig yourself a grave then.

39
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:14,413
- Plenty more fish in the sea.
- Hopefully.

40
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,702
Buzz off!

41
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,741
You're delicious.

42
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,894
Go and find something to do.

43
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:26,811
- God, you're gorgeous.
- Incredible!

44
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,178
Drop dead.

45
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:33,052
- Are you in a hurry?
- I'm free right now.

46
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:39,501
Give us some more, gorgeous.

47
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,256
More what?

48
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,892
The veil looks great on you.

49
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,301
And you'd look great dead.

50
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:49,899
- When can we become engaged?
- You? With your face?

51
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:55,252
- My brother would sort you out.
- How?

52
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:56,936
Watch out!

53
00:05:57,463 --> 00:05:59,181
Noura! Come here.

54
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,381
You're nothing but hooligans!

55
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:42,023
Get a move on.

56
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:44,901
Noura, look over there.

57
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:06,661
<i>This cup of love</i>

58
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:10,259
<i>We share you and me</i>

59
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,974
<i>Will make us both merry</i>

60
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:18,501
Where did Lilia hide her boy-friend
this time?

61
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:22,296
- Can't you forget that affair?
- What happened?

62
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:27,458
She pulled the wool over her father's
eyes. She hid him in the attic.

63
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,818
She told her father his shoes
were her brother's.

64
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:36,022
- Isn't her brother abroad?
- Well, her father's an old man.

65
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:40,381
- The poor old fellow.
- Whatever will she think up next?

66
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:44,692
- Somebody's coming.
- Who? Aunt Zuleika?

67
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:48,697
She looks so innocent

68
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,976
but she did worse when she was young!

69
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:56,899
- Come and help us.
- Pick up the bottles.

70
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:12,298
Hands off!

71
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:15,981
There's still wine in it.

72
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,457
Six bottles.

73
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,892
All perfect.

74
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:49,581
What about this one?

75
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:58,812
The police raided Ali's place
last night.

76
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:01,623
Took his radio and ate his food.

77
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:04,252
Wasn't he supposed
to come here today?

78
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,176
Must have gone somewhere else
for a drink.

79
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:12,337
One, two, three.

80
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:16,420
- One more!
- You're never satisfied.

81
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,451
Thanks.

82
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:25,457
Next time, watch out.

83
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,814
These pens never leave me.

84
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:38,897
You need to look educated
if you want a girl.

85
00:09:55,063 --> 00:10:00,057
Take this to Salih
before he drops off to sleep.

86
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:07,458
Is that all?

87
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:12,897
What about me?

88
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:16,659
Ill-gotten gains aren't for kids.

89
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:18,700
I'll tell Salih of you.

90
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,856
Noura, buy me some cigarettes.

91
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:29,253
Sorry, Mr Sadok, I'm doing a job.

92
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,697
A kilo of potatoes, love?

93
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:45,261
Want a dip, Noura?

94
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,977
I'm not a kid any more.

95
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:57,101
Doins errands for Salih again?
What's he got that we haven't?

96
00:10:57,343 --> 00:10:58,617
Ahmed, I'm in a hurry.

97
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:02,139
Let's see, is it perfume?

98
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:04,738
Can't I have some?

99
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:09,132
There you go, hopping off again!

100
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:14,541
SALIH'S FOR SHOES,
THEATRE AND SONGS

101
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:38,222
If it isn't Noura.
There's no one to touch you.

102
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:41,136
Goods delivered on time.

103
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:46,901
I'm writing a play about some Europeans
who never sober up.

104
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,701
I'm not joking.

105
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,253
- It's written?
- Yes.

106
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:57,778
Except for the title.
I may call it "Laughter in the Dark".

107
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,255
Put that inside.

108
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,336
I brought that from Singapore.

109
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,895
I used it in my famous play,
"Picnic in Istanbul".

110
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:45,862
Nowadays it seems you young people
can't settle to anything.

111
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,541
It's all Moncef's and Mounir's fault.

112
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:52,179
They treat me like a baby.

113
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,254
Listen to me.

114
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:59,338
A man proposes
but it's the woman who disposes.

115
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:01,614
But how will I know?

116
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,172
She'll soon show you.

117
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,772
Run along.
Here comes my actress.

118
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:20,098
Welcome, my dear customer.

119
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,852
Today, I've just what you want.

120
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,456
I wonder.

121
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:38,940
I know your fitting. Come inside.

122
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:43,101
Take all the time you want.

123
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:49,621
I'm hard to please. What makes you
so sure your goods will please me?

124
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,854
Not everything is on display.

125
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:53,731
Suppose I'm disappointed?

126
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,613
Everything I have is made to measure.

127
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:31,854
I was looking for you.

128
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:45,332
I've brought you a fantastic
fountain pen. It still works.

129
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,655
You're old enough
to find the ink yourself.

130
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,492
What's his new play called?

131
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,656
Can't you hear?
"Laughter in the Dark".

132
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:05,134
In the dark? Really?
You're not pulling my leg?

133
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:16,573
How dare you pester girls.
Mixing with those hooligans!

134
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:18,736
Dad, don't hurt me.

135
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:25,619
I've got diabetes.
And you're out to kill me.

136
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,817
I don't see a single tear.

137
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,099
Cry before I kill you.

138
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:37,417
Please, Azzouz, forgive him.

139
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,694
For my sake, let him off.

140
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,615
I'm leaving then.

141
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:48,654
Tomorrow he starts at the barber's.

142
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:03,858
Won't you try some of my sweets?

143
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,732
Right now?

144
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,221
You'll be the first.

145
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:10,171
Are you sure?

146
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:15,771
I'll try just one.

147
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:28,256
The last thing you gave me
didn't work, sheikh.

148
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,698
I still have nightmares.

149
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:34,777
I have just what you need.

150
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:39,261
Every night I have this terrible
powerless feeling.

151
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,135
Put this against your breast.

152
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:51,820
You will be very calm
and you'll sleep soundly.

153
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,419
What would I do without you?

154
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:02,415
Rest assured, I'll keep it close.

155
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,859
What's the ogre doing with the blood?

156
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:10,938
He's tracking the blood, drop by drop,
to Aisha's house.

157
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:15,176
Then he takes hold of her little brother

158
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:18,301
and scrunches him all up.

159
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:23,298
- Why does he need a golden needle?
- Because Aisha's a virgin.

160
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,580
The ogre knows it's forbidden.

161
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:30,294
If he touches a virgin,
his hands will burn.

162
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:33,933
If he lifts her dress, he'll go blind.

163
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:37,812
The ogre is only interested
in children of your age.

164
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,172
Little boys like you
he scrunches down to the last bone.

165
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:44,452
You're the ones talking rubbish.

166
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:50,494
Take good citizen Hamadi Samema
who's sitting right here.

167
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,337
Hamadi Carama, please.

168
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:57,812
Allah planned to make him a rat

169
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:02,373
but the angels intervened
and here's the result.

170
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:05,854
Do you mind,
show some respect for my uniform!

171
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,422
A rat, a rat.

172
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:11,738
- Carama, if you please!
- Rat.

173
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:21,814
Release our comrades!

174
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:42,382
Get on with your work.

175
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:50,783
More trouble again. Soon they'll be
whining again for forgiveness.

176
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,301
Come on, Abdelwahab,
they say some people were killed.

177
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:58,258
It's a fact.

178
00:19:58,503 --> 00:19:59,652
As for me,

179
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:05,301
I only believe what I read
in the paper.

180
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:10,374
People killed!
People die of diabetes too.

181
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:13,343
You can die in lots of ways.

182
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:16,702
Shut up, here comes Colombo.

183
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,454
Look what the wind's blown in.

184
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:29,058
Do you want a free shave?

185
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,381
What's all this?

186
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:33,614
It's hardly the moment.

187
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:36,776
I'm looking for Youssef Soltane.

188
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:39,335
Was he here this morning?

189
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,342
What's he done to you?

190
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:45,652
Did he try to overthrow your regime?

191
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:47,616
Stop fooling around.

192
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:51,651
My boss is so exacting,
I need the man dead or alive.

193
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:55,619
He's causing us a lot of trouble.

194
00:20:56,143 --> 00:21:00,022
To think we ever considered him
one of us.

195
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:06,653
Tell your boss we're all on his side.

196
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:09,815
If anyone sticks their neck out,

197
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:13,180
we'll be pleased to give them a chop.

198
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:15,771
Believe me.

199
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,819
- Shut up the shop, there's trouble.
- Dad won't like it.

200
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,418
Shut up as quick as you can.

201
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:25,857
Get a move on!

202
00:21:45,143 --> 00:21:46,417
That hurts.

203
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:52,741
That's nothing compared
with this morning. All hell was loose.

204
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:56,259
The police came.
They nearly broke the shop window.

205
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:57,697
It's begun again?

206
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:01,572
I don't like this summerjob.
There's no need for you to go.

207
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:05,099
You can help with your brother's
circumcision.

208
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:45,613
Noura, what are you doing here?

209
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:47,581
I came to see Salih.

210
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,539
Hello, sheikh, what's this?

211
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:56,493
Out shopping like one of us?
Is there a bottle in that basket?

212
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:01,294
Drunkard! Your should repent
of your evil habit.

213
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:04,899
May you never know its pleasures.

214
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:18,095
Don't you dare!

215
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:22,697
It's bad for you.
Don't let me ever catch you again.

216
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:35,582
This boy was pestering the girls
in our street.

217
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:38,383
Our girls don't need any pens.

218
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:43,296
- How dare you hit him?
- Keep out of this.

219
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:46,378
Take your hands off me.

220
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:50,696
I don't believe it.
A big man like you attacking children!

221
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:53,218
It'll be your turn soon.

222
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:57,422
One day your impudent songs
will land you in jail.

223
00:23:57,663 --> 00:23:59,221
This is a new interest!

224
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:03,217
You're starting to hit notes now
rather than people.

225
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:10,896
I swear I'll clout him
unless he sings for me.

226
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:13,338
I don't sing to animals.

227
00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:16,099
Tell him to sing.

228
00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:18,698
Sing, Salih, so we're rid of him.

229
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:20,092
No way!

230
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:21,901
I'll smash up your shop.

231
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:24,338
Sing, he's getting angry.

232
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:26,814
I'd rather die.

233
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:29,293
We'll all sing for you.

234
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:33,331
<i>I've picked you, my sweetest flower</i>

235
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:37,292
<i>I've chosen you, my sweetest flower</i>

236
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:47,658
What's going on?

237
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,657
I was just having a joke with Salih.

238
00:24:55,383 --> 00:24:59,217
What, sweetie, don't you know
who the sweetest flower is?

239
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:00,816
Or have you forgotten?

240
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:06,454
When the cat's away,
the mice play, eh?

241
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,495
Did you think I'd died?

242
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:13,100
Why are you humiliating me?
I was only having a joke.

243
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:14,981
I'm joking too.

244
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,653
See how's he's grown up now.

245
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:20,856
He's become a little man.

246
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:27,176
He's even growing a beard.
Let me feel.

247
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,252
Let's have a touch.

248
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,614
Good grief, Salouha!

249
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:30,293
Is all this your trousseau?

250
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:46,412
Red really suits you.

251
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:29,375
<i>Darling, be nice</i>

252
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:36,016
<i>My love is sincere</i>

253
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:55,654
<i>My love is sincere
but there's nothing doing</i>

254
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:59,498
<i>There's nothing doing
because you're a liar</i>

255
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:21,102
I don't want her in my house.
Try to get rid of her.

256
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:25,660
But she's my relative.

257
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:30,382
Would you turn out your own cousin?

258
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:35,462
I don't have cousins who say no
to rich husbands.

259
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:37,022
I don't want her here.

260
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:39,902
A divorcee - and penniless too.

261
00:28:40,143 --> 00:28:41,462
No way.

262
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:46,852
She'll calm down. And she'll be a help
at the circumcision.

263
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:48,695
Get rid of her.

264
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:51,819
She embroiders beautifully.

265
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:54,702
She embroiders?

266
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:20,893
You won't find this anywhere else.

267
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:24,779
And I've better things to show you.

268
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:34,331
You here already?

269
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:41,582
Don't just stand there.
Take it inside.

270
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,062
I'll keep it for you.

271
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:55,938
Dad.

272
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,221
Is Latifa a virgin?

273
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:05,376
It's none of your business.
Leave that to adults.

274
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:07,011
Out of my sight!

275
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:34,022
What are you up to? You rotters!

276
00:31:34,663 --> 00:31:39,054
Work before play, that's what we agreed.
Let me look too.

277
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:44,132
Don't they have all the luck?

278
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:50,300
My cousin says that in France
they have all this and in colour too.

279
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:55,055
How am I going to see it all
before I die?

280
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:59,541
If only I could see Dalila or Zohra
like that.

281
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,174
This one can see the lot.

282
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:04,822
What do you mean?

283
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:35,781
That's nice.

284
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,657
This one isn't for your father.

285
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:42,418
I'm going to wear it
for the circumcision.

286
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:48,458
You went to the beach on your own.

287
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:51,256
Don't lie to me.

288
00:32:51,663 --> 00:32:55,019
Go and wash the salt off
before you father gets back.

289
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:59,302
<i>I want you to wash me but not here.</i>

290
00:32:59,543 --> 00:33:01,022
Where then? At the neighbour's?

291
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:03,982
No, in the Turkish baths.

292
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:07,499
How come you suddenly like the baths?

293
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:14,732
She's right.

294
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:20,455
The boy is almost as tall as you,
and look at the glint in his eye.

295
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:22,500
He's got acne and I've girls here.

296
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:27,692
I wish it were acne.
He had measles late.

297
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:32,141
He's young and innocent.
He's just tall for his age.

298
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:34,419
Let him go with his father.

299
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:36,335
His father's hopeless.

300
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,336
The boy comes out as filthy
as he went in.

301
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,620
Anyway, everyone is used to him here.

302
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:47,372
Just this once then, but make it snappy.

303
00:34:30,303 --> 00:34:33,295
You're pale. Shall we go home?

304
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:36,137
No, no, I must wash, I'm filthy.

305
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,454
Go and fetch some hot water.

306
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:04,093
What a cutie!
Aren't you the lucky one?

307
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:40,259
Melons. Like melons.

308
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:43,731
What about Fatouma's daughter?

309
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:47,214
Dalila's? More like pears.

310
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:51,419
Oh, heavens! Melons, pears,
apples, figs...

311
00:36:51,663 --> 00:36:54,257
I'd like to drown in them.

312
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:56,897
Was Zohra there?

313
00:37:00,903 --> 00:37:02,939
No, but her grandmother was.

314
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:05,891
What about the rest?

315
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:12,501
Nothing. They all hold flannels
or saucepans in front of themselves.

316
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:15,780
You missed the best part.

317
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:17,900
- Come on.
- Wait.

318
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:22,062
At my brother's circumcision,
there'll be a lot of girls.

319
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:25,700
- What about grub?
- Plenty of that too.

320
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:31,053
All right, but we want to be there
for the preparations too.

321
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:34,659
- Leave it to me.
- That's our boy!

322
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:43,500
How did you get into the baths?

323
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:45,973
I played dumb.

324
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:47,622
Like this?

325
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:49,822
No, like this.

326
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:53,896
Not like that. Like this.

327
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:21,455
You call this embroidery?

328
00:38:25,143 --> 00:38:27,213
You call this meat?

329
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:29,021
I told you, I hate waste.

330
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:35,737
Don't annoy him, he'll wake Salouha.

331
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,017
Pass my bra.

332
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:56,938
This one?

333
00:38:57,623 --> 00:39:00,376
No, it reminds me of my ex.

334
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:02,651
I'll take this one.

335
00:39:12,863 --> 00:39:13,932
I'm going out.

336
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:19,655
Stay for a bit. I've found you
a really interesting partner.

337
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:26,736
Thanks, but I've had enough.
I hate marriage and men. I've no luck.

338
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:31,300
I don't want to know.
I'm late for my injection.

339
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:34,854
So it's injections now.

340
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,572
I hope they work.

341
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:50,822
Let go of me. I feel I'm going to burst.

342
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,534
Calmly now.

343
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,820
I don't want to die.

344
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,379
I don't want to die so young.

345
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:11,420
Don't say things like that.

346
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:13,301
I'll fetch the sheikh.

347
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:16,337
Maybe she's possessed.

348
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:20,534
Fetch some kohl.

349
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:25,774
I want to die beautiful.

350
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:56,339
Be gentle.

351
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,939
- It hurts so!
- It'll soon be over.

352
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:13,182
Evil spirits have stolen my fiancé.

353
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:17,214
They've put him down a well.

354
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:27,180
There's certainly a treasure here,
hidden under a stone.

355
00:41:27,423 --> 00:41:28,981
We must find it.

356
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:33,853
The treasure is in me,
waiting to be discovered.

357
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,051
Not under the stone but in me.

358
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:19,215
- You've brought the girl?
- As I promised.

359
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:22,217
She's from a good family.

360
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:26,776
She only had her grandmother
and now she's died.

361
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:28,571
Poor girl.

362
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:34,337
Now she's an orphan.
She has nobody but God.

363
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:38,021
Leila, come here, my dear.

364
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:45,812
- This lady will take you in.
- I'll treat her like my own daughter.

365
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,373
I'll teach her how to run
a household.

366
00:42:49,623 --> 00:42:51,261
Teach her embroidery.

367
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,016
What's that white streak?

368
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:56,502
Quiet!

369
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:01,134
All her family perished. They say...

370
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:05,580
They say the white streak was caused

371
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:08,136
by the shock.

372
00:43:08,943 --> 00:43:10,376
Henna will hide it.

373
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:14,099
I'll take her to the baths tomorrow.

374
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,698
On no account do that.

375
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:19,537
Evil spirits detest heat.

376
00:43:20,383 --> 00:43:22,738
The baths might provoke them.

377
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:47,092
I expect your grandmother spoilt you.
We'll bring you up properly.

378
00:43:57,183 --> 00:44:00,539
Call that sweeping? I'll show you.

379
00:44:04,423 --> 00:44:08,132
Get a move on. We'll have
a double celebration tonight.

380
00:44:14,023 --> 00:44:18,699
The political brigade's taken
my husband. Help me!

381
00:44:24,783 --> 00:44:29,982
Don't get involved. They bit off
more than they could chew.

382
00:44:31,423 --> 00:44:32,458
Look at this.

383
00:44:42,823 --> 00:44:46,577
Here's a present for your new guest.

384
00:44:47,823 --> 00:44:50,053
Tell her it's from me.

385
00:44:50,463 --> 00:44:51,612
What's her name?

386
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:57,460
She's very beautiful. Give her this.

387
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:14,419
See this never happens again.

388
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:17,142
I've told you before.

389
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:21,695
How many more times must I say it?

390
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:24,659
Young girls shouldn't let this happen.

391
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:36,462
Get some cigarettes
but don't let your father see.

392
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:39,854
And buy me two hundred grammes
of halwa

393
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,298
and a bottle of almond syrup.

394
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:44,854
Hurry, I'm dying for a smoke.

395
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:51,493
- All that with this?
- It's all I have. Keep the change.

396
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:57,462
I'm late for my injection.

397
00:45:57,703 --> 00:46:00,536
- Latifa.
- What is it? I'm in a hurry.

398
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:06,016
- Give me your chewing-gum.
- Why? Ask your mother.

399
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,538
No, I want yours.

400
00:46:12,663 --> 00:46:13,732
You rascal!

401
00:46:55,703 --> 00:47:00,333
Let the cricket go.
He's Halfaouine's local artist.

402
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:05,181
Is your new song for the circumcision
of Noura's brother?

403
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,414
It's certainly not for mine!

404
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:25,458
Well done.

405
00:47:28,743 --> 00:47:31,052
You're a star.

406
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:35,939
What about me? Have you forgotten?

407
00:47:36,183 --> 00:47:37,582
Do a swap.

408
00:47:56,823 --> 00:48:00,054
I can't smell a thing.
Only washing powder.

409
00:48:00,303 --> 00:48:04,581
Sorry. She washed it
before I could get hold of it.

410
00:48:04,943 --> 00:48:09,619
You're hopeless. In the baths
you gaze at flannels and saucepans.

411
00:48:09,943 --> 00:48:13,094
- You're a nitwit.
- I'm not a nitwit.

412
00:48:15,223 --> 00:48:20,980
Next time I'll bring you
Latifa's flannel hot from the baths.

413
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:26,702
<i>Hop, little terrace bird,
flap your wings and fly about</i>

414
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:33,018
<i>Little bird, hop, hop, hop
from rooftop to rooftop</i>

415
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:36,217
<i>Let the celebrations begin</i>

416
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:47,136
Hand off!
You've chosen the wrong woman.

417
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:52,538
I mean it.

418
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:33,498
Come here a minute.

419
00:49:37,623 --> 00:49:41,411
You're neglecting me. I'm jealous.
Do up my bra for me.

420
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:57,371
This is from Salih, the shoemaker.

421
00:50:14,823 --> 00:50:19,578
Tell that fool
pigs will fly first.

422
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:37,813
She's so vindictive.

423
00:50:38,063 --> 00:50:39,496
You've said worse.

424
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,301
Come off it!

425
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:51,661
I'd do it if I wanted. You know me.

426
00:50:51,903 --> 00:50:55,020
You're not exactly
a shrinking violet, are you?

427
00:50:59,183 --> 00:51:03,222
You won't succeed.
You haven't got what it takes.

428
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:12,015
The things you hear!

429
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:21,738
Where are you going?
They'll cut your willy off tomorrow.

430
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:25,293
Leave me alone, Zakia.
I'm already circumcised.

431
00:51:25,943 --> 00:51:29,936
That's not the end.
Tomorrow they'll cut off the rest.

432
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:34,532
Give him a break, Zakia.

433
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,581
Don't worry, dear.
No one's going to rob you.

434
00:51:38,743 --> 00:51:42,702
You should use his proper name.
He's a young man now.

435
00:51:42,943 --> 00:51:44,171
A man?

436
00:51:45,223 --> 00:51:48,021
What makes him a man?
Not that little peanut!

437
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:50,262
You're very excited, Zakia.

438
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:54,337
Is your husband
neglecting you for the shop?

439
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:59,579
Has your greengrocer husband
run out of cucumbers?

440
00:52:04,183 --> 00:52:06,299
- Stay put!
- Leave me alone!

441
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,614
All right, off you go.

442
00:52:08,863 --> 00:52:13,653
<i>On my wedding night
he came and stood by my bed</i>

443
00:52:13,903 --> 00:52:16,895
<i>So handsome and holding as a present</i>

444
00:52:17,143 --> 00:52:20,180
<i>A nice fat aubergine</i>

445
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:28,619
<i>Zakia is the queen of the garden</i>

446
00:52:28,863 --> 00:52:32,253
<i>She likes her vegetable basket
to be full</i>

447
00:52:32,503 --> 00:52:35,734
<i>When she's looking for a cucumber</i>

448
00:52:35,983 --> 00:52:42,821
<i>She like the goods in her basket
covered by a good lid</i>

449
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:44,382
<i>And her meat...</i>

450
00:53:10,823 --> 00:53:11,699
One.

451
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,420
A man never cries.

452
00:53:14,663 --> 00:53:15,937
Next.

453
00:53:16,703 --> 00:53:17,818
A man...

454
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,377
I'll repeat it. Don't you dare cry.

455
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:27,339
A man doesn't hang around with women.
Understand?

456
00:53:28,103 --> 00:53:31,095
You may go out today.
Off with you.

457
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:45,939
We don't see much of you these days.

458
00:53:46,183 --> 00:53:49,255
Salih, I called at the shop
but it was closed.

459
00:53:49,663 --> 00:53:50,937
Put the basket down.

460
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:54,018
What did she say?

461
00:53:55,143 --> 00:53:58,818
She said pigs would fly first.

462
00:53:59,063 --> 00:54:01,054
Don't broadcast it.

463
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:07,022
You look upset.
Can't you afford what you want?

464
00:54:07,423 --> 00:54:12,133
Concentrate on what you're doing.
Some apples aren't for sale.

465
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:13,452
I wish you luck.

466
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,495
- Is the couscous good?
- Yes, it's almost ready.

467
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:04,102
I'll put the sauce on in a minute.

468
00:55:11,023 --> 00:55:11,978
Mum.

469
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:16,179
Are all these people sleeping here?

470
00:55:16,423 --> 00:55:19,062
Of course. There's plenty of room.

471
00:55:21,983 --> 00:55:22,938
And Dad?

472
00:55:23,703 --> 00:55:25,295
He's sleeping with you?

473
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:27,818
Where else would he sleep?

474
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:04,659
Hurry up.

475
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:05,938
Run along.

476
00:56:06,303 --> 00:56:08,134
Get a move on, we're late.

477
00:56:12,183 --> 00:56:15,459
We're off to the baths.
I'm counting on you, Salouha.

478
00:56:15,703 --> 00:56:20,015
It'll all be ready.
Enjoy yourselves at the baths.

479
00:56:25,183 --> 00:56:26,172
Come outside.

480
00:56:26,423 --> 00:56:28,778
No. I have to clean up.

481
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:31,856
This time I'll see everything.

482
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:33,092
You'd better!

483
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:54,736
- Was that good?
- Yes. But go away now.

484
00:57:00,863 --> 00:57:05,334
We've all come.
The whole family is here today.

485
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,778
What is this, Jamila?

486
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:13,573
Haven't I already told you
he's too old?

487
00:57:13,823 --> 00:57:15,734
You're going too far.

488
00:57:15,983 --> 00:57:18,702
Please, won't you do me a favour?

489
00:57:19,223 --> 00:57:22,818
Today his little brother
is being circumcised.

490
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:26,817
It's a bigger day than my wedding.
Don't spoil it.

491
00:57:27,063 --> 00:57:29,179
We're bringing you a lot of custom.

492
00:57:29,423 --> 00:57:33,735
What can I do?
All right, you win, go ahead.

493
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,099
Enjoy your celebrations.

494
00:59:23,383 --> 00:59:27,774
Go back home.
I'll tell your father about this.

495
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:56,617
Well, Noura?

496
00:59:58,183 --> 00:59:59,457
What about the flannel?

497
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:03,375
Hurry, the men are coming.

498
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:43,854
Noura has disappeared.
Go and find him for me.

499
01:02:44,103 --> 01:02:45,695
I'm worried about him.

500
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:13,575
Where are you hiding?

501
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:57,741
Where are the cakes?

502
01:03:58,063 --> 01:03:59,416
My beauties.

503
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,579
I'll be in a trance soon.

504
01:04:12,903 --> 01:04:13,972
Come over here.

505
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:19,573
- Have you seen Noura?
- We'll help you find him.

506
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,780
Excuse me while I take
my cough syrup.

507
01:04:43,023 --> 01:04:45,014
Doctor's orders.

508
01:05:01,783 --> 01:05:07,335
<i>A woman loved me but I rejected her</i>

509
01:05:09,463 --> 01:05:12,660
<i>Now I'm in love
and the woman rejects me</i>

510
01:05:13,063 --> 01:05:16,851
<i>I was hard on the woman who loved me</i>

511
01:05:17,103 --> 01:05:19,697
<i>Now my mistress is hard on me</i>

512
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:30,542
<i>When I was loved I was unkind,
I showed no pity</i>

513
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:38,858
<i>Today I'm paying for my wickedness</i>

514
01:05:46,223 --> 01:05:50,694
<i>I don't annoy her,
I don't pester her or beg</i>

515
01:05:50,943 --> 01:05:55,573
<i>But you reap what you sow</i>

516
01:05:55,823 --> 01:06:01,534
<i>Now, if anyone says they love me,
I say I love them too</i>

517
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:04,536
<i>Where is love, where is love?</i>

518
01:06:14,623 --> 01:06:19,743
<i>No. I don't love you, I don't trust you,
you won't stay with me</i>

519
01:06:19,983 --> 01:06:22,543
<i>Even if I love you deep down</i>

520
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:29,132
<i>I'll say the contrary</i>

521
01:06:45,423 --> 01:06:49,018
- Where's this talent been hiding?
- How very charming.

522
01:07:11,103 --> 01:07:12,775
This looks good.

523
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:15,021
Very tasty.

524
01:07:15,463 --> 01:07:17,021
Stop being such pests.

525
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:19,219
We're not doing anything.

526
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:38,537
<i>All the friends and family
are gathered for the circumcision</i>

527
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,261
I'm going for my injection.

528
01:08:59,784 --> 01:09:02,856
The man isn't their uncle,
he's a wizard.

529
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:04,901
A robber of hearts.

530
01:09:05,584 --> 01:09:09,702
He goes out each night
looking for small children.

531
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:14,096
When he finds one,
he puts him in his bag

532
01:09:14,424 --> 01:09:16,176
and takes him to a deserted place.

533
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:19,861
There, he looks at the child's palm
for the mark.

534
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:24,416
If he finds a ring there
or a white dot on his iris,

535
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:29,135
he kills the child
and rips his heart out.

536
01:09:29,384 --> 01:09:34,822
Then he burns him to find the treasure
hidden in the earth.

537
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:55,937
I wrote this play especially for you.

538
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:59,415
Being an actress isn't just
a question of greasepaint.

539
01:09:59,664 --> 01:10:05,580
Whoever heard of a play written
for just two people?

540
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:09,658
I'm not the kind of girl
you think I am.

541
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:15,458
Why do you doubt my motives?
They're entirely honourable.

542
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:21,783
I'm only thinking about art.
I've no evil intentions.

543
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:27,052
I'm not that naive.
I may be divorced

544
01:10:27,304 --> 01:10:30,262
but I've a family and friends
to protect me.

545
01:10:30,904 --> 01:10:32,701
Is this gold?

546
01:10:33,224 --> 01:10:34,862
Stop that.

547
01:10:35,624 --> 01:10:37,023
Very well.

548
01:10:39,064 --> 01:10:43,455
God be my witness.
You made the first move.

549
01:12:52,824 --> 01:12:56,737
Hold your aunt's foot still
so we get the correct size.

550
01:12:58,664 --> 01:13:00,575
You need someone to help you.

551
01:13:02,104 --> 01:13:08,100
No, I manage very well alone.
It's much better that way.

552
01:13:08,744 --> 01:13:11,053
I'd like a pair of wedding shoes.

553
01:13:13,304 --> 01:13:17,013
Sorry, I don't stock
that type of footwear.

554
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:21,302
What if a client

555
01:13:21,544 --> 01:13:24,342
is patient and willing to wait?

556
01:13:25,064 --> 01:13:26,736
The other foot, please.

557
01:13:59,944 --> 01:14:01,172
Leave them be.

558
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:04,133
What are you doing?

559
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:30,138
Seal it up properly.

560
01:14:31,624 --> 01:14:36,573
That's one subversive bolt-hole
that will give us no more trouble.

561
01:14:37,184 --> 01:14:40,415
He can't hide forever.
Sooner or later,

562
01:14:40,664 --> 01:14:42,461
Ali will be denounced.

563
01:14:42,904 --> 01:14:44,383
Congratulations.

564
01:14:45,024 --> 01:14:49,939
First it was children.
Now you attack empty shops.

565
01:14:50,704 --> 01:14:52,137
How courageous!

566
01:14:53,344 --> 01:14:58,976
It's not a shop, it's a meeting-place
for political activists and drunks.

567
01:14:59,224 --> 01:15:03,775
You'll be one of the first
to be hit by its closure.

568
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:05,497
Follow me.

569
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:13,977
That's it, follow the little captain.
And congratulations on the stripes.

570
01:15:19,784 --> 01:15:21,979
What are you doing here?

571
01:15:22,224 --> 01:15:25,057
This is men's business. Buzz off.

572
01:16:39,984 --> 01:16:41,178
Here, take these.

573
01:16:56,984 --> 01:17:00,613
When are the baths open for men?

574
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:05,934
We're closing to clean them.

575
01:19:20,904 --> 01:19:26,137
Stop looking gloomy.
You'll miss your family when you leave.

576
01:19:27,584 --> 01:19:32,658
Look at me. I'm alone. No children,
no family, but I can't fly away.

577
01:19:33,024 --> 01:19:35,379
My wings have been clipped.

578
01:19:36,744 --> 01:19:39,212
Luckily I've this friend.

579
01:19:51,864 --> 01:19:55,539
<i>You help me laugh, cry,
forget and chatter</i>

580
01:19:57,744 --> 01:20:01,498
<i>I've given you my all
but what have you given me?</i>

581
01:20:01,744 --> 01:20:05,532
<i>You wicked bottle,
you dear old bottle</i>

582
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:11,097
Salih, when does a boy become a man?

583
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:50,300
<i>One mind for all- the President's</i>

584
01:20:51,744 --> 01:20:53,143
I don't agree.

585
01:21:25,544 --> 01:21:28,297
<i>Our minds - not the President's</i>

586
01:21:28,544 --> 01:21:29,863
Isn't that better?

587
01:21:31,064 --> 01:21:33,532
<i>I've given you my all</i>

588
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:41,214
<i>But what have you given me,
dear old bottle?</i>

589
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,696
I've had enough. I'm tired.

590
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:05,737
And I'm getting old.

591
01:22:08,984 --> 01:22:10,975
No, Salih, you're still great.

592
01:23:10,104 --> 01:23:14,495
You can't deny it.
Someone saw you write it.

593
01:23:19,984 --> 01:23:23,659
Not only do walls have ears
but you see in the dark too.

594
01:23:23,944 --> 01:23:25,696
Don't act dumb.

595
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:27,579
Take him away.

596
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,698
Where are you taking him?

597
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:32,504
Watch out or we'll close your shop.

598
01:23:32,744 --> 01:23:35,497
I'm to be a guest of the prison.

599
01:23:38,904 --> 01:23:42,055
Noura, tell your aunt
I've been called away.

600
01:23:42,424 --> 01:23:43,982
Ask her to wait.

601
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:45,180
Try to be patient. Tomorrow
is another day. Nothing lasts for ever.

602
01:25:46,104 --> 01:25:48,459
One can't do the impossible.

603
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:56,862
As you're stubborn and won't go
to the baths with you father,

604
01:25:57,104 --> 01:26:02,258
Leila must wash your hair.
I want you clean when I come back.

605
01:26:16,144 --> 01:26:18,339
That hurts.

606
01:26:18,784 --> 01:26:20,695
My mother is much gentler.

607
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:22,743
Don't be a baby.

608
01:26:23,664 --> 01:26:25,063
I've finished.

609
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:30,701
Why won't they let you into the baths?

610
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:34,132
Have you a glint in your eye?

611
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:37,259
I don't know. No one's told me.

612
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:49,103
You're all wet.

613
01:26:49,864 --> 01:26:53,095
You should take off your clothes

614
01:26:53,344 --> 01:26:55,300
and do like in the baths.

615
01:27:21,584 --> 01:27:23,142
Is that how they do it?

616
01:27:23,824 --> 01:27:26,975
In the baths,
they take everything off.

617
01:27:27,464 --> 01:27:29,773
Ask Moncef and Mounir.

618
01:27:31,984 --> 01:27:33,053
I'm shy.

619
01:27:33,784 --> 01:27:36,298
You shouldn't be. It's not a sin.

620
01:27:36,624 --> 01:27:41,652
In the baths, women take off
their clothes and massage each other.

621
01:27:41,944 --> 01:27:44,777
I can show you, if you want.

622
01:28:08,904 --> 01:28:11,577
This is how it's done.

623
01:28:16,744 --> 01:28:18,336
No, don't do that.

624
01:28:18,664 --> 01:28:21,701
I'll slap you like my mother does me.

625
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:36,462
Pack your things.
The sheikh will take you away.

626
01:30:16,184 --> 01:30:19,301
How long was Leila here?
Oh, thank you.

627
01:30:20,304 --> 01:30:25,503
May Allah make you
ever more prosperous and wealthy.

628
01:30:26,704 --> 01:30:29,741
And don't worry about a servant.

629
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:34,012
I'll find you a harder-working maid.

630
01:30:34,264 --> 01:30:35,982
Please don't bother.

631
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:39,422
Azzouz, you are so generous.

632
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,100
You're so big-hearted and generous.

633
01:30:43,344 --> 01:30:45,574
Don't hesitate.

634
01:30:45,984 --> 01:30:49,056
Take me with you, sheikh.
Take me.

635
01:30:49,304 --> 01:30:50,976
Ask me to go with you.

636
01:30:54,304 --> 01:30:57,979
Go after him.
Find out where he lives.

637
01:30:58,224 --> 01:31:01,182
I couldn't.
He must make the first step.

638
01:31:17,544 --> 01:31:18,818
And money for the journey.

639
01:31:21,664 --> 01:31:22,938
Thank you.

640
01:31:26,024 --> 01:31:27,503
There's no doubt.

641
01:31:28,664 --> 01:31:30,734
That son of yours

642
01:31:31,784 --> 01:31:33,502
is grown up now.

643
01:31:45,264 --> 01:31:46,379
Come here.

644
01:31:46,864 --> 01:31:47,819
Hurry!

645
01:31:50,024 --> 01:31:51,093
Are you deaf?

646
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,136
What's this? Defiance?

647
01:31:56,024 --> 01:31:56,979
Come here.

648
01:31:58,384 --> 01:32:01,979
Where are you going?
Come back down.

649
01:32:02,424 --> 01:32:05,575
Come down or I'll give you what for.

650
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:10,737
And where are you going?

651
01:32:11,864 --> 01:32:15,379
Forgive me,
but I'm late for my injection.

652
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:24,295
What's got into everybody?

653
01:32:24,744 --> 01:32:25,893
Come down!

654
01:32:28,264 --> 01:32:32,894
Come down or I'll kill you.
I mean it, I'll murder you.

<i>Little bird, terrace bird</i>

656
01:32:48,184 --> 01:32:51,062
<i>Let him try his wings and fly</i>

657
01:32:51,304 --> 01:32:54,614
<i>He lives in paradise and he's free</i>

658
01:33:13,424 --> 01:33:16,461
<i>The little bird has grown and can fly</i>

659
01:33:19,944 --> 01:33:23,016
<i>The little bird dreams of flight</i>

660
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:26,461
<i>Let him try his wings and fly</i>

661
01:33:45,544 --> 01:33:48,934
<i>He learnt to fly in Halfaouine</i>

662
01:33:51,944 --> 01:33:55,095
<i>One day he flew off
and left me sad</i>

663
01:33:55,344 --> 01:33:58,461
<i>Let him try his wings and fly</i>

664
01:34:17,224 --> 01:34:20,455
<i>I am the foolish one and he the wise</i>

665
01:34:23,544 --> 01:34:26,616
<i>I still thought I was young</i>

666
01:34:26,864 --> 01:34:30,140
<i>Let him try his wings and fly</i>
