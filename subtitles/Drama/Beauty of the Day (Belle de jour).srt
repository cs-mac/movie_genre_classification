<i>Episode 23</i>

35
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,400
Miraculous Doctor Lin, then is it that as long as I find a Heaven Level pure yang practitioner,

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Xiao Xiao will not die?

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,000
Being able to sustain her life doesn't necessarily mean that she will not die.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,600
Initially, it's true that a Heaven Level martial arts expert will be able to suppress it.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,200
But as she grows older, this yin energy

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
will also grow stronger,

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
and it'll take more and more effort to suppress it.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,100
Until it reaches a point where it'll be totally useless.

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,010
Miraculous Doctor Lin, is there any other way?

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Actually there's still a way. It's just...

45
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,000
The medicine you're giving is becoming less and less effective.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,300
Is it that there's some problem with this medicine that was newly developed?

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,410
Professor Mao said that this new medicine needs some time to get used to.

48
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,370
Time. Time.

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,000
Right now, I'm like a ticking time bomb. Even I almost can't control myself anymore. Don't you know?

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm really almost running out of time!

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,200
Don't panic, don't panic. We're all aware of that.

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,000
At that time, you guys were the one who said, that as long as I cooperate with your research,

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
you guys will help restore my body.

54
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,610
But until now, there's no progress at all!

55
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,760
How long more must I wait before you'll be able to solve the problem with my body?!

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Calm down and listen to me. Actually, recently, we found this thing called Holy Fire Spirit Fruit.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,000
It's said that it can help control the chaotic energy in your body, and can even help sustain people's life.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Professor Mao said that, perhaps, this might be able to help you.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Holy Fire Spirit Fruit?

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,100
That's right.

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,250
In order to help you,

62
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,000
Master Bing has employed quite a number of people to find the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Now is the transition period.

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,620
Hang on first. You need to have faith in Professor Mao.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,100
<i>[5 Years Ago]</i>

66
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,320
<i>Lad, you've woken up.</i>

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,800
<i>Are you still feeling unwell anywhere?</i>

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,750
<i>Where am I?</i>

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,780
<i>This is my territory.</i>

70
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,610
<i>Don't worry, no one will harm you here.</i>

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,620
<i>And you are...</i>

72
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,960
<i>You can call me Brother Hua.</i>

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
<i>How did I get here?</i>

74
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,270
<i>Lad,</i>

75
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,980
<i>a few days ago, you did something that created an uproar,</i>

76
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,650
<i>you -- Chi Feng High School.</i>

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
<i>You don't remember?</i>

78
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,550
<i>How can that be?</i>

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,600
<i>I... I actually...</i>

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
<i>This won't do. I need to go.</i>

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,660
<i>Xiao Hu (Little Tiger),</i>

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,200
<i>don't be in such a rush first. I guess that you've nowhere to go anyway.</i>

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,900
<i>You... How do you know my name?</i>

84
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,190
<i>I know the secret of your body.</i>

85
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>Professor Mao wants me to tell you not to worry. Stay here</i>

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>and cooperate with me. He will cure your illness.</i>

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>Professor Mao... hasn't he died?</i>

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,600
<i>How could he...?</i>

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>There's a lot of time ahead of us, you'll get to know about it in the future.</i>

90
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,200
<i>At that time, Master Bing and Professor Mao wanted me to rescue that rascal and bring him back here,</i>

91
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,800
<i>take him in, and even help him develop a cure.</i>

92
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,950
<i>After investing so much in him,</i>

93
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,240
<i>one day, I must get it all back from him, interest and all.</i>

94
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,200
<i>Actually, recently, we found this thing called Holy Fire Spirit Fruit.</i>

95
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,800
<i>It's said that it can help control the chaotic energy in your body, and can even help sustain people's life.</i>

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,700
Holy Fire Spirit Fruit?

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Can it really help restore me?

98
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,000
<i>Strange. Why would that guy, Han Bin, be here?</i>

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,700
<i>Could it be that he's working here?</i>

100
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,900
Is there something you need me to do?

101
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,280
Situ Ling, fifteen years old,

102
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,800
a girl who was in the prime of her life.

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,600
But because of a student's loss of control,

104
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,200
her young life was ended.

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Her brother spent five years

106
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
and finally found the murderer.

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,500
The murderer...

108
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,850
is you.

109
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,410
I hope you can understand Situ Jiong's feelings.

110
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,930
It is very hard for him to forgive you.

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,100
I know. I never dreamed of anyone being able to forgive me.

112
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,250
But I think, I might be able to understand what you're feeling.

113
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,210
So from today onward,

114
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,600
Situ Jiong and I won't order you to do anything again.

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,600
<i>Understand? What's going on?</i>

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
<i>Is she playing some kind of trick?</i>

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Situ Jiong, he's... actually a good person,

118
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,000
please give him some time. Maybe time, will be able to lessen his pain.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,400
Could you?

120
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,800
Haven't I told you before? If there's nothing the matter, don't come here to find me.

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
If there's anything the matter, even more, you shouldn't come here to find me.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,400
What if your identity gets exposed?

123
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,800
Brother Hua, please don't be angry. I've always been careful!

124
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,000
Besides, I purposely came out without putting on my disguise.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
I look so different, no one will recognize me.

126
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,600
Hurry and tell me. How's the progress with the mission I assigned you the last time?

127
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,340
Err... to tell you the truth,

128
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,780
regarding the school... I might not be able to go back anymore.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What happened?

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,600
The mission failed. And Lin Yi's even got a voice recording as evidence.

131
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,400
What you mean to say is, not only were you unsuccessful in doing harm to him,

132
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,500
instead he got a hold on you. Can you put it that way?

133
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,600
That's right.

134
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
Good. Great! Then, you can sit in jail then.

135
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Boss, please just do me a favor.

136
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,400
Boss, all these years I've worked, even if I didn't have any accomplishments, I still worked hard, didn't I?

137
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Back then, when you sent me to the school undercover, we agreed that it would just be for three years.

138
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,400
But after three years, another three years, and after those three years, another three years...

139
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Counting the years, I've been working undercover in the school for almost ten years already.

140
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Boss, help me out. Give me a chance, will you?

141
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,900
Fine!

142
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,040
I will give you a chance, and help you.

143
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,780
If you want to show your loyalty for me,

144
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,050
it's best that you take responsibility for everything.

145
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,390
Rest assured, I won't treat you and your family too shabbily.

146
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,990
Remember, the cleaner you cut ties with me,

147
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,030
the better your family will live.

148
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,280
And as for you, the earlier you will be able to get out of jail as well. Understand?

149
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Yes, Boss.

150
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,800
Is there anything else?

151
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then why don't you hurry up and leave?

153
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes, Boss.

154
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,800
Li Yao.

155
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes, Brother Hua.

156
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Arrange for a neat car accident to send him off.

157
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay, let's try doing it now.

158
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,800
<i>There is currently no one answering the number you've dialed. Please call again later.</i>

159
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,160
Originally, I was thinking of asking Daddy out to eat.

160
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,900
Forget it.

161
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
But if I suddenly appeared in front of him,

162
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,300
he definitely will be very happy, wouldn't he?

163
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
<i>[The ten things to do before I die]</i>

164
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Help you find Holy Fire Spirit Fruit?

165
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes. Lin Yi, will you consider taking up this mission?

166
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,700
After all, this is my personal matter.

167
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,900
For public reasons, I can't use the country's secret agents, for personal reasons, in light of our previous good partnership,

168
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,800
I would feel more reassured if I entrust this to you.

169
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Uncle Feng, but that old fart-

170
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,400
<i>Legend has it that this is a very rare and mystical fruit,</i>

171
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>called Holy Fire Spirit Fruit, which is a fruit that is purely yang.</i>

172
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,180
<i>It contains the most yang energy between Heaven and Earth.</i>

173
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,400
<i>If it is consumed, it can suppress the yin energy in the body,</i>

174
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,500
<i>for decades.</i>

175
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
<i>That's fantastic.</i>

176
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
<i>But this fruit hasn't undergone actual test verification.</i>

177
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,400
<i>The treatment effect differs for everyone.</i>

178
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,000
<i>It can be used for some. But for some, they might experience reverse effects.</i>

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,700
<i>Miraculous Doctor Lin, what does that Holy Fire Spirit Fruit look like? Where can we get it?</i>

180
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,800
<i>After all, it was from ancient medicine transcripts that I read of the existence of this type of fruit.</i>

181
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,300
<i>I only know that it's an excellent antidote for chilly yin poison.</i>

182
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,400
<i>As for where to look for it, and what it looks like, I don't know about that.</i>

183
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,300
I know that the regarding the questions of where the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit, whether it exists or not,

184
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,000
or even whether it's just a fake myth, there are still no answers to them.

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But Xiao Xiao only has a year left. As long as there's still any strand of hope,

186
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,130
I need to give my utmost to try.

187
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Rest assured. In the finding process, I will provide you all the assistance you need.

188
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,900
Sorry, Uncle Feng. Because the current mission I'm on still hasn't ended,

189
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,000
if I withdrew to help you, it's not fair for my employer,

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and it's also not my style.

191
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,200
Have you gotten it?

192
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I got it from the black market.

193
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,400
This... is the map you wanted.

194
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
This is great.

195
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,300
I finally collected all the things necessary.

196
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,400
You've arrived just in time. I have some news to tell you.

197
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,860
There's a cure for your body.

198
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,500
Huh?

199
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,200
As long as I hand these two treasures to Master Bing,

200
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,000
I believe that Master Bing will quickly dispatch men and archaeologists to study it.

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,100
In this way, we'll be able to find the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit that you need.

202
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,500
These two things...

203
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,900
That's right.

204
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,400
This is the medical practice record log handwritten by the Godly Doctor, Zhang Li Ju.

205
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,600
In it, it clearly records the miraculous effects of the legendary Holy Fire Spirit Fruit

206
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,400
from the Fire Spirit Tree.

207
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,880
Brother Hua, but the words written on it is all in ancient script. How can we read it?

208
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,440
That's why we need to find archaeologists to explain it for us.

209
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,400
And the map that Li Yao found,

210
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,400
is the treasure map that has the location of the Fire Spirit Tree.

211
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,000
As long as we find the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit,

212
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,800
and follow the directions given on the medical practice record log,

213
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,300
we should be able to solve the problem with your body.

214
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,450
Han Bin,

215
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,300
your hardship days are almost over.

216
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,200
Brother Hua,

217
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,600
you're really going through so much trouble, just to save him?

218
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,300
Didn't you say that the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit was to be used to develop new medicines to make money?

219
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,940
Saving him is, of course, only one of the reasons.

220
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,700
As long as we find this magical Holy Fire Spirit Fruit,

221
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,100
Professor Mao will be able to stay put in the research laboratory to research.

222
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,600
Come that day, he'll be able to invent <i>even more</i> medicines which will be able to make money.

223
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,080
I will sell drugs in one hand, and antidotes in the other.

224
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll definitely make shitloads of money.

225
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,100
Brother Hua's brilliant.

226
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,400
And finding the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit as soon as possible,

227
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,000
can help improve his problem of losing control.

228
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,390
Only then, will we be able to properly make use of his powerful strength.

229
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,200
That is what Master Bing, and us,

230
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,300
would really consider as helping.

231
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,100
This is what I was aiming for in taking him in.

232
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,400
Why? Why?

233
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,000
I'd already mentally prepared myself that I'd only have a year left to live.

234
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,090
But the moment I heard my dad say

235
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,200
that there was still hope for my body, as long as they find the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit-

236
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Holy Fire Spirit Fruit?

237
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,620
I suddenly wanted so much to continue living!

238
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,300
Why did this happen?

239
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,200
What am I to do?

240
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,860
Someone like me,

241
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,600
am I really entitled to be saved?

242
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,000
The ten things to do before I die...

243
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,200
Holy Fire Spirit Fruit...

244
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I've already searched all the databases and journals.

245
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,220
Even in the top research centers of the world, there's no information about the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit.

246
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,030
What to do? I can't find it.

247
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,500
Where in the world can it be found?

248
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,110
As expected, at this time, none of them are here.

249
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,920
If I didn't get it wrong, there shouldn't be any CCTV cameras in their office.

250
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,800
This-This really is the medical practicing record log left by a doctor from ancient times.

251
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,000
The Holy Fire Spirit Fruit's introduction and location are recorded in these two things.

252
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,200
But Han Bin, why do you have these things?

253
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,800
I can't tell you where they come from, but... there's also other people looking for the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit.

254
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,000
You must find it before them to save Feng Xiao Xiao.

255
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,800
Why are you telling me all these?

256
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I want... to trouble you to help me take it to Situ Jiong.

257
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Situ Jiong?

258
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,000
If I'm the one who hands it to him, he definitely won't want to see me,

259
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,400
maybe... even suspect what my true motives are.

260
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,760
But... why do you want to do this?

261
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,400
I want... to let Feng Xiao Xiao continue living.

262
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,000
Actually Han Bin doesn't want to let you know that he's the one who gave it to you.

263
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,590
Just take it that I'm a busybody.

264
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Lin Yi, I hope that you can promise me something.

265
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,600
What's going on with you and Han Bin? You guys keep doing this to me.

266
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,040
Brother Hua, it really is that lad all right.

267
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,800
Who'd have thought that this lad would be so daring.

268
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,700
He actually dared to secretly sneak into my office.

269
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,450
I want to teach him what happens to those who betray me.

270
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,900
Go find him and bring him here.

271
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes, Brother Hua.

272
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,700
How come I fell asleep here?

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Where's Situ?

274
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,900
Has he gone to class?

275
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,460
Why didn't he tell me before he left?

276
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,800
<i>Xiao Xiao, by the time you see this message,</i>

277
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,200
<i>I've already left to find the location of the Holy Fire Spirit Fruit.</i>

278
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,800
<i>I don't know how much time I will spend, but I promise you</i>

279
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,000
<i>that I'll definitely rush back before your 20th birthday.</i>

280
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,840
<i>Sorry,</i>

281
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>I'd originally promised that I'd stay with you every day this year, and celebrate your birthday with you,</i>

282
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
<i>but please forgive my greediness.</i>

283
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,000
<i>I think that, if I sacrifice this period of time, very soon, I'll be able to accompany you every year.</i>

284
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Can you forgive me for breaking my promise?</i>

285
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,790
<i>You must wait for me. I'll definitely find this antidote.</i>

286
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,830
Why is he still so silly?

287
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,300
Hi.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
You- Who are you?

289
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Good question.

290
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,400
Ah Huang. Ah Huang!

291
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
What do you want? If it's regarding money, it's easy to discuss.

292
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Why did you betray Chu Peng Zhan?

293
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,400
Were you sent by someone?

294
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,300
Tell me the answer.

295
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,250
Because of my son.

296
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:24,350
Since I divorced with my wife, I placed all my focus on my son.

297
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,000
I wanted to train him to take over my career, so that he'd be able to carve out his own success.

298
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,200
But who'd have thought that he'd be addicted to video games, and even learned to abuse drugs,

299
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,000
and owed a whole bunch of money for drugs.

300
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,600
I only found out later.

301
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I wasn't able to raise the ransom fund that they demanded in that short time span either.

302
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,400
And just at that time, I don't know where Jin Gu Bang got the news from,

303
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,800
he came to find me and said that if I was willing to do him a favor,

304
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,400
he'd provide the funds to help me ransom my son,

305
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,810
and help me keep it a secret, and not expose this scandal.

306
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,600
So I agreed.

307
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,300
I really let Chairman Chu down.

308
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,080
Sorry.

309
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,760
<i>Seems like Uncle Chu was right.</i>

310
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,500
<i>This Xie Guang Bo really doesn't seem to be a bad person.</i>

311
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Ohh... So that's what happened. Old Xie's son was kidnapped by the triad gangs.

312
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Jin Gu Bang lent him a helping hand, but used this to threaten him,

313
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000
then Old Xie must be in agony.

314
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,550
But, if it were Meng Er who was kidnapped,

315
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,000
I would have made the same choice.

316
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,400
It's just if Old Xie didn't have enough money, he could have told me. I could have helped!

317
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,400
I think, lending money to Mr. Xie won't solve the root of the problem.

318
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,900
No matter how much money you give the other side, they won't be satisfied.

319
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,200
Xiao Yi, you're right.

320
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,000
But Chairman, there's something very suspicious.

321
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,600
How did Jin Gu Bang find out about Director Xie's son's matter?

322
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Unless he has some links with the triad?

323
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,000
Given his actions at the Board of Director meeting, it's <i>extremely</i> possible.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,500
I agree. What's more, he might even be connected to Li Bi Hua.

325
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,400
If it's as what you guys are saying, then is there any way

326
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,600
for us to seize back control of the company's management rights from Jin Gu Bang?

327
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,800
I think... that our only chance is to rescue Xie Jin Biao from the triad's clutches.

328
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,000
Also, I've already asked Mr. Xie to think of a way to delay it,

329
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,800
and do his best not to let Jin Gu Bang take over Peng Zhan Corporation so fast.

330
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,700
What's left is to wait for me to rescue his son.

331
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,000
But Xiao Yi, you don't even know where Xie Jin Biao is, how are you going to rescue him?

332
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,600
It's okay. I have a way.

333
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,800
Xiao Yi, I can't let you take the risk. What if you get injured? How can that do?

334
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't worry, Uncle Chu.

335
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,400
Don't forget that I'm a bodyguard of international standard.

336
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,000
Sister 36 E, it's me, Lin Yi.

337
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,200
<i>Stinky brat, what the hell are you doing?</i>

338
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,200
<i>I was having a meeting just now, and you kept calling. You called until my handphone was almost out of battery. What the hell do you want?</i>

339
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,900
Is there news on the information I asked you to help me find the last time?

340
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,400
<i>I've found it. But there's a lot of information.</i>

341
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,200
<i>It'll be better to meet up and discuss outside. Message me the time and location.</i>

342
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Let's make it tomorrow then. As long as you tell me Xie Jin Biao's location,

343
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,600
I'll give you evidence of Li Bi Hua and Jin Gu Bang doing harm to Peng Zhan Corporation.

344
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,300
<i>Really? Then we're agreed. You're not to break your word, got it?</i>

345
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,000
Just as I guessed.

346
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,200
- Is there a way?<br>- Currently, our entire Special Forces Police...

347
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,800
Lin Yi? What's he up to?

348
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
Behaving so sneakily.

349
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Deputy Song wants me to hand this to you.

350
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,400
- She also wants me to remind you that this matter of Xie Jin Biao being kidnapped--<br>- Shh!

351
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:30,050
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Gone with the Shirt Team @ Viki</i>

352

<i>Don't touch her!</i>

353
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,400
<i> Are you okay? </i>

354
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>You want to play hero, but still shiver to this extent?</i>

355
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
<i>Beat them both up!</i>

356
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
<i>What are you following me for?</i>

357
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,800
<i>Xie Jin Biao's my friend, I'm here to save him.</i>

358
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,600
<i>Long time no see. Why don't we hold a class reunion here?</i>

359
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,600
<i>What should I do? Usually, when Han Bin transforms, his power is already Earth Level.</i>

361
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,300
<i>Han Bin, don't!</i>
