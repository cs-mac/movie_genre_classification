1
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,411
DIJON - SPRING 1954

2
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,534
For the wounded in Indochina.

3
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:36,469
I have no change.

4
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,609
Red Cross for the wounded
in Indochina.

5
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:52,488
Tightwads!
Let's try somewhere else.

6
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,432
MURMUR OF THE HEART

7
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,649
Did you hear Jelly Roll
on the radio yesterday?

8
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:03,392
There was a fantastic piano solo.

9
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,585
For the wounded in Indochina.

10
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,642
Are you crazy?

11
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:35,616
I'm tired of the old jazz.
Always the same thing.

12
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,451
The music store has
the new Charlie Parker.

13
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:41,428
Let's go.
- You got money?

14
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:59,572
Ouch! You've got nerve
coming here for that.

15
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,640
I have no money.
Besides, I'm against the war.

16
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:03,578
It's for the wounded.

17
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:04,677
Same thing.

18
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:08,457
Go see the boss. He's a sucker.
- Come with me. I'm shy.

19
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,564
Listen, I'm all for charity,

20
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:29,578
but TB, nuns, old folks,
cancer, blue babies - there's a limit.

21
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,410
But this is for France, sir.

22
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:38,611
It's a great record. Charlie Parker
solos with a rhythm section.

23
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:42,550
The loony bin made him even better.
- What's the loony bin?

24
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,559
The madhouse, stupid.

25
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:45,652
Is he crazy?

26
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:48,624
Nervous breakdown.
Lots of jazzmen have them.

27
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:51,599
And no wonder -
alcohol, drugs, women.

28
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,668
You count it.
And don't steal it all.

29
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,469
Where's my book on Corneille?

30
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,504
I'm not done yet.

31
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:06,582
I need it for homework.

32
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:08,516
Get your father to help.

33
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:09,552
My father's no intellectual.

34
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:10,610
He makes washbasins.

35
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,446
Relax. You'll have it tomorrow.

36
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,596
What are you doing, Joseph?

37
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:24,658
I've got a record
that'll knock your socks off.

38
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:30,530
Written and Directed by
LOUIS MALLE

39
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:38,512
I ought to fire you!
All you do is mess up!

40
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,640
It's not that hard!

41
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,643
Stop crying! I hate that!

42
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:47,647
Medical secretary
is a serious profession!

43
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,688
Now, now, Solange, don't cry.

44
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,555
Take my handkerchief.

45
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:01,432
Come, I'll drive you home.

46
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,665
Hello, Augusta.
Is Mama home?

47
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:08,638
Of course.
You know what time it is?

48
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,637
Where's your cap?

49
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,406
Thomas, I'm no fool.
With your grades,

50
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:16,543
you'll fail your exams.

51
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,579
As sure as two and two make four.

52
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:22,420
You sure they make four?

53
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,493
Five, if you like.

54
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,658
My Renzino, how are you?

55
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:31,499
Why are you so late?
- We collected for the Red Cross.

56
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:33,559
Good. You got some fresh air.

57
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:37,402
Thomas, you're going to fail your exams,
and your father'll be furious.

58
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:39,600
It'll ruin everyone's vacation.

59
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,440
Marc, you filthy pig!

60
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,572
Don't do that in my sink!

61
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,510
First, Dad couldn't care less anyway.

62
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:53,383
That's not true.

63
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,458
Second, you said you yourself
never passed a single exam.

64
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,496
But I'm a girl.
And look what happened.

65
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,455
I'm completely ignorant.

66
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:06,502
Thomas, that's too much!

67
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:10,403
Give that back! You've stolen
enough from me already!

68
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:12,532
This time I'll tell your father.

69
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:14,602
Stop it, both of you!

70
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:17,509
What an example for Laurent!

71
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:23,612
I'm an old lady!
You have no respect!

72
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:33,551
Bastard!

73
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,634
I need that money.

74
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:42,603
The Cintra bar
won't serve me anymore.

75
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:44,697
It's bad for my reputation.

76
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:47,602
You shouldn't be going
there anyway.

77
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:52,546
Take it.
I'm too easy on you.

78
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,646
But stop helping yourself.
It's getting out of hand.

79
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:59,613
I never know how much I have.

80
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,682
You'd never do that to me, Renzino.
You're no thief.

81
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,621
No need to be.
He collects in the street.

82
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:41,486
Solange is impossible.

83
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:44,491
Two appointments
for the same time again.

84
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,592
She's crazy,
and she never stops eating.

85
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,502
But otherwise she's charming,
isn't she?

86
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,440
Yes, she's charming.

87
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:54,636
What did you do today?

88
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,642
I had lunch with the Desages.
Their son is at Dien Bien Phu.

89
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,610
They're very worried about him.

90
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:07,522
Why did the French
get into that hellhole anyway?

91
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,650
'Cause our generals are incompetent.
Everyone knows it.

92
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:14,621
War is too serious
to leave to the military.

93
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:17,433
That's original.

94
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:19,602
There're plenty of civilians
in Indochina.

95
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:24,529
Rotten politicians
lining their pockets.

96
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,599
You voted for them, Daddy.

97
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,645
So now I pick the ministers?

98
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:33,438
Did your deputy
vote for the government?

99
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:34,642
Yes or no?

100
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,475
Is that my fault?

101
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:39,453
Leave me alone.
We'll see if you do any better.

102
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:42,420
I don't vote, so I shouldn't talk,

103
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:46,451
but colonial expeditions
are a bit passé in 1954, no?

104
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,659
Renzino, if you don't eat,
you won't grow big and strong.

105
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:54,597
What's the matter?
It's your favorite dish.

106
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,604
I'm not hungry.
Leave me alone.

107
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:59,540
Stop treating me like a six-year-old.

108
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:02,476
Don't speak to your mother like that!

109
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,410
Augusta, serve him.

110
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:08,484
I won't eat.
I said I wasn't hungry.

111
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:11,653
You're getting on my nerves.
You won't eat?

112
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,548
Then leave the table!

113
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:15,420
Get out!

114
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:25,399
Is that how you raise your sons?

115
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:28,632
Don't be so hard on him.
He's very sensitive.

116
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,508
Sensitive!
He's a pain in the neck.

117
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:34,509
He's been unbearable lately.

118
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,640
Go kiss him.
You know you're dying to.

119
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,483
After all, he's your son.

120
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:44,576
And yours too.
If you took more interest -

121
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:46,519
I've given up.

122
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:49,648
Two idiots and a little genius -
it's too much!

123
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:57,625
Your father's right.
I should be angry with you.

124
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,594
Come listen to my new record.

125
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,534
You know I hate jazz.

126
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:03,605
And your aunt and uncle are coming.

127
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:08,440
I can't avoid them again,
though they're no fun at all.

128
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,411
Will you come say good night?

129
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:14,448
- Do you deserve it?
- I don't care that much.

130
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:17,515
Liar.

131
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:21,481
Are you going to study?
Promise you'll wear your glasses?

132
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:47,572
I've come to put
my darling Renzino to bed.

133
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:51,642
He's the most darling,
the most sensitive of all.

134
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:55,585
Mama's favorite,
always first in his class.

135
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:58,592
What?
Not wearing your glasses?

136
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:01,630
You'll never be a gynecologist
like your daddy.

137
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:04,564
We have an account to settle.

138
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,499
Don't act innocent.

139
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,663
Your gallant act with the money.
Know what you are?

140
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:13,442
A collaborator!
I ought to cut off all your hair.

141
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:15,441
Listen to this.

142
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:16,671
"But as Camus wrote,

143
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,506
the only serious philosophical
problem is suicide."

144
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,576
Perhaps action is a way
of avoiding suicide."

145
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,481
You really get something
out of what you read.

146
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:32,618
Send it to Camus
with an autographed picture.

147
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:35,426
"To Albert, from his young disciple."

148
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:44,470
How soft and sweet and pink!

149
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,534
Good enough to eat!
- He's got a hard-on!

150
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,602
The choirboy has a hard-on!
Shame on you!

151
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,582
I didn't even notice. You're gonna
have a tiny dick, like Marc.

152
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:56,652
You're both off to a bad start.

153
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:58,613
Some sex life you'll have!

154
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,622
Oh, yeah? Look here.

155
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,625
Bigger than yours already,
and I'm still growing.

156
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:05,621
Midget!
Wanna see a man's dick?

157
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:09,588
I might scare you.

158
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,627
Great!

159
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:16,666
You need a magnifying glass.

160
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,635
Want to measure?
Go get a ruler.

161
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:24,478
Size isn't everything, you know.

162
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,607
It can even be bad for your health.

163
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:30,485
- Seven.
- No, 6 1/2.

164
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:31,678
What are they doing?

165
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,650
I'm not hard.
That's my normal size.

166
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,559
Filthy pigs! Shame on you!

167
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:42,460
Look! Isn't it gorgeous?

168
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,525
I liked it better
when you were children.

169
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:50,564
If only you'd stayed that way!

170
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,588
Not bad what you wrote last night.

171
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,649
But drop Camus.
He's not worth it.

172
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:14,588
If you're into suicide, read Crevel.
- Who's that?

173
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:17,427
A surrealist who gassed himself.

174
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:21,434
You ever felt like committing suicide?

175
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:22,562
You?

176
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,503
Once or twice.

177
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:27,632
Take General Lasalle.

178
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:31,608
Called "the finest sword in the empire."
You know what he said?

179
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:35,445
"A cavalryman still alive at 30
isn't worth his salt."

180
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,449
How old was he when he died?

181
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:42,423
Shot in the head at 32,
at the Battle of Wagram. Not bad.

182
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:45,593
Oh, no, I'm late!

183
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:38,639
Morning, Father.

184
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,530
Chevalier, this is too much.

185
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,567
This is the last time
you serve mass.

186
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:00,696
I helped a blind man
across the road.

187
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,529
Don't give me that nonsense!

188
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:22,453
He's cranky this morning.

189
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:31,662
You know it's Friday.
Compulsory communion. Did you fast?

190
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,560
No. What's it to you?

191
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:35,570
A rebel now, eh?

192
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,653
Children, there'll be no sermon today.

193
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:02,630
The news from Dien Bien Phu
is very troubling.

194
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:07,559
The last survivors face
hand-to-hand combat,

195
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,570
outnumbered ten to one.

196
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,564
Let us pray for these heroes

197
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:15,508
who've gained the world's admiration
in recent weeks,

198
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:20,411
and particularly for two
of our former students who enlisted,

199
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:22,542
François Barsac
and Pierre de Chambiges.

200
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:24,619
We've had no news of them.

201
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,587
I hope that one day, if called upon,

202
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:30,454
you'll be worthy of their example.

203
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,675
And don't dawdle.

204
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,502
Yes, Father.

205
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,507
Want one?

206
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,544
No, sacrilege doesn't interest me.

207
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,588
It's like blasphemy:
It means you still believe.

208
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:39,656
I'd like to see a black mass
I read about.

209
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:42,460
The real thing,

210
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,590
said by a defrocked priest

211
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,430
and celebrated
on a naked girl's belly,

212
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,471
a whore hired for the occasion.

213
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:53,436
To think someone might
do that in Dijon.

214
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,484
I knew you'd be early.
I skipped a class.

215
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:10,492
Some schoolboy.
Where do you live?

216
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:13,460
- Rue de la Barre.
- Not far from me.

217
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:23,470
- You ever smoked?
- Yes, once.

218
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,632
Then this'll make it twice.

219
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:37,612
Like it?

220
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,589
You got the latest Tintin?

221
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:45,660
But the one before it
was funnier.

222
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:07,639
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone.

223
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,469
Why aren't you at school?

224
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,539
Your mother just went out.

225
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,667
Did you study hard?

226
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:41,548
Want some cream puffs?
Leftovers from lunch.

227
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:44,619
Everyone complimented me
on them.

228
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:45,654
Go to hell!

229
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:48,685
What language!
I'll tell your mother.

230
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,622
That'll keep you busy.

231
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:58,497
One really has to be a saint
in this profession.

232
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:03,564
What is it?
- I want to talk to you.

233
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,540
- Get out of here!
- Know what I just saw?

234
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:09,509
Tell me later. Come on, out!

235
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,471
Solange, get rid of him, will you?

236
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:16,415
The boy's crazy.
I don't know where he gets it.

237
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:11,630
Hi, Joseph.

238
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,584
Need any help, little bugger?

239
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:08,656
Go to hell, Thomas!

240
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:11,656
You know what'll happen?

241
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:15,494
You'll Iose your mind
and turn impotent!

242
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:19,439
Your teeth will fall out!

243
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,566
You 'Il be the shame
of the whole family!

244
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:25,579
At least put on your glasses!

245
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,488
Know what I heard today?

246
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:36,422
Baguemouille, the ear man,

247
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,583
the one who interned with me -

248
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:41,492
he got a professorship.

249
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:45,499
He can't tell an earache
from pneumonia.

250
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:48,402
Don't exaggerate.

251
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:51,564
He's a little overrated, maybe.

252
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,631
His wife's connections helped.

253
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:56,638
She knows the right people in Paris.
She's a snob.

254
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:59,514
She's a pretty woman.

255
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:02,607
And she spreads it around!

256
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:08,556
Good evening, Claudine.
Forgive me, Léonce.

257
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,517
I really must pick up my watch.
It's been at the jeweler's six months.

258
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,458
No kiss?
- No, no kiss.

259
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:21,594
Don't worry, Mama.
He's a bit tired tonight.

260
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:27,566
You know Pleven seized L "Express?

261
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:32,446
You think the government will fall?

262
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:35,608
I hope so.
They're all puppets anyway.

263
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:41,616
Great for our standing abroad.
We look like fools once again.

264
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:48,487
Mendès should be elected.
He's clever.

265
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:52,398
Being clever isn't enough.
Does he have character?

266
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,535
What we need is a Clemenceau.

267
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,662
Or de Gaulle.

268
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:58,632
Why not Pétain?

269
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:02,400
What do you young people think?

270
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:04,502
We young people don't give a damn.

271
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:17,420
Chevalier, confession.
Father Henri's waiting.

272
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:19,426
I'll go after gym.

273
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:21,553
Don't push!

274
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,394
Be sure to watch your butt!

275
00:24:32,507 --> 00:24:33,565
Hello, Father.

276
00:24:34,443 --> 00:24:35,535
Oh, it's you, Laurent.

277
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:41,573
If confessions weren't compulsory,
I'd never have the pleasure.

278
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,514
You exaggerate, Father.

279
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,519
How are your two brothers?

280
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:47,554
Very well, thank you.

281
00:24:47,623 --> 00:24:49,488
Glad to hear it.

282
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,566
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

283
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,659
I confess to Almighty God,
the Blessed Virgin,

284
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:06,464
St. Michael, St. John,
and the apostles Peter and Paul,

285
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:09,476
that I have sinned
in thought, word and deed

286
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:11,512
through my most grievous fault.

287
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:13,672
What were your sins?

288
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,550
I lied to my parents.

289
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:20,681
I swore.

290
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:24,558
I smoked in the bathroom.

291
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,457
Is that all?

292
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:30,598
- I stole a book the other day.
- What book?

293
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:32,626
The Girls by Montherlant.

294
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:36,536
Nothing else?

295
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,431
No wicked thoughts?

296
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:45,412
Sometimes.

297
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,449
Did you abuse yourself again?

298
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,515
Yes, Father.

299
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,486
How many times?

300
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:54,577
Quite a few.

301
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:55,645
Alone?

302
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:58,620
Yes, except twice
with my brother Marc.

303
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:01,621
Sit down.

304
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:05,491
I want to talk to you as a friend,
not a confessor.

305
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:10,402
Do you realize how serious this is?

306
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:13,635
If you don't stop these bad habits,

307
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:16,377
God will turn away from you forever.

308
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:23,475
We're all such weak...

309
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:27,450
pitiful creatures,

310
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:30,423
prey to the vilest temptations
of the flesh.

311
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,654
For those who vow chastity,
it's a struggle, believe me.

312
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,593
Such temptations come with your age,
and you give in to them.

313
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:45,503
But watch out.

314
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:49,405
You'll form habits
that you'll later find

315
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:51,503
impossible to break.

316
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,506
Think of your future wife.

317
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:59,510
She'll expect the same purity of you
that you'll expect of her.

318
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:05,387
I'm confident you'll master this.

319
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,452
We have high expectations
for you.

320
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,601
My, what muscles.

321
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,401
Do you do much swimming?

322
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,532
You've developed a lot in a year.

323
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:25,569
I bet both my hands
won't even go around your thighs.

324
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,481
See? They don't.

325
00:27:30,652 --> 00:27:34,611
Congratulations.
Mens sana in corpore sano.

326
00:27:35,424 --> 00:27:37,415
May I go back to gym, Father?

327
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,595
I have to absolve you first.

328
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,558
For penance, say 30 Our Fathers
and 30 Hail Marys.

329
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:49,468
- Thirty?
- The penance must equal the sin.

330
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,500
They punished
my whole class Saturday.

331
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:57,510
What for?

332
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,639
We put a bra on the statue
of St. Thérèse.

333
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,681
You're such babies.
You know what my brothers did?

334
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:08,523
You know that big statue
of St. Ignatius?

335
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:11,558
They hoisted it
onto the chapel roof.

336
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,457
My parents were furious.
- Were they caught?

337
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:14,620
Someone squealed.

338
00:28:14,696 --> 00:28:18,655
They tried claiming it was a miracle.
They got expelled anyway.

339
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:22,437
- Your brothers were great.
- They still are.

340
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:34,379
I just read The Little Prince.
Great book, don't you think?

341
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:36,610
Not bad. A bit overrated.

342
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:39,620
Stop the dirty war!

343
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:41,446
Peace in I ndochina!

344
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,650
Stop the dirty war!

345
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:01,500
Michel, if your father
saw you here!

346
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:05,410
Madam, this child is entitled
to his political opinions.

347
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:13,554
Just getting home now, Laurent?

348
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:18,456
Out running around again!
You'll start with the course we're on.

349
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:21,621
Renzino, darling, give me a kiss!

350
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,692
Did you put your glasses on?

351
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:26,491
Clara, stop treating him like a baby.

352
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:28,535
Charles, you know
how sensitive he is.

353
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:31,538
He's a pain in the neck, you mean!

354
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,404
But do as you like.
He's your son.

355
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,445
Augusta, another bottle, please.
I'm thirsty.

356
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:41,641
What? You drank
all that already?

357
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,477
It's always the same
with your parents away!

358
00:29:45,554 --> 00:29:46,612
Why are they in Paris?

359
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:50,516
Your father's
attending a conference on VD.

360
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:53,390
What a filthy job!

361
00:29:53,495 --> 00:29:56,396
I'm warning you,
that's the last time!

362
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:03,495
That's good.

363
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:08,704
What pigs!

364
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:15,576
What are you doing, you pig?
I'm not changing the tablecloth!

365
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:18,509
You may go.
I'll ring when I need you.

366
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,453
You can bet I'll go!

367
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,624
You ever play "spinach tennis"?

368
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:31,461
No. What's that?

369
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:34,400
You'll see.
It takes real skill.

370
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,497
Watch out.

371
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:13,634
Afraid to have a cigar?

372
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:15,535
Not at all.

373
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:20,409
- Here they are.
- We brought you something.

374
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,678
Careful, it's still wet.
I just finished it.

375
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:29,423
This is amazing!

376
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,490
You've got talent!

377
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,425
They really do look alike.

378
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,394
Let's put it up right away.

379
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:39,657
You can't tell them apart.
- What'll we do with the real one?

380
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:42,528
We could sell it, buy a boat
and go to Tahiti.

381
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:45,596
Don't be a fool,
or I'll do time for forgery.

382
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:48,471
We'll see. Hide the real one.

383
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:52,445
If they notice,
we'll say it was a joke.

384
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,425
I'm thirsty.

385
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:46,659
All gone.
I'll go down to the cellar.

386
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:52,506
Not dancing?

387
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,573
Don't you know how?

388
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:04,474
Come on.

389
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:07,421
You're plastered!

390
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:11,684
But you're the cutest in the family.

391
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,556
You're worse than Thomas,
and you stink of cigars!

392
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:21,466
You have to choose:
cigars or women.

393
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:23,595
Cigars.

394
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,552
You bit me, you bastard!
You can't even kiss!

395
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:44,421
Shall I teach you?
Open your mouth.

396
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:45,618
Not that wide.

397
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,489
That's disgusting with your tongue!

398
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,500
No, it's not. You try it.

399
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:01,566
We're out of whiskey, kids.
I've got white wine and brandy.

400
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,604
You swine should be ashamed!

401
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:07,444
I swear I'll tell your parents!

402
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,616
Give me that!

403
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:14,677
What's this?

404
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,687
Leave that child alone,
you shameless slut!

405
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,520
Come on, get to bed!

406
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:25,658
Let them do their dirty work alone!

407
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:31,469
Dupertuis, an 11.

408
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,608
Pagès, average as usual,

409
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:37,543
but not average enough: 9 1/2.

410
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:42,446
Renaudin...

411
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,643
yours was particularly poor.

412
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:49,446
You always seem
to be translating from the Hindi.

413
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:51,616
You write,

414
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:55,527
"The human condition is thus
that it scents of divine presence."

415
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:58,695
God's not in the perfume business,
as far as I know.

416
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:08,636
You're talented, Grandsire.

417
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:11,536
Go show that to Father Superior.

418
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:14,479
I'm sure he'll appreciate your artwork.

419
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:20,579
Chevalier, you got
the best grade again,

420
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:24,456
but "in the land of the blind,"
as they say...

421
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,528
You've been slipping lately.

422
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,554
Your ideas on suicide

423
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:33,362
are straight out of the five-and-dime
of modern literature.

424
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:36,562
And from the bargain table, too.

425
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:49,448
- How was Paris?
- Just fine.

426
00:35:53,454 --> 00:35:55,422
Did you see The Barefoot Contessa?

427
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:57,684
Of course.
Ava Gardner was fabulous.

428
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,493
Charles, you're tired.
Come lie down.

429
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,463
We stopped at the Dumaines'.

430
00:36:03,565 --> 00:36:06,625
What a lunch!

431
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:09,628
To begin with we had shirred eggs,

432
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:13,597
then chicken à la Lucien Tendret.

433
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:18,603
washed down with a Chablis '45
and a magnum of Corton-Grancey.

434
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:22,479
And champagne with dessert,
like traveling salesmen.

435
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,518
We did drink a lot!

436
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,678
You drank a lot.

437
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:30,481
- Isn't this a wonderful painting?
- Wonderful.

438
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:33,584
Is it true your grandfather hated it?

439
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:37,529
So it seems.
I salvaged it from the attic.

440
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:38,656
It's worth millions.

441
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:42,493
- Do you like it, Mama?
- Of course. It's a Corot, isn't it?

442
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,435
Don't you?
- Not much.

443
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,473
Of course not.
Too dated for you.

444
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:48,576
You prefer Dubuffet.

445
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:53,671
My father, the smiling hero!

446
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:59,453
Laurent, my boy,
we've decided to introduce you

447
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,511
to the joys and sorrows of sex.

448
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,420
We're going to Madeleine's tonight.

449
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:05,482
No, I'm going to a jazz concert.

450
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:07,628
Who's Madeleine?

451
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:11,398
Never heard of
"L'Orée du Bois"?

452
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:12,624
I'm not in the mood.

453
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:15,631
Courage.
We're counting on you.

454
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:18,395
You'll make the grade.

455
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:19,666
How are we going?
On bikes?

456
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:22,409
Dad's lending us his car.

457
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:25,512
He just doesn't know it.

458
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:27,547
You haven't got a license.

459
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:29,549
Can't have everything.

460
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,576
Dinner's served.
Isn't Madame here?

461
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:36,487
No, Madame is putting
Monsieur to bed.

462
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:49,561
No, I won't go to my room!

463
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:51,605
Leave your bags alone.

464
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,675
What is it?
What do you want?

465
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:56,569
A kiss.

466
00:37:56,644 --> 00:38:00,512
Please, sweetheart, just a kiss.

467
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:02,574
Like we used to.

468
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,515
You're tired.

469
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,417
Go and sleep!

470
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:08,648
Go to your room now and rest.

471
00:38:09,424 --> 00:38:10,584
Won't you sleep with me?

472
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:12,592
Tell me why.

473
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:17,592
You won't sleep
with the big bad wolf anymore.

474
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,401
I'll eat you up.

475
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,493
You're hurting me.

476
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:32,613
You're no fun.

477
00:38:33,414 --> 00:38:34,540
Where are you going?

478
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:36,650
Your father's had a bit to drink.

479
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:38,646
You look so handsome.

480
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:41,455
Sure you're going to a concert?

481
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:44,590
Don't be out too late, all right?

482
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:22,622
Watch it, idiot!

483
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:27,559
- There's not much gas.
- We're not going far.

484
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:31,470
You got any cash?
I don't.

485
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:33,631
You're my guests.

486
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:36,376
I get special rates.

487
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:38,670
Drink up.
It'll give you courage.

488
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,451
Who'll we give him for his first?
Dolorès?

489
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:49,422
She's got beautiful breasts,

490
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,590
but she rushes things.

491
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,429
Francine, the Belgian girl?

492
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,694
No, she's cross-eyed.
He'd be traumatized for life.

493
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:03,460
Don't worry. We'll ask Madeleine.
That's her job.

494
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:24,548
I'll wait in the car.
You'll save money.

495
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:26,490
Come on, move it.

496
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,486
And be nice to the ladies.

497
00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:57,423
I'll go talk to Madeleine.
You sit down.

498
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,687
That boy's the same age as my son!

499
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,590
Can you imagine!

500
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:14,566
That's her.

501
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:20,581
She tells fantastic stories
about the days of real brothels.

502
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:25,641
She should write a book.
She's been in the business 35 years.

503
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:29,582
That's your little brother?
Not bad.

504
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,652
You know what she told me?

505
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,657
"One look at a new client
and I know what his vice is."

506
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:38,657
Do I have a vice?

507
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:42,436
Sure. You just don't know
what it is yet.

508
00:41:57,485 --> 00:41:59,578
- Wanna dance?
- I can't. I hurt my foot.

509
00:41:59,687 --> 00:42:01,450
Come on.

510
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:12,455
- My name's Freda. And yours?
- Laurent Del Dongo.

511
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:15,501
Not your last name.
Are they your brothers?

512
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:17,469
No, just friends.

513
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,668
Let's have some fun together.

514
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:38,551
They should put in an elevator here.

515
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:01,573
These shoes are killing me.
They're too small.

516
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:03,549
You like them?
- They're very smart.

517
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,642
Oh, I've got a run.

518
00:43:10,558 --> 00:43:14,460
Come sit by me.
So this is your first time?

519
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:16,519
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

520
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,464
I always get the virgins.

521
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,437
Everything'll be all right.

522
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:25,572
Just relax, sweetie.

523
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,609
I never kiss customers.

524
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:32,546
That's only for my fiancé.

525
00:43:57,605 --> 00:43:59,630
Come here and I'll wash you.

526
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,675
I washed before I came.

527
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:03,501
Come on.

528
00:44:11,452 --> 00:44:13,443
You're cute, you know that?

529
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,489
You're big for your age.

530
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,424
You're raring to go, I see.

531
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:21,427
Dry off, sweetie.

532
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:26,624
Since it's your first time,
I'll take off my bra.

533
00:44:27,468 --> 00:44:30,460
But you'll have to help me
put it back on.

534
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:34,674
You think I have a nice figure?

535
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:37,668
Do you like me?

536
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,547
I've put on some weight lately.

537
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,639
The food's so good around here.

538
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:47,518
I hear your friends are paying for this.
Nice of them.

539
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:49,648
Is it your birthday?

540
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:54,688
What soft skin!

541
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,561
Softer than mine.

542
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,491
You okay?
Frightened?

543
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:04,538
Don't you worry.
I'm very gentle.

544
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:06,605
Everything will be just fine.

545
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:08,665
Just do as I say.

546
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,569
I excite you a little, don't I?

547
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,638
Let me lie down,

548
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,645
and you get on top.

549
00:45:20,588 --> 00:45:24,422
What's the rush?
There's no meter running.

550
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:27,527
Ouch, that hurts!

551
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:29,458
Gently.

552
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,589
I'll give you the rhythm.

553
00:45:36,604 --> 00:45:38,572
You like that?
Nice, isn't it?

554
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:49,547
Not bad for a beginner.

555
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:51,577
You're gifted.

556
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,450
You'll be a lady-killer
when you're older.

557
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:39,523
You bastards!

558
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,574
You little jerks!

559
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:51,509
That's no way to act,
especially his first time!

560
00:47:22,443 --> 00:47:24,377
How long is scout camp?

561
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:27,447
You going to Lake Settons?

562
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,553
We were real jerks last night.

563
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:37,523
We were really drunk.

564
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,624
When you get back from camp,
I'll introduce you to a great girl.

565
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:46,566
She'll spend the whole night with you.

566
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:48,534
Go to hell!
And leave my cat alone!

567
00:47:48,636 --> 00:47:50,661
What's this?
Teasing him again?

568
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:52,632
No one asked you, Augusta.

569
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:57,400
And you - hurry up.
You have enough sweaters?

570
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,690
Hands out of your pockets, Michel.

571
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:26,503
- Scouts forever!
- Ready!

572
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:31,544
Long live France!

573
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:44,614
The evening spreads its velvet cloak
over the earth

574
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:53,523
This Ionely camp
wraps itself in your Iove

575
00:48:54,468 --> 00:49:01,533
O Virgin of light
Star shining in our hearts

576
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:09,608
Hear our prayer
Our Lady of the Scouts

577
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:14,518
The Eag le Patrol will present
Goethe's The 'Erlking.

578
00:49:23,564 --> 00:49:26,533
Who rides so late
through dark and wind?

579
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,601
It is the father with his child.

580
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:30,637
He holds the boy fast in his arms.

581
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,497
He keeps him safe and warm.

582
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:37,409
Son, why are you frightened
and hiding your face?

583
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:41,470
Father, can't you see
the Erlking with his -

584
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,411
Crown and robe.

585
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:45,384
Crown and robe.

586
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:50,512
My son, it is a wisp of cloud.

587
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,617
Darling child, come with me.

588
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,452
I will play lovely games with you.

589
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:59,564
So many flowers grow on the shore.

590
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:02,493
My mother has many golden robes.

591
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:05,436
Father, Father, can't you hear

592
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,474
the Erlking's whispered promises?

593
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,566
Hush. Be calm, my child.

594
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:11,611
It's only the wind in the dead leaves.

595
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:15,575
Darling boy, will you come with me?

596
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:18,476
My daughters already await you

597
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:21,486
to lead you in their nightly dance

598
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:24,489
and rock and sing you to sleep.

599
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:28,652
Father, Father, can't you see
his daughters in the dark?

600
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,522
My son, I see them well.

601
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:32,656
They are but old grey willow trees.

602
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:36,469
I love you and am charmed
by your beauty.

603
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:39,597
And if you're not willing,
I'll take you by force.

604
00:50:40,574 --> 00:50:42,667
Father, Father, he's taking me.

605
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,670
The Erlking is hurting me.

606
00:50:45,446 --> 00:50:48,438
The father, terrified, gallops on,

607
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,608
holding the moaning child in his arms.

608
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:53,545
Worn and tired, he reaches home.

609
00:50:54,455 --> 00:50:56,582
In his arms the child lies dead.

610
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:03,527
Hurry up. Lights out.

611
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:07,693
Can I sleep next to you?

612
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,562
If you hurry.
You're always last.

613
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:17,633
- You're sweating. What's wrong?
- I must have caught cold.

614
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:26,612
The sound is quite clear.

615
00:51:27,454 --> 00:51:29,513
I can only confirm your diagnosis:

616
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:32,618
rheumatic aortic insufficiency

617
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:35,495
due to scarlet fever,

618
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:38,529
and dilation of the left ventricle.

619
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:43,526
Excuse our jargon.
It merely means a heart murmur.

620
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:45,595
I really don't think it's serious.

621
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:50,500
He must have
an electrocardiogram right away.

622
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:54,613
You know the routine:
complete rest,

623
00:51:54,715 --> 00:51:56,683
ice packs over the heart,

624
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:59,510
and a good dose of salicylate.

625
00:52:00,554 --> 00:52:03,546
You must be careful
for a month, young man.

626
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:05,558
Then we'll see.

627
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:08,457
He ought to go
to Bourbon-les-Eaux.

628
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:10,588
There's no better place.

629
00:52:10,664 --> 00:52:13,565
- And school?
- What does that matter, darling?

630
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,410
You just changed it an hour ago.

631
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,678
It's hot, so the ice melts quickly.

632
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:38,387
Keep still! It'll slip off.

633
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:42,656
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I don't care, as long as you get well.

634
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:47,591
Did you take your "sicilate"?
- Salicylate. Yes, I did.

635
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:52,528
I had a strange childhood.

636
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:57,533
Until 15, I lived like a savage
near Florence,

637
00:52:57,611 --> 00:53:00,478
in a villa designed by Michelangelo

638
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:03,573
but with no bath or central heating.

639
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:07,577
I lived there with Augusta
and never went to school.

640
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:12,420
- And your mother?
- You know she died when I was three.

641
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,528
My father was a madman.

642
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:19,694
He got involved in politics,
so his family cut off his money.

643
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:25,538
He'd come see us,
with a different woman every time.

644
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,675
He'd rant and rave
about Mussolini and the Vatican,

645
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:31,434
and then off he'd go.

646
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:34,673
One day he came to get us.

647
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,483
The fascists were after him.

648
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:39,678
We managed to cross the border

649
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:43,613
and ended up in Paris
without a penny.

650
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,649
5:20!

651
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:51,497
You always make me forget the time.

652
00:53:51,698 --> 00:53:53,495
This is awful!

653
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:59,604
Be a good boy
and take your temperature.

654
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:02,403
- When will you be back?
- What?

655
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,476
After dinner.
I hope you'll be asleep.

656
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:27,456
You're crazy!
You're out of bed, and barefoot!

657
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:53,654
Proust to amuse you
and Tintin to instruct you.

658
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:55,452
Here.

659
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:59,456
- Dizzie Gillespie? Great!
- We're loaded.

660
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:01,501
Did you win at the races?

661
00:55:03,437 --> 00:55:05,496
Thomas sold a carpet
to an antique dealer.

662
00:55:05,605 --> 00:55:08,665
We found it in the attic.
Five hundred francs!

663
00:55:09,443 --> 00:55:11,502
We got a rotten deal,
but who cares?

664
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:15,638
I'm dead!
I screwed too much last night.

665
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,405
Don't make me laugh.

666
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:19,485
He claims he had Martine,

667
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:22,521
Dr. Picot's daughter,
with the huge -

668
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:25,453
All I'm saying is
I screwed too much.

669
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,585
Martine doesn't screw around.
Frank tried all winter.

670
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,653
I won't argue.
You're just children.

671
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,454
Now she's leaving for Italy.

672
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:35,586
I always get yelled at
because of you.

673
00:56:35,695 --> 00:56:39,563
It's great to be sick.
I'm gonna stay in bed all my life.

674
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:43,500
With the entire household
at your beck and call, right?

675
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:46,629
No, just you and me.

676
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,532
And Gusta.

677
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,500
Beautiful, isn't it?

678
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:18,629
But don't let it drone.
Give it rhythm.

679
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:21,666
You understand the meaning?
- Very well. Why?

680
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,602
Congratulations.

681
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:28,537
It took Heidegger 200 pages
to translate two lines of Heraclitus.

682
00:57:29,649 --> 00:57:32,516
Please sit down.
How are the studies?

683
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:34,587
His illness has matured him.

684
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:37,452
He won't have any trouble passing.

685
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:39,515
I knew it.
My son's a prodigy.

686
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,493
You'll be a genius
like your grandfather.

687
00:57:43,597 --> 00:57:45,588
It always skips a generation.

688
00:57:45,665 --> 00:57:48,395
Since your son is a genius,

689
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:52,495
may I suggest you treat him
like an adult?

690
00:57:52,572 --> 00:57:54,472
Of course you may, Father.

691
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:57,406
It's none of his business!

692
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:08,648
That guy never stops!
How old is he now?

693
00:58:16,563 --> 00:58:18,531
You're a rotten player.

694
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:23,434
I can't concentrate
with that damn TV.

695
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,508
Hello, sweetie.

696
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:31,544
We came to see the little wonder.

697
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:34,412
Evening, Claudine.

698
00:58:44,557 --> 00:58:46,457
Does it work well?

699
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:50,623
Léonce refuses to buy one.

700
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:53,564
It's expensive,
and the programs are lousy.

701
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,658
How do you know,
if you don't have one?

702
00:58:57,604 --> 00:58:59,504
Everyone says so.

703
00:58:59,572 --> 00:59:01,631
We bought it for the children.

704
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,573
Hear that?

705
00:59:06,479 --> 00:59:09,573
Brush your teeth!
You could kill a fly at 50 feet.

706
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:13,619
What a gorgeous dame!

707
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:15,547
Where'd you come from?

708
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:24,554
Marc, come on!
What's wrong with you?

709
00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:26,599
I have a surprise for you.

710
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:29,658
A big surprise!
I'm going to college.

711
00:59:30,637 --> 00:59:32,571
I passed the entrance exam.

712
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:35,506
Are you sure?
You saw your name on the list?

713
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:38,475
That's good news.
What about you, Thomas?

714
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:41,639
I don't have my grades yet,
but my horoscope isn't too good.

715
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:45,382
If you fail,
you're going to summer school.

716
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:49,382
I think the moment has come.

717
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,394
Uncle Léonce, what do you think
of this picture?

718
00:59:57,564 --> 00:59:58,622
It's magnificent.

719
00:59:59,499 --> 01:00:02,468
I love Corot.
No one can compare.

720
01:00:03,536 --> 01:00:06,630
It's a little dirty.
It needs a cleaning.

721
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,665
Marc, leave it alone!

722
01:00:10,677 --> 01:00:14,511
Are you sure it's genuine?
I think it's a forgery.

723
01:00:14,547 --> 01:00:16,606
What's wrong with you?
It's beautiful.

724
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:19,408
Corots are worth a lot of money.

725
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:23,420
A painting's worth the price
of the canvas and paint.

726
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:26,549
The rest is capitalist speculation.

727
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,654
I don't like this picture.

728
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:31,588
In fact, I hate this picture!

729
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,437
Are you out of your mind?

730
01:00:53,486 --> 01:00:55,545
I know, I know!

731
01:00:58,558 --> 01:01:00,549
I came here a lot when I was young.

732
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:02,561
You never told me that.

733
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:05,460
Aunt Juliette had an estate nearby.

734
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:09,659
I remember I had bicycle races
with my cousins.

735
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:13,668
- You rode a bike?
- Yes, and quite well.

736
01:01:49,576 --> 01:01:51,476
This is the bedroom.

737
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:58,611
The bathroom.

738
01:02:04,524 --> 01:02:06,458
The sitting room.

739
01:02:06,526 --> 01:02:08,391
Just one bedroom?

740
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:12,530
The letter said "Madame Chevalier
and child," so we thought -

741
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,661
Your secretary's crazy, Charles!

742
01:02:17,537 --> 01:02:18,595
Are you full up?

743
01:02:18,671 --> 01:02:22,437
We are, sir, unfortunately.
For you, that is.

744
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:26,443
Never mind. Put another bed
in the sitting room.

745
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:28,605
That way I can keep
an eye on you.

746
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:31,609
I must get going.

747
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:34,482
- You in such a hurry?
- Actually I am.

748
01:02:34,554 --> 01:02:36,579
I'll try to come see you.

749
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:40,493
Bring the boys along.

750
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:42,618
If those idiots want to come.

751
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:48,467
Best time to call
is early afternoon.

752
01:02:48,568 --> 01:02:50,433
All right, dear.

753
01:03:06,686 --> 01:03:09,655
Two or three aren't bad,
but that's all.

754
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:11,617
You're hard to please.

755
01:03:13,526 --> 01:03:15,517
An after-dinner drink, madame?

756
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:31,400
They're talking about you.
You should be flattered.

757
01:03:31,511 --> 01:03:33,479
It's you they're looking at.

758
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:36,515
Then you should be
even more flattered.

759
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:41,418
Do you enjoy hotels?
- I haven't stayed in them enough.

760
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:44,454
I adore hotels.

761
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:47,593
I feel free, as if I were
starting a new life.

762
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:52,498
Even if it's only a feeling,
it's very nice.

763
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:57,536
Daddy hates hotels.

764
01:03:57,704 --> 01:04:01,470
It runs in his family.
Remember your great-aunt?

765
01:04:01,641 --> 01:04:05,600
The one who always said,
"Education will be the end of France."

766
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:08,570
The first thing she did in a hotel

767
01:04:08,648 --> 01:04:13,483
was to take a big bottle of methyl
alcohol and disinfect everything:

768
01:04:13,586 --> 01:04:15,679
sink, tub, chamber pot.

769
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:20,516
She was so clumsy with it
that she often set the place on fire!

770
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:24,458
Put your shoes outside the door.

771
01:04:55,495 --> 01:04:58,589
Why are there never any hangers
in French hotels?

772
01:04:58,698 --> 01:05:00,461
Good night.

773
01:05:03,436 --> 01:05:04,425
Sleep well.

774
01:05:04,504 --> 01:05:06,495
You have to buy me
new shoes tomorrow.

775
01:05:06,572 --> 01:05:08,665
All right.
Did you brush your teeth?

776
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:10,669
I didn't want to disturb you.

777
01:05:11,444 --> 01:05:13,503
It won't disturb me at all.

778
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:19,517
What time's your treatment tomorrow?

779
01:05:20,486 --> 01:05:21,544
9:30.

780
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:26,591
Can you help me?
My zipper's stuck again.

781
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:30,494
I'll order breakfast
for 8:45, okay?

782
01:05:31,597 --> 01:05:33,565
They'll bring the tray to your room,

783
01:05:34,534 --> 01:05:36,661
and you can tiptoe in
to wake me up.

784
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,495
There.

785
01:05:45,678 --> 01:05:48,442
What do you want?
Coffee and rolls?

786
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:53,416
Tea and what?

787
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:55,648
Orange juice and toast.

788
01:05:56,422 --> 01:05:58,481
I'm sure their orange juice is canned.

789
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:00,556
What's the matter?

790
01:06:01,694 --> 01:06:03,559
Don't look at me like that.

791
01:06:03,629 --> 01:06:06,427
I have no sense of modesty.

792
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:10,466
Your father never could
get used to it.

793
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:38,589
How much? Ten grams?

794
01:06:43,469 --> 01:06:46,438
Hold it in your mouth a while.

795
01:07:01,454 --> 01:07:03,445
Your mother's very pretty.

796
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:06,492
I saw you at the hotel last night.

797
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:08,388
Next.

798
01:07:08,494 --> 01:07:09,620
It's your turn.

799
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,424
Hello, Fernande!

800
01:07:11,497 --> 01:07:13,522
Mr. Bizot, you'll never change.

801
01:07:22,508 --> 01:07:24,442
Go stand at the bar.

802
01:07:25,445 --> 01:07:26,605
Facing me.

803
01:07:35,421 --> 01:07:36,683
Afraid I'll cripple you?

804
01:07:37,623 --> 01:07:39,591
I know what I'm doing.

805
01:07:40,426 --> 01:07:41,620
What's your name?

806
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:46,489
Nice name.
I had a cousin named Laurent.

807
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:48,491
Turn to the side.

808
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:49,660
Which side?

809
01:07:50,436 --> 01:07:52,427
Either. We'll do both.

810
01:07:52,538 --> 01:07:53,664
Lift your arm.

811
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:57,467
You're already a little man.
How old are you?

812
01:07:57,677 --> 01:07:59,542
Fifteen.

813
01:08:02,515 --> 01:08:04,574
This cure will do you good.

814
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:08,449
Me, I've never been ill.

815
01:08:08,688 --> 01:08:11,623
Where are you from?
Paris, I bet.

816
01:08:11,657 --> 01:08:13,648
You look like a Parisian.

817
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,519
Turn your back, sweetie.

818
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:18,624
The weather's changing.

819
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:20,456
The new moon

820
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:23,502
and the west wind will bring rain.

821
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:26,663
You Parisians don't understand
these things.

822
01:08:27,507 --> 01:08:30,601
When you look up,
all you see is the Eiffel Tower.

823
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,447
All done.

824
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:43,486
Come here and I'll rub you down.

825
01:08:43,556 --> 01:08:46,650
You mustn't catch cold.
It's bad for the treatment.

826
01:08:48,528 --> 01:08:51,429
Is Malavelle your doctor?
You're lucky.

827
01:08:51,531 --> 01:08:54,591
He's the best here,
but he's temperamental.

828
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:57,568
He laid into my husband
the other day.

829
01:08:59,572 --> 01:09:02,564
You know Hubert, that tall fellow
you were talking to outside?

830
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:07,545
He makes me laugh, that devil.

831
01:10:00,499 --> 01:10:03,400
Renzino, you know
you shouldn't run.

832
01:10:09,642 --> 01:10:11,576
Introduce me to your mother?

833
01:10:11,644 --> 01:10:13,373
I'm so hot.

834
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:14,446
Hubert Bizot.

835
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:15,639
Pleased to meet you.

836
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:19,651
- How about a game with me?
- I'm a very bad player.

837
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:23,546
That doesn't matter.
How about tomorrow at 11 :00?

838
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:26,419
All right, but I warned you.

839
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:33,565
He's got a lot of nerve.

840
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:38,660
Don't play with him.
You'll make a fool of yourself. Look.

841
01:10:39,538 --> 01:10:41,597
What's the matter?
Are you jealous?

842
01:10:41,707 --> 01:10:44,574
Not at all.
People will laugh, that's all.

843
01:10:47,446 --> 01:10:49,414
You should take some lessons.
- You're right.

844
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:51,643
That charming young man
will teach me.

845
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:00,618
Laurent, wait for me.

846
01:11:04,563 --> 01:11:08,499
St. Tropez isn't everything
people say it is.

847
01:11:08,668 --> 01:11:11,432
- You know St. Tropez?
- St. what?

848
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:15,540
My parents have a villa in La Baule.

849
01:11:16,509 --> 01:11:18,568
I came here
out of fear for Hubert.

850
01:11:18,678 --> 01:11:21,442
My grandmother died of rheumatism,

851
01:11:21,514 --> 01:11:23,675
my father has attacks,
and now it's starting on me.

852
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,509
I think it must be hereditary.

853
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:29,588
Really? You're a doctor's wife.
What do you think?

854
01:11:29,655 --> 01:11:31,555
We never discuss medicine.

855
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:35,423
Isn't it always like that?

856
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:39,521
You're mother's great.
I hope to be like her at her age.

857
01:11:39,598 --> 01:11:41,395
How old is she?

858
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:45,460
She's 85,
and she still has all her teeth.

859
01:11:47,606 --> 01:11:51,440
The countryside here is lovely.

860
01:11:51,577 --> 01:11:53,568
Very restful, in any case.

861
01:11:54,413 --> 01:11:57,541
Your mother says you know Italy.
Is that true?

862
01:11:57,616 --> 01:12:01,450
We lived in Naples.
My father was the French consul.

863
01:12:12,565 --> 01:12:16,501
Your friend Hubert's nice.
He speaks Italian very well.

864
01:12:16,702 --> 01:12:18,670
What do you mean, my friend?

865
01:12:19,438 --> 01:12:22,430
He's a real idiot!
You know what he is?

866
01:12:22,508 --> 01:12:23,600
A royalist, of all things!

867
01:12:23,676 --> 01:12:26,440
You're flirting with a royalist!

868
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:28,444
You're behaving like a husband!

869
01:12:28,514 --> 01:12:30,607
Worse! Your father never
carried on like this.

870
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:34,485
You're my prying little
French husband.

871
01:12:34,587 --> 01:12:36,418
My bourgeois,

872
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:38,582
malicious,

873
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:41,489
jealous and bad-tempered
little husband!

874
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,519
Next.

875
01:12:45,464 --> 01:12:46,556
Oh, it's you, Laurent.

876
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:49,627
You're in quite a hurry.

877
01:12:54,573 --> 01:12:55,631
Oh, it's you.

878
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,509
You can call me Hélène.

879
01:12:58,611 --> 01:13:00,545
What are you doing now?

880
01:13:00,646 --> 01:13:01,670
Nothing special.

881
01:13:02,448 --> 01:13:03,540
Wait for me?

882
01:13:03,682 --> 01:13:05,479
If you like.

883
01:13:09,522 --> 01:13:11,649
Were you afraid of dying
when you got sick?

884
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:13,651
A little. You?

885
01:13:14,426 --> 01:13:17,486
Yes. I think a lot
about death in general.

886
01:13:18,497 --> 01:13:19,657
You don't look the type.

887
01:13:22,535 --> 01:13:25,504
- I'll show you.
- I'll never get it.

888
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:44,420
Shall we sit down?
There's a bench there.

889
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:45,616
No, let's walk.

890
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:51,553
Have you slept with him?

891
01:13:51,664 --> 01:13:53,529
Me? Are you crazy?

892
01:13:53,599 --> 01:13:56,397
- Have you kissed him?
- No.

893
01:13:56,635 --> 01:13:58,660
He's handsome but conceited.

894
01:14:00,706 --> 01:14:04,608
Does your mother like him?
- Not at all.

895
01:14:07,646 --> 01:14:09,546
Do you like jazz?

896
01:14:09,682 --> 01:14:11,650
Wanna hear my records?

897
01:14:12,418 --> 01:14:14,579
- In your room?
- Yes. Does that scare you?

898
01:14:14,687 --> 01:14:18,646
Me? You think you're dangerous?

899
01:14:33,472 --> 01:14:35,406
I can't stay long.

900
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:44,380
You've got a nicer view.
Shall we trade?

901
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:54,483
All very serious.
You're really an intellectual.

902
01:14:54,593 --> 01:14:56,458
Will you study medicine
like your father?

903
01:14:57,496 --> 01:14:58,656
Not on your life.

904
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,534
I hate the Tour de France.

905
01:15:04,436 --> 01:15:05,664
Where are your records?

906
01:15:10,576 --> 01:15:12,544
Stop it!

907
01:15:17,616 --> 01:15:19,641
Laurent, you're tickling me.

908
01:15:20,586 --> 01:15:22,417
Besides, I'm older than you.

909
01:15:22,488 --> 01:15:23,580
I'm 16 1/2.

910
01:15:23,656 --> 01:15:27,387
Liar! You'll be 15 in October.

911
01:15:27,493 --> 01:15:29,393
I asked to see the hotel register.

912
01:15:29,495 --> 01:15:31,486
Daphnée and I made a bet.

913
01:15:44,476 --> 01:15:45,500
I like you.

914
01:15:45,577 --> 01:15:48,603
I want to too,
but I've decided to wait.

915
01:15:48,681 --> 01:15:51,377
I don't want to sleep around.

916
01:15:51,517 --> 01:15:53,576
Keeping yourself pure
for your wedding night?

917
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:56,450
Don't be silly.
I'm waiting to fall in love.

918
01:15:56,555 --> 01:15:58,455
And I'm a little scared.
Aren't you?

919
01:15:58,524 --> 01:16:00,389
It's normal the first time.

920
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:02,620
You've already slept with someone?

921
01:16:03,395 --> 01:16:05,420
- Yes and no.
- What do you mean?

922
01:16:05,497 --> 01:16:07,624
I can't explain.

923
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:12,594
- Your mother will be coming back.
- I locked the door.

924
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,469
She'll know I'm here.

925
01:16:16,442 --> 01:16:18,433
She intimidates me.

926
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:21,536
What about my jazz records?

927
01:16:21,613 --> 01:16:24,673
Bring them downstairs tonight.
We'll dance.

928
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:27,510
It's not dance music.

929
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:29,484
Pardon me!

930
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:31,451
See you.

931
01:16:37,396 --> 01:16:42,424
"...and so ends the broadcast
of today's race."

932
01:17:16,702 --> 01:17:18,602
Oh, I'm bushed!

933
01:17:19,571 --> 01:17:22,472
Your friend's nice, but you're right:

934
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:24,406
He's not very smart.

935
01:17:27,646 --> 01:17:29,637
That's not a book for you.

936
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:32,475
I've already read it.
Thomas lent it to me when I was sick.

937
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:34,609
- You're kidding.
- I'll tell you the story.

938
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:36,649
Don't! I haven't read it yet.

939
01:17:37,423 --> 01:17:39,414
And I thought I hid it so carefully.

940
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:41,626
In any case, Thomas was wrong.

941
01:17:46,632 --> 01:17:50,534
Your father's right.
I'll never be a real mother.

942
01:17:50,602 --> 01:17:53,503
You've already read
The Story of O at your age!

943
01:17:53,605 --> 01:17:56,403
There's no childhood anymore.

944
01:17:56,642 --> 01:17:59,475
I was surprised to find it there.

945
01:17:59,545 --> 01:18:01,672
- Did that shock you?
- Absolutely.

946
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:03,642
That's the last straw!

947
01:18:04,616 --> 01:18:07,608
What did you think of it?
- It's interesting.

948
01:18:08,554 --> 01:18:09,646
Well written.

949
01:18:11,557 --> 01:18:13,616
Why not take things as they come?

950
01:18:13,692 --> 01:18:14,681
Meaning?

951
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:18,396
I don't know.
Begin at the beginning.

952
01:18:18,497 --> 01:18:20,488
Wait to experience things yourself.

953
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:24,402
And there's plenty of time.
I'm not rushing you.

954
01:18:25,537 --> 01:18:28,563
Everyone has to discover
love for himself.

955
01:18:30,609 --> 01:18:33,578
Lots of things can happen
between a man and a woman.

956
01:18:33,645 --> 01:18:36,614
Better to find out for yourself,
not from a book.

957
01:18:37,683 --> 01:18:39,514
Don't you agree?

958
01:18:40,519 --> 01:18:41,577
It's funny.

959
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:46,515
My three sons are already men.
I can't get used to it.

960
01:18:48,427 --> 01:18:49,587
Especially you.

961
01:18:51,597 --> 01:18:53,656
I guess I'm getting old.

962
01:18:55,501 --> 01:18:57,435
Do you think you're a man?

963
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:12,607
Come in.

964
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:19,650
Put it over there, please.

965
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:21,551
It's a nice morning,

966
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:24,686
but with the wind coming up,
we may get a storm.

967
01:20:57,656 --> 01:20:59,521
Some more tea?

968
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:03,661
Laurent, don't mope like that.

969
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:06,520
I'd rather you slapped me back.

970
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,563
I should ask the manager
for another room.

971
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,638
The hotel's completely full.

972
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:19,510
Another thing:

973
01:21:20,512 --> 01:21:23,447
I'm expecting someone today.
It's nothing, but -

974
01:21:23,515 --> 01:21:25,608
Okay, I get it.
You want me to leave you alone.

975
01:21:25,684 --> 01:21:28,414
Shall I go outside and play?

976
01:21:35,627 --> 01:21:38,391
I think you're great.

977
01:21:38,597 --> 01:21:41,430
I only meant
I wouldn't be here for lunch.

978
01:21:41,533 --> 01:21:43,398
Do as you like.

979
01:21:43,468 --> 01:21:45,663
I'll go sightseeing in Autun
with Hélène and the others.

980
01:21:47,472 --> 01:21:48,666
Don't forget:

981
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:51,600
Whatever you do, I'm on your side.

982
01:21:55,614 --> 01:21:57,411
Hurry up!

983
01:21:58,517 --> 01:22:00,451
Hélène, what are you doing?

984
01:22:09,428 --> 01:22:11,419
There's no room.
Go ahead without me.

985
01:22:11,496 --> 01:22:13,521
Come on, squeeze in!

986
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:16,390
I don't feel like it.
See you tonight.

987
01:22:16,468 --> 01:22:17,560
Don't be silly.

988
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:21,537
- What a pain in the neck.
- Anything to get attention.

989
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:49,429
Have you ever had cirrhosis?

990
01:22:50,535 --> 01:22:53,436
A cure at Vichy would help.

991
01:22:53,505 --> 01:22:54,597
I've had five of them.

992
01:22:54,706 --> 01:22:58,506
Being a woman, I love fine wines.

993
01:22:58,577 --> 01:23:01,375
A nice Beaujolais is very good.

994
01:23:16,528 --> 01:23:19,463
Look how well-behaved the boy is.

995
01:23:43,588 --> 01:23:46,386
Your mother said you'd be out today.

996
01:23:46,491 --> 01:23:47,617
That's possible.

997
01:23:47,692 --> 01:23:51,628
I'll have shirred eggs to start,

998
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:53,693
then foie gras and toast.

999
01:23:54,466 --> 01:23:56,434
- That's not on the menu.
- So what?

1000
01:23:56,601 --> 01:23:58,626
The toast nice and crisp this time.

1001
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,473
And some Chateau Laffite '47.

1002
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:06,603
We don't have it in half bottles.

1003
01:24:06,678 --> 01:24:08,612
Who said a half bottle?

1004
01:24:43,682 --> 01:24:46,583
Bobet is in the lead.

1005
01:24:46,685 --> 01:24:53,591
It now seems certain he 'Il win
today's leg of the Tour de France.

1006
01:25:38,503 --> 01:25:41,666
No cigarettes, no matches,
no nothing -

1007
01:25:42,407 --> 01:25:44,375
what a lover!

1008
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:46,604
Did you find some?

1009
01:25:48,613 --> 01:25:50,513
Call the concierge.

1010
01:25:54,419 --> 01:25:55,681
Jacques, get dressed quietly.

1011
01:25:56,454 --> 01:25:57,512
Are you crazy?

1012
01:25:58,423 --> 01:25:59,515
Come here.

1013
01:26:00,559 --> 01:26:02,424
Let me go!

1014
01:26:02,494 --> 01:26:05,463
Laurent's asleep in there.

1015
01:26:07,599 --> 01:26:08,657
You said he was out.

1016
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:11,526
That boy is unpredictable.

1017
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:15,401
Now hurry up. Let's go!

1018
01:26:15,473 --> 01:26:17,566
- This time it's too much!
- You 'Il wake him up!

1019
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:21,479
All right, I'll go,
but you're coming with me.

1020
01:26:21,546 --> 01:26:24,606
Are you crazy?
I can't leave Laurent.

1021
01:26:27,452 --> 01:26:29,613
Don't ask me to.
- I am asking.

1022
01:26:30,589 --> 01:26:33,524
Just once, show me that I count.

1023
01:26:34,626 --> 01:26:36,423
Be quiet!

1024
01:26:38,496 --> 01:26:39,588
Come on now.

1025
01:27:37,656 --> 01:27:39,556
"I have to leave.

1026
01:27:40,425 --> 01:27:42,416
I'll be back in two days.

1027
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:46,521
Don't be sad.
I'll explain everything.

1028
01:27:47,532 --> 01:27:48,556
I Iove you."

1029
01:30:30,495 --> 01:30:33,396
Jacq ues, stop it! Let me go!
You ' re crazy!

1030
01:30:39,437 --> 01:30:41,428
Jacques, stop it! Let me go!
You're crazy!

1031
01:30:41,506 --> 01:30:43,474
I can't leave Laurent.

1032
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:46,443
Don't ask me to.

1033
01:30:46,511 --> 01:30:47,637
I am asking.

1034
01:30:48,546 --> 01:30:49,604
Please.

1035
01:31:13,671 --> 01:31:15,434
Who won the leg?

1036
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:17,565
I don't give a damn
about the Tour de France.

1037
01:31:19,711 --> 01:31:22,612
I thought you were sick.
- Do I look sick?

1038
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,648
I didn't see you this morning.

1039
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:26,608
I overslept.

1040
01:31:27,452 --> 01:31:28,646
Is it true your mother's gone?

1041
01:31:29,621 --> 01:31:34,422
Seems she drove off in a hurry
with some guy last night.

1042
01:31:35,493 --> 01:31:37,654
My older brother broke his leg.

1043
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:41,489
Did you see the news
from the Geneva Conference?

1044
01:31:41,566 --> 01:31:44,433
Mendès is trading off Indochina.

1045
01:31:44,502 --> 01:31:47,437
All those guys killed for nothing!

1046
01:31:47,505 --> 01:31:49,666
We've lost anyway,
so it's better to stop.

1047
01:31:50,441 --> 01:31:51,499
Lost for you maybe.

1048
01:31:51,576 --> 01:31:54,511
We'd win with more troops
and the US Air Force.

1049
01:31:54,612 --> 01:31:56,637
You're too dumb, even for a fascist.

1050
01:31:57,415 --> 01:31:59,576
I'm not a fascist, I'm a patriot.

1051
01:31:59,684 --> 01:32:03,450
A country's lost without colonies.
Look at the English.

1052
01:32:10,628 --> 01:32:13,392
I'm leaving.
The music's lousy.

1053
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:16,657
You can't come in here
without a jacket.

1054
01:32:17,435 --> 01:32:19,528
Really? Just watch.

1055
01:32:43,561 --> 01:32:46,462
All lesbians.
What a waste.

1056
01:32:46,531 --> 01:32:49,523
And the mothers approve.
What an age we live in!

1057
01:32:49,634 --> 01:32:51,499
It's nothing new.

1058
01:32:51,569 --> 01:32:55,403
Just read Proust.
But you don't read Jewish writers.

1059
01:32:57,508 --> 01:33:00,500
Hubert, come sit here
and bring your friend.

1060
01:33:03,681 --> 01:33:06,411
Would you like a cup of tea?

1061
01:33:07,552 --> 01:33:09,520
Aren't you going to dance?

1062
01:33:10,421 --> 01:33:12,651
It would distract you.
You must be lonely.

1063
01:33:15,626 --> 01:33:17,491
My poor little boy.

1064
01:33:18,596 --> 01:33:21,565
I'm neither poor nor particularly little,

1065
01:33:21,699 --> 01:33:23,667
and I'm certainly not yours.

1066
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:54,521
Stop it! Everyone's watching!

1067
01:33:54,632 --> 01:33:57,624
So it's true what they say -
you're a lesbian.

1068
01:33:58,503 --> 01:33:59,595
I should have known.

1069
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:02,537
I've always wondered:
How do you do it?

1070
01:34:02,607 --> 01:34:05,405
That's enough or I'll slap you!

1071
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:07,635
All right, don't get upset.

1072
01:34:09,647 --> 01:34:13,640
I'll tell you a secret no one knows,
not even my parents.

1073
01:34:14,452 --> 01:34:17,421
I'm really a woman.
We could have fun together.

1074
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:24,493
You don't believe me?
Come to my room and I'll show you.

1075
01:34:24,595 --> 01:34:27,655
Very poor manners.
But then, what can you expect?

1076
01:34:28,566 --> 01:34:31,535
Is it true your daughter's a lesbian?

1077
01:34:31,602 --> 01:34:33,661
That's what Hubert said.

1078
01:35:01,466 --> 01:35:03,661
- Could you turn off that awful music?
- It's Gillespie.

1079
01:35:04,435 --> 01:35:05,629
I have a headache.

1080
01:35:51,682 --> 01:35:53,479
You don't look so good.

1081
01:35:53,551 --> 01:35:56,418
I've seen you looking better.

1082
01:36:13,538 --> 01:36:15,506
Don't cry.
It'll make your eyes red.

1083
01:36:16,641 --> 01:36:18,506
What happened?

1084
01:36:21,646 --> 01:36:23,637
It'll feel better to talk about it.

1085
01:36:25,483 --> 01:36:26,677
Is it that bad?

1086
01:36:28,686 --> 01:36:31,587
He asked me to get a divorce

1087
01:36:31,656 --> 01:36:34,454
and leave with him
for Paris right away.

1088
01:36:36,427 --> 01:36:37,587
And you refused?

1089
01:36:38,429 --> 01:36:40,420
I tried to explain.

1090
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:44,431
He said I was a coward,
afraid of leaving everything behind.

1091
01:36:44,535 --> 01:36:45,661
What a dope.

1092
01:36:46,404 --> 01:36:47,530
He doesn't understand you.

1093
01:36:48,673 --> 01:36:50,607
Maybe I am a coward.

1094
01:36:52,643 --> 01:36:54,577
But I don't want to be forced.

1095
01:36:54,645 --> 01:36:56,670
I want to be free.
That's my way of loving.

1096
01:36:57,448 --> 01:36:59,382
Couldn't he see that?

1097
01:37:04,455 --> 01:37:06,480
He sees things differently.

1098
01:37:07,558 --> 01:37:10,550
He wanted to organize
my life around his.

1099
01:37:11,562 --> 01:37:13,530
What about us?
He's got some nerve.

1100
01:37:15,666 --> 01:37:17,566
You're not his problem.

1101
01:37:18,603 --> 01:37:21,538
He's very jealous.

1102
01:37:23,474 --> 01:37:25,567
I'm afraid of being hemmed in.

1103
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:27,502
But you loved him.

1104
01:37:27,578 --> 01:37:29,443
Of course I did.

1105
01:37:30,715 --> 01:37:33,479
There are different ways of loving.

1106
01:37:38,489 --> 01:37:40,389
Another misunderstanding.

1107
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:41,651
Did he leave?

1108
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:46,396
- Yes. He's moving to Paris.
- You won't see him again?

1109
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:51,459
I don't think so.

1110
01:37:53,638 --> 01:37:57,506
You'll find someone
who'll love you just as you are.

1111
01:37:59,644 --> 01:38:01,578
Renzino, you're wonderful.

1112
01:38:07,685 --> 01:38:10,552
What a conversation
for a mother and son to have!

1113
01:38:10,621 --> 01:38:12,680
Why not?
I'm your friend too.

1114
01:38:17,428 --> 01:38:18,486
And then?

1115
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:22,497
I was alone with Gusta.

1116
01:38:22,566 --> 01:38:24,625
I spoke with everybody
to learn French.

1117
01:38:25,403 --> 01:38:27,428
That's how I met your father.

1118
01:38:28,506 --> 01:38:31,669
He came up to me
at Place St. Michel.

1119
01:38:32,677 --> 01:38:34,668
I didn't understand him very well,

1120
01:38:35,479 --> 01:38:36,673
but I thought he was very handsome.

1121
01:38:37,448 --> 01:38:42,613
He had a long beard then.
He looked like a young Garibaldi.

1122
01:38:44,488 --> 01:38:46,547
Who can say no to Garibaldi?

1123
01:38:47,425 --> 01:38:49,518
That's how I get pregnant.
- With Thomas?

1124
01:38:49,627 --> 01:38:51,458
Of course.

1125
01:38:51,529 --> 01:38:53,394
You got married right away?

1126
01:38:54,532 --> 01:38:56,557
It created quite a stir.

1127
01:38:57,668 --> 01:38:59,636
Your grandma was furious.

1128
01:39:01,505 --> 01:39:03,473
For the Dijon bourgeoisie,

1129
01:39:03,574 --> 01:39:06,634
a 16-year-old foreign refugee
without a penny -

1130
01:39:06,711 --> 01:39:08,611
I was some catch!

1131
01:39:09,647 --> 01:39:12,377
They all came to get a closer look.

1132
01:39:13,417 --> 01:39:15,442
"The fortune hunter,"
your aunts called me.

1133
01:39:16,454 --> 01:39:18,649
My French made them shudder.

1134
01:39:19,457 --> 01:39:20,617
What about Daddy?

1135
01:39:23,661 --> 01:39:25,561
He was crazy about me.

1136
01:39:26,697 --> 01:39:28,631
We were like lovebirds.

1137
01:39:28,699 --> 01:39:32,499
- Hard to imagine.
- You don't know your father.

1138
01:39:34,538 --> 01:39:36,631
He was very jealous then.

1139
01:39:38,409 --> 01:39:41,435
He almost resented me
for giving in so easily.

1140
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:45,410
- Was he the first?
- Of course.

1141
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:48,618
I wonder if he realizes that.

1142
01:39:48,686 --> 01:39:51,587
He should. It's his profession!

1143
01:39:55,526 --> 01:39:56,618
- May I?
- Please.

1144
01:39:58,662 --> 01:40:00,596
Are you playing gin rummy?

1145
01:40:01,632 --> 01:40:03,463
Yes, American style.

1146
01:40:04,435 --> 01:40:06,403
It's a special style.

1147
01:40:07,471 --> 01:40:10,565
It's a bit different.
I'll take one card.

1148
01:40:13,544 --> 01:40:14,533
I'm putting up my two.

1149
01:40:14,678 --> 01:40:18,580
- But that's the ace of spades.
- Yes, it has a curse on it.

1150
01:40:19,517 --> 01:40:21,417
That's right. I forgot.

1151
01:40:21,619 --> 01:40:23,678
I take nine, six, four.

1152
01:40:25,423 --> 01:40:28,620
I put a jack on your two,
turn and pass.

1153
01:40:29,427 --> 01:40:30,519
This is quite impossible.

1154
01:40:30,594 --> 01:40:33,563
Look, a crossed card.

1155
01:40:34,598 --> 01:40:35,622
Crossed?

1156
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,664
- You never seen that?
- Never.

1157
01:40:39,437 --> 01:40:41,405
I'm positive.

1158
01:40:41,505 --> 01:40:43,405
Watch this.

1159
01:40:49,647 --> 01:40:52,616
Watch out for my feet!

1160
01:40:59,657 --> 01:41:01,625
My father adored the waltz.

1161
01:41:02,426 --> 01:41:04,417
What a shame you didn't know him.

1162
01:41:04,662 --> 01:41:07,654
He lived only for women and politics.

1163
01:41:11,635 --> 01:41:13,500
You know how he died?

1164
01:41:13,637 --> 01:41:17,573
He went back to Italy during the war
at a very dangerous time.

1165
01:41:17,641 --> 01:41:21,407
He was going
to join the resistance.

1166
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:24,571
But he fell in love
with a girl in Milan.

1167
01:41:24,648 --> 01:41:28,379
He lived at her house.
That's how they caught him.

1168
01:41:43,501 --> 01:41:46,664
Aren't you being unfaithful
to Hélène these days?

1169
01:41:47,471 --> 01:41:48,597
I've never been after her.

1170
01:41:49,406 --> 01:41:50,430
Liar.

1171
01:41:51,509 --> 01:41:53,500
She's nice, and pretty too.

1172
01:41:53,611 --> 01:41:55,670
She gets on my nerves.
She's a tease.

1173
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,549
What about Daphnée?
Isn't she a tease?

1174
01:42:00,451 --> 01:42:02,385
Sure, but at least
she's not a virgin.

1175
01:42:02,486 --> 01:42:03,680
How would you know?

1176
01:42:04,455 --> 01:42:05,581
I can tell.

1177
01:42:06,457 --> 01:42:09,449
Just like that, at first sight?
Pretty good!

1178
01:42:13,497 --> 01:42:15,658
And you? Are you a virgin?

1179
01:42:16,433 --> 01:42:17,491
That's my business.

1180
01:42:18,502 --> 01:42:21,596
Anyway, Hélène's a lesbian.
- What a thing to say!

1181
01:42:21,672 --> 01:42:23,663
Hubert says almost all girls are.

1182
01:42:25,609 --> 01:42:27,474
Not so cold!

1183
01:42:27,545 --> 01:42:31,481
They start in school
and continue afterwards.

1184
01:42:31,582 --> 01:42:33,550
Hubert certainly knows a lot.

1185
01:42:33,651 --> 01:42:36,643
With your stories about Father Henri,
you're opening my eyes.

1186
01:42:37,421 --> 01:42:40,652
Men are queers, women are lesbians -
everyone's happy.

1187
01:42:42,459 --> 01:42:44,518
Cold water's good for your hair.

1188
01:42:53,537 --> 01:42:55,437
You're hurting me.

1189
01:42:55,539 --> 01:42:58,667
Don't blame me.
Your nails are hard as rocks.

1190
01:42:59,443 --> 01:43:00,535
It's a sign of virility.

1191
01:43:00,611 --> 01:43:02,545
Of old age, you mean.

1192
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:10,577
Must be funny being married
to a gynecologist.

1193
01:43:14,425 --> 01:43:15,551
You get used to it.

1194
01:43:17,628 --> 01:43:19,653
I've been meaning to ask you:

1195
01:43:22,533 --> 01:43:24,524
Is Daddy really my father?

1196
01:43:24,635 --> 01:43:27,604
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious.

1197
01:43:31,475 --> 01:43:36,469
I swear you're your father's son
and your brothers' brother.

1198
01:43:38,582 --> 01:43:40,550
Why did you ask?

1199
01:43:40,651 --> 01:43:42,482
I don't love him.

1200
01:43:43,654 --> 01:43:45,519
I just can't.

1201
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:48,558
And the feeling's mutual too.

1202
01:44:28,499 --> 01:44:30,433
Laurent, stay with us.

1203
01:44:37,441 --> 01:44:40,706
You see how these soldiers dance?
Incredible!

1204
01:44:41,578 --> 01:44:43,443
A bunch of hicks!

1205
01:44:43,647 --> 01:44:47,447
Poor France.
What a republic we have!

1206
01:44:48,519 --> 01:44:50,419
Want to dance?

1207
01:44:51,588 --> 01:44:53,453
Can I have a drink?

1208
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:55,625
You won't dance with me?

1209
01:44:57,561 --> 01:44:58,653
That's not very nice.

1210
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:08,403
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1211
01:45:08,472 --> 01:45:10,440
the fireworks!

1212
01:45:10,507 --> 01:45:12,566
I brought you a classy lady.

1213
01:45:42,573 --> 01:45:43,699
Now, on with the dance!

1214
01:45:44,575 --> 01:45:46,566
Lovebirds, out on the floor!

1215
01:45:53,617 --> 01:45:55,380
May I have this dance?

1216
01:45:55,486 --> 01:45:56,510
I'm spoken for.

1217
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:59,589
He can step on your toes
the next dance.

1218
01:45:59,656 --> 01:46:01,624
Want me to kick your teeth in?

1219
01:46:01,692 --> 01:46:04,456
Don't get familiar with me!

1220
01:46:04,595 --> 01:46:08,463
You're not good enough
to fight with me.

1221
01:46:08,532 --> 01:46:11,433
That's what you say, punk!

1222
01:46:16,673 --> 01:46:18,607
Take it easy!

1223
01:46:19,443 --> 01:46:20,705
Calm down!

1224
01:46:21,545 --> 01:46:22,705
That's enough now.

1225
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,605
Go sit down!

1226
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:29,416
Great timing!

1227
01:46:29,486 --> 01:46:33,445
Insulting the working classes
for Bastille Day!

1228
01:46:33,524 --> 01:46:34,548
I'll knock him flat!

1229
01:46:34,658 --> 01:46:36,455
Let's dance.

1230
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:41,495
Here he is.

1231
01:46:42,466 --> 01:46:44,525
Who does he think he is, anyway?

1232
01:46:44,635 --> 01:46:48,628
- He's dumb but harmless.
- He's a damn snob.

1233
01:46:52,676 --> 01:46:55,474
I like dancing with you.

1234
01:47:05,656 --> 01:47:08,489
Hubert's an idiot,
but I think your mother's overdoing it.

1235
01:47:08,592 --> 01:47:09,616
Really?

1236
01:47:10,394 --> 01:47:11,656
You should keep an eye on her.

1237
01:47:31,582 --> 01:47:34,551
Have a drink.
Dancing works up a thirst.

1238
01:47:34,651 --> 01:47:37,415
This'll cool you down.

1239
01:47:37,621 --> 01:47:39,589
I've had too many.

1240
01:47:40,524 --> 01:47:43,459
- Where do you live?
- The Hotel des Bains.

1241
01:47:44,595 --> 01:47:46,654
Could I see you tomorrow afternoon?

1242
01:47:47,397 --> 01:47:49,365
I'm not working tomorrow.

1243
01:47:50,434 --> 01:47:52,425
Say, you're Italian, aren't you?

1244
01:47:53,704 --> 01:47:55,433
I knew it!

1245
01:47:55,505 --> 01:47:57,473
Me, I'm from Brittany.

1246
01:47:59,443 --> 01:48:00,535
And where are you from?

1247
01:48:00,611 --> 01:48:02,442
I'm from Paris.

1248
01:48:03,513 --> 01:48:05,481
A city slicker.

1249
01:48:05,716 --> 01:48:07,581
Let's take a walk in the park.

1250
01:48:07,651 --> 01:48:11,519
I've got something important
to show you.

1251
01:48:13,523 --> 01:48:15,650
Something very pretty.

1252
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,394
It's my bedtime.

1253
01:48:21,598 --> 01:48:23,657
- I'll go with you.
- Don't bother. I have an escort.

1254
01:48:24,434 --> 01:48:26,595
She got me all wet.

1255
01:48:26,703 --> 01:48:30,503
Rich women are all bitches!

1256
01:48:30,574 --> 01:48:32,508
They're all bitches, those rich dames.

1257
01:48:40,484 --> 01:48:42,611
Let's go, Laurent.

1258
01:49:20,691 --> 01:49:22,659
No, please! Turn that off!

1259
01:49:23,427 --> 01:49:24,655
My head's spinning!

1260
01:49:26,563 --> 01:49:29,498
What a great invention,
Bastille Day!

1261
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,534
We should celebrate it more often.

1262
01:49:32,602 --> 01:49:34,467
We can start again tomorrow.

1263
01:49:35,405 --> 01:49:37,396
No, not every night.

1264
01:49:37,674 --> 01:49:40,438
Oh, I'm dead!

1265
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:43,545
I can't even get undressed.

1266
01:49:43,613 --> 01:49:45,444
I'll help you.

1267
01:52:20,670 --> 01:52:24,504
I don't want you to be unhappy...

1268
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:29,570
or ashamed, or sorry.

1269
01:52:32,516 --> 01:52:35,383
We'll remember it
as a very beautiful...

1270
01:52:37,687 --> 01:52:39,621
and solemn moment...

1271
01:52:41,525 --> 01:52:43,584
that will never happen again.

1272
01:52:47,464 --> 01:52:49,523
What's going to happen now?

1273
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,534
Nothing.
We'll never mention it again.

1274
01:52:52,702 --> 01:52:54,567
It'll be our secret.

1275
01:52:57,407 --> 01:53:01,639
I'll remember it without remorse,
tenderly.

1276
01:53:03,647 --> 01:53:05,638
Promise you'll do the same.

1277
01:54:40,644 --> 01:54:43,579
Laurent, what is it?

1278
01:54:43,613 --> 01:54:45,581
You know what time it is?

1279
01:54:52,689 --> 01:54:56,557
Are you crazy?
Get out or I'll scream!

1280
01:54:57,494 --> 01:54:58,620
You've lost your mind!

1281
01:54:58,695 --> 01:55:01,391
All right, all right.
I'm leaving.

1282
01:55:02,532 --> 01:55:05,467
Which is Daphnée's room?
- 27.

1283
01:55:06,569 --> 01:55:08,469
Are you going to her room?

1284
01:55:25,555 --> 01:55:27,386
Daphnée, open up!

1285
01:55:27,624 --> 01:55:30,593
It's almost 10:00!

1286
01:55:31,594 --> 01:55:35,530
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- We're leaving in five minutes.

1287
01:55:36,466 --> 01:55:37,455
Hurry up!

1288
01:55:37,534 --> 01:55:39,502
Wake up!

1289
01:55:41,404 --> 01:55:43,497
Get dressed!
You mustn't let anyone see you.

1290
01:55:44,607 --> 01:55:46,404
The coast is clear.

1291
01:55:47,544 --> 01:55:48,602
Hurry up.

1292
01:56:04,694 --> 01:56:07,595
Hurry, Françoise.
The Bollingers are waiting.

1293
01:56:11,434 --> 01:56:12,628
Isn't that the Chevalier boy?

1294
01:56:49,606 --> 01:56:51,574
Sneaking out at night now?

1295
01:56:53,576 --> 01:56:55,441
What's all this about?

1296
01:56:55,645 --> 01:56:57,545
The explanation had better be good.

1297
01:56:58,648 --> 01:57:01,446
And walking around barefoot!
