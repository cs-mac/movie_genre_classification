{3528}{3572}Mom, you be careful.
{3577}{3626}ALPENA, MICHIGAN 1984
{3652}{3734}I think this is longer than it used to be!|What a lovely day.
{3739}{3803}BASED ON A TRUE STORY
{3808}{3914}- Dad is looking so well.|- He is, isn't he? He always was a fighter.
{3956}{4067}- Look at Mahtob.|- She's such a daddy's girl.
{4072}{4123}Well, so were you.
{4153}{4256}Moody, Mahtob, Dad!|Come on. Fresh, home-made lemonade.
{4261}{4310}Come on, everybody.
{4315}{4408}Mom, Daddy's teaching me|how to fish again.
{4516}{4629}- Can I see today's catch?|- One of these days, oh ye of little faith.
{4657}{4733}- Here you go. Dad, d'you want lemonade?|- Yes.
{4738}{4770}OK.
{4775}{4821}- Ah.|- Sour?
{4826}{4935}- A little.|- Not enough sugar? I never get that right.
{4940}{5063}Hey, Mahtob.|What vitamins do we get from lemons?
{5068}{5150}- What vitamins do we get from lemons?|- Vitamin C.
{5155}{5213}Yes. What vitamins|do we get from bananas?
{5218}{5306}- Vitamin C, vitamin B and fibre.|- Right!
{5361}{5460}- None of my kids was as smart as that.|- Great. Thanks, Mom (!)
{5465}{5525}- And what are you gonna be?|- A nurse.
{5530}{5606}- You can be a doctor as well.|- A doctor and a nurse.
{5611}{5697}How do you teach Mahtob to fish|when you've never caught one?
{5702}{5795}Honey, it's the best way.|This way I'm totally unprejudiced.
{5800}{5909}He bought all this fishing equipment|and he's had her out there every day.
{5914}{6023}If it's a choice between your lemonade|and my fishing, I know where I stand.
{6028}{6122}- I wanna sit on Daddy's lap.|- Well, it's my turn.
{6127}{6209}- Don't fight over me, girls.|- You should find another lap.
{6348}{6408}And then we have... Thank you.
{6413}{6538}.. a 30-year-old woman with a Class 3|Pap smear for a TAH, so I think...
{6543}{6634}The Iranians have prayed themselves|back into the Stone Age.
{6639}{6718}Why would anybody come to the States|to study medicine?
{6723}{6780}You can get a degree in Iran in two weeks.
{6785}{6821}Seven days.
{6826}{6925}The Ayatollah's got some great ideas.|A soldier gets wounded, let him die.
{6930}{6976}He's gonna go to paradise anyway.
{6981}{7066}- See that newspaper?|- The Iranian funny page?
{7071}{7188}How can he read that thing?|Looks like one of my prescriptions!
{7193}{7242}I've read that prescription.
{7281}{7367}{Y:i}("Vissi d"Arte" from Tosca by Puccini)
{8100}{8163}- No, no, don't turn it off.|- It's OK.
{8236}{8316}- Honey, what's wrong?|- Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.
{8420}{8510}What's wrong?|The family - is everything all right?
{8515}{8564}Everybody's fine. They're fine.
{8590}{8695}By the way, Mammal phoned.|He and Nasserine have had a baby boy.
{8721}{8782}That's great.
{8862}{8925}A couple of doctors|were making cracks again.
{8961}{9020}- Who were they?|- What does it matter?
{9025}{9098}It matters, Moody. It matters.
{9103}{9169}We moved here to get away from all that.
{9174}{9260}- God, it's just so awful!|- Oh, honey, forget it.
{9294}{9414}Honey, forget it.|There are dumb people everywhere.
{9461}{9509}Forget it.
{9514}{9580}"And the genie roared with laughter.|Ha ha ha!"
{9585}{9647}"O thou poor thief|of a thousand alleyways. "
{9652}{9716}"You think you can marry|the Sultan's daughter
{9721}{9806}when all the princes in Persia|are seeking her hand?"
{9811}{9884}"You foolish slave,|replied Aladdin boldly. "
{9889}{9964}"Have you forgotten|the precious jewels in the cave?"
{9969}{10024}"You have the wits of a donkey. "
{10029}{10108}"I should put you back|into the dirty old lamp. "
{10113}{10193}- Is there really Aladdin's cave?|- There must be.
{10198}{10297}- Can we find it?|- I'm not sure if I know where it is, but...
{10302}{10398}You know, I was born in Persia.|They call it Iran now.
{10403}{10511}If I took you there,|maybe we could look for it together.
{10516}{10658}Iran's got caves and mountains|and deserts, just like in the story.
{10663}{10765}And mosques|that are so beautiful they're like jewels.
{10770}{10864}When the sun shines on them|they dazzle your eyes.
{10869}{10918}Would you like to see those?
{10951}{11000}OK. Where were we?
{11039}{11088}- Daddy?|- Uh-huh?
{11093}{11154}Do I hate Americans?
{11180}{11223}Of course not.
{11228}{11324}Lucille says I hate Americans|because you're from Iran.
{11531}{11668}Sweetheart... Lucille doesn't really know|what she's talking about.
{11703}{11795}So we shouldn't pay|too much attention to her.
{11800}{11868}I've lived in America for 20 years.
{11873}{11939}I'm as American as apple pie.
{11965}{12063}And so are you. Give me a kiss.
{12103}{12152}Big hugs.
{12179}{12230}Mmm. Big hugs.
{12239}{12286}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{13081}{13181}That was Ameh Bozorg.|It's always the same.
{13232}{13293}She cries and cries on the phone.
{13319}{13427}"You're like a son to me.|When your mother died, I raised you. "
{13432}{13494}"I'm sick.|You're not here to look after me. "
{13499}{13558}- Is she sick?|- No, no, she's not sick.
{13587}{13678}She's 58. She feels old, but she's not sick.
{13683}{13764}- Same old guilt trip.|- Oh, honey, come on.
{13769}{13838}She's your sister. Phone her more often.
{13843}{13908}Phoning's no good. She wants to see me.
{13913}{14019}Now Mammal and Nasserine have had|the baby, everybody's there except me.
{14024}{14113}It's been ten years.|I haven't seen my family for ten years.
{14118}{14206}Mammal and Reza have been here.|Why doesn't she come?
{14211}{14303}She's hardly been out of Tehran.|She wants to see me over there.
{14308}{14427}They want to see us.|They've never met you or Mahtob.
{14432}{14533}- She asks why we can't go for a vacation.|- You'll have to explain it to them.
{14538}{14637}- Explain what?|- We can't go to Iran.
{14642}{14690}Why not?
{14695}{14774}I'm not taking Mahtob to Iran.|It's much too violent.
{14779}{14854}We're not going to go sightseeing|to the Persian Gulf.
{14859}{14935}We're going to spend two weeks|with my family.
{14940}{15002}Moody, there's too much|going on over there.
{15007}{15106}Look, your family is welcome here|any time. You know that.
{15133}{15206}Maybe you should just go there yourself.
{15211}{15300}No. I don't mean that either.|None of us should go. It's not safe.
{15305}{15361}- Mommy!|- I'm coming!
{15366}{15417}You're getting it out of proportion.
{15422}{15510}I haven't seen any of them for ten years.
{15515}{15549}- Honey, I...|- Mommy!
{15554}{15616}All right! I'm coming!
{15677}{15726}No, it's OK. Go ahead.
{16542}{16603}Honey, I want to go more than anything.
{16608}{16676}I miss them so much.
{16681}{16755}You're always talking|about how important family is.
{16760}{16888}All I want to do is go for two weeks|with you and Mahtob and visit my family.
{16893}{16981}- Moody, it scares me.|- What scares you, honey?
{17007}{17069}Look at me.
{17074}{17207}Do you honestly think that I would take|you and Mahtob anywhere dangerous?
{17239}{17318}I love you both|more than anything in the whole world.
{17323}{17408}Listen. Mahtob's got a vacation.
{17413}{17498}She starts a new school. It's a good time.
{17783}{17828}I swear to you...
{17860}{17913}on the sacred Koran
{17918}{18063}that you won't be in any danger,|that we'll be back after two weeks
{18068}{18192}and that I wouldn't do anything|to jeopardise yours or Mahtob's safety.
{18258}{18354}Come on, honey.|It's not such a big deal.
{18575}{18620}{Y:i}(plane roars)
{19287}{19347}{Y:i}(noisy shouting)
{19846}{19918}Look what they're doing.
{20179}{20240}- Hello, Betty.|- Hello, Nasserine.
{20245}{20296}It's so good to see you.
{20394}{20452}This is Mahtob.
{20457}{20569}- Betty! Betty! This is Ameh Bozorg!|- Sweetheart, that's Daddy's sister.
{20639}{20736}- Oh, my goodness. Look. Mahtob.|- Mahtob!
{20767}{20828}Moonlight. You are moonlight.
{20833}{20911}I know. Mahtob means "moonlight".
{20916}{20959}Mahtob.
{20964}{21057}Betty? I'm so happy.|Now you can be with us.
{21062}{21139}Yes. It's only for two weeks|but I'm very pleased.
{21144}{21205}I remember your house|in America very well.
{21210}{21301}- Mammal, it's so good to see you.|- Finally you're here, Betty.
{21306}{21411}Yes. I'm so glad we could come for a visit.|Congratulations on the baby.
{21416}{21448}Thank you.
{21505}{21547}- What?|- Nothing.
{21552}{21714}She says Mahtob looks almost exact|to Moody and to Ameh Bozorg.
{22006}{22101}- Some reception, huh?|- Oh, my gosh. It's amazing.
{22106}{22186}- You know all these people?|- All of them.
{22214}{22263}Oh, boy. This is all my family.
{22268}{22367}- Obviously they really missed you.|- The car's just over here.
{22515}{22578}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{22583}{22632}Go ahead. Unwrap it. It's a gift.
{22685}{22743}Thank you. Isn't that nice?
{22823}{22889}Oh, thank you. Thank you.
{22894}{22948}- Go on, put it on.|- Now?
{22953}{23052}Yeah. It's, er... They've gone|to a lot of trouble. It'll make them happy.
{23057}{23118}- All right.|- It's pretty good quality.
{23162}{23211}Let's get in the car.
{23806}{23930}{Y:i}(chanting through loudspeakers,|traffic noise)
{24425}{24497}God... it all looks so different.
{24593}{24679}You said foreign women|don't have to wear Islamic dress.
{24684}{24754}Yeah, I know. I made a mistake.
{24780}{24838}It's all changed.
{24843}{24946}Anyway, it's only when you leave|the house or when you go outside.
{24951}{25062}You saw the women. I didn't recognise|half my family. They were all covered.
{25067}{25199}Last time only half of them wore chadors.|It's all new.
{25204}{25283}- What would happen if I didn't wear this?|- Ameh Bozorg?
{25322}{25445}{Y:i}(speak Farsi)
{25518}{25567}She says you'd get arrested.
{25572}{25647}{Y:i}(women whoop)
{25863}{25949}- I have to go to the bathroom.|- Wait. We're almost there.
{26256}{26296}Hi.
{26321}{26383}{Y:i}(bleating)
{26429}{26519}No! They're hurting him, Mommy!|They're hurting him!
{26524}{26576}They're hurting him, Mommy!
{26581}{26674}It's a way of saying welcome.|They give the meat to the poor.
{26679}{26760}Honey, we have to step over it.|It's expected.
{26765}{26824}Just hang on to me.
{27031}{27102}{Y:i}(muezzin leads prayers)
{27155}{27198}Mahtob...
{27203}{27266}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{27382}{27456}{Y:i}(crowd chants)
{27674}{27793}It's the Friday prayer.|From Tehran University.
{28478}{28529}{Y:i}(knocking)
{28534}{28581}Mahmood...
{28586}{28662}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{28802}{28851}Prayers.
{29202}{29269}{Y:i}(soft chanting)
{29680}{29725}{Y:i}(loudspeakers blare)
{30291}{30365}{Y:i}(speak Farsi)
{30443}{30559}Don't forget we've got|to get some things for your mom and dad.
{30602}{30671}Thank you, honey. Let me do you.
{30782}{30818}All right?
{31003}{31100}{Y:i}(Moody) Fix your scarf!|Fix your hair! Cover your hair!
{31623}{31717}They didn't know you were foreign.|They wouldn't have been so harsh.
{31722}{31831}- It was a little bit of hair.|- You gotta be careful. They're very strict.
{31857}{31918}You must cover all.|You must not be careless!
{31923}{32057}Every hair that is not covered is like a|dagger aimed at the heart of our martyrs!
{32062}{32111}Come on.
{32116}{32185}Just give it time, sweetheart. It's OK.
{32518}{32568}{Y:i}(talking and laughter)
{32573}{32622}Look at these hands.
{32627}{32693}{Y:i}(speak Farsi)
{32776}{32828}Sshh!
{33120}{33177}- Mom...|- Sshh!
{33333}{33426}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{33431}{33505}I guess that means we can eat.
{34022}{34090}Come on, sit up straight.
{34383}{34440}Is it because I didn't wear a chador?
{34445}{34530}Honey, you misinterpreted.|She wasn't looking at you.
{34535}{34610}You didn't see. She looked at me...
{34615}{34701}It was the same feeling today|when the police stopped me.
{34706}{34768}It was with such dislike.
{34811}{34895}It just seems so primitive sometimes.
{34900}{34998}All religious beliefs seem primitive|when they're not your own.
{35003}{35066}But to cover them up|and hide them away?
{35071}{35167}- Are they afraid of women's sexuality?|- No, that's not the reason.
{35172}{35255}Iranian women like to wear the chador.|It's a mark of respect.
{35260}{35357}When the Shah tried to ban them|they had demonstrations in the streets.
{35362}{35431}Most women wanted to bring it back.
{35512}{35648}Sorry. I know it's a different culture.|I guess I... just don't understand it.
{35730}{35797}Why is Mammal angry at you,|and the others?
{35802}{35881}They seem to be going at you all the time.
{35907}{35983}My family... they're very religious.
{35988}{36083}They're not sophisticated.|They're basically country people.
{36114}{36181}It's all changed so much.
{36186}{36279}It's all back to the Koran.|It's been that way since the Revolution.
{36284}{36334}When they moved into this house,
{36339}{36413}they got rid of all the furniture -|all of it.
{36438}{36565}Now they see me and...|I seem so Americanised.
{36570}{36630}And you have an American wife.
{36693}{36751}- Yeah.|- I'm sorry.
{36756}{36822}The last thing I wanted|was to insult them...
{36827}{36859}I know.
{36986}{37067}Honey, it's going|to seem strange for a while,
{37072}{37149}but, believe me, they want to love you.
{37154}{37232}They will. I promise.
{37237}{37273}OK.
{37278}{37349}{Y:i}(he laughs)
{37354}{37398}- What?|- Nothing.
{37403}{37472}- Nothing.|- What's so funny?
{37477}{37552}You know they think|we make love all the time?
{37587}{37631}- Who?|- The family.
{37636}{37685}Why?
{37690}{37771}After they make love|they have to take a shower.
{37776}{37867}They can't pray unless they do.|It's considered unclean.
{37872}{37955}We're taking two or three showers a day!
{37960}{38030}Oh, God! What, they think|we're two rabbits?
{38089}{38166}I'm not taking another shower.|You knew the whole time!
{38171}{38280}- I didn't know you were such a swinger!|- You knew that all along!
{38285}{38372}- You were out in the hall giggling!|- Don't get mad.
{38771}{38874}{Y:i}(prayers blare out)
{39365}{39414}{Y:i}(knocking)
{39419}{39474}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{39541}{39605}- Don't go.|- I have to.
{39635}{39710}- Please stay.|- I can't.
{39715}{39797}You've been getting up early|every morning. Don't go.
{39802}{39874}What's the matter with you?|We're with my family.
{39879}{39962}They're Sayyeds -|direct descendants of Mohammed.
{39967}{40068}Of course, to a sophisticated American|that must seem primitive.
{40073}{40122}{Y:i}(door slams)
{40127}{40186}{Y:i}(argue in Farsi)
{41307}{41395}- Betty?|- Oh, God, you scared me.
{41400}{41444}I wondered where you were.
{41449}{41579}- I got the most beautiful picture.|- Light's gone. Coming in?
{41584}{41620}Yeah.
{41915}{41969}- Betty?|- What?
{42047}{42124}Something happened|before we came out here.
{42129}{42161}What?
{42166}{42263}I didn't want to tell you about it.|We were coming out here, so...
{42268}{42317}Moody, what happened?
{42494}{42559}I got fired from the hospital.
{42585}{42629}You got fired?
{42634}{42712}It happened just before we left.
{42717}{42774}Literally, two days.
{42899}{42980}I can't believe it. They can't do that.
{42985}{43102}Yes, they can. If they can find someone|who can do the job for less money.
{43107}{43163}Oh, no.
{43168}{43229}And who isn't an Iranian.
{43256}{43342}Oh... Moody, I can't believe that.
{43347}{43471}- Your work was going so well.|- You think they like Iranians in Michigan?
{43494}{43615}It's always there... just under the surface.
{43683}{43758}Not one of my colleagues
{43763}{43823}has ever stood up for me|whenever there was trouble.
{43828}{43866}Honey, that's not true.
{43871}{43954}We're talking|about the medical profession.
{43959}{44052}They're supposed to be|an educated group of people.
{44057}{44106}What are we gonna do?
{44187}{44291}Well... I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
{44296}{44384}We're gonna go home tomorrow|and find out how this happened.
{44389}{44459}We'll appeal. It's America. We've got laws.
{44464}{44528}We've got friends.|You've got lots of friends.
{44533}{44590}And this just can't happen.
{44646}{44682}Hey!
{44708}{44778}Stop that. Look at you|messing everything up.
{44783}{44828}Get your own stuff together.
{44833}{44931}- I don't think they'll let this through.|- Maybe Mammal can ship it.
{44936}{45041}Do you wanna pack Toby Bunny|or carry him? It's gonna be hot.
{45046}{45083}- Pack him.|- OK.
{45088}{45169}Sit down and fold up|all those clothes you messed up.
{45174}{45241}- Can I put them in the suitcase?|- Yes.
{45246}{45318}Sweetheart, you haven't packed.|Do you want me to do it?
{45323}{45369}No.
{45459}{45505}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{45510}{45637}You must take passport to the airport|three days before to get approval.
{45642}{45737}- Approval? What approval?|- You must get stamp.
{45742}{45814}- You cannot leave today.|- When's the next flight?
{45819}{45868}I don't know.
{46004}{46086}- Moody, what is this?|- I don't know.
{46091}{46176}We'll have to wait|for the next available flight, I guess.
{46288}{46349}How could you not|take care of the passports?
{46354}{46484}- Didn't somebody tell you about this?|- Nobody thought about it.
{46489}{46611}We'll go to the airport|and tell them we didn't know about it.
{46616}{46720}Maybe they'll let us through. If not,|we'll sit and wait for the next flight.
{46725}{46800}I don't know how to say this to you.
{46830}{46905}We're not going back. We're staying here.
{46948}{46998}What do you mean? How long?
{47003}{47080}I want to get a job here. In a hospital.
{47106}{47205}- What?|- I want us to live in Iran.
{47231}{47302}No. No.
{47307}{47384}- There's nothing for me in America.|- No.
{47429}{47544}Are you crazy? We're Americans.|Your daughter's an American.
{47549}{47608}Moody, honey,|you're upset about your job.
{47613}{47672}I understand that. We're gonna fix it.
{47677}{47727}- I want Mahtob to grow up here.|- No!
{47732}{47811}- I think she should become a Muslim.|- No! No.
{47894}{47943}You lied to me.
{47969}{48071}You lied to me. You held the Koran|and swore nothing was gonna happen.
{48076}{48155}- Mommy.|- You were planning this all the time.
{48160}{48220}- Aren't we going home today?|- Yes, we are.
{48225}{48324}- Go downstairs and say goodbye.|- All right.
{48329}{48375}{Y:i}(door shuts)
{48459}{48517}Moody, I know what's been going on.
{48522}{48602}They've got no right.|You've got to resist it.
{48796}{48897}I know how much you miss your family,|how guilty they make you feel.
{48902}{48961}I know the pressure|they're putting on you.
{48966}{49055}I promise we'll come back.|We'll spend time here.
{49060}{49117}But we can't stay here.
{49122}{49192}This is a backward, primitive country.
{49218}{49280}I won't live here|or bring up my daughter here.
{49285}{49377}How can you consider raising|Mahtob here with how they treat women?
{49382}{49445}- I know it's the right decision.|- No.
{49450}{49531}- For all of us. For you and for Mahtob.|- You can't mean this.
{49536}{49643}I'm a doctor. They're desperate|for doctors. I could do a lot of good here.
{49648}{49704}- Please...|- Besides, I'm a Muslim.
{49709}{49763}- This is where I should be.|- Don't do this.
{49768}{49847}I know it seems harsh,|but it's the best thing for all of us.
{49852}{49955}- Mahtob could learn real values here.|- No! I won't stay here. You can't...
{49960}{50010}You listen to me.
{50015}{50065}You're in my country now.
{50070}{50151}You're my wife. You do as I say.|You understand me?
{50193}{50242}We're staying here.
{51041}{51123}Mammal, would you translate for me?
{51187}{51294}Please excuse me if I don't get my words|straight. I'm a bit shaken up.
{51378}{51477}I wanted to talk to you to see|if you could understand my feelings.
{51512}{51559}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{51595}{51671}Moody and I have been married|for seven years.
{51676}{51755}We have loved each other very much|and trusted each other.
{51760}{51811}Trust was always very important.
{51816}{51876}{Y:i}(Mammal translates)
{51881}{51934}I didn't want to come here.
{51939}{52017}Moody knew that.|I made it very clear to him.
{52022}{52134}The only reason I came was to visit|with you so you could meet our daughter.
{52208}{52260}But I was frightened.
{52281}{52382}So Moody swore to me on the holy Koran|that nothing like this could happen.
{52467}{52552}He held the Koran and he swore to me.
{52557}{52606}Isn't that true, Moody?
{52611}{52683}I had to. You wouldn't|have come with me if I hadn't.
{52749}{52802}Baba Hajji, you're a religious man.
{52807}{52888}How can Moody swear on the Koran|and then do this to me?
{52893}{52961}{Y:i}(translates)
{53000}{53069}{Y:i}(replies angrily)
{53134}{53195}{Y:i}(all start shouting)
{53278}{53331}Allah will forgive him.
{53336}{53416}{Y:i}(continues in Farsi)
{53456}{53505}No! No!
{53510}{53585}Ameh Bozorg, Ameh Bozorg,|please help me! Please!
{53839}{53919}No, you can't do this. Damn you!
{53924}{54059}Damn you! You can't keep me here!|You had this planned all along!
{54064}{54118}Damn you!
{54945}{55007}I'll be with you.
{55060}{55114}I'll help you.
{55268}{55321}You try to go to sleep.
{55462}{55523}Where are the cheque-books|and credit cards?
{55528}{55627}And I'll need the house keys|and the keys to the car.
{55714}{55778}They're in the small bag, I think.
{55952}{55984}Moody?
{56046}{56132}- Talk to me. Please!|- There's nothing more to say.
{56170}{56250}Oh, Moody, please. Please talk to me.
{56426}{56458}Mahmood...
{56463}{56512}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{56688}{56752}{Y:i}(thunder crashes)
{56881}{56974}{Y:i}(Moody) I told you to stop calling here.|No, she's not available.
{56979}{57078}She's also my wife,|which means she wants to do what I want.
{57109}{57188}You're not helping him by doing this.
{57193}{57296}Yes, I know and I'm very sorry,|but this isn't gonna help his illness,
{57301}{57350}so please leave us alone.
{57355}{57404}No, I will not discuss...
{57430}{57547}I really don't care about that. The State|Department can do what the hell it likes!
{58006}{58085}Betty, you've got to eat.
{58090}{58176}You can't keep this up.|You're gonna make yourself sick.
{58356}{58481}If I thought you really wanted to stay here,|we could have such a great life.
{58646}{58788}You know... when I first heard|the Shah was leaving Iran...
{58793}{58878}it was just after Mahtob was born.
{58883}{58980}I couldn't believe it. It was just amazing.
{58985}{59085}They had everyone on the streets.|Millions of people.
{59142}{59206}I should have been here.
{59231}{59315}For the first time,|we could say to everyone,
{59320}{59441}"This is our faith. This is our way of life.|This is who we are. "
{59483}{59535}And nothing could stop us.
{59595}{59656}You can't imagine what that was like.
{59977}{60060}I know things have been hard for you,|but they'll get better.
{60065}{60114}I promise you.
{60539}{60628}- Dear Lord, hear our prayer.|- Dear Lord, hear our prayer.
{60633}{60703}Please help us leave Iran|and get back to America.
{60708}{60797}Please help us leave Iran|and get back to America.
{60802}{60850}Please let nothing separate us.
{60855}{60905}Please let nothing separate us.
{60910}{60978}And keep us always safe in your care.
{60983}{61046}And keep us always safe in your care.

{64278}{64355}- Stop it, Daddy!|- It's OK. It's between Mommy and me.
{64360}{64454}It was nothing. I tried to call Nasserine.|I got the wrong number.
{64459}{64548}What do you think?|You think you can lie to me?
{64553}{64642}You think you can do anything|without me knowing about it?
{64647}{64690}My family tell me everything.
{64695}{64774}They're watching you all the time,|so don't be stupid.

{65089}{65166}- I don't wanna go to school.|- What school? When?

{66918}{67023}We don't have our passports. My husband|has them. We're American citizens.

{67526}{67566}- Please sit.|- Thank you.
{67599}{67650}We're so glad to see you.
{67690}{67751}I spoke with my mother|in the United States.
{67756}{67820}I know the State Department is into this.
{67825}{67903}We're just very happy to be here.|We'll sleep anywhere.
{67908}{67983}For as long as it takes,|until you can get us out.
{67988}{68075}What are you talking about?|You cannot stay here.
{68117}{68221}I can't go back to my husband.|I wanna go home to the United States.
{68226}{68282}That may be, but you are in Iran.
{68312}{68394}- You are married to an Iranian?|- Yes.
{68399}{68451}- Then you are an Iranian citizen.|- No.
{68456}{68558}I'm not. I'm an American citizen|and my daughter's an American citizen.
{68563}{68655}We were born in the United States.|We have American passports.
{68660}{68749}I mean, we don't have them with us.|My husband has them.
{68754}{68828}We've never changed our citizenship.
{68867}{68974}If you marry an Iranian man, you|automatically become an Iranian citizen.
{68979}{69046}The laws regarding women are very strict.
{69051}{69135}You cannot travel anywhere|without written permission.
{69140}{69241}You have no rights to the children.|They go to the man in a divorce.
{69289}{69355}I'm sorry,|but you have to go back to your husband.
{69360}{69426}But we'll never get out of Iran.
{69431}{69522}We're being held hostage.|It was almost impossible to come here.
{69527}{69643}Mrs Mahmoody, there are many American|women here in similar circumstances.
{69724}{69793}May I ask you why you came to Iran?
{69933}{69982}I don't know.
{70023}{70072}I don't know.
{70110}{70161}I was afraid to come.
{70244}{70301}I wanted to please him.
{70306}{70367}I trusted him.
{70372}{70460}I was frightened|but I never thought this would happen.
{70465}{70530}I thought of him as an American.
{70587}{70671}He's changed. Oh, God, he's changed.
{70707}{70752}Look, Mrs Mahmoody...
{70785}{70917}Many came back after the Revolution|feeling guilty about being away,
{70922}{71015}about turning their backs|on Iran and on Islam.
{71048}{71180}Now Iran is an Islamic state and that's|a wonderful thing for many Iranians.
{71277}{71349}Well, if there is anything I can do...
{71354}{71475}Maybe if you need to organise|telephone calls to the US
{71480}{71561}or if you want to write letters home,|let me know.
{71916}{72004}So if Daddy asks,|we went for a walk and got lost.

{74734}{74796}I can't believe she's five, can you?
{74833}{74865}No.
{74933}{75041}Thank you for today.|The doll and everything.
{75144}{75188}I miss her.
{75343}{75421}Seems I haven't|spent much time with her lately.
{75486}{75526}Moody...
{75571}{75635}I wanna make it work.
{75713}{75783}You were such a wonderful father today.
{75788}{75860}It brought it all back.
{75865}{75948}Honey, I want you to be happy.|I want to make you happy.
{75986}{76047}I need you to help me.
{76153}{76193}Oh, Betty.
{76307}{76358}I didn't want it to be like this.
{76396}{76490}I love you. I never wanna hurt you.
{76516}{76629}Oh, Moody. Moody, I need you to help me.
{76709}{76761}We can't stay in this house.
{76766}{76862}It's my sister's house.|She'd be insulted if we went away.
{76867}{76945}No. She doesn't want us here.|She doesn't like me.
{76996}{77040}We got nowhere else to go.
{77045}{77102}We could stay|with Mammal and Nasserine.
{77107}{77166}We helped them|when they were in the States.
{77171}{77268}Nasserine goes to classes.|I could babysit. I could help.
{77273}{77309}Please.
{77377}{77416}Oh, Betty.
{77447}{77496}I don't wanna lose you.
{77595}{77669}I want you to tell me|anything I can ever do.
{77695}{77746}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{77751}{77804}- The kitchen?|- Kitchen.
{77809}{77858}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{77863}{77949}I'll cook for you.|I'm so grateful, Nasserine.
{78095}{78139}Thank you so much.
{78144}{78199}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{78320}{78387}I was telling them|the same rules apply as before.
{78887}{78936}You have to wear a chador tonight.
{78941}{78973}Oh?
{78978}{79050}My uncle's a mullah.|He's highly respected.
{79055}{79151}He's a very influential man.|He's written books on Islam.
{79189}{79263}Maybe he's gonna help me get a job.
{79367}{79435}Betty, you are very good Iranian cook.
{79440}{79505}- Thank you.|- You are lucky people.
{79585}{79634}Why you wear chador?
{79716}{79780}- I thought I had to.|- But why?
{79785}{79900}Chador is Persian tradition.|It's not necessary to wear it inside.
{79905}{79969}It is exaggerated with some people now.
{80019}{80068}Mahmood told me you read Koran.
{80073}{80138}Yes. I try.
{80143}{80188}- I like to.|- Very good.
{80193}{80287}- You go to Koran class?|- No.
{80330}{80414}Mahmood must send you there.|They are in English language.
{80585}{80685}- Would you like?|- Yes. Very much.
{80818}{80908}The Hadiths or reports|are the collected sayings of the Prophet
{80913}{80991}with additional commentaries|by devout and learned men.
{80996}{81115}In our readings from the Koran, we'll|consider the Hadiths when appropriate.
{81120}{81185}- What page are we on?|- I don't know. She just...
{81213}{81297}- You're American.|- Yes.
{81325}{81431}.. without there being on it an imam|guiding the people to God.
{81436}{81498}- We lived there!|- You're kidding?
{81503}{81558}- Chicago.|- But I lived in Michigan.
{81563}{81596}- Where?|- Near Lancing.
{81601}{81667}- Where?|- It's a little place. Owosso.
{81672}{81777}I lived there for five years!|I went to grammar school there.
{81782}{81876}- My husband had his own practice there.|- My husband's a doctor too.
{81881}{81935}I can't believe this!
{81959}{82092}Now I work for an English language|magazine for Islamic women.
{82097}{82158}- Have you become Muslim?|- Mm-hm.
{82193}{82310}- Did you convert?|- Well, I wanted to, I guess.
{82315}{82423}My husband was happy I did.|It made things a lot better.
{82478}{82522}Er... I gotta go.
{82527}{82576}- Ellen, it's been...|- No, really.
{82795}{82834}Moody.
{82839}{82960}I just met an American woman in class.|From Owosso. Her husband's a doctor.
{82965}{83015}- Are they here?|- They just left.
{83020}{83077}She's invited us over. Is that all right?
{83082}{83131}Yeah, that's fine.
{83169}{83266}I want you to ask questions|when you're out with your daddy.
{83271}{83364}I want you to ask him questions|about taxis and buses.
{83369}{83429}- And how much things cost.|- OK.
{83434}{83589}All right? Ask him questions about signs.|What the signs mean, what they say.
{83594}{83645}- All right.|- Then you can teach me.
{83650}{83715}Why do you wanna learn all that?
{83720}{83776}I have to if we're gonna get out of here.
{83824}{83895}{Y:i}- (Mahtob) What's that?|- (Moody) His name on the sign.
{83900}{84004}- What's he sell?|- All kinds of things they sell here.
{84035}{84141}These are pictures of people|who died in the war.
{84146}{84215}{Y:i}(speak Farsi)
{84334}{84402}- Why all these questions, honey?|- What's that?
{84407}{84516}- That's the rest of the market and...|- What do they do?
{84711}{84817}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{84822}{84884}Telephone. Telephone.
{85158}{85239}The moment the Shah left|I wanted to go back to Iran,
{85244}{85290}but Ellen didn't want to.
{85295}{85387}So I said, "Fine. I'll go without you. "
{85392}{85448}So she came.
{85476}{85573}The first year in Iran|things were very bad between us.
{85578}{85645}She couldn't adjust. Could you, Ellen?
{85650}{85736}It took quite a time before she understood|how to be a good wife.
{85928}{85977}Warm, isn't it?
{86007}{86043}Yes.
{86162}{86211}Why did you come back?
{86237}{86306}I mean, my God,|he let you go home to the States...
{86311}{86366}and you came back.
{86371}{86432}Maybe at the beginning if...
{86437}{86532}Of course there was the custody problem|with the kids, so...
{86568}{86617}It was tough for me.
{86622}{86696}I had no experience.|A small American town.
{86762}{86862}- Was he violent?|- Not in the States, never.
{86867}{86934}You're not supposed to. It's not Islamic.
{87001}{87094}Marriages do work out here.|They can be good.
{87131}{87257}It's been hard for me at times,|but you've got to give it time, Betty.
{87262}{87330}Islam has such beauty in it.
{87335}{87418}I mean, I'm glad my kids|are growing up as Muslims.
{87496}{87534}Ellen...
{87539}{87660}I'm so happy we're friends. When you told|me you were from home, I was thrilled.
{87665}{87709}It was like a miracle.
{87735}{87771}Ellen...
{87876}{87949}I have something I want to tell you.
{87954}{88063}If I do, can you keep it a secret?|Not tell your husband?
{88115}{88166}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{88197}{88274}Ellen, I'm sorry. Please forget I spoke.
{88336}{88412}No, it's OK. Go ahead.
{88438}{88530}I won't tell him. That's a promise.
{88535}{88584}Would you take this letter for me?
{88589}{88647}I'm trying to get back home to America.
{88652}{88755}My family is working on it, but Moody|knows where I am every minute.
{88760}{88799}{Y:i}(door opens)
{88804}{88921}Are you crazy? Don't you realise|what can happen? Terrible things.
{88926}{88971}You just can't, Betty.
{88976}{89044}If you were caught,|they could execute you.
{89247}{89346}It's for the Embassy. Please.
{89481}{89530}{Y:i}(speak Farsi)
{89686}{89731}Can you believe that?
{89736}{89836}They're desperate for doctors,|they've got casualties from the war,
{89841}{89915}but because I trained in America,|no one will give me a job.
{89920}{89966}{Y:i}(Mammal) It's not the reason.
{89971}{90020}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{90046}{90166}Hard to believe this country was getting|sophisticated before the Revolution.
{90171}{90251}We were building chemical plants,|oil refineries,
{90256}{90322}multi-million dollar installations.
{90327}{90437}They're all rotting because nobody knows|how to operate them!
{90442}{90486}It's all so primitive!
{90491}{90540}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{90602}{90715}Honey, somebody needs to go to|the market. We're out of meat and things.
{90720}{90804}- I can't go.|- It's for tonight's dinner.
{90809}{90911}I can't go. You'll have to wait|till Nasserine gets back.
{90916}{90966}She's late. What'll we do tonight?
{90971}{91050}I don't know!|Can't you go by yourself for a change?
{91076}{91137}Yeah. I can, really.
{91142}{91226}I know the way. It's not far.|I'll take the children.
{91427}{91492}You give me a list of everything you need
{91497}{91582}and I'll tell you what time|for you to be back here.
{91618}{91696}Take the baby with you.|Mahtob can stay here with me.

{91805}{91887}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{92174}{92223}{Y:i}(in Farsi)
{92228}{92321}- You are American?|- Yes.
{92347}{92407}I need dozaari for the telephone.
{92412}{92522}I was in America many times.|New York. Amarillo, Texas.
{92572}{92613}You want to telephone?
{92650}{92710}Please. Come. Please.
{92933}{92969}Thank you.
{93092}{93177}American Interests section.|Nicole Adjanian.
{93203}{93310}Nicole, it's Betty. Have you heard anything|from the State Department?
{93349}{93408}No, I can't.
{93413}{93519}Because he watches me all the time|or he has somebody watch me.
{93550}{93658}I didn't know that.|Will they let us go if I get a divorce?
{93714}{93749}What?
{93779}{93879}I can't do that... I can't do that.
{93933}{94046}I won't leave her.|Nicole... Nicole, I won't leave her!
{94099}{94176}All right. I'll get to the Embassy if I can.
{94449}{94503}Thank you. You're very kind.
{94508}{94597}You can use the telephone|when you want. No problem.
{94628}{94710}- Thank you.|- I like America very much.
{94715}{94779}My son was with University of Texas.

{94962}{95084}My name is Hamid.|Any time for telephone, you come here.
{95168}{95217}I'm Betty.
{95341}{95446}- Who'll take me to school tomorrow?|- I don't know, honey.
{95451}{95521}It'll either be me or it'll be Daddy.
{95526}{95617}- But I want you to.|- I don't know if I can, Mahtob.
{95655}{95714}Why can't you?
{95757}{95793}Honey...
{95857}{95957}I promise you I'll be there|and everything will be all right.
{96001}{96037}OK?
{96092}{96128}Come on.
{96155}{96195}- Dear Lord.|- Dear Lord.
{96200}{96240}- Hear our prayer.|- Hear our prayer.
{96245}{96332}- We beg you to help us leave Iran.|- We beg you to help us leave Iran.
{96337}{96430}- And get back to America.|- And get back to America.
{96435}{96520}{Y:i}(Mahtob cries)
{96525}{96669}I'll be back this afternoon, sweetheart.|I'll be back. I'll be back, sweetheart.
{96674}{96747}Sweetheart, I'll be back.|I'll be here, sweetheart.

{96856}{97009}Mommy, please! Mommy, don't leave me!|Don't leave me!
{97870}{97957}Nasserine, take the baby. I'll get the rice.
{98168}{98208}Hamid. I can't stay.
{98213}{98295}You must come inside.|There is someone here.
{98423}{98494}Miss Nassimi. She came to help you.
{98552}{98613}Hamid told me you wished to leave Iran.
{98618}{98674}You know it is extremely dangerous.
{98679}{98732}I have to get back to the United States.
{98737}{98810}- Why don't you try to get a divorce?|- No.
{98815}{98902}If I get a divorce, my husband|will get custody of my daughter.
{98907}{98992}If they catch you with your daughter,|they could execute you.
{98997}{99049}- I can't leave her. I have to...|- Please.
{99075}{99156}Wait. I think we can help you.
{99161}{99215}My brother has helped many people here.
{99220}{99323}I will be here Wednesday and Thursday|at this time if you can come.
{99362}{99462}Here is my telephone number.|Memorise it, please. Don't keep it.

{99707}{99742}Betty!
{99747}{99806}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{99872}{99917}I got the rice.
{99950}{99990}Sorry.
{100198}{100256}What happened?
{100261}{100310}She was crying all day again.
{100340}{100390}I had to go pick her up.
{100395}{100466}We can't make her do this, Moody.|She's frightened.
{100471}{100599}I know. Tomorrow they want you|to go to school with her.
{100604}{100636}OK.
{100662}{100720}They want you to stay with her every day.
{100725}{100802}Of course. Of course I'll stay with her.
{100828}{100884}They're all devout women there.
{100917}{100966}You'll be watched.
{101013}{101052}OK.
{101092}{101164}I just want Mahtob to be happy.
{101169}{101249}I want her to have a happy childhood.|Don't you want that?
{101254}{101337}Islam's the greatest gift|I can give my child.

{103684}{103777}You said there'd be no danger.|Mahtob could have been killed!
{103782}{103893}America's doing this. Who supplies the|bombs, the planes? Who's backing Iraq?
{103898}{103997}Don't be so naive. America's responsible|for this war, no one else!
{104468}{104540}You should not behave this way.
{104545}{104592}I had to tell Hormoz.
{104597}{104678}It is your duty as a wife|to tell your husband everything!
{104683}{104732}You cannot have secrets!

{105751}{105817}Very nice. Very nice.
{106003}{106093}Mahtob... very nice.
{106098}{106139}Very nice.
{106216}{106341}I am very sorry... It's bad in Iran.
{106346}{106409}Bad for you... your husband.
{106437}{106481}I'm sorry.
{106528}{106628}We help you. We help you. Help you.
{106676}{106759}- Could I use the telephone?|- Telephone? Nah! Nah.
{106843}{106988}Husband, no telephone.|You inside. You inside.
{106993}{107029}Right.
{107077}{107191}You come after morning. Eleven.

{107357}{107407}{Y:i}(women all agree)
{107412}{107473}Thank you.
{107503}{107574}{Y:i}(man) There are three principal ways|out of Iran.
{107600}{107705}You could go to Baluchistan and then|across the mountains into Pakistan.
{107710}{107821}In the south-west to Bandar Abbas,|then across the Gulf by boat to Oman.
{107826}{107875}This is the most dangerous route.
{107880}{108000}From Tehran, across the Zagros|Mountains, through Kurdistan into Turkey.
{108005}{108084}There are checkpoints|and the border's heavily armed.
{108089}{108169}- Which way do you think is best?|- The Gulf.
{108241}{108285}How much will it cost?
{108290}{108418}When you and your daughter are back in|America, perhaps you will reimburse me.
{108423}{108523}Dollars would be of more help to me|than Iranian currency.
{108579}{108628}Keep in touch with my sister.
{108633}{108681}Right.
{108686}{108775}{Y:i}(woman speaks in Farsi)
{108797}{108852}{Y:i}(Betty) Run! Run!

{112080}{112145}She is from the Embassy.|I need to take Mahtob.
{112150}{112216}{Y:i}(speaks Farsi)
{112221}{112284}Nah, nah! Impossible. Child goes to father.

{112361}{112412}Madam, you wait, husband come.
{112417}{112479}- I want my baby!|- Madam! Madam!
{112484}{112549}I want my baby! I want my baby!
{112554}{112624}I want my baby!
{112629}{112687}Betty, they won't let you take her.
{112692}{112775}The State Department want you|to go to the Iranian Foreign Minister.
{112780}{112928}No! The State Department don't understand|the culture. They'll only make things worse!
{112933}{113027}- You wait for your husband.|- Tell her I want my baby. I want my baby!

{114152}{114205}Listen, honey, don't talk right now.
{114210}{114309}Because I have to tell you you can't talk|about Hamid or the Embassy
{114314}{114390}because if you do,|they'll never let us get away.
{114395}{114471}Don't say anything. Do you hear me?
{114521}{114590}Mommy, don't leave me. Don't go away.
{114595}{114653}I promise you. I promise I won't leave you.
{114658}{114718}Do you hear? I won't leave you.
{114922}{115021}- Where are Mammal and Nasserine?|- You, don't ask questions.
{115107}{115171}Is that enough for you, sweetheart?
{115359}{115408}They've moved in with Ameh Bozorg.
{115781}{115843}- Moody, what are you doing?|- Mommy!
{115848}{115933}Please don't take her!|Moody! Moody! Please!
{115938}{116025}Please don't take her!|Moody, please don't take her! Moody!

{123350}{123402}We will fly you to Bandar Abbas
{123407}{123491}and then take you by speedboat|across the Gulf.
{123614}{123678}I'll never be able to thank you.
{123716}{123780}Please, Betty. There's really no need.
{123845}{123933}Just make the journey safely.
{124051}{124121}I wish you could have seen this|in the summer.
{124160}{124226}All the flowers have gone now, of course.
{124231}{124318}Gardens have always|had a special place in Persia.
{124323}{124374}Throughout our history.
{124379}{124453}In fact, the word "paradise"|is a Persian word.
{124501}{124563}It's hard to believe|that the idea of paradise
{124568}{124642}will always be|intimately connected with Iran.
{124697}{124821}Whenever I think of what's happening to|my country, I try to remember its gardens.
{124914}{124989}You must try and phone me now|whenever you can.
{125036}{125077}By Christmas you'll be home.
{125082}{125156}{Y:i}("Joy to the World")
{125398}{125438}Betty.
{125576}{125645}Merry Christmas.
{125680}{125732}{Y:i}I'm sorry. The Gulf got too dangerous.
{125737}{125819}Warships are checking|all the civilian boats.
{125824}{125913}Zahedan is safer, so I've booked|a flight for you and Mahtob
{125918}{126003}on Wednesday 29th January,|ten days from now.
{126008}{126106}Wednesday. Good.|Moody's at the hospital on Wednesdays.
{126111}{126200}On the 29th, take Mahtob|to the school bus as usual.
{126205}{126262}We will pick you both up|from the bus stop,
{126267}{126338}take you to a safe house|until it's time to go.
{126403}{126460}{Y:i}(Betty) Was he in pain?
{126497}{126533}Is he now?
{126570}{126644}How much? How long has he known?
{126682}{126770}- So he's not responding to the treatment?|- What is it?

{126922}{126990}Mother, would you hold on for a moment?
{126995}{127101}It's my father. He's not doing well.|They feel they should operate and...

{127682}{127769}- I'm sorry about your father.|- Thank you.
{128036}{128100}Will you be able to come home with us?
{128105}{128204}No, I can't go.|I'd lose my job at the hospital.
{128247}{128362}- But it's all right for Mahtob to come?|- No. You'll have to go on your own.
{128478}{128549}- I can't go without Mahtob.|- Why not?
{128554}{128628}You'll see your father.|What's the problem?
{128686}{128741}I won't go without her.
{128922}{128969}Betty...
{129009}{129060}You'll leave as soon as possible.
{129065}{129152}You'll see your father|and liquidate all our assets in the States.
{129254}{129318}It's my money and I want it!
{129323}{129359}{Y:i}(slams door)
{129364}{129443}Don't do it, Betty.|You'll never see your daughter again.
{129448}{129556}- He won't allow you back in the country.|- My father is dying.
{129561}{129643}I don't think he'd want you to|if it meant losing your daughter.
{129648}{129728}Why can't I go now, come back|and later try to get out?
{129733}{129820}You can't leave Mahtob here,|not with Moody's family.
{129825}{129892}They're from the provinces,|more fanatical than most.
{129897}{129945}This regime encourages them.
{129950}{130065}Some people here consider a girl|ready for marriage at nine years of age.
{130070}{130119}Child brides are not unknown.
{130124}{130205}If you want to be free, with Mahtob,
{130210}{130293}you've got to leave on the 29th|as we agreed.
{130298}{130412}But he may send me out before,|maybe tomorrow. He hasn't said.
{130655}{130694}For the war.
{130699}{130782}They take them younger and younger.|12 years old, some of them.
{130787}{130867}They give them plastic keys to paradise,|made in Taiwan,
{130872}{130948}and tell them they'll go|straight to heaven if they die.
{130953}{131014}They use them sometimes|to clear minefields.
{131019}{131082}They run across the field|and get blown to pieces.
{131123}{131155}OK.
{131262}{131313}We've only a week to go.
{131318}{131443}He's got to get your passport validated.|He can't do it in the time. It's impossible.
{131448}{131542}He trusts you now.|Try and do anything you can to delay him.
{131579}{131669}- Where were you?|- Moody. I went to the market.
{131697}{131798}I wanted to buy my father some gifts|but I couldn't find anything.
{131803}{131852}The one day I come home early.
{131904}{131994}I've let you go. I've given you freedom.
{132053}{132116}OK. Listen to me.
{132121}{132273}If you don't do as I say, I'll lock you up|and you'll never see Mahtob again.
{132278}{132348}On the 26th|you get on that plane to America.
{132353}{132424}You send everything back here|and then you return.
{132429}{132544}In the meantime, do not touch the phone|or set foot out of the house. Is that clear?
{132549}{132581}Yes.
{132622}{132673}Moody?
{132678}{132783}- You booked for the 26th?|- What do you mean? Of course I booked.
{132788}{132849}You got the validation?|Remember last time?
{132854}{132941}Zia knows people. It's all been done.
{133259}{133354}I hope your father gets well.|I'm sorry we can't see you off tomorrow.
{133359}{133435}Please come back to us. We love you.

{134884}{134933}I have to go to the market.
{134938}{135034}There's a few things that I need.|It'll take me about 20 minutes.
{135039}{135104}- I'll go.|- No, no. It's all right.
{135109}{135150}I need some fresh air.
{135155}{135252}I'd like to buy some gifts for my father.|There's been no time.
{135257}{135306}{Y:i}(translates)

{137040}{137089}Houssein, I have her with me.
{137094}{137190}This is the last chance I have.|We have to leave now.
{137430}{137474}Betty. Come.
{137595}{137688}My brother wants you|to call your husband and delay him.
{137693}{137793}First I must call Houssein|and tell him you're safe.
{137855}{137933}- I forgot Toby Bunny.|- What?
{137958}{138009}I forgot Toby Bunny.
{138014}{138108}Honey... Honey, do you want|to go home to America?
{138134}{138201}Mahtob, stop crying.
{138206}{138258}Stop crying.
{138292}{138331}Listen now.
{138353}{138440}If we go back for Toby Bunny,|we have to stay with Daddy.
{138445}{138512}Do you want that?
{138517}{138579}But when will I see my daddy again?
{138584}{138637}I don't know.
{138720}{138756}Stop crying now.
{138784}{138834}I love you.
{138839}{138906}I love you. You be my big, brave girl.
{138988}{139020}All right.
{139025}{139136}{Y:i}- Moody, I'm not gonna get on that plane.|- Why not? What are you planning?
{139141}{139208}Nothing. I'm not planning anything.
{139213}{139285}{Y:i}- I'll call the police.|- Go ahead and call the police.
{139290}{139361}{Y:i}- There are things I'd like to tell them.|- Like what?
{139366}{139478}Like I know the clinic isn't legal.|You don't have an operating permit.
{139483}{139600}I found out. I sit there all day long.|You think I wouldn't notice?!
{139605}{139668}{Y:i}I'm only trying to be good to you.
{139673}{139754}{Y:i}- Yes.|- We don't need the police.
{139759}{139865}I agree. That won't be necessary.
{139870}{139976}{Y:i}So we can get together|and talk about this, Betty. Betty?
{139981}{140025}I'll have to think about it.
{140030}{140120}You'd better.|I don't believe a word you say any more.
{140170}{140289}How could you take Mahtob away?|You're stealing my child.
{140294}{140365}No. I'm not gonna|promise you anything, Betty.
{140370}{140428}You're my wife. Get your ass back here!
{140489}{140531}Hello, Betty. This is Zia.
{140536}{140671}Zia. I want you to tell Moody|that I have a lawyer.
{140708}{140759}Tell Moody I won't meet with him alone.
{140764}{140903}If he wants to talk with me, I'll be there|between 11 and 12 tomorrow morning
{140908}{140960}and six and eight tomorrow afternoon.
{140965}{141009}You tell him that.
{141039}{141161}We're ready. We must go. They'll|find you if you stay any longer in Tehran.
{141166}{141209}OK. Let me get my things.
{141214}{141316}We've had no time to organise paperwork,|so you may have difficulty in Turkey,
{141321}{141363}but they won't send you back.
{141368}{141429}Get to the US Embassy|when you get to Ankara.
{141434}{141529}We'll drive you to the Zagros Mountains.|Tribesmen will take you across.
{141534}{141651}They're Kurdish. Most are friendly.|They know how to avoid the checkpoints.
{141656}{141713}Do not let anybody know|you're American.
{141749}{141835}First you must be careful|of the checkpoint outside Tehran.
{141917}{141958}Betty...
{141963}{142062}Very soon I hope you will be strolling|again in your own garden at home.
