1
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:47,683
June 6, 1982, at 03:00, first 
day of the Lebanon War

2
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:09,885
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:12,004
- Assi.
- Shmulik.

4
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:15,796
I am the commander.
That's Hertzel.

5
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:19,884
I’m Yigal.

6
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,156
Hi.

7
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:25,085
Come on, Yigal. Let's move.

8
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:41,362
"It's the man that's made of steel,
the tank is only a piece of iron"

9
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:13,163
Cinderella to Rhinoceros.
Continue north.

10
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:17,035
Past the banana field, go up the road
and wait for instructions.

11
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,079
Welcome to Lebanon. Over.

12
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:53,162
We're taking the road!

13
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:03,124
Hertzel, you son of a bitch!

14
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,120
Where are we, Assi?
What's happening?

15
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:37,516
Maybe you should call them
on the radio, tell them we have arrived.

16
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,401
They said wait, we wait.

17
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,203
Someone is coming.

18
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,441
Don't point this shit at me!

19
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:56,083
- Who was it?
- A guy with a megaphone.


20
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:01,076
- Let me see.
- Wait.

21
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:29,685
- Are you in charge?
- No, I am.

22
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:44,559
So listen carefully. 
There’s your vehicle

23
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:48,162
12 men and a list of
assignments for 3 weeks.

24
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,277
How do you mean 3 weeks?

25
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:55,807
No, it's just... we were told...

26
00:05:55,887 --> 00:06:00,199
I follow a precise work plan,
I have a program to implement.

27
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,404
I will try to make it easier and explain
every mission in detail,

28
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:07,565
After that you will ask your questions.
The first job is easy.

29
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:10,286
There's a town, north, north east.

30
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:13,040
Our air force has bombed it clean.

31
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,476
At 7.00 we enter the area,

32
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:18,917
We make sure there is nothing left
and go out the other side.

33
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,238
From there we continue north.
At 9.30, 10 tops.

34
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:26,206
to arrive at the friendly zone.
It's a hotel called Saint Tropez.

35
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:30,075
We'll eat and continue with
our next assignment.

36
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,079
In the meantime you will remain
here with the vehicle on the road. 

37
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,920
If another vehicle comes by,
fire warning shots.

38
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:38,726
If they won't stop, shoot the engine.

39
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:44,036
I'm Jamil, your CO.
Questions?

40
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:48,366
Okay. You have an hour until morning.

41
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:53,119
- Good night.
- Good night.

42
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:17,240
It’s a walk in the park
to Saint Tropez.

43
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:33,124
- We have half an hour to sleep.
- Jamil said an hour.

44
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:36,439
Doesn't matter. If I say we have a
half hour, then that's what we have.

45
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:40,640
- You keep watch.
- Why does it have to be me?

46
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,877
I am the commander and I decide.

47
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:48,399
So, that’s how you want 
to start? Great!

48
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:51,519
Next time you'll tell
me to call you sir.

49
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:55,646
Call me what you like,
just shut up and let me sleep.

50
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:58,315
Wake me up in half
an hour. Goodnight.

51
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,919
Tell me, why me. Huh?
Why not Yigal?

52
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:11,722
Or... what's his name.. the new guy.
It's time, maybe he's not tired

53
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,725
Listen, Hertzel, I have my reasons.

54
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:17,076
I can ask him, right?
Would you like to be keep watch?

55
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:19,960
- Are you in charge of this vehicle?
- You are! But please...!

56
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,645
I just asked the 
new one to keep watch.

57
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:24,406
I also know that one
guard is needed.

58
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,961
- Do you have a problem with that? 
- No, no, I'm fine.

59
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,326
- Who asked you??
- No, it's that...

60
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,278
Did I ask you to keep watch?

61
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:34,559
- I told you I have my reasons! 
- What reasons, Assi? Please!

62
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,400
I'm on my last legs...
the new guy is about to replace me.

63
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:41,042
- And you tell me you have your reasons!
- Yeah, I have my reasons.

64
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:43,004
Right...

65
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:46,121
You can say what you want.
But they’re reasons I don't understand.

66
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:49,159
Ah, you don't, don't you?
Yigal has to drive, right?

67
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:50,799
I can go on duty.
No problem.

68
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:51,324
There...

69
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,198
You be quiet!
The new one is the aimer.

70
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,283
I am in charge of the vehicle and
I am responsible for our team

71
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,238
What does it mean? Like I don't count?
I'm not important?

72
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,721
I'm not saying this, what I mean
you are the loader,

73
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,406
you just grab shells and put them
in the gun, just that.

74
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:05,723
It's physical work, Assi.
It takes strength to do it.

75
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:09,203
But the aimer? What does he do?
He just takes aim and fires.

76
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:12,557
Who bends down, lifts heavy stuff,
breaks his back, burns himself,

77
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:16,725
breathing in all the fucking stink
from the gun? You? Him? Him? It's me!

78
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,839
For me there's no problem.
Seriously, I can keep watch, really.

79
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:23,243
Goodnight, Yigal. Sleep, sleep,
you need to rest.

80
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:26,165
You have to make 
that F-15 fly tomorrow.

81
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:32,201
Hertzel, please let us sleep now.
Goodnight.

82
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,198
Some reasons.

83
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:53,240
Cinderella to Rhinoceros.
A car is heading our way. Hello.

84
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,646
Cinderella to Rhinoceros,
Here we go!

85
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:06,915
Fire!

86
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,925
Shmulik. Fire!

87
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,837
He's not stopping. Shoot the
engine, Rhinoceros! Fire!

88
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,878
Fire, Shmulik! Fire!

89
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:23,880
Shoot! Fire!
Shmulik! Fire!

90
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:30,358
Shoot, damn it! Shoot!
What are you waiting for?! Fire!

91
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,798
Shoot, Shmulik!

92
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,762
They're going into the field.
Take them out!

93
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:42,123
To the right, Jonathan! 
The right...

94
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:44,484
There he is!

95
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,761
This is two: we're
chasing him on the plantation!

96
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:54,085
Why didn't you shoot? You had him
in your sights! I'm talking to you! 

97
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,922
One, this is two. We took out one terrorist.
We're following the other one.

98
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:03,245
- What's going on? Jonathan!
- He's been hit! He's been hit!

99
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:09,681
One man down. No. 1, this is no. 2:
I repeat: we have a wounded man.

100
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,081
Bring him here. Over.

101
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,880
Want some?

102
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,680
Here.

103
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,566
This is two.
Ready for resuscitation.

104
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,640
- Is the wounded man responding?
- Negative.

105
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:45,884
Talk to him, make him say something!

106
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:49,599
Talk to me, Jonathan!

107
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:51,355
I panicked.

108
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:53,165
He's not answering!

109
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:56,956
Before I only shot at cans.

110
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:59,277
I panicked.

111
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:58,883
Pass me the bottle?

112
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:12,717
Cornelia? Cornelia, this is Cinderella.

113
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:15,801
We have an angel.
I repeat: we lost one.

114
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:18,645
We need to evac the body. Over.

115
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:23,200
Can't send a chopper.
Evac the body on the Rhinoceros.

116
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,760
Cinderella to Rhinoceros.
A pickup truck is coming.

117
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,595
Shoot the engine, no warning shots,
fuck this! Over.

118
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:06,275
Peace! Peace!

119
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,718
Cornelia, this is Cinderella.
We are moving.

120
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,001
This is Cornelia.

121
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:41,716
We'll send a chopper to evac
the body within the hour.

122
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:43,600
Over.

123
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,682
Rhinoceros, he's stopping.

124
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:31,400
Stop! Stop! Don’t move!

125
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,638
Don't shoot!

126
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:09,723
Are you crazy?

127
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,479
I’m hot. This stench makes me sick.

128
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:23,639
I'm sick too. I'm gonna throw up.

129
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:27,244
From now on water is rationed,
is that clear?

130
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:32,082
- Is that clear?
- Yes, yes.

131
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:36,640
Avoid contact with civilians. Over.

132
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,119
Move! Move!

133
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,237
Go, go. Move!

134
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,682
Rhinoceros, this is Eagle.
I am above you.

135
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,281
Prepare the body for transfer.

136
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,765
Attention.
I’m lowering the harness.

137
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:33,766
I’m lowering the harness.
Secure the body.

138
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:44,124
We're going to lift the body.
The body is going up.

139
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:19,518
You want some, Assi?

140
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,923
Here, Shmulik. You want some?

141
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:31,963
- You want some, Hertzel?
- Cereals, yeah...

142
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:09,205
Ok. We will ride into the town.
We will have one hour to cross it.

143
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,076
Should not be difficult,
the Air Force have already had their fun,

144
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:14,083
we just need to clean up the leftovers.

145
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:18,001
Remember that international conventions
prohibit the use of phosphorous bombs.

146
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,363
We will respect the law and
no longer use the word ‘phosphorus’.

147
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:24,922
From now on we will say ‘smoke bombs’
instead of ‘phosphorous bombs’.

148
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,483
Any questions?

149
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:32,843
- Good.
- I have a question.

150
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:42,246
Is it possible for someone,
maybe Cornelia

151
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,926
to call my parents to tell them
that I'm alright?

152
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:51,720
I am the only son, 
my parents are old.

153
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:57,800
- What's your name?
- Yigal.

154
00:23:57,847 --> 00:24:02,363
Negative.

155
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:18,160
You're killing me with your
stupid ass questions.

156
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,795
- What have I done?
- Nothing. You have not done anything.

157
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:28,516
Hertzel, what have I done?

158
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,044
Another stupid-ass question...

159
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:33,203
Cornelia to Cinderella.

160
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:36,478
We have information about terrorists
who have taken civilian hostages.

161
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:39,166
The orders are to put
an end to that game. Over.

162
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,120
What are you doing? You know
smoking is not allowed in the turret.

163
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:44,721
Assi, I'm hot. Get off my case.

164
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:48,285
- Will you put it out?
- And relax a bit!

165
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:51,165
Put that cigarette out, Hertzel!
That's an order!

166
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,121
This is Cinderella.
On my mark we go in.

167
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:58,596
Do not forget the cover.
Over.

168
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:13,720
This is Cinderella, keep your eyes open
and cover one another.

169
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,362
From this moment you do
not take risks, you shoot to kill.

170
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,758
Go on, Rhinoceros.

171
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,844
Rhinoceros, stop.

172
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:46,357
We’ll search the area.

173
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:18,326
- I have to pee.
- What?

174
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:21,362
- I gotta pee. Can’t hold it.
- Later.

175
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:25,002
- Herztel, give me the box.
- Not now, wait.

176
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,277
Hertzel, what are you doing? Hertzel...

177
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:36,323
Rhinoceros, they’re shooting at us
from above.  Take them out. Over.

178
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:45,487
Rhinoceros, fire.
Fire!

179
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:48,320
- What? What’s he yelling?
- I do not know what he’s saying, Shmulik!

180
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,164
Shoot! Shoot!

181
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:56,720
Rhinoceros, wake your aimer
and let's finish with the bullshit.

182
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:59,565
Shoot, you read me? Fire!
Shit, are you deaf?

183
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:02,923
Can’t you hear? Hertzel,
Do it!

184
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,677
- It’s a little girl, Assi!
- Rhinoceros, shoot!

185
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:08,287
Tell him there’s a girl, Assi!
Tell him there’s a girl!

186
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:09,959
Shoot, Rhinoceros. Shoot!

187
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:12,965
Shoot, Shmulik! Shoot! That's an order!
You hear me, asshole?

188
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,567
I'm begging you! Shoot! Shoot!

189
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:00,317
Down! He's down!

190
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:07,442
Do not come closer.

191
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,723
Leave him, Michael!
Look up!

192
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:17,685
This is number two.
We’re at the entrance to the building.

193
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:22,000
- Do not come near. Step away.
- Have you seen my daughter?

194
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:26,405
- Have you seen her?
- Do not come any closer. Get away!

195
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,637
The stairway’s clear.

196
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:37,357
Her name is Wafa.
She’s only five. What happened to her?

197
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:38,806
Go away!

198
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:48,647
- Where is my daughter?
- Do not come closer! Go away! Go away!

199
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,078
Where is my daughter?

200
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:57,724
Answer me! Give me back my child!

201
00:28:57,767 --> 00:29:03,319
- Don’t touch me! Stop it!
- Give me back my child!

202
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:10,925
Do not get up!

203
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:17,443
Don’t get up!
They’re shooting!

204
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:46,764
Stay down. It's dangerous.

205
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,284
We’re entering an apartment.
Grenade!

206
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:15,759
Apartment clean.
Bodies of two terrorists and a girl.

207
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,599
No losses.

208
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:22,565
Come out of there. Over.

209
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:02,159
Listen to me carefully...

210
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:05,520
So far I haven’t said anything.
I kept saying to myself:

211
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:08,600
Don’t be hard on him,
Whatever happened, happened.

212
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:11,241
But from now and until
further notice...

213
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:15,957
if so much as a fly moves,
I want a phosphorous bomb...

214
00:31:16,127 --> 00:31:18,880
I’m sorry, what I meant was:
I want a smoke bomb.

215
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,877
- What's your name?
- Shmulik.

216
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,596
Shmulik, don’t let me down.

217
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:38,245
You are responsible for what
I have told him. Be careful!

218
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:46,397
So far we have played cops and
robbers, now it’s war.

219
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:21,476
Understand? I'm talking to you.
You understand?

220
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:26,764
Because if it doesn’t work, I’m fucked.
You’re playing with my life here.

221
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:34,361
The aimer... he’s a virgin!

222
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:55,726
- I will not die because of you!
- Assi, relax a little, wil you?

223
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:59,396
Relax? If he won't change his 
attitude we’re all gonna roast here.

224
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:03,965
This is phosphorus here. You know what it is?
I’m talking to you. You know phosphorus?

225
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,959
Not even fingernails will remain!
Not one fingernail!

226
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:09,561
Not even a piece of meat for
the flies, not a drop...

227
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,996
So you take the trigger, ok?

228
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,967
- What?
- You have a trigger too, right?

229
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:19,079
- Yes, so what?
- Then squeeze it.

230
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:23,365
Show me how you do it.
I will aim and you pull the trigger.

231
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:25,762
You’re giving me orders? Did you hear?
He’s giving me orders…

232
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,685
What orders? Come on!
What orders?

233
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,764
Just don’t put their blood
on my hands.

234
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:36,437
You can shoot too. That's all.

235
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:46,485
What’s with the face, eh?

236
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:49,764
Nothing. But you must admit
he has a point.

237
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:51,400
Whose side are you on, mine or his?

238
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,403
On mine, Assi.

239
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:56,485
You are in charge, 
you can’t take sides.

240
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,206
I don’t know what to say to your
stupid-ass explanations!

241
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:03,286
You are a shitty loader,
any moron could do your job!

242
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:05,363
You’re giving me a headache, relax.

243
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:07,756
Who are you telling to relax?!
I am more relaxed than you!

244
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:10,685
What’s coming over you both?

245
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:16,156
We’re being shot at !!!

246
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:23,885
Rhinoceros, the left!

247
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:05,163
"It's the man that's made of steel,
the tank is only a piece of iron"

248
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:25,316
The tank is fine,
it wasn't hit badly.

249
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:53,844
This is number two, Cinderella
I have something for you.

250
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:59,643
This is Cinderella, we’re coming.

251
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:16,878
Shmulik, you see something?

252
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:21,597
Jamil is with someone.
Yigal, do you see something?

253
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:24,247
There’s a wall in the way.

254
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:48,360
It is the Syrian who shot at your vehicle.

255
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:57,325
Everyone alright? No injuries?

256
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,917
Yigal, take the chain.

257
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:07,046
Take it, move! Tighten it!

258
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,965
Hold his hands. I'll hold him down.
Lock it! Lock it!

259
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,479
Lock it! Did you lock it?

260
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,320
- Did you lock it?
- I can’t!

261
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:23,403
- Lock it!
- It’s done!

262
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:35,841
This is morphine.
If he starts to stir

263
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:38,646
give him a shot of this
drop after drop.

264
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:49,277
Cornelia, this is Cinderella.
We have a cricket with us.

265
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,599
Sure it's a cricket?

266
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:56,164
If it sings like a cricket and looks 
like a cricket then it must be a cricket.

267
00:37:57,647 --> 00:38:00,400
- Your position?
- More or less in the center of town.

268
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,519
In some travel agency 
or something like that.

269
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:06,559
Copy that. Wait for us.

270
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,955
What are you doing here,
Syrian soldier boy?

271
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:49,320
- What's your name?
- Hertzel.

272
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,676
You have problems with Syrians?

273
00:38:52,087 --> 00:38:54,999
No, but we’re in in Lebanon.
We thought you had Lebanese here.

274
00:38:55,047 --> 00:39:00,075
This is Cornelia. You seem to have
deviated from your route.

275
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:05,037
Maybe it seems that way from
where you stand. I see no deviations here.

276
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:10,199
Predatory birds want your
location, Cinderella. Wait.

277
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,477
Cinderella, attention.
You deviated from your course

278
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:50,678
and entered an area controlled
by the Syrians.

279
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:56,164
Cinderella to Cornelia,
I am in the center of town.

280
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:59,683
I have not deviated one iota from the path
that had been established.

281
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:01,638
I have not deviated.

282
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:04,597
It does not matter now what you
have or have not done.

283
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:07,639
You’re out of our reach
and this is a problem.

284
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:09,725
Stay holed up in that
travel agency

285
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,645
do not move and do not engage
in any offensive activities.

286
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:16,640
We are working to solve your problem.
Over.

287
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:21,798
Copy that.

288
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:31,204
Get the vehicle out and
get yourselves cleaned up.

289
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:35,118
I’ve lost a lot of energy.

290
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:39,558
I have a question.

291
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:44,845
- He said that up in Saint Tropez...
- The question.

292
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,356
Where are we now?

293
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:52,326
Because in two weeks
I’m going on leave.

294
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:58,004
This is a state of emergency.
Your leave is postponed until further notice.

295
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:01,398
Questions?

296
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,323
OK.

297
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,401
The vehicle is fucked.

298
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:11,158
No dial is working.

299
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:20,078
No oil, no power.
No way we’re moving.

300
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:23,798
If the vehicle is gone,
we’re no good either.

301
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:30,482
We have wounded people.
They’ll send a helicopter to save them.

302
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:32,762
We’re going home, Hertzel.

303
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:38,604
No, listen... you’re seeing things...
Only from a certain perspective.

304
00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:42,401
In short you need to look
at the big picture.

305
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:44,722
I don’t understand,
we’re going home.

306
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:46,997
If you no longer have a vehicle,
you have to evacuate, right?

307
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:51,086
Listen, you're also the oldest one here,
but there are some things that you...

308
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:55,245
That I what? Come on, talk.

309
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:57,717
Issues... that you overlook.

310
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:01,442
Assi, He's right. And then you have to
file a report about the vehicle.

311
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:06,436
- Guys, trust me, if I tell you...
- What are you talking about?

312
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:10,600
I have my reasons.

313
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:16,080
So who’s caling? Me or you?

314
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:18,806
- Put it back, Hertzel.
- Your decide, Assi. You call or should I?

315
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:22,038
- Put down the receiver, it's an order.
- Fuck your orders!

316
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:24,038
Hertzel!

317
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:27,921
- Rhinoceros to Cinderella.
- What is it, Rhinoceros ?

318
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:30,646
What is it, Rhinoceros?

319
00:43:30,727 --> 00:43:34,766
- Speak to us, come on. Speak.
- Assi, answer them.

320
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:37,520
Rhinoceros, answer!

321
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:41,082
I'm coming there.

322
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,443
I did not expect this of you.
I did not expect this.

323
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:02,122
- You did not expect what?
- Not this!

324
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,486
What?

325
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:06,286
To disobey an order is one thing,
but to do this to a friend...

326
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,323
No, no, stop! Haven’t you
yelled at the new one

327
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:10,483
that you don’t want to die
because of him?

328
00:44:10,527 --> 00:44:13,087
So what the fuck are you doing now
busting my balls with your friendship crap?

329
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:15,118
This is my life too, okay?
My life!

330
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,283
Jamil is coming.

331
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:21,315
Put pride aside and you'll see
that I'm doing you a favor.

332
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:26,401
Now talk to him. Because if you can’t
do it, I'll do it for you.

333
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:29,847
And we have never been friends.

334
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:45,798
Tell him, Yigal.

335
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:52,083
The vehicle is gone. Just look
at the dials, they're all dead.

336
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:01,321
All dead.

337
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:04,041
- Have you tried?
- The dials speak for themselves.

338
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:06,840
We have wounded men, they’ll send
a helicopter to take them away.

339
00:45:06,927 --> 00:45:09,282
If the vehicle is gone
there's nothing for us to do here.

340
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:11,477
Shut your face!

341
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:14,718
Start it.

342
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:18,157
- It won’t move, the dials...
- A tank doesn’t break just like that!

343
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:20,966
Nor does it jump in the air
or walk. Start it.

344
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,964
Spin it! Do not stop, go!

345
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,963
- Why did you stop? Keep it spinning!
- But if there’s no power...

346
00:45:28,007 --> 00:45:30,316
Start it! Fire it up!

347
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:34,485
Pump it!

348
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:38,079
Pump it.

349
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:42,599
Pump it.

350
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:48,197
Keep pumping, do not stop!
Do not stop!

351
00:45:55,287 --> 00:45:59,360
Keep going! That’s right!
Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump!

352
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:03,241
The pedal! Push the pedal! Push!
Speed up, come on! Speed up!

353
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,246
- Push harder.
- What?

354
00:46:05,287 --> 00:46:07,847
Harder down! Push it all the way!

355
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:11,881
Faster! Go faster!
Go! Go, faster!

356
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:16,483
Ok! More! More!
Go!

357
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:38,205
It’s the second or third time
I’m telling you that:

358
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,645
Wash your faces and
Clean it all up.

359
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:44,360
You can not make war
in this mess.

360
00:47:17,007 --> 00:47:21,239
- I swear that the dials...
- Enough with the dials already!

361
00:47:21,527 --> 00:47:24,599
Truth is I can’t count on anyone.

362
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:36,564
Cornelia to Cinderella.
Two phalangists are coming your way.

363
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:42,079
- They will take care of you in case of evacuation.
- Copy that.

364
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:17,404
My mother must be on
Valium again.

365
00:48:22,727 --> 00:48:27,118
She’ll sit there, sorting photos of
when I was a kid, in her flowery dress...

366
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:31,246
Now would seem like the right moment..

367
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:37,364
She sorts them by year, or separates
color ones from black and whites.

368
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:45,244
I finished my freshman year in high
school when I lost my father.

369
00:48:45,327 --> 00:48:48,797
They called me in class and
told me he was dead.

370
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,284
Heart attack.

371
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:59,244
Then my teacher took me aside,
hugged me, ah...

372
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:06,485
She spoke to me, but I did not understand
a thing, just felt her tits against me.

373
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:10,446
Then she took me home
in her car.

374
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:14,998
I had a boner all the way home.

375
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:20,478
Anyway we finally arrived.
We got into the house,

376
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:23,923
It was full of people.
When they saw me they came to me.

377
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,527
They all wanted to hug me,
but I did not want that;

378
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:29,207
They would have felt my hard-on.

379
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:34,964
My teacher, however, thought that

380
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:39,802
it was psychological, like trauma from
losing someone, things like that, you know?

381
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:44,246
So follow me into my room and
tells me that I should cry;

382
00:49:44,287 --> 00:49:47,996
that if I cried... Then...
I would feel better.

383
00:49:48,087 --> 00:49:51,875
And so I thought if I cried
She’d hug me again.

384
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:56,683
So I focused and started 
telling myself:

385
00:49:56,767 --> 00:50:01,045
"My father is dead. He died,
I am an orphan, I have no father,

386
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:07,560
My father is dead. And so...
I started to cry.

387
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:12,565
What are you gonna do?
And things went just as I predicted.

388
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:17,004
She pulled me to her,
hugged me and told me:

389
00:50:17,087 --> 00:50:21,080
"Yes, cry my darling. Cry it all out."

390
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:23,563
And my thing was pressing
against her belly

391
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,484
And I knew that she felt it.

392
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:31,165
So I kept crying and she
kept holding me tight.

393
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:33,966
And for a minute, or more,
I was crying.

394
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:36,766
pressed against her tits

395
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:41,678
smelling her smell,
the smell of her hair;

396
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:45,203
and my cock rubbing against
her soft belly...

397
00:50:46,367 --> 00:50:50,280
And suddenly I felt her... pull
me stronger towards her,

398
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:53,279
and move
slowly with me.

399
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:56,963
I stopped crying and
bit my lips to hold it in.

400
00:50:57,047 --> 00:51:00,437
And then she whispered:
"Do not be ashamed,

401
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:03,758
do not stop, let yourself go,
cry, you have not finished yet"

402
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:09,399
"Let go, my darling" she says,
"Let yourself go". And so I did.

403
00:51:09,487 --> 00:51:12,479
I felt it rise and then bang!

404
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,325
And here I come,
I’m coming and coming...

405
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:18,086
And she hugged me, shaking me.

406
00:51:20,967 --> 00:51:30,797
And I felt...really free,
just like she said.

407
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:35,799
You just gave me a hard-on,
for fuck's sake!

408
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:52,720
Cinderella, it’s Cornelia.
Two phalangists are coming your way.

409
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:58,245
Wait until darkness, they’ll
guide you to Saint Tropez. Over.

410
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:44,922
Who are the phalangists?

411
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:50,163
Christian Arabs... they’re on
our side, they’re allies.

412
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:55,122
Christians, Muslims, what's the difference,
what matters is getting out of here.

413
00:52:55,287 --> 00:53:00,566
Rhinoceros, let the Mercedes go.
Move to the side. Over.

414
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:13,000
Cornelia, I have a problem
with your phalangist.

415
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:17,525
I wanted to know how to get out
and he gave me conditions,

416
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:20,400
He says that first he wants to talk
to the Syrian prisoner.

417
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,998
He says he made a deal with you.
Can you explain this? What does this mean?

418
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:28,636
Let him talk to the Syrian prisoner.
Over.

419
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:58,363
- Hello, welcome.
- Can I take...

420
00:53:58,407 --> 00:54:03,356
I am the officer here. Assi.

421
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:05,358
- Do you speak Arabic?
- No.

422
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:08,280
No Arabic. You speak Arabic?

423
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:11,566
- You speak Arabic.
- No, no English...

424
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:13,842
Light, you have light?

425
00:54:13,927 --> 00:54:16,487
- Fire.
- Fire, fire, yes.

426
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:20,527
- Good.
- Yes

427
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:34,636
Oh... Hi.

428
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:44,637
Listen, you sonofabitch.
When we come to Saint Tropez

429
00:54:44,927 --> 00:54:52,436
I'll tell what's gonna happen.
I'll take you to a suite...

430
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:53,716
First we’ll strip you.

431
00:54:53,767 --> 00:55:00,843
The boys haven't spent a night with
a cute boy like you for a long time...

432
00:55:03,407 --> 00:55:06,717
Then I’ll pluck one of your
eyes out with a spoon.

433
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:11,838
Just one, so you can see
what I do after that.

434
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:16,365
- You're from the Phalange?
- Yes, yes.

435
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:26,686
I'll cut your dick off. But I don’t want
you to die and ruin the party.

436
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:28,564
Can you give me one?

437
00:55:36,927 --> 00:55:45,835
The morning after I will tie your legs
to two cars. I will pull you apart.

438
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:50,876
Start praying to Allah.

439
00:55:55,247 --> 00:56:04,599
Treat him well.
He is a prisoner of war.

440
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:06,759
Very.

441
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:16,719
What did he say, Yigal?

442
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:20,237
I don’t understand his Arabic,
but I guess he was reassuring him.

443
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:30,639
But what is he saying?

444
00:56:30,807 --> 00:56:33,799
It is not the Arabic I learned in school.
It's different, I don’t understand it.

445
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:41,277
Take a cigarette, take it,
I’ll give you the light.

446
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,719
He thinks we’ll kill him.

447
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:56,396
We do not want to kill you.
Calm down, listen, calm down!

448
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,483
He doesn't speak English.
What are you speaking English to him for!?

449
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:00,597
- Tell him something in Arabic.
- What am I supposed to say?

450
00:57:00,647 --> 00:57:02,956
Assi, do something!
He’ll hurt himself.

451
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:06,884
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

452
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:12,803
What? What? Want water?

453
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:14,646
Give him morphine, Assi!

454
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:19,283
- Here, here, hold it.
- Okay. Envelope! Envelope!

455
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:23,277
Fuck! There! Here it is,
Assi. I found it!

456
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:07,565
So we’ll wait until dark and go
on our own to Saint Tropez.

457
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:09,283
Be careful.

458
00:58:09,327 --> 00:58:11,363
- And the phalangists?
- What about them?

459
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:12,960
They were supposed to guide us

460
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:14,963
Now you’re saying
we're going alone, in short...

461
00:58:15,007 --> 00:58:17,077
We’re going alone!

462
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:25,522
We’ll get out town at this
point, okay?

463
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:28,127
From here we’ll head north...
to sector... 9-11

464
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,283
Cornelia to Cinderella.

465
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:33,401
... Where is our Saint Tropez?

466
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:35,077
Saint Tropez.

467
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:39,319
- Cinderella, answer.
- This is Cinderella, over.

468
00:58:39,447 --> 00:58:43,235
Prepare to move.
The Phalangists will guide us.

469
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:46,603
It’s final. Confirmation received.

470
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:48,883
I’m not going with them.

471
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:52,602
I am the highest-ranking officer
and I’m telling you I’m not going with them!

472
00:58:52,687 --> 00:58:55,155
You see, you can send a helicopter,
or force me to take

473
00:58:55,207 --> 00:58:57,163
what's left of my platoon
and be on our way...

474
00:58:57,207 --> 00:59:00,677
without even knowing how
many fucking Syrians...

475
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:07,758
Use Pluto.

476
00:59:10,807 --> 00:59:12,479
Prepare to move.

477
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:15,639
They’re saying that someone...
made a mistake and now we're surrounded?

478
00:59:15,687 --> 00:59:17,598
- So?
- So what?

479
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:20,605
- Ask the question!
- Is it true or not? What's happening?

480
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:22,046
There are Syrian forces around here.

481
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:24,521
Well here’s a newsflash!
But is it dangerous?

482
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,398
This thing we're doing
is called war.

483
00:59:26,447 --> 00:59:29,007
and war is notoriously dangerous.

484
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:43,605
What the fuck is he saying?
Like I don’t know war is dangerous?

485
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:46,838
Who the fuck am I? Fuck you!

486
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:52,082
Wait, I bet that he...
knows stuff he won’t tell us.

487
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:55,955
No, no, now... we move north,
and we open a road.

488
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:58,316
But which road are you talking about?

489
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,001
Or maybe even he doesn’t know shit?

490
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:07,159
And after all who is he?
A lieutenant, a captain...

491
01:00:07,207 --> 01:00:11,041
...that fucking Cornelia, who
sends people on suicide missions?

492
01:00:17,207 --> 01:00:20,563
- What, what are you looking for?
- Pluto.

493
01:00:20,647 --> 01:00:22,126
No, no, Hertzel. It’s not allowed.

494
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:24,203
- It is an emergency channel.
- Oh, really, Assi? Wake up!

495
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:27,444
Have you done morphine?
You need another shot to wake up?

496
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:30,121
- You’re edgy, Hertzel. You shouldn’t...
- Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!

497
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,761
- You see you're nervous?
- Fuck nervous!

498
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:35,196
I’m trapped in here with you,
you can’t read instruments,

499
01:00:35,247 --> 01:00:37,602
and the other one can’t shoot.
Of course I’m nervous!

500
01:00:37,687 --> 01:00:40,963
Calm down, Hertzel. We'll go north
and we'll open a road. You'll see.

501
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:43,316
Get the tank’s manual, Yigal.
You’ll find Pluto’s frequency.

502
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:45,039
Don’t give it to him, Yigal. Wait.
Don’t give it to him!

503
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:47,555
We’ll end up in solitary for 40 days
Yigal, don’t give them...

504
01:00:47,607 --> 01:00:49,563
Ask Assi. He knows the frequency.
Ask Assi!

505
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:51,837
- Come on, Assi, what frequency ?
- You really don’t want to understand...

506
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:54,082
If I go to jail my father
will never forgive me!

507
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:58,040
What jail, Assi? What jail?!
We’re about to die here!

508
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:00,044
Give me, give it to me!

509
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:04,516
1-5-2-5.

510
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:12,157
I need air evacuation, you hear me?

511
01:01:12,207 --> 01:01:14,880
Send a helicopter and we’re
out of here in a minute.

512
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:18,715
Too dangerous to land there
and then there is the tank.

513
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:21,964
It was hit by a rocket, remember?
It would be great if could even move.

514
01:01:22,007 --> 01:01:23,042
It’s not possible.

515
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:26,682
We can not let the tank
fall into their hands.

516
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,200
Are you even listening to me?

517
01:01:28,247 --> 01:01:32,684
I’m calling for help and you’re wondering
whether to leave the vehicle?

518
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:37,483
I don't have bags of blood,
No first-aid kits, nothing.

519
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:41,196
I'm asking for help! And you’re holding
me here for hours with those two clowns.

520
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:44,842
That you sent to help me,
but don’t you understand? I need help!

521
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:47,879
Do you understand what
I'm saying? I need help!

522
01:01:48,007 --> 01:01:49,565
I’m trapped, trapped, damn it!

523
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:51,677
And that's all the army
can offer me,

524
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:53,638
two assholes in a Mercedes?

525
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:56,121
One of whom is not even capable
of pointing the road on the map 

526
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:59,842
The other one tells me he’s Turkish.
What the fuck is he doing here?

527
01:01:59,927 --> 01:02:02,236
- We know them. They’re reliable. 
- Who, who knows them? 

528
01:02:02,287 --> 01:02:04,403
Maybe you know them?

529
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:13,240
Can I trust them to get
us out of here?

530
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:18,362
- You have no choice. 
- I have no choice. 

531
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:23,798
That's the way things are, Jamil.
Get out of there before it's too late. 

532
01:02:23,847 --> 01:02:28,967
And between you and me...
Feel free to improvise. Be creative. 

533
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:40,525
The driver, ah... I think he’s called
Yigal, can you check? 

534
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:45,482
- Yigal Yomtov. What? 
- Call his mother, tell her he’s fine. 

535
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:48,805
Anything else?

536
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:59,443
Call my mother too. I’m leaving 
Pluto’s channel. Over and out.

537
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,357
Clean the vehicle
and prepare the gun.

538
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:30,803
Then we’ll move north and
we'll open a passage.

539
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:35,883
- You're nuts!
- On the contrary, Hertzel.

540
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:42,881
Now I know. Now I know
that I was wrong and you were right.

541
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:46,442
Right? What are you talking about?

542
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:53,315
- You were not supposed to keep guard.
- What are you saying?

543
01:03:56,687 --> 01:04:02,398
You do physical work, Hertzel. 
You need to save energy. 

544
01:04:04,327 --> 01:04:07,444
If you had slept, you
would not have been so nervous. 

545
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:10,246
You're going crazy!
Hello? Wake up. 

546
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:14,155
You see, Hertzel,
see that you're nervous? 

547
01:04:20,727 --> 01:04:24,322
- What are you doing? 
- I am an officer, Hertzel.

548
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,843
I need a shave.

549
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:35,087
Order and hygiene are paramount. 
Every tank commander knows that. 

550
01:04:39,887 --> 01:04:44,085
We must organize and arrange
the tank’s ammunition. 

551
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,001
Put it in the front.

552
01:04:56,767 --> 01:05:01,887
3 fluorescent rockets,
3 fragmentation missiles

553
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:09,758
2 anti-tank missiles and
a phosphorous bomb. 

554
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:25,602
Actually, I stand corrected,
a smoke bomb. 

555
01:05:29,807 --> 01:05:36,679
Then we head north and we
open up a passage. 

556
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:41,164
But first we must
clean the vehicle. 

557
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,079
You can’t go to war
in this mess.

558
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:25,397
This is Cinderella, prepare to move. 
Over. 

559
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:53,002
Rhinoceros, stay on top of the Mercedes.
We will keep behind. Over. 

560
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:25,639
Why is the radio silent? 
Where is Jamil? 

561
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:29,242
I don’t know. Shmulik,
can you see him? 

562
01:09:30,647 --> 01:09:34,242
No, he’s gone.

563
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:54,922
What's happening, why are we stopping?

564
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:57,157
It’s the Phalangist, he made a sign.

565
01:09:57,247 --> 01:09:59,966
I do not take orders from
fucking Phalangists, is that clear? 

566
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:03,039
What orders?
He just waved!

567
01:10:05,127 --> 01:10:07,118
Rhinoceros to Cinderella.

568
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:17,164
Rhinoceros to Cinderella. 
Rhinoceros to Cinderella, do you copy? 

569
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:28,635
You have to go now!
Go there. Three kilometers. 

570
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:29,842
What?

571
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,323
We do not go anywhere unless
we talk to Jamil. 

572
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:37,076
Jamil's gone! Go!

573
01:10:37,127 --> 01:10:40,324
- Wait, I’ll call. 
- There’s no time. Go now! 

574
01:10:40,367 --> 01:10:42,835
- But.. 
- No time! 

575
01:10:48,007 --> 01:10:49,918
I’m taking the prisoner. 

576
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:54,038
Give me the key! 

577
01:10:55,927 --> 01:10:57,406
The key!

578
01:10:57,447 --> 01:11:00,007
Jamil has it.

579
01:11:08,647 --> 01:11:15,883
Trust me, you have to go now! 
Go there! 

580
01:11:55,447 --> 01:12:01,283
- What did he say? 
- That he has to pee. 

581
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,483
What is this music?

582
01:12:19,647 --> 01:12:23,003
Let’s go..., like
the Phalangist told us.

583
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,844
I’m not leaving without Jamil. 

584
01:12:27,727 --> 01:12:33,643
Rhinoceros to Cinderella. Jamil?

585
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:35,882
What do we do, Assi?

586
01:12:44,687 --> 01:12:46,484
Assi...

587
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:22,238
- Cinderella to Rhinoceros.
- This is Rhinoceros.

588
01:13:22,287 --> 01:13:25,677
- Why did you disappear?
- Problems with the radio.Over.

589
01:13:25,847 --> 01:13:27,758
Listen. We were cut off.

590
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,924
and we made a small detour
to Saint Tropez. 

591
01:13:30,967 --> 01:13:32,116
You have arrived at Saint Tropez?

592
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:34,362
Affirmative. Keep moving. 
Are the Phalangists with you? 

593
01:13:34,487 --> 01:13:35,920
Negative.

594
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:38,475
Start the engine and keep moving.
Stay in touch with me. 

595
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:40,637
I don’t know where to go,
which direction to take. 

596
01:13:40,687 --> 01:13:43,884
Where we are in now, at some point
we heard some music. 

597
01:13:43,927 --> 01:13:46,521
Hertzel, calm down.
Take a deep breath and listen. 

598
01:13:46,607 --> 01:13:50,805
You must not stay there.
Start the engine and go. 

599
01:13:56,287 --> 01:14:00,041
Rhinoceros, Cinderella here, talk
to me. Are you moving? 

600
01:14:01,527 --> 01:14:04,519
Rhinoceros, you have to get away
from there! Rhinoceros!

601
01:14:05,887 --> 01:14:08,162
Shmulik, Hertzel, Yigal, respond!

602
01:14:08,247 --> 01:14:10,886
Hertzel answer me. Where are we going?
where are we headed? 

603
01:14:10,927 --> 01:14:13,441
Go north. Flatten everything you see.

604
01:14:13,487 --> 01:14:15,318
Move! If you stay there,
you’re fucked! 

605
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:17,597
Yigal, go, start the engine! Go!

606
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:24,126
It’s not starting!
It’s not fucking working!

607
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:27,523
Push the accelerator! The gas! 
The gas! Push the accelerator! 

608
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:29,000
Push the fucking accelerator! 

609
01:14:29,087 --> 01:14:30,725
- It doesn’t work! 
- Stop crying! 

610
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,803
Keep pushing. Pump! 
Pump! More gas! Don’t stop! 

611
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:35,964
I don’t want to stay here, okay? 
I want to leave! 

612
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:40,245
That's enough, I want to go 
home, okay? 

613
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:43,006
- I want my mom... 
- Yigal... Yigal... 

614
01:14:43,047 --> 01:14:45,959
Don’t cry. Stop crying.
We're going home, don’t cry. 

615
01:14:46,007 --> 01:14:47,804
- Push on the gas. The accelerator! 
- I want to get out of here.

616
01:14:47,847 --> 01:14:50,042
I want to go home! 

617
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,998
They’re shooting at us!

618
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:58,039
- Who?
- How the fuck should I know? I gotta shoot! 

619
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:02,763
I have no air. I can’t breathe! 
I can’t breathe! 

620
01:15:02,847 --> 01:15:06,806
Yigal! Yigal, I need power.
I can’t shoot without power! 

621
01:15:06,847 --> 01:15:13,082
- I can’t breathe! I’m suffocating! 
- Push on gas, Yigal! Gas! I’ll shoot! 

622
01:15:15,407 --> 01:15:19,161
Go, Yigal! Go, go, go, go! 
Go, Yigal! 

623
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:26,365
Go! Don’t stop! Floor it! Go!

624
01:15:28,407 --> 01:15:32,195
Go! Go! Don’t be scared! 
Go, Yigal! Go!

625
01:15:32,247 --> 01:15:34,920
Full throttle, Yigal!
Full throttle!

626
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,719
Go, Yigal! Go!

627
01:15:47,407 --> 01:15:50,046
Load it, Hertzel!
They’re shooting at us! 

628
01:15:50,967 --> 01:15:54,562
- They’re shooting at us, Hertzel! 
- Hertzel! 

629
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,806
- Loaded! 
- Fire! 

630
01:16:01,727 --> 01:16:04,241
Go, Yigal! Go, go, Yigal!

631
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:06,126
Fire!

632
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:14,316
Keep going, Yigal!
Go! Yigal! Don’t stop! 

633
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:15,959
Let's get out of here!

634
01:16:23,047 --> 01:16:25,959
Did they hit us from the front!
Yigal, are you all right? 

635
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:32,485
Yigal, answer me, Yigal! Yigal!

636
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:34,445
Yigal, are you okay?

637
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:38,077
He’s been hit!

638
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:42,201
Yigal! Yigal, can you hear me?

639
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:45,438
Help me Hertzel.

640
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:54,005
Let’s get him out of here!

641
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:06,880
Yigal?

642
01:18:12,247 --> 01:18:13,965
Yigal!

643
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:21,079
Yigal?

644
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:55,038
Jamil to Rhinoceros.

645
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:04,723
- This is Rhinoceros. 
- Did you get out of town? 

646
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:07,805
Affirmative.

647
01:19:07,887 --> 01:19:10,765
Cornelia, this is Cinderella. 
We're out. 

648
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:19,999
This is Cornelia. Copy that
Tell your driver

649
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,437
that his mother got the message.
Over and out.
