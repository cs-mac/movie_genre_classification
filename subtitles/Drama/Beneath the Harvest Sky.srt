www.titlovi.com

2
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,276
So what, she's like your
girlfriend now or something?

3
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,278
No.

4
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,380
I don't know.

5
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,883
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

6
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,486
That was fuckin' air time there.

7
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,753
Ready to learn, kid?

8
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,788
Yeah.

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,256
Here we go.

10
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,858
I like to go in slow
and deep, you know?

11
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,394
You know what I'm
talking about there?

12
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,629
Does that embarrass you there?

13
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,697
Oh, yeah.

14
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,265
Ha, ha, ha, he is.

15
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,701
Look at you, you're
fuckin' embarrassed.

16
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,669
Are you blushing?

17
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,570
It's the way you say it.

18
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,271
You're blushing.

19
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,505
Holy shit.

20
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,306
Oh, yeah.

21
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,507
Next one.

22
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,475
One hand.

23
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,243
One hand?

24
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:26,712
If you got to use two,
I'd fuckin' shoot you.

25
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,447
What's the... the next one?

26
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,215
250, 250.

27
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,464
That's fuckin' you right there.

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,299
Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,766
All fuckin' day.

30
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh, yeah.

31
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,401
Oh...

32
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,172
Casper.

33
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,906
What?

34
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,807
Did you get my text?

35
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,809
I've texted you like twice.

36
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,479
Uh, no.

37
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:04,583
Must have been them Canadian
signals there, you know.

38
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,617
OK, let me see your phone.

39
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,319
What?

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,619
Relax.

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,555
Fuck, man.

42
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,556
When...

43
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,523
I need to talk to you, OK?

44
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,424
Let's go outside.

45
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,426
Come on.

46
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,830
So why did the cow
cross the road?

47
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,265
I'm not in the mood, Casper,

48
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,433
He wanted to go
to the moo-vies.

49
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,272
My little sister
likes that one, so.

50
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,545
Where were you this morning?

51
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,980
What?

52
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,648
Why are you so...

53
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,283
I needed you.

54
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:38,885
OK?

55
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,487
And you... look.

56
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,460
Uh, I don't know how
to tell you this.

57
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,565
What?

58
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,435
Did someone die or something?

59
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,437
I'm pregnant.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,607
I'm fucking pregnant.

61
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,923
God.

62
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,925
I need you, OK?

63
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,937
Can we make it work?

64
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,272
Will you make it work?

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,013
Uh.

66
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:45,884
Do you love me?

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,059
Casper?

68
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,861
What?

69
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,296
Can we just then...

70
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,304
Sorry.

71
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:09,508
I'm not... I... we... just
don't apologize, you know?

72
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,744
Just my... just don't...
just don't worry about it.

73
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,379
Just give me some time.

74
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,348
I'll figure it out.

75
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,582
But don't worry about it, OK?

76
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,619
I'll figure it out.

77
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,722
I'll... I'm Casper fucking Cote.

78
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,993
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

79
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,564
I'm going to go figure it, OK?

80
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,605
Yeah, I'll call you.

81
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,874
I'll-I'll... I'll
catch you later.

82
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,996
OK, so has anyone here
ever heard of the Jim twins?

83
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,398
The Jim twins.

84
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,033
No one?

85
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:07,867
All of you?

86
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:12,938
Jim Lewis and Jim Springer
were identical twins,

87
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,374
separated at birth,
given up for adoption

88
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,976
and raised by different
families in different parts

89
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:22,547
of the country, unaware
that the other even existed.

90
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,884
And then one day when they
were 39 years old, they met.

91
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,620
And they got to
talking, and guess what?

92
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,422
They found out that
they both married

93
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,824
women named Betty,
had gotten divorced,

94
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,594
and remarried to
women named Linda.

95
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,398
They both had sons
named James Alan.

96
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,633
They both bit their
nails and had migraines.

97
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,836
They both went to the
exact same beach in Florida

98
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,506
for vacation, both of them.

99
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,409
They both love NASCAR,
hated baseball.

100
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,944
They both voted the same,
drank the same beer,

101
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,147
smoked the same cigarettes.

102
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:59,651
When it was all said and
done, they both died apart

103
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,554
on the same day from
the same illness.

104
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,989
That's fucked up.

105
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:08,427
Well... yeah, that's fucked up.

106
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,961
We don't say that,
but yeah, it is.

107
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,465
So just think about how
maybe some of those choices,

108
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,968
maybe they're... maybe they
aren't choices at all.

109
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,105
Maybe some things are
beyond your control.

110
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,442
And so now, going back to
the story, well, where do you

111
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:27,179
guys think that Pony Boy
falls in... in all this?

112
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,648
Because certainly he's dealing
with a lot of peer pressure,

113
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,616
right?

114
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,151
He's hanging out with his
older brother, with Soda Pop,

115
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,687
So where do you think
he falls in all this?

116
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,922
Anyone got an id... Casper?

117
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,924
Can I go to the
bathroom, please?

118
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,826
We're about five minutes away.

119
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,227
You can hold it.

120
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,795
You want to take your
boots off the table there?

121
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,968
Right.

122
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,769
Genius.

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,203
Great.

124
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,205
Take your socks off, or
you're going to the office.

125
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,006
Take your socks off.

126
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,073
That's good.

127
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,675
That's great.

128
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:00,846
Now you can take your
feet off the desk.

129
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,913
Smart guy.

130
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,916
Now I got to put the socks
and shoes back on, man.

131
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,651
You could have just
said that there.

132
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,253
Well, I could have.

133
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,056
Would have been... jeez, your
room's a mess here, teach.

134
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,224
My room's a mess?

135
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,692
Yeah.

136
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,729
Well, I got to go to
the bathroom anyways.

137
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,930
Hey, you want detention?

138
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,799
Yeah, sure, teach,
give me detention.

139
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,601
Yeah, it's a big joke,

140
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:25,003
Everyone's aware you're
such a tough guy.

141
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,507
You want me to show you
fuckin' tough guy, teach?

142
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,774
I'm not, because you're
starting to fuckin'

143
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,743
piss me off right now.

144
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,043
All right.

145
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,113
Yeah, you
said that five fuckin' words...

146
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,282
Yeah, fuck me.

147
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,751
Here.

148
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,755
OK, easy.

149
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,823
Hey, old Pony Boy.

150
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,892
Good people make bad choices.

151
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,727
It's fuckin' easy.

152
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,062
I'm smarter than you.

153
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,734
So you and Casper

154
00:08:55,736 --> 00:09:00,138
would move to Boston together?

155
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,544
Yeah.

156
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,312
Yeah?

157
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,314
OK.

158
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,951
But not...

159
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,590
So you've
been coming to this school

160
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,659
since you were six
years old, right?

161
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,793
Right?

162
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:22,628
Yeah.

163
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,195
And now you're 17.

164
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:28,166
That's 2/3 of your
life you spent here.

165
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,101
Guess I know you pretty well.

166
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,103
I... I know your family.

167
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,240
I know your circumstances.

168
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:42,242
And it really angers me that
you might throw it all away.

169
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:48,587
I would imagine that
you've got a plan.

170
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,956
You've got a plan
beyond high school.

171
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,724
Have you even thought
about which colleges

172
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,025
you might like to try?

173
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,660
You act like you
want to be punished.

174
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,696
You act like you want to
be thrown out of school.

175
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,931
You act like you
want to be a failure.

176
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,367
Here's what I want you to do.

177
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:06,838
And if you want to come back to
this school, please come back.

178
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,006
But apply yourself.

179
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,040
Follow the rules.

180
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:09,675
Work hard.

181
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,009
Behave!

182
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,345
Or don't bother coming back.

183
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,347
You're done.

184
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,650
He's kind of a dick.

185
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,951
Well, fuck him.

186
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,822
Fuck him.

187
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,063
Oh, he says you've got
a bright future, though.

188
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,298
He said I've got
a bright future?

189
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,335
Yeah.

190
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:41,706
He started jerking off,
just thinking about you.

191
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,008
It's the truth too.

192
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,676
Yeah, he does that.

193
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,236
Get off.

194
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,399
Badger's down at Tulsa.

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,235
Go there.

196
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:54,372
I said, Badger is down at Tulsa.

197
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,207
Go there.

198
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,208
OK, OK, OK.

199
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,310
Jesse, go there.

200
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:04,516
Jesse, get out of
my... get off my por...

201
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,550
close the fucking door.

202
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,414
That's it.

203
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,415
It's in there.

204
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,526
What's wrong with Clayton?

205
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,594
What do you mean?

206
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,196
Wouldn't even open the door.

207
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,831
You don't know better than that?

208
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,933
He don't like doing
business at home.

209
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,969
Besides, he don't trust
no one but family.

210
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,839
Or fuckin' second cousins.

211
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,440
Second cousins?

212
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,174
Mm-hmm.

213
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,876
That's all family.

214
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,845
Everybody's a second
cousin to everybody.

215
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,313
Mm-hmm.

216
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,581
You don't
trust no one but me, OK?

217
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,516
Mm-hmm.

218
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,851
Look at me.

219
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,285
You don't trust no one but me.

220
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,987
Yeah, I don't trust
no one but you,

221
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,189
but... ahem... your
brother's a weird dude.

222
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,424
You're a fuckin' weird dude.

223
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,960
Get the fuck out.

224
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,361
Get out.

225
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,564
Take your powdered donuts
and get the fuck out.

226
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,566
Fuck you.

227
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,269
Fuck me?

228
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,276
Well, fuck you, all right, Sal?

229
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,278
Hmm?

230
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,545
Sorry about that.

231
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,347
That guy was bad.

232
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,615
I don't like that guy.

233
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,116
That guy was a bad guy.

234
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,274
Hey, how'd it go?

235
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:12,477
Um, got a bottle of
big dogs there, yeah.

236
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,312
Big dogs?

237
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,313
Yeah.

238
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,247
That's a good score there.

239
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,316
And, uh, something that I
think are hydros, maybe.

240
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,350
Well yeah, I'll take a look.

241
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,352
OK.

242
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,292
Yes, sir.

243
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,294
Hydros.

244
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,595
That's real good.

245
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,363
I can do that whenever
you need, you know.

246
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,232
Uh-huh.

247
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,600
Book it.

248
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,568
Looks like a rock there.

249
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,570
Fantastique.

250
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,544
And how is your, uh...
how's your cunt mother?

251
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,347
She's always in a bad
mood, that one there, yeah.

252
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,049
I know.

253
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,150
Yeah.

254
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,119
Has she shit out any
more kids since I've last

255
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,321
seen her dumb ass?

256
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,324
Um... I don't think so, no.

257
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:06,264
Well, um, tell her fuck you
from your old man, will you?

258
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,366
Sure, yeah.

259
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,500
Yeah, well, I'll call you.

260
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,369
Or just come by anytime.

261
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,204
Yeah?

262
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,972
Yeah, sure.

263
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,373
All right.

264
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,975
I'll... I'll be by, or you
call me then, you know?

265
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,511
I know, but I...
I will call you.

266
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,513
Good.

267
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,354
Why are you crying?

268
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:34,292
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause you
want a gold, gold, fish?

269
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,195
I got to go get... Michael!

270
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,097
Where's Mom?

271
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,197
Hey, where's Mom?

272
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
She went for a nap.

273
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,735
A nap!

274
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,570
That's where she is, huh?

275
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,704
You eat lunch yet?

276
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,373
Hey, go upstairs, you guys.

277
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,341
Yeah, you.

278
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,475
Upstairs.

279
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,343
Gerard, take them
upstairs there.

280
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,246
I don't
want to go to take a nap!

281
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:55,681
I know.

282
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,015
It's OK.

283
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,684
I want Mama!

284
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,330
You ever been shot with
a potato cannon, Dayton?

285
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,032
No.

286
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:13,699
No?

287
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,533
I bet it would hurt?

288
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,534
Don't you?

289
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,270
Probably would, yeah.

290
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:19,805
Yeah.

291
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:20,806
You want to see?

292
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,444
OK.

293
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,146
How about this?

294
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,313
I sit here for 30 seconds.

295
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,715
If you can get
that thing loaded,

296
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,817
I'll let you shoot me with it.

297
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,453
What are you doing here, you?

298
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,121
I live here, Kim.

299
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,190
I told you not to bring
that thing in the house.

300
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,658
Oh, I could say the
same thing to you.

301
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
OK, mister big shot.

302
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,229
You want to start paying rent,
you can start having a say.

303
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,698
Uh, I'm... I'm still...
I'm still 17, Kim.

304
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't you get enough
money from me being here?

305
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,839
I'm sorry, baby.

306
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,307
It's all right.

307
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,620
I put on the moose video.

308
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,089
Penelope started crying.

309
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,758
Oh, did she?

310
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,660
Oh, yeah.

311
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,827
Dad says, fuck you!

312
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,295
Yeah, well, fuck him too.

313
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,866
I'm going to be late.

314
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,503
Well, it's going to take
me that long if I'm lucky.

315
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,305
The car's making that
weird noise again.

316
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,807
Are you going to
be here for supper?

317
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,409
No, I'm going to the
Tasty Food with Casper, so.

318
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,411
Oh.

319
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,449
What?

320
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,650
Well, it'll have to do.

321
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,421
Come on!

322
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,422
Car.

323
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,403
Well, I don't hear it.

324
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,405
OK.

325
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,406
Come on.

326
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:11,028
Are we spraying them for
bugs to protect the flowers?

327
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,931
It's called Sugar Mover.

328
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,000
It's like a fertilizer.

329
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,802
But it doesn't
protect the flowers.

330
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:21,339
It kills the flowers.

331
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,807
But why?

332
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,642
We need to protect the potato.

333
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,812
We don't want the flower to
suck up all the nutrients.

334
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,447
We need it to go to the tuber.

335
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:34,352
That way it has a stronger,
better, healthier life.

336
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,054
If we don't, the
potatoes won't survive.

337
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,962
It's not easy.

338
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,865
Farmer to make a
living, it's not easy.

339
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,600
You'll get sick and tired
of looking at these,

340
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,835
I guarantee it.

341
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,938
But you harvest them
right and put them

342
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,774
in the proper
environment, and they'll

343
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,442
last you a good long time.

344
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,511
All right, let's go, uh,
pull them out of the ground.

345
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,893
You know how I feel
about you, Dom.

346
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,594
You've always got a place here.

347
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,897
You're a hell of a hard
worker, and you're a smart kid.

348
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,871
Dom?

349
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:01,873
Yeah, what?

350
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,874
Help.

351
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,542
Hold on.

352
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,544
I'll get it.

353
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,086
Fine, I'm going
to walk over here.

354
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,059
Jeez, fucking rocks are heavy.

355
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,137
You know, it's weird.

356
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,772
I... I see you at
school all the time,

357
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,208
but we never really get to talk.

358
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,744
Yeah, it's like, uh,
harvest friends, right?

359
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:44,815
We always talk during the
harvest, but go back to school,

360
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,717
it's...

361
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,218
Harvest friends.

362
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,487
So we're just
harvest friends then?

363
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,089
Ah, not yet.

364
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,624
Ow!

365
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,258
Oh, god.

366
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,560
Oh, it hurts to even punch
you, the backs of my arms

367
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:57,728
are so sore.

368
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,164
You had muscles
back there, did you?

369
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,765
No.

370
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,534
I've never worked
so hard in my life.

371
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:06,170
Well, it doesn't
really get any easier.

372
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:06,838
Oh, yeah?

373
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,872
Uh-huh.

374
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,541
That's great, thanks.

375
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,243
So why are you doing it?

376
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:13,711
Ah.

377
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:15,546
I'm saving up for next year.

378
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,114
Mm-hmm?

379
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,681
For college.

380
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,816
You?

381
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:21,151
Car.

382
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:24,288
You've been working like
this all year for a car?

383
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,123
Two years.

384
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,527
Oh my gosh, I definitely
couldn't do that.

385
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,761
Ah, you haven't seen the car.

386
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,284
I should have enough
with the harvest here.

387
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:56,020
I ain't going nowhere.

388
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,688
You'll let me know
if you get an offer?

389
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,690
I said I would.

390
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,274
You're getting real close.

391
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,310
Maybe a couple more
checks, you know?

392
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,312
Yeah.

393
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,869
That's fuckin' kicked.

394
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,914
Look at that!

395
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,850
Eh?

396
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,818
Let's go.

397
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,820
I want to break some shit.

398
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,255
Yeah.

399
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,157
All right.

400
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,725
That's what's up with that.

401
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:42,960
Keep going, keep going.

402
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,430
All right, come on!

403
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,432
It's there.

404
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,233
Just fuck it!

405
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,434
Whoa!

406
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,306
Holy shit!

407
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,375
Let's go shoot it with
some fuckin' potatoes, yeah?

408
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,377
Yeah.

409
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:49,927
All right.

410
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,173
See if it's strong enough.

411
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,051
Argh!

412
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,226
It's all bullshit.

413
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:25,896
You know, by third grade
they've fuckin' decided,

414
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,532
bang, who's staying,
who's going.

415
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,434
They're either going
to care about you,

416
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,402
or they're not going to
give a fuck about you.

417
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,907
They're always calling me
into the fuckin' guidance

418
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:40,344
counselor's office.

419
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,946
And it is bullshit.

420
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,915
They're wrong.

421
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,350
But then again,
none of it's going

422
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,018
to matter anyway, so
fuck 'em, you know?

423
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,039
I knew you were going
to fuckin' do that.

424
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:43,166
This works out, we can make a
fuck-ton of money, me and you.

425
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,336
What about this thing
with the Keegans?

426
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,572
You know, where you've got
45 Hell's Angels just up

427
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,041
the road there at Bear Lake?

428
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,076
Hell's Angels want to do
battle with the Keegans, who

429
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,946
are running meth
and coke south up.

430
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:59,950
Meth's between the Angels
and Phil and Bobby Keegan.

431
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,985
Keegans being
green-lit got shit-all

432
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,387
to do with us, as
far as I'm concerned.

433
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:07,991
Is that... you mean "us,"
me and you, or "us,"

434
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,993
like you and your guys?

435
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,228
Both.

436
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,163
Both is fair game.

437
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,333
It stands right now, that
includes the gatekeepers.

438
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,069
As long as we stick to
running pot and pills,

439
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,039
Hell's Angels got no business
knowing our business.

440
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:27,210
This works out with
the Florida guy,

441
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:32,182
we're slamming pills all
down the I-95 corridor.

442
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:36,253
It starts right now,
right here, with us.

443
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,460
Don't fuck this up, all right?

444
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Let's load them up.

445
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,156
Hello, sir.

446
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,091
How are you today?

447
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:13,758
I'm good, thank you.

448
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,992
How are you?

449
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,326
Not too bad.

450
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,427
What is your citizenship?

451
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,296
I'm an American.

452
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,397
Hold on just a minute, please.

453
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,457
What was the purpose of
your trip to Canada today?

454
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,626
Uh, got a pizza at the
Little House of Pizza.

455
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,395
You purchase anything
else besides the pizza?

456
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,596
No, sir.

457
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:53,764
Is there anything
else in the truck

458
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,198
that doesn't belong to you?

459
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,266
No, sir, it's all mine.

460
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,401
All right, thank you very much.

461
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,269
Have a good day.

462
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,336
Thank you.

463
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,671
Did this guy do something wrong?

464
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,540
Oh, I don't know, but
we're about to find out.

465
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,757
What about, uh...
uh, Jesse's brother?

466
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:21,459
What's his name?

467
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Ethan.

468
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,662
Yeah.

469
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,304
You know.

470
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,438
Ahem.

471
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,273
He said he would,
uh, pay... pay me

472
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,209
when he got his welfare check.

473
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:43,647
He'd get the rest to me,
uh, the first of the month.

474
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:44,649
OK.

475
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:50,320
Your job is to keep them
between the ditches.

476
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,422
They go off the road, they
start to fall behind...

477
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,690
All right, I'll talk to him.

478
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,092
I mean, you know
what I'm saying.

479
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,227
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:34:57,229 --> 00:35:03,300
OK, well... my brother.

481
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,235
Yah!

482
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:07,137
Where's my fucking money?

483
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,572
Give me my fucking money!

484
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,507
Where's my fucking money?

485
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,509
All right, seriously.

486
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,311
I'm serious.

487
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,445
He's my little brother!

488
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,746
Whoa!

489
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,382
Wait, too... that went
on way too fucking long.

490
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:20,484
I'm only kidding you, man.

491
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,285
Oh, are you?

492
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,286
Jesus Christ!

493
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,593
Yeah, I've been working on
some slight modifications.

494
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,528
Oh yeah?

495
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,197
Added this big-ass
fuel tank back here.

496
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,899
I think you're
going to dig this.

497
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:39,504
Get closer.

498
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,505
Take a good whiff.

499
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:46,810
Yeah, gas.

500
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,513
Diesel.

501
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:55,552
But over here
we'll add 3/4-inch.

502
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,254
You see that pump?

503
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,156
Uh-huh.

504
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,256
Give me the hose.

505
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:00,258
OK.

506
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,539
I'll plug it in.

507
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,554
Kill it!

508
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,229
Oh, shit!

509
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,574
Yeah, three of them.

510
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:51,608
Tighter than a midget's pussy.

511
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,554
No more "frozen river in the
middle of the night" bullshit.

512
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,457
Now we drive it across
in broad daylight.

513
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:13,496
The pipeline to Canada's
south runs through us.

514
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,499
And with what we got
coming up from Florida,

515
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,002
we'll be working I-95
in both directions.

516
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:56,307
Wait.

517
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:56,907
Wait!

518
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,442
What?

519
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,411
Wait.

520
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,847
I want to tell you something.

521
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,715
Did I do something?

522
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,385
No.

523
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:09,387
What?

524
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,624
Stop.

525
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,063
I want you to know...

526
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,002
What?

527
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,913
That I can take care of you.

528
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,450
I can take care of you and
that fuckin' baby inside you.

529
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,919
My baby inside you.

530
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,788
And I promise I will.

531
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,956
I promise.

532
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,458
I promise I'm not
going to fuck this up.

533
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,562
I swear to god I'm not
going to fuck this up.

534
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:56,333
I'm going to take care
of... of both of you.

535
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,335
OK?

536
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,681
Want to fuck me?

537
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,929
Well, you fuck up this
time of year, you're dead.

538
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,131
And half their pitching
staff is injured.

539
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,767
And the other half just sucks.

540
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,635
I mean, even if they make
the playoffs, who cares?

541
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,604
Hey, guys?

542
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:34,637
Yeah?

543
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,872
I could use some help over here.

544
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,909
Yeah.

545
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:40,911
Let me try to lift
the roller up there.

546
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,550
So.

547
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,653
So, uh, do you like the Sox?

548
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:54,824
I mean, I like some
players, like Pedroia.

549
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,026
Not rooting against them there,
but not building my plans

550
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,728
and dreams around them either.

551
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,730
Whoa, man.

552
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,030
She's shitting on your dreams.

553
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,887
Are you OK?

554
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,121
Yeah, Emma, I'm fine.

555
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:29,893
You know, you said you were
moving to Boston with Casper

556
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,895
to go to Red Sox
games, so I was just

557
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,596
trying to be funny about it.

558
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,765
You know, I... I get it.

559
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,436
I get that you don't get
it, and that's... that's OK.

560
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,771
Look, I didn't mean to be
mean about your friend there.

561
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,072
I just... I don't know.

562
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,741
I just always hear
about all the trouble

563
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:45,942
he gets in all the time.

564
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,877
Like he got Tasha
Nadeau pregnant,

565
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:48,978
and she's like 15 years old.

566
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,680
You sound like everyone else.

567
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:51,948
They don't get it.

568
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,716
It's like when... say
you're out drowning

569
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,718
on Long Lake and someone
throws you a life vest.

570
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,954
That's... that's Casper.

571
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,556
He's there to throw
you a life vest?

572
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:00,558
No.

573
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,659
No, Casper is the life vest.

574
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:03,793
OK?

575
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,628
You know, he's
always been there.

576
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,564
I know exactly what
I'm getting with him.

577
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,834
And then when I'm around him,
I don't feel like I'm drowning.

578
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,669
When I hang out
with Casper, I know

579
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,137
something crazy is
going to happen.

580
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,738
But you know, at least
something happened.

581
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:27,050
You know, I don't know
very much about the Red Sox.

582
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:31,221
But I do know that I'm
supposed to hate the Yankees.

583
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:32,223
Yeah.

584
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,157
I got to teach you how to sweep.

585
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,761
My god, this is terrible.

586
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,131
You think that's going to work?

587
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,269
Move.

588
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:20,970
Fuckin' hammer.

589
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:22,105
Here, this is how you do it.

590
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,090
OK, it's on.

591
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:42,292
It should pop up
as a new network.

592
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,027
Yeah.

593
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:43,727
Fuck.

594
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:44,894
Yeah?

595
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,596
We got fucking
Wi-Fi in this shit.

596
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:46,597
Awesome!

597
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,636
Relationship... you guys are
in a relationship now, huh?

598
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,238
I guess she's like your
baby mama though, right?

599
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,272
Fuck you.

600
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:57,640
You know.

601
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,008
Fuck it.

602
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,344
Why don't you just
click on her there?

603
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,613
Oh, Emma Daigle there.

604
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:04,881
Why would
she be friends with Tasha?

605
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:06,115
Oh, girls don't

606
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,051
have to like each other
to be friends on here.

607
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,253
Girls don't have to like each
other to be fuckin' friends.

608
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,155
And that's the
fuckin' truth there.

609
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:16,593
Her favorite quote...
sometimes good things

610
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:20,630
have to fall apart so that...
so that better things can

611
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:21,731
fall together.

612
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:22,765
Oh, yeah.

613
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,005
You guys are all
fuckin' geniuses.

614
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,139
At least, that's what you think.

615
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,377
You all think you're
the first ones who

616
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,079
ever thought of something.

617
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:38,247
Like you're the
ones who invented

618
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:39,882
bringing shit across a border.

619
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,688
Let me tell you something.

620
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,357
We got you.

621
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,293
You're done.

622
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:54,263
Charged, but cooperating.

623
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:58,201
You do understand, uh,
cooperating defendant part?

624
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,203
That's on you.

625
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,943
For a felony, you're looking
at starting at four years.

626
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,147
So what?

627
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,247
I do four years in jail.

628
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,183
Oh yeah, OK.

629
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,953
Jail.

630
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:19,756
Jail is not federal prison.

631
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,999
You're not a smart
guy, are you, Lee?

632
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,770
All right.

633
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:37,974
Or do you know deep down
inside that you are not smart?

634
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:38,976
I hate Jesse.

635
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,147
Don't blame your fuckin' cousin.

636
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:45,782
No one's fuckin' solid no more.

637
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:46,849
No, no, no, no.

638
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,384
You're right about that.

639
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:49,419
Drugs will do that to you.

640
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,359
But Jesse, he's a bright guy.

641
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:59,395
He wanted to keep his passport
so he could cross over

642
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,932
Said something about
hockey and strip clubs

643
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,967
being important to him.

644
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:10,073
So when we asked
him to wear a wire,

645
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:13,309
that bright son of a bitch
took all of about one

646
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,345
and a half, maybe two
seconds to think it over.

647
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,014
Oh, he's a bright guy.

648
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:20,717
He's in Canada right now
with a big old set of titties

649
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,453
flapping in his
face, knowing him.

650
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:32,495
Yeah.

651
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:35,131
Then again, you've
got nothing to lose.

652
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,133
Right?

653
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,971
Phew.

654
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,372
You want us to
tell the prosecutor

655
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,374
you've been cooperative.

656
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,011
You do realize
that you are going

657
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,913
to actually need to
cooperate, right?

658
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,186
Right?

659
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,539
Fuck!

660
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:39,428
I have
children, 4 boys and 4 girls,

661
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,898
and 12 grandchildren and
2 great-grandchildren.

662
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,436
Hey, did you remember
my cookie dough?

663
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,071
I helped him move on

664
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:51,874
after he served a tour
in the Korean War.

665
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:54,877
That was hard enough 'til I...

666
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:55,879
Baby?

667
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,483
Baby, what's wrong?

668
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:56,372
Shit, that's so good.

669
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,874
That is so good.

670
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:01,644
Mmm, so awesome.

671
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,315
Thank you.

672
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

673
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:20,229
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

674
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,532
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

675
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,307
I'm private, OK?

676
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,910
I don't need your stupid
fuckin' friends, none of that.

677
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,579
Do you even love me?

678
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:39,181
Tasha, why do we... you
always make it like this.

679
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:42,018
Do I love you?

680
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,220
OK, my friends... my
friends are not stupid, OK?

681
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:46,522
That one's fuckin' stupid.

682
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,391
What the fuck is wrong with you?

683
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,562
What the fuck is... come here.

684
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,064
Look at me.

685
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:57,266
Are you fuckin' drunk?

686
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,668
Are you... you're fuckin' drunk.

687
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,436
No.

688
00:48:59,437 --> 00:48:59,937
Look at you.

689
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:00,437
No!

690
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,204
Fuck me.

691
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:02,638
No.

692
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,441
Keep your fuckin' voice down.

693
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,243
I'm not drunk.

694
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:07,276
Yes, you... stop it.

695
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,278
Smell anything?

696
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,983
I'm not drunk, OK?

697
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:15,384
I'm not drunk.

698
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:17,553
And you're... you're an asshole.

699
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:18,522
No.

700
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,056
And you don't love me.

701
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:22,258
And you don't love
your baby, OK?

702
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,260
Just keep
your fuckin' voice down.

703
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,529
Just keep your
fuckin' voice down.

704
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,197
Don't fuckin'...

705
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,166
I'm having Casper Cote's baby!

706
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,104
Asshole!

707
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,392
Hey, asshole, how'd
it go with Tasha?

708
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,594
All right.

709
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,096
Phew.

710
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,331
You know what they say there.

711
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,266
Sometimes good
things have to fall

712
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:08,471
apart so that better things
can fall together, you know?

713
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:09,572
That's very funny there.

714
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,207
It is pretty funny.

715
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:12,708
Now I know why you have
to date 15-year-olds.

716
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,544
Oh.

717
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,080
Oh, fuck me!

718
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:18,715
Hey!

719
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:20,282
Moose safari.

720
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,184
You guys want to go?

721
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,419
What's a moose safari?

722
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:30,421
"What's a moose safari?"

723
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:45,502
Oh my god!

724
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:10,666
Little pink flower,
what's your little name?

725
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,119
That was so fucking fun!

726
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,554
Don't tell me that
wasn't fucking fun.

727
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,422
I told you it was fucking fun.

728
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,424
Woo-hoo!

729
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,627
We don't always get one.

730
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,529
That was wicked cool.

731
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:43,232
Sometimes they get killed if
we, like, hit it, you know...

732
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:45,134
Hey, man, you bumped into me.

733
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,136
I... I don't want
to start anything.

734
00:51:47,138 --> 00:51:48,604
I don't want to start anything.

735
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,573
I'm just...

736
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:50,373
Who do you think you are?

737
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:51,640
Don't touch me!

738
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:54,276
Casper?

739
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,711
Hold this.

740
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,146
Get out of my face.

741
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,548
Casper.

742
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,650
Casper!

743
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:02,751
Casper, you win, buddy.

744
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:03,653
Come on.

745
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:04,588
Come on, buddy, it's OK.

746
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,721
Get the fuck off me.

747
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:06,356
Hey, hey, hey!

748
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,357
Hey!

749
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,358
Come on.

750
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,500
You fuckin' put
your hands on him,

751
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,734
you put your
fuckin' hands on me.

752
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:21,470
You understand that there?

753
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,506
You don't ever
fuckin' walk in here

754
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:26,175
and put your fuckin'
hands on him!

755
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:29,512
You go back to fuckin' Madawaska
where you fucking came.

756
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:32,515
Crack, take your fucking
crack crew with you.

757
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:35,651
What the fuck are
you looking at?

758
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,521
I said, get fuckin' walking!

759
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:39,655
What are you looking at?

760
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,190
Get the fuck out of here!

761
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:42,192
Yeah, you!

762
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,199
Your buddies are
going there, kiddo.

763
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,501
Casper, come on, man.

764
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,503
Casper.

765
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,277
You come around here, you
ask about Casper fuckin' Cote.

766
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,183
I run the fuckin' county, kid.

767
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:10,953
Well...

768
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,941
I am not feeling sorry for you.

769
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,443
You're going to be
late for harvest.

770
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:10,446
Well, I don't even
start until later.

771
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,582
You feel good right now?

772
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,252
It's the same story every
time you hang out with him.

773
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:18,287
God, it's not...
it's not Casper.

774
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:19,289
No?

775
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,489
Oh, so is it you?

776
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,857
Yeah, I don't think so.

777
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:23,692
Trouble does not fall
far from the tree.

778
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,461
You're so much better than him.

779
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:26,629
I'm... I'm not.

780
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:27,963
OK, we're... we're no different.

781
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,598
All you want to
talk about is just

782
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,700
me going and working for
George the rest of my life.

783
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:32,801
Yeah, because it's
a good opportunity,

784
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:34,570
and it's there if you want it.

785
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:36,005
It's fuckin' here if I want it.

786
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:41,777
No, I can't.

787
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,446
I'm telling you, no, I can't.

788
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,449
Uh, I'm... I'm fuckin'... I'm...
I'm shittin' my... my guts out

789
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:51,453
my ass here, OK?

790
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,290
Uh, yeah, I've got food
poisoned or something.

791
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,925
I don't know, but I'm... it's
coming out of both ends,

792
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,427
and... and I can't...
I can't make it.

793
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,296
Five... five minutes.

794
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:07,298
I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll,
uh... no, I... I'm telling you,

795
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,972
I can't fucking
do it, all right?

796
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,540
You're going to have
to get somebody else.

797
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,811
I'm sorry.

798
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:18,947
OK.

799
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,011
Hey.

800
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,479
Wake up.

801
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:53,382
Get up.

802
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:54,384
I need you.

803
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,583
Hey there, you!

804
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:29,017
Hey!

805
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,386
How you been?

806
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,054
How you doing?

807
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,056
Casper the Ghost, eh?

808
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,690
That's my friend Dom here.

809
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:35,458
Hi.

810
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,692
What's his name?

811
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,460
Dominic.

812
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:38,128
Oh, Dominic.

813
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:39,028
Yeah.

814
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:40,397
Hi.

815
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:41,563
You got a French name.

816
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,965
Yeah.

817
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:45,734
Yeah, my
uncle couldn't come this week.

818
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,002
Yeah.

819
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:47,637
Yeah, so you can
pick them up for him.

820
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:48,638
Yeah.

821
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,578
Yeah, there.

822
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,514
You like them?

823
00:56:57,515 --> 00:56:58,181
Yeah.

824
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:01,183
They're more Frenchy than yours.

825
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,051
Yeah?

826
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:05,154
Here, you wear mine.

827
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:06,422
I like yours too, though.

828
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:07,723
Yeah.

829
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,825
You're ready for an ATV, you.

830
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:10,859
Vroom, vroom!

831
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:14,830
Uh, I mean, is there anything
else we can do for you, or?

832
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:16,165
Yeah.

833
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,167
When you have time, you
can do the bird feeder

834
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:20,436
because it's too
far out of my reach.

835
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,037
Yeah.

836
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:25,841
And then when you have more
time, you can do some wood.

837
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:27,443
"Anything else we
can do for you?"

838
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,477
Really?

839
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:29,711
You know, I felt sorry for her.

840
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:34,817
She makes $3,600 a month on
pills she pays $4 a bottle for,

841
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:35,851
all right?

842
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:38,220
She should feel sorry for us.

843
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:39,222
Pour it in.

844
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:45,694
We're good?

845
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:47,696
Yeah.

846
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,064
Look at these fat birds.

847
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:52,701
You see those holes there?

848
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:54,703
She shoots the
raccoons from inside.

849
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,004
She'll just sit there, bang!

850
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,176
Here you go.

851
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:06,081
And, uh, thank you for
your service, you know?

852
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,898
You want some?

853
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,268
No, I'm, uh... I'm good.

854
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,803
You?

855
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:31,507
No, no, I'm, uh... I'm
good too, thank you.

856
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:37,679
Uh, Mr. Borgia, we're...
we're here for, um, you know...

857
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,248
my uncle couldn't, but, uh...

858
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,551
Right now the cheapest thing
you can eat is peanut butter,

859
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:47,589
but put it on a cracker
with a banana pepper,

860
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:48,591
it ain't half bad.

861
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:49,691
Sounds good, yeah.

862
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,995
Just give him the damn pills
already and come back to bed.

863
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:54,730
Do you have to talk
everybody's ear off?

864
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:55,998
Do you have to
come out and chum up

865
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,299
to every guy who comes in here?

866
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:58,867
Bring the crackers.

867
00:58:58,869 --> 00:58:59,869
Come to bed.

868
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,282
Let's get the fuck out of here.

869
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,608
All right!

870
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,851
Whee!

871
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,225
Now, you did good.

872
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:40,295
You did real good.

873
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:42,931
Now, you want this
to be something more

874
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,232
than just an
after-school special?

875
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:46,435
You want this to grow
into something bigger?

876
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:49,838
Then you need to know
the business, OK?

877
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,106
OK.

878
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:55,744
Now, Badger, he
learned the business,

879
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,046
but he don't know business.

880
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,449
Mm-hmm.

881
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:03,185
I mean, he got no mind for it.

882
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:10,187
But you, with you we
might have something.

883
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:13,028
Who are we?

884
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,896
You know, who are
we in all of this?

885
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,500
We're... well, we're...

886
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:19,901
Little fish.

887
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:20,470
Yeah?

888
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:22,237
Yeah.

889
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:27,075
Yeah, we're little fish in
the big pond, gasping for air.

890
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:31,279
But the doctors that write those
scripts and the pharmacies that

891
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:34,282
fill those scripts and the
companies that distribute all

892
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:39,054
them big bad drugs... well,
they're the big fish.

893
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:39,889
You know?

894
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,323
They're like Moby Dick.

895
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,058
Remember?

896
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,358
Yeah?

897
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,294
Moby Dick in a
fucking kiddie pool.

898
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,032
The bottom line
of the whole deal,

899
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:53,101
we are just a spoke in
a very fucked-up wheel.

900
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:42,584
It's funny, you know?

901
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:45,253
Almost everyone I know right now
is working the potato harvest

902
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:45,988
there.

903
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,191
And I'm here.

904
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:51,560
I would much rather be here
than work in the potato harvest.

905
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,985
So did George tell
you you're going

906
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:21,189
to be working with
Josh tomorrow?

907
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,591
What do you mean?

908
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:24,326
Well, my parents are
taking me to Vermont

909
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:25,328
to look at colleges there.

910
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,932
That's great.

911
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:32,400
Yeah, it should be pretty cool.

912
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,572
What?

913
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:40,108
Then you're not going to back
with the harvester for a while.

914
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,945
Ow.

915
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:18,380
Twig or something.

916
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,116
Ow.

917
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:21,117
Be careful.

918
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:27,923
I want to get
a place, like a place for us.

919
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:32,294
Like... like for us and the baby.

920
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:33,962
Before the baby comes,
we should get a place.

921
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,366
What?

922
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:41,236
Don't you think?

923
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:42,270
Uh...

924
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,272
Don't you want to live with me?

925
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:48,610
And I'm going to pay
for that, though, right?

926
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:51,947
That's what you're saying.

927
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:52,949
Are you going to pay for it?

928
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,285
I'm just saying I
want to get a place.

929
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:02,023
And I'm just asking you, who's
going to pay for that there?

930
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:03,224
Well, do you want
people to think

931
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:06,294
that you can't take care of me?

932
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,296
Your own baby?

933
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:14,235
I thought you said you were
going to take care of us.

934
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:16,471
Oh, don't fucking start.

935
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,039
Don't get... stop.

936
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,307
Don't fuckin' start.

937
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,309
Don't... Tasha!

938
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,380
Just... just shut up, please.

939
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:26,581
Just stop.

940
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,717
Just shut the fuck
up, please, Tasha.

941
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:29,719
Don't tell me to shut up.

942
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,686
Tasha...

943
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,554
Don't tell me to shut up.

944
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,255
OK, I'm sorry.

945
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:36,424
Just stop talking, please.

946
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,659
Everyone's going

947
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,061
to think you're a stupid jerk.

948
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,197
Oh, really?
Everyone's going to think

949
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:44,699
Is that what they're
going to think?

950
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,134
On the fuckin'
playground, they're

951
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:49,137
going to think that I'm
a stupid fucking jerk?

952
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:50,672
On my best fucking
day, they're going

953
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,140
to think I'm a
stupid fucking jerk.

954
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:53,575
That's the truth there.

955
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:55,410
I don't give a fuck
what any of them think.

956
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,394
Oh, fuck.

957
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,315
Oh, fuck.

958
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,114
What are you thinking about?

959
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,821
What?

960
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:49,257
Casper.

961
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,392
Oh my gosh, why are you
thinking about Casper

962
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:52,427
right now?

963
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:57,765
It's... here, let me... let
me show you some pictures

964
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,667
of my car.

965
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:01,336
Oh, the car.

966
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,538
The car.

967
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,440
Check that out.

968
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:07,675
Oh, wow.

969
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:10,445
That's wicked cool.

970
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,413
You know, I was thinking
about the other night,

971
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:15,216
and I think I get it now.

972
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:16,918
You know, he's... he's
really not half bad.

973
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,523
Here.

974
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,398
I always thought if I could just

975
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,836
earn enough to get this
car, then we could just go,

976
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,938
and everything would be better.

977
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,841
You know?

978
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:41,509
Like everything
we've been doing up

979
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:46,347
to now has been to
get to this one night.

980
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,450
I'm so close.

981
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:56,452
Casper just... I just thought
leaving would be easier.

982
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,916
Sorry.

983
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,884
Oh, yeah.

984
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:56,885
Yeah, it's OK.

985
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:05,360
Let's have sex.

986
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,562
What?

987
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:09,864
Yeah, we want to fuck, right?

988
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:12,533
Let's fuck.

989
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:14,535
I don't want to right now.

990
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:16,537
Why not?

991
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,539
I feel gross.

992
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,540
Oh yeah?

993
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,310
What?

994
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,050
Take off your pants.

995
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:32,787
What?

996
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,456
Take off your pants.

997
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,325
What?

998
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:39,394
Either you take off your
fuckin' pants right fuckin'

999
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:40,995
now, or I'm going to
take them off for you.

1000
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,498
Take off your fuckin' pants.

1001
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,799
Take off your fuckin' pants!

1002
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,769
Let's get the fucking pants off!

1003
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:48,771
Stop!

1004
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,709
You're on your period, Tasha.

1005
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:01,316
You're on your period.

1006
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,820
Uh...

1007
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:05,721
Fuck!

1008
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:08,790
Yeah, you fucking are!

1009
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,958
I see it right fucking there!

1010
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,860
What the fuck!

1011
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,829
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1012
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,798
Let me explain!

1013
01:12:15,799 --> 01:12:16,632
Go ahead.

1014
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:17,799
Explain it to me.

1015
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:19,467
What?

1016
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:20,601
I don't want you to leave.

1017
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:21,703
Oh, fuck you!

1018
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:23,705
Then you don't fucking lie!

1019
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:25,640
You're a fucking liar!

1020
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:28,009
Fuck you!

1021
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,445
God fucking damn it!

1022
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:32,847
Stop!

1023
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:33,816
Don't go.

1024
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:34,817
Shut up.

1025
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,357
Fuck.

1026
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,974
OK, now.

1027
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:33,809
You see how it
gets hot like that?

1028
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,510
Yeah.

1029
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:34,877
Goes red?

1030
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:37,011
That's when you add
the filler metal.

1031
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:37,613
OK.

1032
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:38,180
See?

1033
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:38,847
And it melts it.

1034
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,148
It's like water.

1035
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,682
Oh.

1036
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:42,850
You see how I kind of
fucked up right there?

1037
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:44,652
Yeah.

1038
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:49,757
All I got to do is just heat
it up and move it with the heat

1039
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,726
'til it's right and smooth.

1040
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:53,194
And then you just fix it, yeah?

1041
01:13:53,196 --> 01:13:56,798
You just fix it, and nobody
will know the difference.

1042
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,065
Now, pay attention.

1043
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:00,835
All right, well, you're
doing the next one.

1044
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:02,069
This is fuckin' dangerous.

1045
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:03,538
I know.

1046
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:04,506
Don't hit me.

1047
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:05,007
Hey.

1048
01:14:05,008 --> 01:14:09,710
OK, so I bring it over Tuesday.

1049
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:11,045
First thing Wednesday
morning, you're

1050
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,213
going to go over to Portsmouth...

1051
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,748
OK.

1052
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,683
With that and what I
already brought across.

1053
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:17,885
Now, he's not going to show
up 'til later in the day,

1054
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:20,188
so you're going to meet
up right at the motel.

1055
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:24,125
And I want you to
take Casper with you.

1056
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,226
What?

1057
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:26,928
Oh.

1058
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,931
You know, I... I fuckin'... no.

1059
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:30,866
I can't.

1060
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:31,633
What?

1061
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,636
I'll... I'll drive it
down, but not with him.

1062
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,104
What are you talking about?

1063
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,607
I'm telling you, I
want him to go with you.

1064
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:40,875
You know?

1065
01:14:40,877 --> 01:14:41,943
He needs to know the
route, same as you.

1066
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:44,011
Well then, fuckin'
forget it, OK?

1067
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,913
I mean... uh.

1068
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,515
You know, I don't
need him looking over

1069
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:48,616
my fuckin' shoulder.

1070
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:49,917
I'm not looking
over your shoulder.

1071
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:50,919
Is that what you think?

1072
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:55,256
I think this is about you and
your fucking trust issues.

1073
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,598
Badger!

1074
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:03,965
Come back!

1075
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:05,166
What the fuck?

1076
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,034
Yeah.

1077
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:08,903
No, he'll be back.

1078
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:10,171
"Trust issues."

1079
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:12,073
He used to be a lot worse.

1080
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:15,877
And your trust issues.

1081
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:16,879
Yeah.

1082
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:47,141
Yeah, it's definitely
my first choice.

1083
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:48,876
Uh, the campus is
really awesome.

1084
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,812
They have this, like, big
lake out there and, you know,

1085
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,181
like this giant outdoor mall.

1086
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:55,616
It was really cool.

1087
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:56,951
It sounds really cool.

1088
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:59,654
Yeah, it was really
a good trip, you know?

1089
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:01,722
I'm really excited
for next year.

1090
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,792
I had to work with creepy old
Josh the whole time, you know?

1091
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:05,794
And I missed you.

1092
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,163
Yeah, I missed you too.

1093
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:16,003
So is something wrong?

1094
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,776
I just feel like I'm... I'm
really starting to like you,

1095
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:26,614
you know, Dom, and I... I
just don't want to give you

1096
01:16:26,616 --> 01:16:30,585
the wrong idea, uh, and make
you think that this can be more

1097
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:34,789
Because I don't know.

1098
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:36,924
I... I just think this kind
of has to be a harvest thing,

1099
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,660
Like... like what you said.

1100
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:42,263
It's like... like
harvest friends.

1101
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:44,732
Harvest friends, right.

1102
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:45,967
Like you and Austin.

1103
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:46,969
Right.

1104
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:03,217
Hey.

1105
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:05,953
Got your passport, kiddo?

1106
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,288
Yeah.

1107
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,290
I need you tonight.

1108
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:36,350
What?

1109
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:37,285
Oh, her?

1110
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:38,986
She's cute, huh?

1111
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:39,955
That's a fucking beast.

1112
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:43,090
That ain't no car, kiddo.

1113
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,793
I've seen your script run.

1114
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:48,229
Puts you over the
top for your car.

1115
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:50,431
Yeah, put that away.

1116
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:52,433
I suppose our share is OK.

1117
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:53,435
No big deal.

1118
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:54,935
No big fuckin' thing.

1119
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,242
Turns out I don't need
diaper money anymore, so.

1120
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:02,244
What?

1121
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:04,178
Don't worry about it.

1122
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,880
You got your passport, you?

1123
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:06,914
Why?

1124
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:08,849
We're going to a hockey game.

1125
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:09,851
Seriously?

1126
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,226
But why are you going again?

1127
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,895
Because I've got to fuckin' talk

1128
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:22,196
to the guy about some bullshit.

1129
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,333
Look, I don't

1130
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:27,935
want to fuckin' talk
to you about this

1131
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:28,937
all night, all right?

1132
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:29,938
I'm late.

1133
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:36,711
Oh, yeah.

1134
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:39,146
Thank you.

1135
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,449
This thing's a
fuckin' beast, no?

1136
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:42,451
Oh, yeah.

1137
01:18:42,452 --> 01:18:43,452
It's a piece of shit.

1138
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:45,219
It's a... yeah.

1139
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,727
He's going to the
Draveurs game, you know.

1140
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:53,994
Play in Grand Falls area.

1141
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:54,996
Ah, I hate Grand Falls.

1142
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:56,897
I know you hate Grand Falls.

1143
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,132
That's why I took you there.

1144
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,138
There he is there.

1145
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,415
Maybe he's doing his own thing
or something, his own deals

1146
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:17,151
or something on the side, so.

1147
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:19,353
My dad's pissed, you know.

1148
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:20,755
It's fucked up.

1149
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:26,494
So, uh... I slept with Emma.

1150
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,465
Shut your fuckin' face.

1151
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,134
Oh, yeah.

1152
01:19:33,136 --> 01:19:34,401
I fuckin' called that there.

1153
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:35,370
You did.

1154
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:36,504
You called it.

1155
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:37,506
How was it?

1156
01:19:39,842 --> 01:19:40,842
Good.

1157
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:41,409
What?

1158
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,978
There's more to this.

1159
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:49,150
There's more to that "good" than
just wha... was she a virgin?

1160
01:19:49,152 --> 01:19:50,417
I don't know.

1161
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,192
Kind of uncomfortable,
and we were

1162
01:19:58,194 --> 01:20:00,528
in a forest with
leaves and shit.

1163
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,562
No, you fuckin' weren't.

1164
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:02,930
You were in a forest?

1165
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:03,931
Yeah.

1166
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:07,268
OK.

1167
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:12,006
Anyway, she said that we're
just harvest friends now, so.

1168
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:14,341
What?

1169
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:15,543
What the fuck is that?

1170
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:19,380
I guess I just wasn't
part of her plan.

1171
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:21,115
And that's that, so.

1172
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,321
That's you being responsible?

1173
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,355
Just go!

1174
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:29,456
Fuck you!

1175
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,026
Oh, there he is.

1176
01:20:32,028 --> 01:20:34,128
Down the stairs, dah-dah,
dah-dah, dah-dun-dun.

1177
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,863
Let's go.

1178
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:39,033
You... you shut the fuck up!

1179
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:42,169
You're the one making all
the fuckin' noise out here.

1180
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:44,839
OK, let's
go to a fuckin' hockey game.

1181
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:45,906
Let's go.

1182
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,247
He's not even going in.

1183
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:37,151
I don't know what he's doing.

1184
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:39,219
He says he's going
to the Draveurs game,

1185
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:40,721
and then he's, I don't
know, sitting out here.

1186
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:44,692
Fuck.

1187
01:22:44,694 --> 01:22:47,094
Come on, Badger,
what are you doing?

1188
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:49,163
Maybe he just wants a lap
dance before the game, you know?

1189
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,201
All right.

1190
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:54,202
Well, he's going in.

1191
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:58,172
What
the... he's not going.

1192
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:00,240
Do you see that?

1193
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:04,044
I... I don't know.

1194
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:08,415
Why is he... what
is... god damn it.

1195
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:16,523
Can I have your phone?

1196
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,036
Hey, it's Casper.

1197
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:30,504
My phone died.

1198
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,072
Yeah.

1199
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:35,275
Damn fuckin' right, he
didn't go to the game.

1200
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:38,779
He...
he... no, he's at Mon Copain.

1201
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:41,448
He just got into some guy's car.

1202
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:42,483
I don't know.

1203
01:23:42,485 --> 01:23:44,218
Like, the guy just pulled up.

1204
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,453
No, he's... he was
sitting here for a while.

1205
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:48,055
Then this other guy pulls in.

1206
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:49,590
He gets up like
he's going to go in,

1207
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:52,559
and then he gets in
this other guy's car.

1208
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:54,061
Yeah.

1209
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:55,529
Oh, wait.

1210
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:56,663
Wait, he's getting out now.

1211
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:02,803
I don't know.

1212
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:04,204
I don't know who
the other guy is.

1213
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:11,612
OK.

1214
01:24:11,614 --> 01:24:13,213
All right, he's driving off.

1215
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,116
He's going.

1216
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,250
And he's gone.

1217
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,785
And we're going to lose him.

1218
01:24:17,787 --> 01:24:19,720
OK, bye.

1219
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,221
He wants us to follow this guy.

1220
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:22,223
That guy?

1221
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:24,525
Let's hope he's going
to a fucking hockey game.

1222
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:45,839
So what now?

1223
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,310
I don't know.

1224
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:51,678
Just sit here and watch.

1225
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,902
What the hell is
he doing in there?

1226
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:50,470
What the hell are
we doing out here?

1227
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,945
It's fuckin' stupid,
just sitting in this car.

1228
01:26:57,947 --> 01:26:59,646
I mean, is this...
you know, you just

1229
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:01,715
want to run errands for
Clayton the rest of your life.

1230
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:04,451
That's what you want to do?

1231
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,420
Is that what you
think I'm doing here?

1232
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:08,589
I want to be here right now?

1233
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:12,859
Thought we were going to a...
to a hockey game, you know?

1234
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:14,695
Well, I'm sorry
about the hockey game.

1235
01:27:14,697 --> 01:27:15,896
I used to think we both
wanted the same thing,

1236
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:17,331
but now we're sitting
in a car instead

1237
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:18,398
of going to a hockey game.

1238
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,733
It makes no fuckin' sense.

1239
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:23,604
You used to think we both
wanted the same thing?

1240
01:27:23,606 --> 01:27:28,408
You know, you think leaving
this town is everything, right?

1241
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,510
We... we leave the town,
then we go into the Boston,

1242
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:31,578
and then we watch the Red Sox.

1243
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,613
That's the plan.

1244
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:34,448
That's the plan!

1245
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,749
Then what?

1246
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,384
What happens when the game ends?

1247
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:38,286
What?

1248
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:39,753
You tell me!

1249
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:40,887
Give me something to do.

1250
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:45,759
I'll leave, but you have
no idea what kind of money

1251
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:46,927
I could make right here.

1252
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,930
See, you think you're
doing something different.

1253
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,332
OK, you think like your dad
sees something special in you,

1254
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:55,502
You're doing exactly what
everyone in this town

1255
01:27:55,504 --> 01:27:57,571
has expected you to do
since the day you were born,

1256
01:27:57,573 --> 01:27:58,905
you included.

1257
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:02,943
I'm... I'm the one who's always
expected something more from

1258
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:07,281
something better for yourself.

1259
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:08,615
OK?

1260
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:11,285
This town has nothing
that either of us want.

1261
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:14,054
We're meant to leave together.

1262
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:17,057
We're not meant to stay.

1263
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:19,726
Shit gets old fast, Casper.

1264
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:21,028
And it's going to get old fast.

1265
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:42,849
Oh, shit.

1266
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:43,884
Oh...

1267
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:44,652
Oh, fuck.

1268
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:45,086
Fuck!

1269
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:46,553
Shit.

1270
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:16,883
You're good here.

1271
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:35,602
Hey, where's Dom?

1272
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:57,524
What the fuck?

1273
01:29:57,526 --> 01:29:58,692
Holy shit.

1274
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:03,997
I can't just drive the fuck off.

1275
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:05,632
Get down!

1276
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:06,401
Fuck!

1277
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:07,402
Piece of shit.

1278
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,705
There's three of them.

1279
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:12,707
Fuck.

1280
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:25,118
After this third, we can go.

1281
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,155
We'll go up quick and
get the fuck out of here.

1282
01:30:28,157 --> 01:30:30,957
Come on, let's go.

1283
01:30:30,959 --> 01:30:31,959
Fuck!

1284
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,696
Let's go.

1285
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:44,605
Come on!

1286
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:45,106
What?

1287
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:46,640
Fuck!

1288
01:30:46,642 --> 01:30:48,642
Straight to fuckin' voice
mail, so he's already

1289
01:30:48,644 --> 01:30:50,043
in fuckin' Canada.

1290
01:30:50,045 --> 01:30:53,113
My god, your uncle is
such a fucking douchebag.

1291
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:56,450
Come on, come on.

1292
01:30:56,452 --> 01:30:59,719
See, maybe like... what

1293
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:01,721
if I said he didn't have
anything to do with it,

1294
01:31:01,723 --> 01:31:03,123
and that it was all me?

1295
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:05,625
And that... that I
planned all this,

1296
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,695
and... and that he
didn't do anything?

1297
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:12,599
OK.

1298
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:16,002
Enough already.

1299
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:22,976
He's my brother, OK?

1300
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:26,513
He's my only brother.

1301
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:27,547
And I love him.

1302
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:35,088
And now I'm fucking him!

1303
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,556
Yeah.

1304
01:31:36,558 --> 01:31:39,059
Yep, that's true.

1305
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:42,729
He is your brother, and
you are fucking him.

1306
01:31:42,731 --> 01:31:48,068
We are firmly entrenched
into fuck-you territory.

1307
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:51,738
You going to listen to me, Lee?

1308
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,507
Your brother is fucked
in the here and now

1309
01:31:53,509 --> 01:31:54,941
because of his
choices, his actions.

1310
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:02,215
Only one of which is aggravated
trafficking of scheduled drugs

1311
01:32:02,217 --> 01:32:06,119
across an international border
with his idiot fucking brother.

1312
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:16,663
This crying stuff, all this
remorse, you've got to... this

1313
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:17,964
has got to be in the rear view.

1314
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:19,165
You've got to put
that behind you.

1315
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:21,968
You've got to move forward.

1316
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:23,136
You've got to
think about Amanda.

1317
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:24,170
You've got a baby coming.

1318
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,645
You've got to suck it up.

1319
01:32:31,647 --> 01:32:32,779
You've got to man up.

1320
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:38,685
You've got to pull
your shit together.

1321
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:39,687
Right.

1322
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:44,925
Here's how this is
going to play out.

1323
01:32:47,863 --> 01:32:49,864
Thank you.

1324
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:54,834
Suspect is leaving
the port of entry.

1325
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:54,861
How you doing?

1326
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:55,696
Good.

1327
01:33:55,697 --> 01:33:57,397
Can I get your license,
registration, proof

1328
01:33:57,399 --> 01:33:58,765
of insurance?

1329
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,834
Uh, Canada.

1330
01:34:00,836 --> 01:34:03,003
Home.

1331
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,072
I'm just going

1332
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:07,074
to check your license
and registration.

1333
01:34:07,075 --> 01:34:08,075
I'll be right back.

1334
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:41,908
You guys all set?

1335
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,910
Just on a hunch, let me run
my canine around the vehicle.

1336
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,178
Yeah, that would be great.

1337
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,180
Sir, I'm Deputy Miller

1338
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:50,150
Anything illegal in the vehicle
that I need to know about?

1339
01:34:50,152 --> 01:34:53,219
If you'll exit the vehicle,
take 10 steps forward.

1340
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:55,355
Face away from the vehicle
for me while I do the search.

1341
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:56,856
Hey, I've got this pizza here.

1342
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,124
I see it.

1343
01:34:58,126 --> 01:34:59,859
You're all set.

1344
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:00,861
Jeez.

1345
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:31,791
Oh, he smells the fuckin' pizza.

1346
01:35:31,793 --> 01:35:33,393
Go back to your vehicle.

1347
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:34,861
Put your hands on the hood while
I search you and the vehicle.

1348
01:35:34,863 --> 01:35:36,029
Walk back.

1349
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:38,798
Keep your hands out
of your pockets.

1350
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,300
Put them on the hood.

1351
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:41,268
Spread your legs.

1352
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:42,269
Anything sharp on you?

1353
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:43,770
Any knives or needles at all?

1354
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,532
Bed's clear.

1355
01:36:12,534 --> 01:36:14,200
Nothing will fit in there.

1356
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:20,206
So, uh, I'm done?

1357
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:21,208
We're done now?

1358
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:39,018
How much does the MDEA

1359
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,887
know about what
they've been doing?

1360
01:37:40,889 --> 01:37:42,322
I mean, how much do
they know about us,

1361
01:37:42,324 --> 01:37:45,158
what we did, you know?

1362
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:49,329
OK, we've got to...
we've got to go.

1363
01:37:49,331 --> 01:37:51,097
We've got to get our money.

1364
01:37:51,099 --> 01:37:53,032
We've got to go right now.

1365
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:54,200
Casper, we've got
to go right now!

1366
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:55,202
Fuck!

1367
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,390
Grab the funds.

1368
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:17,391
Grab the money.

1369
01:38:46,554 --> 01:38:47,554
Dom?

1370
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:48,555
Dom!

1371
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:51,557
Dom, let's go.

1372
01:38:51,559 --> 01:38:53,559
Dom!

1373
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:54,561
Come on, let's go.

1374
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:03,236
Fuck!

1375
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:05,204
Get the fuck out!

1376
01:39:05,206 --> 01:39:07,206
No!

1377
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:12,211
Dom!

1378
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:23,423
No!

1379
01:39:57,558 --> 01:39:59,192
You all right, Dom?

1380
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:02,628
Coming for you!

1381
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:11,204
Dom!

1382
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:19,245
Dom?

1383
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,402
Here!

1384
01:40:42,404 --> 01:40:43,636
Ugh, over here.

1385
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:58,344
When I was about your age,
someone really close to me

1386
01:41:58,346 --> 01:42:00,413
died.

1387
01:42:00,415 --> 01:42:04,684
And, um, my mom picked me up
and drove me to the funeral.

1388
01:42:04,686 --> 01:42:08,187
And I couldn't cry, you know?

1389
01:42:08,189 --> 01:42:09,789
I thought there was
something wrong with me

1390
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:13,359
because I couldn't cry.

1391
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:16,829
I knew I missed him,
but I couldn't cry.

1392
01:42:16,831 --> 01:42:20,533
And my mom said,
don't worry, it's OK.

1393
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:24,704
It's not a race.

1394
01:42:24,706 --> 01:42:25,738
There's no rush.

1395
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:26,740
It'll come when it comes.

1396
01:42:30,444 --> 01:42:37,183
And, uh, when I got to the
funeral, this guy I barely knew

1397
01:42:37,185 --> 01:42:38,918
put his arms around
me, hugged me.

1398
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:44,824
And he said, I
wish you long life.

1399
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:46,425
And I lost it.

1400
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:49,729
I... I fell to pieces.

1401
01:42:49,731 --> 01:42:51,931
And I... I wish you long life.

1402
01:42:54,931 --> 01:42:58,931
