17
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,778
It feels so nice
walking in the bright sun.

18
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,485
Yes, it's nice...

19
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,489
but perhaps a little too hot
for pale girls like us.

20
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,022
I'm really perspiring.

21
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:49,026
I like it. It's washing all
the old powder out of my skin.

22
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,737
Along with the tobacco smoke
and alcohol.

23
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,299
You know, I've been thinking
about something.

24
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,672
What?

25
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:06,614
One of these days...

26
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,711
Pick up the pace, everyone!

27
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,600
WELCOME, NICHIREN PILGRIMS

28
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,789
<i>Please listen, everyone!</i>

29
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,492
<i>You all asked for masseurs,</i>

30
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:28,062
<i>but there are only 18</i>
<i>in this whole town.</i>

31
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:33,034
I was able to get 12 of those,

32
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:37,438
so come draw lots!
Come on, everyone!

33
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,821
What a racket!

34
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,003
They're so noisy!

35
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,943
They really are loud!

36
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,080
Quite a merry bunch, eh?

37
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,084
Merry?

38
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,151
What do you mean?

39
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,792
Well, I...

40
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,170
Does that sound "merry" to you?

41
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,232
It sounds noisy to me.
Just plain noisy.

42
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,176
Sounds like
they're in high spirits.

43
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,176
High spirits?

44
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,896
You call that "high spirits,"
old man?

45
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,761
It's just noise.
That's what it is.

46
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,528
Is he mad again?

47
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,469
Yes.

48
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,928
It's quite a big show tonight.

49
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,429
Big show?

50
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,138
What do you mean by that?

51
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,106
Does that sound
like a "big show" to you?

52
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,874
They're just noisy!

53
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,103
Too noisy!

54
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,011
See? He's grouchy again.

55
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,229
Hello?
Is this the front desk?

56
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,167
It's really noisy down there.

57
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,203
This is an outrage!
That's no way to behave at an inn.

58
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,863
Tell them!

59
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,403
I can't work.

60
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,942
I need a massage before bed,
so send a masseur.

61
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,478
What? They're all taken?

62
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,174
All of them?

63
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,343
We're ready.

64
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,182
Please do your best.

65
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,316
Who's the professor?

66
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,789
He's been here
since early summer,

67
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,452
reading very
difficult-Iooking books.

68
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:22,526
Maybe that's why
he says rather difficult things.

69
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,897
What sort of things?

70
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,404
A man was reciting
a Chinese poem in the water.

71
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,474
The professor heard it

72
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,101
and asked if the man
had composed it himself.

73
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,979
The man said no,
it was a famous poem by so-and-so.

74
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:43,520
The professor said
it was ridiculous

75
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,624
to recite other people's poetry.

76
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,421
That means geisha
shouldn't sing songs,

77
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,564
because they didn't write them.

78
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,563
That's right.

79
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:59,296
That man hasn't recited
a poem since.

80
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,166
Poor man.

81
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,902
I feel more sorry for the couple
across the hall from him.

82
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,551
Hello?

83
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,784
Where's that masseur?

84
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,894
What! That's ridiculous!

85
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,065
One group
can't monopolize them all!

86
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,898
How can you allow
something so absurd?

87
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,901
Get me the owner!

88
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,996
What?

89
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,368
Gone to bed?

90
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,869
How can the owner
go to bed before his guests?

91
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,345
Wake him up!

92
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:55,324
I was so angry last night
that I couldn't sleep a wink.

93
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,962
Was there something wrong?

94
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,689
You bet there was.

95
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,198
No masseur ever came.

96
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,703
They were all busy
with that group.

97
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,536
These excursion groups
have no manners

98
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,942
or consideration at all.

99
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,651
Well, they only travel
once or twice a year.

100
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,781
So are you saying...

101
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,522
that means they can behave
however they please?

102
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,665
No, I didn't mean -

103
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,098
I didn't mean
they can do anything.

104
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,736
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,906
Ethically speaking,

106
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:46,477
monopolizing all the masseurs
is absolutely inexcusable.

107
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,779
Don't you agree, old man?

108
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,109
Well...

109
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,080
<i>Ouch!</i>

110
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,083
What is it?

111
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,085
I stepped on something.

112
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,722
Did you cut yourself?

113
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,086
Are you all right?

114
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,692
Are you okay?

115
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,694
Call the innkeeper!

116
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,932
Your injury was due
to our negligence.

117
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,476
We sincerely apologize.

118
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,540
The carelessness of the staff
is my responsibility.

119
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,311
I beg your forgiveness.

120
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,945
How's your foot?

121
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,716
Frankly I'm embarrassed
by all the attention.

122
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:37,693
It's a great dishonor
to have a guest hurt.

123
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,128
We owe all of our guests
a profound apology.

124
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,836
Tell me, sir,

125
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,836
do you mean
you're apologizing to everyone?

126
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,136
Indeed.

127
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,439
Apologizing to all
the guests means

128
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,209
you believe that
the facilities are perfect.

129
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,374
Not at all.

130
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:05,047
Either that, or you're exploiting
his misfortune for publicity.

131
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,057
Rationalize it how you will,
that's how I see it.

132
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,355
Exploiting this tragedy
is an outrage.

133
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,796
"Tragedy"?
It's just a little wound.

134
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,532
Besides, there's
something almost poetic

135
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,300
about finding
a hairpin in the bath.

136
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,604
Poetic?

137
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,517
It's like the sole of my foot
has been pierced by poetry.

138
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:40,954
Everything you just said
smacks of decadence.

139
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,423
Why not add vulgarity to it

140
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,897
by hoping that the woman
it belonged to is beautiful too?

141
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,526
There's no need
to read so much into it.

142
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,533
Besides, I was careless too.

143
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,371
That may be so, but -

144
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,410
No, it was all our fault.

145
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,346
We'll see that
it never happens again.

146
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,851
- But the problem remains -
- It's all right.

147
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,046
He's already apologized.

148
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,657
It's really not that serious.

149
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,417
Is that so?

150
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,991
Then am I to presume I'm making
a nuisance of myself here?

151
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,662
Then we'll discuss this
in my room.

152
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,567
Innkeeper, come to my room.

153
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,006
The professor's bored
from being here so long.

154
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,980
Talking relieves his boredom.

155
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,846
You're right.

156
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,548
We're bored too.
His anger relieves our boredom.

157
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,227
I am not bored.
I have a mountain of reading.

158
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,860
If my anger relieves
your boredom -

159
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,867
Well, we'll discuss this later.

160
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,140
If you'll excuse us.

161
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,879
Dear...

162
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,141
you shouldn't have said
the professor was bored.

163
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,917
What if he comes to us
and complains?

164
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,178
That would be awful.

165
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,292
You're right.

166
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,554
What will we do if he comes?
What will we do?

167
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,893
Don't worry.
I'll take care of him.

168
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,067
Really?

169
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,705
Mr. Nanmura called it "poetic."

170
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,436
He said his foot was
"pierced by poetry."

171
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,103
How do you interpret that?

172
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,247
It's got to mean something.

173
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,786
"Dear Sir,

174
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,432
I am one of the pilgrims
who stayed at your inn.

175
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,034
I seem to have lost a hairpin
with a red coral gem.

176
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,137
If you happen to find it,

177
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,241
please let me know.

178
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,344
If so, I will send money
to have it returned to me

179
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,448
by registered mail.

180
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,346
Sincerely yours,
Emi Ota"

181
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,681
Professor, a letter came
from the hairpin owner.

182
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,721
Yes, so it seems.

183
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,089
But that person doesn't know

184
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,232
what her hairpin did
to Mr. Nanmura's foot.

185
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,992
Of course not.

186
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,762
Not unless she's told.

187
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,102
She couldn't know that
Mr. Nanmura felt it was poetic.

188
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,879
Professor, I think
the owner of that hairpin

189
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,642
may in fact be
an older woman,

190
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,345
but my wife thinks
it's a young woman.

191
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:02,851
You're constantly going on
about what your wife thinks,

192
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,088
but what does her opinion
have to do with any of this?

193
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:14,302
No... I just meant...

194
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,641
I'm sorry.

195
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,385
Say, old man,
what do you think?

196
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,122
Since it was
an ornamental hairpin,

197
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,657
she's not the kind
to wear Western clothes.

198
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,127
Right. You can't wear
one of those with a perm.

199
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,357
So she must wear a kimono.

200
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,025
Whether she wears a kimono

201
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,231
or whether she's old or young
is of no importance.

202
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,640
I just hope for Mr. Nanmura's sake
that she's beautiful.

203
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,946
For Mr. Nanmura's sake?

204
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,707
That's right.

205
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,614
He felt the hairpin was poetic.

206
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:09,157
She has to be beautiful
so that his poetic illusion isn't crushed.

207
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,258
I see.

208
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,733
- Is that right?
- Yes.

209
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,994
Very well put, Professor.

210
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,172
So that's how it is?
I see.

211
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,272
You should send it right away.

212
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,210
Of course I will,

213
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,146
but you were hurt by this pin.

214
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,411
She should apologize.

215
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,181
There's no apology needed.

216
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,154
Just leave it be.

217
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,553
Just hurry and send it.

218
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,657
But...

219
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:56,697
"Sorry about injury.

220
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:02,541
Coming to apologize. Emi"

221
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,318
Mr. Nanmura?
Telegram, sir!

222
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,320
He's not here?
Where could he be?

223
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,923
A telegram?

224
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,186
From the owner of the hairpin.
She's coming to apologize.

225
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,828
Really?

226
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,623
She's coming?

227
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,132
She sent this en route,
so she must be on the next train.

228
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,204
Where's Mr. Nanmura?
Excuse me.

229
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,399
Well, the owner
of the hairpin is coming.

230
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,705
Think she'll be beautiful?

231
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,781
- Well, my wife says -
- What?

232
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,209
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,648
I hope she is, for his sake.

234
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,487
But we must consider
the other possibility.

235
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,253
What?

236
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,557
If she's beautiful,
all will be well.

237
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:59,967
But if she's not,
he'll be disappointed.

238
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,366
We must be prepared
to comfort him.

239
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,539
Comfort him?

240
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,337
Dear, what do you -
- Again?

241
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,309
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,816
What do you mean?

243
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:26,253
Poetic illusions are like dreams,
and they're always beautiful.

244
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:32,631
But reality is quite often ugly.

245
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,328
Dear...

246
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,031
maybe you should
go look for Mr. Nanmura.

247
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,372
All right.
I'll go have a look.

248
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,596
Nanmura,
what are you doing here?

249
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,666
I've been looking all over.

250
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,467
Wait a minute.
How much is that?

251
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,473
<i>Forty</i> sen.

252
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,078
Bring me the change later, kid.

253
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:29,224
Actually, the hairpin's owner
has come to apologize.

254
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,761
- She came all this way?
- Of course.

255
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,694
She hurt you.

256
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,994
Is she beautiful?

257
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,072
I saw her only briefly
from the back.

258
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,235
"A goddess from the back,
homely from the front."

259
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:52,543
Listen, there's a chance
she won't be beautiful,

260
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,585
so don't be disappointed
if she's not.

261
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,952
Poetic illusions are like dreams,

262
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,288
and they're always beautiful.

263
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,488
But reality is quite often ugly.

264
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,429
I have no idea
what you're going on about.

265
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,001
What are you trying to say?

266
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,108
What <i>am</i> I saying?

267
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,415
- What are you thinking, dear?
- Oh, right.

268
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,418
Anyway, just stay
calm and collected.

269
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,081
Don't de disappointed
under any circumstances.

270
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,159
She's not the only woman around.

271
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,992
You'll find your poetic beauty,

272
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,225
so don't let yourself get gloomy.

273
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,666
I'm not disappointed
or gloomy.

274
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,862
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

275
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,042
You don't want your poetic illusion
to be crushed -

276
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,676
Dear...

277
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,610
we don't even know
what she's like yet.

278
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,216
I only saw her from the back.

279
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,109
You're right.

280
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,279
All right, let's go see.

281
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,051
Let's go together and see.

282
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:17,600
...and thus, I'm sure
your visit will please him greatly.

283
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,260
Don't you think so?
- Indeed.

284
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,942
So please don't crush
his poetic illusion.

285
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,805
I beg you.

286
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,610
I'll do the best I can.

287
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,510
Ah, welcome.

288
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:39,186
This young lady owns the hairpin.
She's very sorry.

289
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,887
I'm terribly sorry
for my carelessness.

290
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,429
It's nothing, really.

291
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:52,133
You needn't have come
all the way here.

292
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,472
It's almost embarrassing
to make such a big deal out of it.

293
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,543
I've told her everything.

294
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,545
Now, if you'll excuse me.

295
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,477
Let's go.

296
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,382
Please excuse us.

297
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,964
Thank you.

298
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,465
Professor, I'm so relieved.

299
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,598
Thank goodness she's beautiful.

300
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,569
Don't you think so, dear?

301
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,740
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

302
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,542
It would've been a tragedy
if she weren't.

303
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,516
Well, thanks for your help.

304
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,650
No, it was all thanks to you.

305
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,382
No, no.

306
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,022
Come here a minute.

307
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,709
The heat's a bit oppressive,
isn't it?

308
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,543
Is it?
I mean, yes, it is.

309
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,820
Um...

310
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,555
Yes?

311
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,762
It's really very hot.

312
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,766
Yes, you're right.

313
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,672
Maybe I'll soak in the water.

314
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,980
Your towel?

315
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,847
Have you gone for a soak yet?
It might be refreshing.

316
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,079
I will.

317
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,586
Thank you.

318
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:12,035
You're very considerate
for a scholar.

319
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,043
I'm too old for all that.

320
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,705
That's not so.
You do just fine.

321
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:24,954
Let's see...
Miss, please bring a mirror.

322
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,456
And bring in the lady's bags.

323
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,568
And we'll close these screens.

324
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,876
I guess that should do.

325
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,044
Really? I guess
I was wrong to ask.

326
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,344
I won't ask again.

327
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,452
All he does is
talk to her all the time.

328
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,592
Hey, what about
your walking practice?

329
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,687
Oh, right.
I lost myself in our conversation.

330
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,337
How far did I get yesterday?

331
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,539
Just past that tree.

332
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,411
You made it
this far yesterday.

333
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,610
I'll try for the next tree today.

334
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,215
One, two, three!

335
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,532
You can do it.

336
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,202
Keep going!

337
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,102
Come on.

338
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,802
A little further.

339
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,070
You can do it.
Keep going.

340
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,738
Just a little further.

341
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,382
Come on!

342
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,846
Just a little further.

343
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,385
You can do it!

344
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,824
Careful!

345
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,364
Too bad.
You almost made it.

346
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,370
Too bad.
- It's still a record.

347
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,441
Do you practice
like this every day?

348
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,180
- Will you come watch?
- Yes, absolutely.

349
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,984
Go get my crutches,
would you?

350
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,056
You take them to him, lady.

351
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,870
Jiro, let's go.

352
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,638
You boys!

353
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,281
Come on.

354
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,923
Why don't you take
his crutches to him?

355
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:58,866
All he does is talk to you.
You take them.

356
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,208
The professor's moved in with us.

357
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:14,442
We were really cramped last night.
Right, Jiro?

358
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,588
That's right.
And the professor snores!

359
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,453
Even louder than Grandpa.
We can't sleep.

360
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,453
That sounds awful.
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,532
We'll all sleep
in my room tonight, okay?

362
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,898
Now go take him his crutches.

363
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,866
Come down now.

364
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,577
Careful. Don't fall.

365
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,206
Now go get his crutches.

366
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,759
- He's gone.
- Where could he have gone?

367
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,895
- The crutches are gone too.
- He probably went back.

368
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,311
That was nice of you.

369
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,141
You managed that well.

370
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:24,386
Listen, let's everyone take turns
singing their favorite song.

371
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:28,083
It can be any kind of song.

372
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,993
If nobody speaks up,
I'll pick someone.

373
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,608
Another group arrived today.

374
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,602
So it seems.

375
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:54,215
These groups
lack all consideration.

376
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,515
Oh! I better book
a masseur while I can.

377
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,925
Hello? Front desk?

378
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,758
Since another group's
come in today,

379
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,558
would you book me
a masseur now?

380
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,633
What?
They're all booked?

381
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,430
Surely you can find one!

382
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,597
What? You can't?

383
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,800
All taken?

384
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,037
They didn't lose any time
booking them all.

385
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,376
They sure didn't.

386
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:32,681
I tell you, these groups
lack all consideration for others.

387
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,295
Hello?

388
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,434
Speaking.

389
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,067
Is this Ume?

390
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,399
Is everything okay?

391
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,344
He got mad?

392
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,178
He came back three times?

393
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:04,318
You didn't tell him I'm here, did you?
Make sure you don't.

394
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,492
Really?

395
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,927
He'll take my things
if I'm not there next time?

396
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:19,463
Fine with me.
He can have it all.

397
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,699
It'll be a clean start
for both of us.

398
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,968
And Ume...

399
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,575
when he comes
to take my things,

400
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,873
don't say "see you later"
like always.

401
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,483
Say "farewell."
Understand?

402
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,449
And like I've said before,

403
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,387
you should think about getting
married and changing jobs.

404
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,755
Think it over while I'm gone.

405
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:50,828
I think it's best for you
to go home and get married.

406
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,836
Anyway, think it over.

407
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,702
By the way, have you seen Okiku?
Was she worried?

408
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:05,377
I'll write her
and explain everything.

409
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,481
All right, then.
Good-bye.

410
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,624
Don't swallow the seeds.
You'll get appendicitis.

411
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,736
- Aren't you going to eat?
- No.

412
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,536
- What a waste.
- You can have it.

413
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:44,281
What's the character
for "suddenly"?

414
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:48,050
"Suddenly"?
Shall I ask the professor?

415
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,694
No, don't bother.

416
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:07,575
"Dear Okiku, I'm sorry
I left without telling you.

417
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:22,248
I won't be coming back
for a while.

418
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:36,831
The reason is because..."

419
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,608
<i>Can we visit you</i>
<i>when we get back to Tokyo?</i>

420
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,938
<i>Yes.</i>

421
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,741
<i>- Will you cook something for us?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

422
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,716
<i>- Where do you live in Tokyo?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

423
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,878
<i>- You're not listening!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

424
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,523
I asked if we could
visit you in Tokyo,

425
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:00,997
and if you'd cook us something,
and where you lived.

426
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,566
Sorry. I was thinking
about something.

427
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:09,535
I may not have a home
when I return to Tokyo.

428
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,470
Then what will you do?

429
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,868
I don't want to go back.
I probably won't.

430
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,912
Then we can't visit you after all.

431
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,246
I'll have to start all over again.

432
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,526
Here we go again.

433
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,595
The professor's the loudest.

434
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,027
Grandpa has to try harder.

435
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,961
- Come on, Grandpa!
- Louder!

436
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,967
- Louder!
- Come on!

437
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:49,304
- Come on!
- Don't let him win!

438
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,641
Boys, be quiet.

439
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,357
Grandpa's louder now.

440
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,601
I can't stand it
when people snore.

441
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,011
Taro, you've written here
about your summer vacation

442
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,953
as if it's already over.

443
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,956
I wanted to finish
the assignment.

444
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,618
I understand that,

445
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,824
but how can you write about things
that haven't happened yet?

446
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,992
Because every day here
is the same.

447
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:23,231
I get up, exercise
to the radio, bathe,

448
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:28,037
eat breakfast, study, play,

449
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:32,842
have lunch, take a nap,
go for a walk,

450
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,017
help you practice walking,

451
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,481
then have a bath,
eat dinner,

452
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,786
and then...

453
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:51,757
study a little more, and go to bed.
Every day's the same.

454
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:56,635
But you have to write
about the special things that happen.

455
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:01,005
For example,
how a lady came from Tokyo,

456
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,043
how the professor got into fights
with excursion groups.

457
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,650
Different things happen
every day.

458
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:12,312
Like how the professor moved
into our room when that lady came?

459
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,220
And how we moved
into her room?

460
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,159
- And their snoring contest?
- That's right.

461
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,672
How about another game?

462
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,103
- Another game of Go?
- If you would.

463
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,406
- Again?
- Please.

464
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,442
Really?

465
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:05,207
This is Grandpa's.
The professor sent his too.

466
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,411
He's got some nerve.

467
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,314
He expects you
to wash his things.

468
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,813
Really?

469
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,215
That's all right.
I'll do them all.

470
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,953
Take your clothes off now

471
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,184
and have a swim until they dry.

472
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,224
Go on, get in.

473
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,101
It's cold!

474
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,206
See? Doesn't it feel nice?

475
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,572
You splashed me!
I'll splash you back!

476
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,613
Don't splash me!
Just go swim.

477
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,443
I'll splash you more!

478
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,575
- Stop that!
- No.

479
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,211
Come on! You can do it!

480
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,357
Come on!

481
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,320
You've broken
your own record!

482
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,762
Keep going!

483
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,266
A little further!

484
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,097
Keep trying!

485
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,305
You can do it!

486
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,905
Don't give up!

487
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,280
You're almost there.

488
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,516
A little further!

489
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,593
You can do it!

490
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,331
You did it!

491
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,102
You made it!

492
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:48,172
Thanks to all of you.

493
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,012
I'll try a new place tomorrow.

494
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,150
Someplace with obstacles.

495
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,911
Obstacles?
That might be a little tough.

496
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,213
It'll be all right.
Won't it?

497
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:02,223
Of course.
You made it this far today.

498
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,761
All right. I'll do it.

499
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,125
Now let's go have a soak.

500
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,267
This is almost like
a neighborhood meeting.

501
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,135
That's true.

502
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,642
Why don't we get together
like this regularly?

503
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,179
Next time will be in our room.
Right, dear?

504
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:28,409
Ah, I'm sorry.

505
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,722
The professor
should be chairman.

506
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,917
- Really?
- Absolutely.

507
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,561
Me?

508
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,390
No question about it.

509
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:45,129
Very well.
I accept the duties of chairman.

510
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:50,432
As our first topic, I submit
the service here at the inn.

511
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:54,044
I'd like to hear your opinions.

512
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,842
Yes, let's talk about that.

513
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,949
In my opinion...

514
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:05,519
although there are many
shortages these days,

515
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:10,859
it isn't being too picky
to point out that the food

516
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:17,198
leaves something to be desired.

517
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,193
Breakfast is miso soup, egg,
seaweed and pickles,

518
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,205
and lunch is noodles -
basically a rice substitute.

519
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,334
That much is fine.
The problem is dinner.

520
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,744
Sashimi followed by grilled fish,
soup, and boiled greens -

521
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:36,751
always the same,
as if it's written in stone.

522
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,550
They change the presentation,
but never the food.

523
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,991
One look
and I lose all appetite.

524
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,620
I didn't come
to the mountains to eat fish.

525
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,761
There should be
some local specialties.

526
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,801
What do all of you think?

527
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,398
You're absolutely right.

528
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:06,012
You may be right,
but I get a big discount here,

529
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,208
so I can hardly complain.

530
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,915
Actually,
with the grandkids along

531
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,455
I got a much lower rate too.

532
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:19,693
Now that you mention it,

533
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,993
I'm paying below
the normal rate too.

534
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,799
So you can't complain.

535
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,598
You're right.

536
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,069
But still...

537
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,600
a bit of variety would be nice.

538
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:38,214
Some tofu, or squash,
or salmon, or sardines.

539
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,179
I agree.

540
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,650
Some squash would be great.
I love squash.

541
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,481
Or salmon rice with tea.

542
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,793
What about you,
Mr. Hiroyasu?

543
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:54,124
You haven't said a word.
Do you have no opinion?

544
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,324
Oh, the meals here
are definitely not fancy.

545
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,232
Are they, dear?
Ah, I'm sorry.

546
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:10,274
They're not fancy,
but we don't feel deprived.

547
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,314
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

548
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,788
from now on we'll have
the same as everyone else.

549
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,583
Won't we dear? Oops!

550
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,654
I'm sorry.

551
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,422
Shall we change
the subject now?

552
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:32,601
Very well. I'll speak
to the innkeeper about the meals.

553
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,237
Next topic?

554
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,999
Your snoring, Professor.
It's annoying.

555
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,802
She couldn't sleep
a wink last night.

556
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,069
Taro!

557
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,009
You said it was like
sleeping by train tracks.

558
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,947
I don't know what to say!

559
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:52,054
I'll try to be more careful.

560
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,052
Next topic?

561
00:44:54,958 --> 00:45:00,726
Miss Emi, anything you'd like
to bring up besides train tracks?

562
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,858
Not really.

563
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,437
Since I arrived,
I've been getting up early.

564
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:12,371
I learned the exercises to the radio,
and I do washing in the river.

565
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,070
I wish I could live
like this forever.

566
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,738
But the boys will leave
when summer's over,

567
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:23,546
and so will Mr. Nanmura
and the rest of you.

568
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,951
I'll miss you all.

569
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,115
If Mr. Nanmura leaves,
I suppose you'll -

570
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:33,092
Listen, everyone.
After we all return to Tokyo,

571
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:38,257
we should keep meeting.
Shouldn't we, dear?

572
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,771
Yes, dear. Good idea.

573
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,239
What do all of you think?

574
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,970
- I'm in favor.
- Let's do that.

575
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,273
- Good idea.
- Yes, indeed.

576
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,814
Will I still be chairman?

577
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,952
Of course!

578
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,019
But Miss Emi may not have
anywhere to go back to.

579
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,784
It's been chaos
since you left.

580
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:37,016
He said he'd file
a missing person's report.

581
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,888
I didn't know what to do.

582
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:43,192
I'm sorry about all this.
What did he do then?

583
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,825
He flew into a rage
and took everything.

584
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,472
I think he was just
trying to intimidate me.

585
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,668
I'm glad he took everything.
A nice clean break!

586
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,143
How can you say that?

587
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,584
What would you do
if he found out you're here?

588
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,829
What would I do?

589
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,156
I'm not sure.

590
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,391
I'd slap his face.

591
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,763
You don't seem terribly worried.

592
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,137
What are your plans now?

593
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,607
I'm not sure...

594
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,540
but something will come to me.

595
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:35,148
I've learned the radio exercises
and how to do laundry.

596
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,381
See how much sun I've gotten?

597
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:49,565
Okiku, remember
during the pilgrimage,

598
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,701
how we were perspiring?

599
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,414
<i>Miss Emi!</i>

600
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:12,346
It's time for his walking practice!
Hurry up!

601
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,384
Oh, I forgot.

602
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,518
Why don't you soak in the springs
and then rest awhile?

603
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,300
Here I am.

604
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,309
Here I come!

605
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,548
Get set, go!

606
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,986
Are you all right?
Be careful.

607
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,359
You okay? Careful.

608
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,524
And he's off!

609
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,664
He's walking
on his own two feet!

610
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,334
Miss Emi looks nervous.

611
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,697
Mr. Hiroyasu
is trembling with fear.

612
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:04,602
Mr. Nanmura's covered 30 feet,
and he's giving it his best.

613
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,876
He's clenching his teeth.

614
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,103
Come on!

615
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,780
Keep going!

616
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,575
Come on!

617
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,852
Don't give up!

618
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:29,260
We're all rooting him on.
He's trying with all his might.

619
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,461
He's breaking out
in a sweat.

620
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,604
Come on!

621
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,202
You can do it!

622
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,899
Come on!

623
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,368
Keep going!

624
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,539
Be careful!

625
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,112
You're halfway!

626
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,117
Careful!

627
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,001
Just relax.

628
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,607
Too bad - he fell!

629
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,210
He almost made it.

630
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,486
- That was tough.
- Are you hurt?

631
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,921
No.

632
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,389
I'll carry you back.

633
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,294
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

634
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,531
That's dangerous.

635
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,733
Be careful!

636
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,207
Careful!

637
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,311
Come on!

638
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,644
You can do it!

639
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,754
Miss Emi, watch your step!

640
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:49,529
Are you all right?
Please be careful.

641
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,771
Watch your step!
Don't rush!

642
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,343
You're almost there!

643
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,687
Watch your step!

644
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,766
She made it!

645
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,669
Thank you.

646
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,172
What a relief!

647
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,738
Here come the masseurs.
Let's let them by.

648
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,613
Gentlemen, watch your step.

649
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,619
It's rocky there.

650
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,984
Thank you.

651
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,927
Be careful.

652
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,826
The bridge starts right there.

653
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,064
It's narrow.

654
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,598
Be careful.

655
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,770
- Isn't that Mr. Hiroyasu?
- Good day.

656
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,443
- Good day.
- Hello.

657
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,115
It curves there.
Be careful.

658
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,747
You can do it!

659
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,517
We know. Thank you.

660
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,659
You all right?

661
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,317
Come on!
Keep going!

662
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,508
I'm afraid I let you win.

663
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,743
You did no such thing.

664
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:47,481
Let's try again
after I go for a soak.

665
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,485
Again?

666
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:08,410
Hello? Front desk?

667
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:13,348
Listen, I came here
to read my books,

668
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,751
but this old man constantly
makes me play Go with him.

669
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,746
I want a different room.
Send a maid.

670
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,791
What? No rooms?

671
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:32,398
I have to do something.

672
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,706
I know!
I'll go back to my first room.

673
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,656
Hey. Hey you.

674
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,532
Who are you?

675
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:11,701
I came to get Miss Emi.

676
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,840
Miss Emi?

677
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,102
Yes.

678
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,011
To take her back?

679
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:24,279
Yes. Some matters
need her attention.

680
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:29,391
That's a real shame.

681
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,426
Shouldn't I take her back?

682
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,263
I can't tell you not to,

683
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,938
but it's still a real shame.

684
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:50,376
Did you already have a soak?

685
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,072
No, it's packed
with new visitors.

686
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,479
Another group?

687
00:55:55,752 --> 00:56:00,280
If you don't mind,
could we play another game?

688
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,753
Really?

689
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:08,293
Perhaps we can talk more later.
If you'll excuse me.

690
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,960
So the water's packed
with people, is it?

691
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,972
Another group, eh?

692
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,813
The masseurs
are already booked up.

693
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:34,187
Hello? No, nothing.

694
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,094
So that's how it is, eh?

695
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,466
I'm back.

696
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,036
I'm back.
- Welcome back.

697
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,943
This is my friend Okiku.
Mr. Nanmura.

698
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,110
Nice to meet you.

699
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,085
What about me?

700
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,622
Jiro and Taro.

701
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:09,986
Hello.

702
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,354
Nice to meet all of you.

703
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,293
How about introducing us too?

704
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:18,701
Mr. And Mrs. Hiroyasu.

705
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,964
Nice to meet you.

706
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,606
So we have another member.

707
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:31,941
Yes, and this one
is very poetic too.

708
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:39,412
I wonder how Mr. Nanmura
will feel about Miss Emi going back.

709
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:53,528
When I told the professor
I had come to take you back,

710
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:57,469
he said it was a shame.
Why would he say that?

711
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,807
So you're here to take me back?

712
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,672
Yes.
Aren't you coming?

713
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,576
No, not yet.

714
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,739
No matter what?

715
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,082
That's right.

716
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,787
I don't want to go back
to that gloomy life.

717
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,154
That's no way to live.

718
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,060
I didn't want for money.

719
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:28,499
I could sleep when I wanted,
get up when I wanted,

720
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:33,574
wear what I wanted,
eat what I wanted, see what I wanted.

721
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:36,610
But that's all.

722
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,880
I want more meaning
in my life.

723
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,151
So please don't try
to talk me out of this.

724
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,129
I don't know
what the future holds,

725
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,501
but at least while I'm here
every day in the sunshine,

726
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,837
the sun will show me the way.

727
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,780
So don't try
to talk me out of it.

728
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:19,117
You know you feel the same way.
- I do?

729
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:38,741
I suddenly feel like crying.
Please don't stop me.

730
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,206
I came here to lecture you,

731
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:18,404
but I wound up
getting lectured instead.

732
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,316
Emi, I understand.

733
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:28,519
If that's how you feel,
I'll settle things with him.

734
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,759
Leave it to me.

735
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:35,057
Forget about everything,
and let the sun bronze your skin.

736
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,866
Someday I too will -

737
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,935
Miss Emi!

738
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,501
The little boy's coming.

739
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:01,650
Mr. Nanmura is moving
into Grandpa's room.

740
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:05,487
Two groups arrived today,
so all the rooms are packed.

741
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,590
I'm very sorry.

742
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:14,828
We have a group of pilgrims
and one of shopgirls.

743
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,671
- Sorry to intrude.
- Not at all.

744
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,833
With the rates we're paying,
we can't moan.

745
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,980
Sorry to barge in like this.

746
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,811
You and your wife too?

747
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,749
No, my wife will be
in the next room.

748
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,718
Well, then,
I guess it's all right.

749
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:37,121
Having a couple in here
would be a bit much.

750
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,553
So you're on
a discounted rate now too?

751
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:04,146
Quiet! Stop that racket!

752
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,755
Emi, could we trade places?

753
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:55,430
You'll get used to it.
I don't notice it at all anymore.

754
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,505
Are you sure?

755
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,811
This is really something.

756
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,020
I didn't expect this.

757
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,623
Loud, isn't it?

758
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,426
Isn't there anything
we can do?

759
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,224
Well...

760
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:28,132
we have to startle them.

761
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,431
Shall we try it?

762
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,113
What happened?

763
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,616
Nothing. You called me.

764
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:45,378
No, I didn't.

765
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,883
Really?

766
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:10,478
"The day after
those two groups arrived,

767
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:16,511
the professor got really grumpy
and went back to Tokyo.

768
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:22,513
Miss Emi's friend left too.

769
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:28,519
Grandpa seems to miss
his Go partner."

770
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:34,358
"Mr. Nanmura finally crossed
the log bridge today - hurrah!

771
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:38,529
Mr. And Mrs. Hiroyasu
have gone too.

772
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:42,733
We'll be going home
soon as well.

773
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:47,109
I hope Mr. Nanmura
can make it

774
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:50,878
to the top of the steps by then."

775
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,697
If I make it to the top,

776
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:08,735
I can go back to Tokyo

777
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,429
with the rest of you.

778
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:16,445
Go back to Tokyo?

779
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,705
Ready?

780
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,890
Go!
This will be tough.

781
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,825
If he makes it,
he can go back with us.

782
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:36,487
Come on!

783
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,825
You can do it!
Keep going!

784
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,234
Come on!

785
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,600
Don't give up!

786
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:48,138
Come on! Keep going!

787
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,577
10... 11...

788
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:57,377
12... 13...

789
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,429
Keep going!

790
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:15,329
18... 19...

791
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,774
You're halfway there!
Come on!

792
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,339
23...

793
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,248
Keep going!

794
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,894
28...

795
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,306
Ten to go! 9...

796
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,779
8...

797
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,513
5...

798
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,378
4...

799
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,317
3...

800
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,016
2... 1!

801
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,184
You made it! Hurrah!

802
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,021
He's going back after all.

803
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,166
I made it.

804
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,397
Now I can go back to Tokyo.

805
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,240
Miss Emi!

806
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,283
What's wrong?

807
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:44,223
I'm just happy he made it.
These are tears of joy.

808
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,672
You're all leaving me.

809
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,537
I'll be all alone.

810
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:10,576
"Emi, many thanks
for your help during my stay.

811
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,847
Since my return,
I've started using a cane,

812
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,921
and it's not just for show.

813
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:20,290
Tonight's our first 'neighborhood meeting.'
We look forward to your return to Tokyo.

814
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,260
