1
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:32,790
Anton!

2
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,498
Anton!

3
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,216
-Where's your brother?
-I don't know.

4
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:56,435
Don't touch strange dogs, ok.

5
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:08,633
-Anton!
-Over there!

6
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,325
Anton?

7
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:15,837
Are you mad?
Those papers are full of germs!

8
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:18,269
We've been looking for you for over
an hour! What if we'd left without you?

9
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:20,124
It's a baby magpie.

10
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,078
Its foot is broken.

11
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:24,281
It's dying.
Look at it.

12
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:25,945
Poor thing.

13
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:28,417
Stop making a scene.
Someone will save it.

14
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,303
-We don't have time.
-We can't just leave it here.

15
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:33,183
We can.
Come on, move!

16
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,129
-Mummy...
-Gran's dogs will devour it.

17
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:38,910
Would you have saved people
during the war?

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,932
Spare me, Anton.

19
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,849
You win.

20
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,574
It's a stowaway.
Don't say a word about it.

21
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,037
The conductor can stop the train.

22
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,304
Gently... Open it!

23
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,774
Go away,
I'm cleaning.

24
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,418
-When'll you tell her?
-I don't know.

25
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,685
-I won't decide now.
-You should have told her.

26
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:10,404
-I should have.
-It's an ambush.

27
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:14,314
Take Récif.
Give him to Gulven.

28
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,775
Gulven!

29
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:24,804
-Come and get Récif.
-Hold her.

30
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,532
Ready.

31
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:35,365
Look, it's your daughter.
Your little daughter!

32
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:39,371
I'll tell Léna myself,
as soon as she gets here...

33
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:43,568
Give her your
neurological report too.

34
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:49,678
-Cut the schoolyard blackmail...
-Shit! Are you happy now?

35
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,625
Trying to drive me mad?

36
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:56,304
It's bad enough
and you make it worse!

37
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,546
I don't understand you, Annie.

38
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:00,847
Because it doesn't concern you.

39
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,495
-Clean the barbecue.
-You said we weren't using it.

40
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:07,664
I don't want you
within 20 yards of me!

41
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:12,856
Got out everything you need?
I finish packing tonight.

42
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,317
Very nice...

43
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,553
Things are hotting up.

44
00:03:35,646 --> 00:03:38,013
Take this.
It makes me feel sick.

45
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:42,233
In your struggle for family harmony,
I'm on your side.

46
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,701
Don't yank my chain, young man.

47
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:48,125
Help me out here.
Get the kids inside.

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,076
We'll see to it.

49
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:54,422
-Talk to your big sister.
-Once the damage is done.

50
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:59,516
-What'll you say?
-I'll tell her that her patients...

51
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:02,137
need her more than her two brats.

52
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,689
That she must return post haste
to her crummy hospital

53
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,195
and that she can't go near
the canal,

54
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:10,461
unless accompanied by at least

55
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,898
two members of the community...

56
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,637
Your father can never face
the facts.

57
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,262
I've never known him face
the facts.

58
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,701
Interested in what I'm saying?

59
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,358
I don't know.

60
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,022
Not one bit.

61
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:39,595
You don't touch birds.

62
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,643
Everyone knows that.
Nor eggs in nests.

63
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:43,876
Puppies or kittens are the same.

64
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:47,459
If they smell of humans,
the mother lets them die.

65
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,477
-Enough.
-They need to know.

66
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,254
-Is the bird going to die?
-No, it won't die.

67
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:57,001
We were careful.
We used a handkerchief.

68
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,534
Do birds have a soul?

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,736
No, Anton, birds are birds.

70
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,522
Is it still alive?

71
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,184
Yes, petal.

72
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,485
-Can I look in the bag?
-I just did.

73
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,689
Why not show her?
Has it croaked?

74
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,898
You said not to touch it.

75
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,060
A bird's temperature is 51 C.
That makes them pure spirits.

76
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,235
Is the bird dead, Mummy?

77
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:23,284
No, it's alive.
It's just fine.

78
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:26,573
Spare us the religious guff.

79
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:29,076
-Frédérique asked me.
-Enough!

80
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,695
Don't mention the bird to Gran!

81
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,152
30 years ago,
Léna was three and a half.

82
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:27,801
She was born in January.

83
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:31,615
January 12th, 1974.

84
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:36,318
<i>With Léna here,
life changed.</i>

85
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:38,622
<i>My wife changed.</i>

86
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:43,270
<i>She wanted another daughter.
Frédérique was born.</i>

87
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:47,291
<i>Even now,
I have the strange impression</i>

88
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:51,074
<i>that Frédérique
is my wife's daughter only.</i>

89
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:53,412
<i>Hers alone.</i>

90
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:57,380
<i>Gulven, however,</i>

91
00:06:57,576 --> 00:07:00,774
<i>is definitely the son
of my whole family together.</i>

92
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:08,839
<i>This year, for her birthday,
Léna asked me in secret to stand surety</i>

93
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:14,187
<i>for an apartment that she wanted
to rent in her own name.</i>

94
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,908
<i>One Tuesday morning,</i>

95
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,460
<i>I pulled up
outside her old building.</i>

96
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,441
<i>I had driven from Guerlédan
to Paris.</i>

97
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,290
<i>I waited until her husband left,</i>

98
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:29,514
<i>then I hurried up to join her.</i>

99
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:36,017
<i>She had hidden two packed suitcases
under the children's beds.</i>

100
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:40,999
<i>She was dumping her husband
and the hospital.</i>

101
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:45,000
<i>She had also decided
the children would stay with her.</i>

102
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,625
-What's she like?
-Elise? Ok.

103
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,645
I warned you.

104
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:05,911
You'll be doing relief work
in September?

105
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:08,111
Shit,
they can't keep a secret!

106
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:09,906
No, I won't

107
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:12,276
and I'm not missing
the new school year.

108
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:15,383
You want to look after
your kids now

109
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:18,961
but you can't only do that.
You need to work.

110
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:21,552
Why couldn't
I only do that?

111
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:25,012
It may not help,
having a mother

112
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,153
entirely at their disposal...

113
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,396
You're wrong,
it suits them.

114
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:33,143
I was absent for years,
away for birthdays or Christmas.

115
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,348
-Not anymore.
-Christmas matters now?

116
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,492
It used to make you sick.

117
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:38,904
Enough.

118
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:41,757
Ready.

119
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:18,533
Mom, look at all those cows!

120
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,721
How do Mum and Dad rate Elise?

121
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,702
She asked for a nutcracker
to eat whelks.

122
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,319
Why are they always loopy?

123
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:31,075
-Who's loopy?
-Gulven's new girlfriend.

124
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,030
Don't tell him that!

125
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,601
It's José!

126
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,588
Come on, get out.

127
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,613
Look, it's Auntie Léna!

128
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:01,255
<i>-You're happy.
-Not much luggage.</i>

129
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:03,628
<i>We're only here for the weekend.</i>

130
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:07,273
-She's glad to see you.
-Hi.

131
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,094
How are you?

132
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:11,791
Hi.

133
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:15,857
Remember Elise?

134
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,769
Spare me her life story.

135
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,025
Welcome.

136
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,014
Mum, can I have your room?

137
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,819
-No way.
-Why not?

138
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,959
Because it's my room.

139
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:41,103
You three kids share a room.

140
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,509
I can't read there.

141
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:46,997
Read in my room
before you go to bed.

142
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:49,683
You don't read,
so sleep in their room.

143
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,610
I said no.

144
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:54,390
-Fuck!
-Anton, watch your mouth!

145
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,376
I'll see to it.

146
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:59,703
If you want,
you can go to Rome instead of me.

147
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,289
Take Mum while
I mind your kids.

148
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,282
A 12-hour coach journey?
No way.

149
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,617
No one made you go.

150
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,124
Hi, doggies.

151
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,134
The kittens! The kittens! The kittens!

152
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,503
We're off to Mrs Jégo's.

153
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:22,014
To see her kittens.

154
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,058
-Don't bring one back!
-Your bag's on your bed.

155
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,455
-Where's Frédérique?
-Upstairs with Gulven and Elise.

156
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,593
Wait for us, boys!

157
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,158
Shit!

158
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,088
Drowning or burial.

159
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:22,564
What'll I tell the kids?
They'll look everywhere.

160
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,904
Cremation.

161
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:28,579
It's crazy
you can't even keep a bird alive.

162
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,177
What do you mean?

163
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,765
The thing was already half-dead.

164
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,507
I'm not touching it.
Black bird, evil spirit.

165
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,119
I can see to it.

166
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:46,480
Mind if we keep this in the family?

167
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:53,649
We're losing a bird
and, above all, a game of Cranium.

168
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,554
Want to climb up?

169
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,069
Don't move.

170
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,617
It's the tale
of a poor and hideous woman

171
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:08,085
with a daughter your age,
Augustine.

172
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,198
Her husband had abandoned her

173
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:12,597
to sail the seven seas

174
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,250
and she found herself
with no food to eat.

175
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,872
So she made a pact
with the devil.

176
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:22,257
She offered him her child
in return for some gold coins.

177
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:27,027
Lucifer accepted
and put a handful of gold coins

178
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,432
-on the rim of the spring.
-What's the rim?

179
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,721
The rim is the stone edge
where Augustine is sitting.

180
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:37,847
So the devil grabbed the child
to carry her off.

181
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:42,805
But when the woman tried
to pick up the coins from the stone,

182
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:46,074
-she burnt her hands horribly.
-Why?

183
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:49,786
Because the coins
came from the flames of hell.

184
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:53,466
Trust the devil
to play a trick like that.

185
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,205
With a cry, the poor woman
dropped the coveted gold

186
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:04,058
and the coins lodged forever
in the granite of the rim.

187
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:06,179
She had lost everything:

188
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:08,195
the gold and her child.

189
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:12,767
-Are the coins still here?
-Yes, they're still here.

190
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,540
Wet the rim to see them.
There are 14.

191
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,233
Want to try?
Step back.

192
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:32,967
-See them?
-No.

193
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:35,268
You need to wet it a bit more.

194
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:44,200
Can we see anything?

195
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,219
At the bottom, maybe.

196
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:50,509
Charge!

197
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,510
You're back already?

198
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:57,708
-Pretty kittens?
-Not great, except a ginger one.

199
00:14:57,904 --> 00:14:59,465
-The ginger's one are rare.
-We're looking for gold coins.

200
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:01,355
-What coins?
-The devil's.

201
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:03,469
-Was he sweet?
-Yes.

202
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,421
You're going back there?

203
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:09,131
-We'll take it back to Paris?
-Maybe, if you really want to.

204
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,488
-You're not getting a cat?
-Hurry before she gives it away!

205
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,091
Come on, you slowcoaches!

206
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:05,947
Shit! Use the lock!

207
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:07,190
Sorry.

208
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:10,517
-Can I do my teeth?
-Of course.

209
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:27,546
How long have you been with Gulven?

210
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,324
-Seven months exactly.
-Not bad.

211
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,810
So, how do you find my parents?

212
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:37,343
Well, a little...

213
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,739
-a little cold.
-Cold?

214
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:45,019
I'd have picked
any adjective but "cold".

215
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:46,684
They're not at all cold.

216
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:49,822
They have failings, true.
But cold?

217
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:55,301
Shit, you've got a nerve!
You started without me!

218
00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:00,581
You know the beginning is what
I like in sex but look at you...

219
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,983
Your scars still really show.

220
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,219
I'm proud of them.
Here and here...

221
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,162
And, sister dear,
it's something I share with Elise.

222
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:11,560
She had pneumothorax too.

223
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:13,866
Show her your scars.

224
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,555
It's ok, Gulven.

225
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,059
-Show her your scars!
-No.

226
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,016
Can't you wait until I get out
before you strip?

227
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:27,822
You miss it, don't you,
you raunchy mama...

228
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:29,958
A man's body against yours...

229
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,720
Move, stupid!

230
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,345
You smell of sex!
You smell of worn-out old sex.

231
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,115
-You're not asleep, José?
-No.

232
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:06,515
You had a nightmare?

233
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,534
You've done a pee?

234
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,553
Are you nuts?

235
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,242
Coming for a smoke?

236
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:28,727
I don't want a sister.

237
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,703
You won't get one
if you don't want one.

238
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:56,312
Hail, Mary, full of grace...

239
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,270
Your feet are wrinkled.

240
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,824
-The Lord is with thee...
-What are you doing?

241
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:07,648
Resisting my anti-Christian approach
to popular art?

242
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,284
No, please, don't smile.

243
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,667
This house teems
with permanently smiling people

244
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:20,134
who don't need your blessing,
believe me.

245
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:56,463
I want to die.

246
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,851
Don't say that.

247
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,857
I know you don't
love me anymore.

248
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:16,625
Who is it then? Armel?

249
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,575
I do love you.

250
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:20,561
You make my life hell.

251
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,317
I'm ashamed of us.

252
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,241
You try to make me flee you.

253
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,886
What do you see in a guy
called Armel?

254
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,567
-He lent me a book.
-A guy lends you books.

255
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:35,117
This is absurd.
I can borrow books from people.

256
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,223
Even in Iran women
can borrow books.

257
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:41,138
Sometimes I wonder if this kid is mine.

258
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:46,612
Stupid! Get out! Get out!

259
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,647
Look at this. Six weeks old.

260
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:56,121
Beautiful.

261
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:59,741
-Hi.
-Hi.

262
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:04,093
-Ok?
-And you?

263
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,075
Your cat pissed
by the fridge.

264
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:11,613
Where is it?

265
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,011
They're all down at the lock.

266
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,932
Not the best place for a cat.

267
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:17,951
Anton doesn't agree.

268
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:19,706
Couldn't anyone stop him?

269
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,402
Can't you eat quietly?

270
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,942
"Puss in Boots" at 6 a.m.
may not be good for my pregnancy.

271
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,799
Augustine was up.

272
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,867
She can't decide
when the whole house wakes.

273
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,405
Mum was already up packing.

274
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,671
Your kids tyrannize you, you know.

275
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:50,781
I'm dumb, I have to be.

276
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:53,155
Mothers are stupid brainless cows,

277
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:56,418
except for you, of course,
you're perfect.

278
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,616
I'm just saying
they take advantage of you.

279
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:03,712
Have you ever analysed
"they take advantage of you"?

280
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,433
You play the tough guy
by making your heart arid.

281
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:10,978
A tough guy? Me?
You've totally lost it.

282
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,744
Honestly...

283
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:15,811
Six months ago,
you were a wreck, now you lecture me?

284
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,567
Hurry, girls, it's eleven-thirty.

285
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:22,115
You know we're eating at twelve.
We leave at three!

286
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,141
-Who'll get the bread?
-I'll go.

287
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,147
You're not washed.
Frédérique...

288
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,516
Don't ask her,
I said I'll go.

289
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:31,371
At least comb your hair.

290
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:55,889
I'm the old mother rabbit
of Guerlédan...

291
00:22:56,086 --> 00:23:00,080
I have nothing to eat...
My tummy's empty.

292
00:23:00,343 --> 00:23:03,026
I fancy eating some nice fish.

293
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:08,113
Or, if not, I could eat children
who stink of fish!

294
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:10,003
We don't smell of fish!

295
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,576
Why are you here?

296
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,039
-Hello.
-Hello, Nigel. Why are you here?

297
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,271
Your mother summoned me.

298
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:17,903
No way!

299
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,792
Mummy!

300
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,074
Can you put me down?

301
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,668
What's Nigel doing
in your garden?

302
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,800
I invite whom
I want to my home.

303
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:42,079
Bread, Mummy...

304
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:52,737
-Go outside.
-Not too much. Lunch is in five minutes.

305
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,840
You think you're clever?

306
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:58,654
I offered the house to Nigel
while we're in Rome.

307
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:00,957
He needs to see his children.

308
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,163
And you need to stir up the shit!

309
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:06,911
You have an interview
with your sister's boss on Tuesday.

310
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:11,647
You can fill in at the bookstore
during her maternity leave.

311
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:16,994
Focus on yourself, Léna.
Only on yourself.

312
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:20,352
You're both crazy.

313
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:22,658
Don't be silly,
we sorted it all out.

314
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:25,607
Hide these fast.
It's not the season.

315
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:28,801
I don't want them!
I'm too busy to gut them now!

316
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,548
Nigel can grill them tonight
as a treat for the kids.

317
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:35,910
-Just put them in the bin!
-Take me to the station.

318
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:38,440
-Operation Evacuation?
-Discreetly.

319
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:41,222
You can't.
Our coach leaves at three.

320
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,552
Tell your grandkids
you threw their mother out.

321
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:47,812
You always complicate things.

322
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,188
I'll get the car keys.
I'll wait for you outside.

323
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:53,764
Can you get my bag?
In case I bump into the kids...

324
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:59,399
When are you going to grow up?

325
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,737
We can't talk about this, Mum.

326
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,726
You've always sided with Nigel,

327
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,414
with order.

328
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:07,757
You have such a poor imagination.

329
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:10,606
-Ever heard of altruism?
-Shut up!

330
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:12,329
Stay for lunch.

331
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:15,314
If it's too tough,
leave when we do.

332
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:19,731
If I leave, I leave now.
If not, I go with the kids.

333
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,549
Here.

334
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:29,138
-You don't know what you want.
-I do.

335
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,633
I want you to be happy.

336
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:34,870
Let me know
if your coach misses a bend.

337
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:00,087
Your wife's a real bitch.

338
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,981
She told me something
she found funny.

339
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,379
She said it after I complained.

340
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:11,957
She told me
I reminded her of a hyena.

341
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,982
Pull over, please.

342
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:16,764
-You want to pee?
-Pull over.

343
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:35,808
Frankly, the hyena isn't
the nicest animal in Africa.

344
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:37,914
Or anywhere else, in fact.

345
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:41,664
I thanked her for her bitchy remark.
"What bitchy remark?"

346
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:45,059
"What you just said,
calling me a hyena."

347
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:49,694
She started sighing.
A very demonstrative sigh.

348
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:52,863
Then she said she found it amusing.

349
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:55,880
I answered that I found it mean
rather than amusing

350
00:26:56,073 --> 00:27:02,053
and so I was wondering
why she was being so mean to me.

351
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:05,219
She hesitated before answering,

352
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,544
as if she were asking herself if the time
had come to tell me the whole truth

353
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,747
-or not.
-What truth?

354
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:14,756
That she doesn't love me.

355
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,340
I don't need you confiding in me.

356
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:21,576
-Besides, I'm not interested.
-Let me finish the hyena story.

357
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:26,184
She hesitates and that's when
I make the mistake of smiling,

358
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:30,574
a faint smile, but a smile even so
expressing complicity, sharing...

359
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:33,639
She withdraws into her shell
and simply says,

360
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:37,803
"Hyenas lurk near corpses
they haven't had the guts to kill.

361
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:40,653
"You're like them.
I feel you lurking."

362
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,989
Lights out, good night.

363
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:44,911
I don't understand!

364
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:47,791
She isn't saying I lurk.
That's absurd.

365
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:51,502
She's saying I don't have the guts
to end it between us.

366
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,326
She's saying I won't leave.

367
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:55,946
-She thinks...
-Enough, Mathias!

368
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:57,807
I'm willing to help, but not now.

369
00:27:58,006 --> 00:28:01,105
Just answer one question for me.
Just one. Ok?

370
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:03,158
Answer me yes or no.

371
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:05,970
Has she said she's seeing
another guy?

372
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,865
What's going on?

373
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,264
Mathias was showing me something.

374
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:28,468
Gran said you'd
gone back to Paris.

375
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,492
She was wrong.
Don't worry.

376
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:32,595
I'm not worried.
When do you leave?

377
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:35,099
-I'm here.
-Thank you, dear.

378
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:37,400
Here comes my most beautiful child!

379
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,573
What are you up to now, Lena?

380
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,847
And Augustine?

381
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:44,317
She's eating with José

382
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:48,126
-so she can have a nap during our lunch.
-She gave up naps two years ago.

383
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:52,638
Forgot something?

384
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,623
Ah, Léna just the woman.

385
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:59,457
Under friendly but firm duress
I've offered Nigel my room

386
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,427
since it's geographically closer
to your offspring.

387
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,115
I don't want this to prevent me

388
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:08,164
from testifying against him

389
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:11,140
during your divorce proceedings.
Sorry, Nigel...

390
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,563
I forbid you to joke
about my divorce, ok?

391
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:16,613
-Yes.
-Relax, Léna.

392
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,316
Mummy!

393
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:22,846
Is it good, sweetheart?

394
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,336
How could you?

395
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:28,293
It seemed a good idea.

396
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,532
Michel!

397
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,015
The pregnant one...

398
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:27,826
No, Frédérique, my second daughter.
My grandchildren...

399
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:29,451
Frédérique!

400
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:55,764
Mrs Roland...

401
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,006
Shit, it's scary...
They're all so old!

402
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,517
No older than Dad and Mum.

403
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:13,600
I hope I die first.

404
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:16,608
Don't be so dumb,
they'll have a great time.

405
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,940
Can't you be negative for once?

406
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:33,091
Honey...

407
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,896
We're waiting for you.

408
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,424
Mind driving us to the station?

409
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:49,478
Of course not. When?

410
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:51,495
-The 7 p.m. train?
-Yes.

411
00:31:51,688 --> 00:31:54,591
-Coming back with us?
-No, I'll stay a bit.

412
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,898
-You'll miss that interview.
-I won't.

413
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,429
Just say so.

414
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:04,512
-I don't need the hassle.
-I'll get the 10:20 train.

415
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:09,286
-If Nigel will drive me there.
-No problem.

416
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,785
What about Elise and Gulven?

417
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,072
They're staying till Tuesday.
Then they're off to a rock festival.

418
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,506
-Can I tell them?
-Yes.

419
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:20,262
Elise will give me her hand.

420
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:22,916
We're getting married!

421
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:25,989
Why are you the only one
who still plays with dolls?

422
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:30,153
-Back off! Congratulate him!
-Congratulate him for what?

423
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:32,394
I forbid you to get married!

424
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:35,496
Excuse her, Gulven.
It's her hormones!

425
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:40,428
Right...

426
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:43,753
Let's calm down.
They won't get married.

427
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:45,615
Are you crazy?

428
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,447
You close it up like
a retirement home!

429
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,976
-Where are you going?
-For a drink.

430
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:54,236
-I'll be gone later.
-Ok, kisses.

431
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:55,841
Have a safe trip.

432
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,984
-Ok, honey?
-Hit the road, Jack.

433
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:08,866
It's this one. It has your name on it
but I don't understand it.

434
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,191
-Where's it from?
-Gulven found it.

435
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:15,261
He wanted Elise
to hear the family hymns.

436
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:19,650
"Without moving but with the intensity
of his gaze..."

437
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:29,767
We're only making plans for Nigel,

438
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:36,165
We only want what's best for him

439
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,946
Wer're only making plans for Nigel,

440
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:48,387
Nigel just needs this helping hand

441
00:34:52,142 --> 00:34:56,366
And if young Nigel says he's happy,
He must be, he must be.

442
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,201
He must be happy in his work.

443
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:26,643
And if young Nigel says he's happy,
He must be happy..

444
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:28,365
Excuse me.

445
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:36,721
I can't talk now.
We're putting the kids to bed.

446
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:40,756
I'll call you after I drive Léna
to the station.

447
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:47,634
Kids, say goodbye to your mother.

448
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:55,061
We need to get to the station.

449
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,690
I've changed my mind.

450
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:58,966
I'll stay a day or two,

451
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:01,719
in total harmony,
unless your slut spoils it.

452
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:04,918
-You're staying, Mum?
-What do you mean?

453
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,314
Your mother asked meto
look after our kids

454
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:11,708
because you need to retrain
as a book-seller.

455
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,357
So?

456
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,147
I work from time to time,
you know.

457
00:36:17,345 --> 00:36:21,470
I try not to show it but, all the same,
don't push me too far.

458
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:24,634
A holiday with my ex-wife
at her parents'...

459
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:27,169
-I'm not ready.
-Sorry.

460
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:29,730
I thought you came
because you missed the kids.

461
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,581
The kids, yes.

462
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,690
You're the one pretending
nothing has changed!

463
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:50,117
-You wear me out!
-You're right.

464
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:52,581
I must be mad.
Good for the asylum!

465
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:55,744
-Don't act neurotic.
-You think I'm neurotic?

466
00:36:56,296 --> 00:37:00,422
The hysterical mother,
with her clutches, her fatal embraces.

467
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,690
<i>Anton and Aug
need a week away from you.</i>

468
00:37:04,043 --> 00:37:06,084
Create a little distance.

469
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:08,292
I'm an irresponsible mother?

470
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:10,859
I never called you irresponsible.

471
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:13,387
You mix everything up.

472
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:16,265
You're dishonest, Léna.

473
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:20,423
-Scared and dishonest.
-Right, I'm out of here.

474
00:37:20,623 --> 00:37:23,819
You asked to be alone with the kids
until the divorce.

475
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:26,536
So you could live out
your shitty affair!

476
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:29,868
Six months without seeing them.
It was sick but I kept quiet!

477
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:32,716
I intend to make
the most of this week.

478
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:35,183
Why did you have to come here?

479
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,166
You get two days
with them next week.

480
00:37:37,362 --> 00:37:39,534
How fucking generous! Two days!

481
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:47,148
Get dressed, Anton.

482
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:49,452
Come on, sweetheart.

483
00:37:49,653 --> 00:37:51,825
Daddy's driving us
to the station.

484
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:54,443
-We're going home.
-Isn't it bedtime?

485
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:57,962
Hurry up. Put your things
in your backpack.

486
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:02,357
We've had enough slamming doors today.
I'll split instead.

487
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:08,497
I'm sorry kids.

488
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:10,584
It's your mother's call.

489
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:17,556
What do we do?

490
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:21,683
We don't move.

491
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:56,158
Can you still
hear me after that?

492
00:38:56,355 --> 00:39:01,277
Now then, this gun dates from 1849.
1849, does that ring a bell?

493
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,752
No? All right...

494
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:07,105
It was the battle that pitched Garibaldi
against the French.

495
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:11,076
Any more and I'll kill that old bat
with eternal stones.

496
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,824
Run, you idiot,
or they'll see us!

497
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,910
We'll have a wonderful view
of St Peter's

498
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,633
and a surprise awaits us:
a lighthouse.

499
00:39:30,026 --> 00:39:31,880
Tell me words of love.

500
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:33,765
In Italian or in French?

501
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:38,241
I don't care. I need
a little sentimentality, darling.

502
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:45,129
What does that mean?

503
00:39:45,325 --> 00:39:47,846
You're most impolite,
young lady,

504
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:50,250
to demand sweet nothings like that

505
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,867
and reckless to arouse a man like me

506
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:55,078
in an almost deserted park.

507
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:56,938
"Stronzo"!

508
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:14,030
I hug you in my two arms.

509
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:19,663
And I want to flee with you,
my love.

510
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:29,265
I don't want to die, you know.

511
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,224
I can't feel my right
cheek anymore.

512
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,618
The neurologist warned us.

513
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:53,495
Facial paralysis,
diminished eyesight...

514
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:57,779
-We aren't there yet.
-It looks as if we are.

515
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,696
Let's not panic.

516
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:04,182
Maybe it's temporary.
Want to see a doctor here?

517
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:06,324
No, there's no sense in it.
It won't help.

518
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:09,047
I have all the medication I need.

519
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,937
-What are you doing?
-Calling the kids.

520
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:17,472
I don't want you telling them!

521
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:23,452
Frédérique first.

522
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:27,770
Her answering machine, of course.

523
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:31,008
It's Mum.

524
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,278
A quick hello from Rome

525
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:35,682
to tell you that it's sunny

526
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:39,675
and that Dad and I
are going to live here till we die.

527
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,045
No, I was tidying up.

528
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:48,582
I never said I'd repaint
their room.

529
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:50,816
So what do you want?
Good.

530
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:54,469
No, I'm not going.

531
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:57,125
Because I'm in Guerlédan.

532
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,542
Nigel has left.

533
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:03,331
None of your business.

534
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:05,768
I don't want to talk about it.

535
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,107
Well...

536
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,083
I have to go and do the shopping.

537
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:15,044
Give Dad my love.

538
00:42:32,624 --> 00:42:35,046
Want to talk about it?

539
00:42:38,226 --> 00:42:41,609
You just feel weepy
or is it worse?

540
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:53,040
<i>You've reached Frédérique and Mathias.
Leave us a message.</i>

541
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,028
<i>Frédérique, it's me again.
Call me as soon as you can.</i>

542
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:02,125
<i>Léna's in Guerlédan.
I just spoke to her.</i>

543
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,750
What's wrong?

544
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:08,848
Nothing.

545
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:12,465
I'm ok, sweetheart.
Want to go to the park with Dad?

546
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:15,921
Yeah, okay.

547
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:20,630
Don't shout, Mum.
I told you your voice is amplified.

548
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:24,144
It's their problem, Mum.
Yes, I'll talk to her.

549
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,804
Remember to get me a gondola.

550
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:29,811
No gondolas in Rome?

551
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,842
Ok, have fun and take care.
Anton sends his love.

552
00:43:35,038 --> 00:43:36,827
Give her a kiss.

553
00:43:37,023 --> 00:43:38,812
Goodbye, madam.

554
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:43,477
You made our old mum
cry again?

555
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:47,328
She loves it.

556
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,600
I still want to be
an anaesthetist.

557
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:14,218
-You can't be now.
-You're wrong.

558
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,803
Since going on leave,
I haven't contacted the hospital.

559
00:45:18,004 --> 00:45:20,176
But they'll end up firing you.

560
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:23,537
-I'll do something else.
-Simon!

561
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,477
-Good to see you!
-I saw you this morning.

562
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:34,128
You're right!
You know my big brother, Simon.

563
00:45:37,912 --> 00:45:42,321
I made good time. I was thinking...
Do you have hens here?

564
00:45:42,521 --> 00:45:44,049
-Gulven?
-Yes?

565
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,552
Can you come with me? Excuse us.

566
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:48,340
Be right back.

567
00:45:55,227 --> 00:45:57,563
I'm not stupid, ok.

568
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:00,889
-What?
-Why did you invite Simon?

569
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,805
I didn't think you'd mind.

570
00:46:03,006 --> 00:46:05,495
He's on his way to the festival.

571
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:08,564
-Well, I do mind!
-You've met him before.

572
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,556
Thank you, I remember.

573
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:12,442
What's the problem?

574
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:18,529
At my move, Simon stayed
to assemble the furniture.

575
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:20,994
That was kind of him.

576
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:26,270
It took forever to get rid of him.

577
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:27,711
No...

578
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,355
Wait...
I didn't know.

579
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:34,338
He knows.
I don't need this kind of trap.

580
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:38,045
We'll have dinner,
then he'll leave tomorrow.

581
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:40,035
You're too silly, Gulven!

582
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,679
How many people will
you send packing?

583
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:45,892
My life pisses you off!

584
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:47,648
The way I think pisses you off.

585
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,149
-I should just vanish for good.
-I never said that.

586
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:52,287
That's exactly
what you just said.

587
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:54,049
And you're probably right.

588
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:55,842
-Get lost!
-You get lost!

589
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:57,543
Asshole!

590
00:46:57,737 --> 00:46:58,948
Loser.

591
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:05,257
-What's wrong?
-She's completely mad.

592
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:17,036
Good morning

593
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:18,407
Good morning.

594
00:47:44,052 --> 00:47:46,573
I didn't mean to stir up the shit.

595
00:47:46,772 --> 00:47:48,234
Not you!

596
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:50,771
I'll find a hotel
nearby and split.

597
00:47:51,253 --> 00:47:54,188
Thanks for making me
look like a hysteric.

598
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:57,711
I was glad to see you.

599
00:47:58,551 --> 00:48:00,656
It was an opportunity.

600
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,027
Wait there,
I'll get changed.

601
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:12,310
Let's hide.

602
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:19,209
Hold on...

603
00:48:27,953 --> 00:48:29,808
You're too much.

604
00:48:34,192 --> 00:48:36,133
Give me a second chance.

605
00:48:36,335 --> 00:48:37,710
It's as simple...

606
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,895
-It's as simple as that?
-No, it's not simple.

607
00:48:45,711 --> 00:48:48,046
Léna, you never called me.

608
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:53,390
You never sent a sign via my sister.
It's not simple.

609
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,102
Goddammit,
I don't fall in love often!

610
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,247
Sorry, I'm getting carried away
but I can't help believing in it.

611
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:09,643
-There was no reason to.
-Sorry, there was.

612
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,108
You kissed really well

613
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,985
and you seemed to want it too.

614
00:49:16,558 --> 00:49:19,374
It doesn't matter
nothing happened.

615
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,790
You're mad at me
because it didn't?

616
00:49:24,783 --> 00:49:26,091
What was I supposed to do?

617
00:49:26,287 --> 00:49:29,220
You strip, you strip me,
but then forbid me to touch you.

618
00:49:30,448 --> 00:49:33,130
-I don't know why I scare you.
-You don't.

619
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:38,213
Go out to dinner
and leave me with the kids.

620
00:49:38,414 --> 00:49:42,157
Afterwards, I'll be in bed.
And, tomorrow, you'll leave.

621
00:50:02,894 --> 00:50:04,453
I'm scared.

622
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:07,783
Hold on.

623
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:09,508
Don't panic.

624
00:50:27,118 --> 00:50:28,775
What are you doing?

625
00:50:28,972 --> 00:50:31,078
I can't read in our room.
Aug's sleeping

626
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:33,448
Think it's smart
hiding here to read?

627
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:35,533
Hiding?
The house isn't far.

628
00:50:35,725 --> 00:50:36,969
Let's go back.

629
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:39,718
Let me read you a story.

630
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,515
Anton...

631
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:43,619
Please.

632
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,233
Tell me on the way back, ok?

633
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,257
Ok.

634
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:53,669
It's the story of Katell Gollet,

635
00:50:53,868 --> 00:50:56,552
which means Katell the Lost.

636
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:59,399
She was beautiful
and lived with her father.

637
00:51:00,268 --> 00:51:04,360
Her beauty was matched
only by her perversity.

638
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:06,439
What does that mean?

639
00:51:06,636 --> 00:51:09,058
She loved dancing and debauchery.

640
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,107
So her father wanted
to marry her off.

641
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,904
But Katell had no desire
to shorten her youth with marriage.

642
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,661
So she told her father,

643
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,576
"When I find
"a handsome partner able to dance

644
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:23,909
<i>"for twelve hours with me,</i>

645
00:51:24,108 --> 00:51:26,495
<i>he'll win my heart and my hand."</i>

646
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:04,261
<i>Many young men try their luck.</i>

647
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,846
<i>But Katell rejects them all one by one.</i>

648
00:52:10,218 --> 00:52:13,927
<i>Soon, it is Minek's turn
to dance for Katell.</i>

649
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:17,761
<i>He is 17,
with bright blue eyes.</i>

650
00:52:29,706 --> 00:52:33,699
<i>Like the other boys, 650
Minek knows her bad reputation.</i>

651
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:37,826
<i>People say she's dissolute
and unable to love.</i>

652
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:40,808
<i>Even so,
Minek falls in love with her.</i>

653
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:43,457
<i>Since he is handsome
and a good dancer,</i>

654
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:46,079
<i>she takes him to the local fête.</i>

655
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,833
<i>Before marrying him,</i>

656
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:52,994
<i>she wants to see
if he can make her dance for hours.</i>

657
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:56,705
<i>The procession climbs a hill
to the fête.</i>

658
00:52:57,512 --> 00:53:00,578
<i>At the head,
four nubile women</i>

659
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,785
<i>bear a statue of the Virgin.</i>

660
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:23,364
<i>Katell has told her father
she wants to come by cart.</i>

661
00:53:23,562 --> 00:53:26,943
<i>On reaching the top,
she leads Minek over to the singers.</i>

662
00:53:27,145 --> 00:53:30,821
<i>She starts the celebration
before the priest says mass.</i>

663
01:01:09,115 --> 01:01:12,245
Hello. I'm looking
for my sister, Léna.

664
01:01:12,442 --> 01:01:15,738
She's downstairs waiting for you.
Through here...

665
01:01:20,603 --> 01:01:22,163
-Enjoy lunch.
-See you later.

666
01:01:22,364 --> 01:01:23,290
Be back by 2.

667
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:26,548
It's as cold as a fridge in there.

668
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:31,503
I see the link
between undertakers and florists now.

669
01:01:31,705 --> 01:01:33,778
She keeps the air-con on?

670
01:01:33,979 --> 01:01:36,247
Does she pay you decently?

671
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,320
It keeps the flowers fresh.

672
01:01:39,515 --> 01:01:44,183
Otherwise, the answers are:
Yes, no and yes.

673
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:48,377
-I wouldn't last a day.
-Good, because I work there.

674
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,064
I didn't mean that.

675
01:01:50,266 --> 01:01:51,640
You did.

676
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:53,715
Are we going far?

677
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:55,090
A little bit.

678
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,046
Just across the park.
It's full of flowers.

679
01:01:57,242 --> 01:01:58,703
I know, flowers...

680
01:01:58,905 --> 01:02:00,814
You're obsessed, aren't you?

681
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,636
What are the flowers
supposed to hide?

682
01:02:04,184 --> 01:02:05,493
Don't be fucking nosy.

683
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,892
Vulgarity doesn't suit you.

684
01:02:08,088 --> 01:02:11,701
"Marry fashion and you'll soon
be widowed," Cromwell said.

685
01:02:12,121 --> 01:02:13,430
Cromwell?

686
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:16,921
The English guy with the round hat
and puritan views.

687
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:19,088
I'm considering divorce.

688
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:22,165
I'm...

689
01:02:22,938 --> 01:02:26,253
I'm sick of his jealousy
and his mediocrity.

690
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:29,617
Divorce, it sounds odd,

691
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:32,664
like talking
about someone else.

692
01:02:39,225 --> 01:02:43,414
After our so-called honeymoon
in Annecy, I told myself:

693
01:02:43,608 --> 01:02:45,910
real life will never begin.

694
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:47,927
I didn't really care.

695
01:02:48,153 --> 01:02:50,518
Focusing on work passes the time.

696
01:02:50,712 --> 01:02:52,371
It's taken me 10 years.

697
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:54,096
I have no illusions now.

698
01:02:54,297 --> 01:02:56,946
Loving but lucid.
That's my untenable motto.

699
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:02,997
You already had someone last summer...
Have you told Mum?

700
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:04,437
No.

701
01:03:05,144 --> 01:03:07,827
-When will you tell her?
-Later.

702
01:03:08,023 --> 01:03:10,063
I'll let her savour
your divorce first.

703
01:03:13,848 --> 01:03:16,914
-Who is he?
-Please. That's not really the issue.

704
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:19,598
It is. For me it is.

705
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:23,115
It hurts me here.
I feel betrayed.

706
01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:25,523
Don't you always
feel betrayed?

707
01:03:25,721 --> 01:03:26,931
What?

708
01:03:27,128 --> 01:03:29,679
You're not always
the one who's hurt.

709
01:03:29,878 --> 01:03:32,335
You think you're
alert and attentive

710
01:03:32,535 --> 01:03:35,883
but you'd be surprised
by what goes on in front of you.

711
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:39,598
What are you trying to imply?

712
01:03:50,711 --> 01:03:52,532
You haven't eaten.

713
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:37,906
NOTORlOUS

714
01:04:55,252 --> 01:04:57,325
Your sister's very friendly.

715
01:04:57,524 --> 01:05:02,064
She gives off a form of energy.
I love that kind of attitude.

716
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,108
-Is she much older?
-I'm the older one.

717
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,275
I'd never have guessed.

718
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:12,204
We've just had an order for a delivery
to the cemetery.

719
01:05:12,403 --> 01:05:14,192
-I'll let you go.
-To the cemetery?

720
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:15,881
Yes, of course.

721
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:19,980
The family wants the bouquet
to be there by five.

722
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:23,475
I'm thinking of something...
a little wild,

723
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:25,228
a little bushy.

724
01:05:25,428 --> 01:05:29,006
Do I have to? I'm going
to the wholesale market tomorrow.

725
01:05:29,204 --> 01:05:32,335
Sorry, Léna, I don't want to know.

726
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,658
Just manage. I warned you
that this job could be tough.

727
01:05:37,076 --> 01:05:39,978
I know but today
I have to pick up my kids.

728
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,522
I thought I'd be gone by four.

729
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:47,538
I know. A month from now
they'll have the flu,

730
01:05:47,731 --> 01:05:52,107
epidemics, chickenpox, head lice,
holidays every other week...

731
01:05:52,308 --> 01:05:54,728
Don't tell me about
your children.

732
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,840
I hate children!

733
01:05:57,492 --> 01:06:02,161
I'm the only person for miles who
doesn't ant to hear about children.

734
01:06:02,357 --> 01:06:03,816
Sorry.

735
01:06:04,146 --> 01:06:06,415
You swore I'd never
know their names.

736
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:08,269
<i>Anton and Augustine.</i>

737
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:16,268
Nigel?

738
01:06:16,466 --> 01:06:17,993
It's me.

739
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,716
We had a shrike.
Have you ever had one?

740
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,402
A strike is worth
a trip to the park.

741
01:06:27,602 --> 01:06:29,991
-What was it for?
-I can't go to the park,

742
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,820
I have loads of homework.

743
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:45,353
Yes?

744
01:06:45,553 --> 01:06:47,212
What do you mean, no key?

745
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:49,133
Anton has one on a string.

746
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:51,370
He forgot it? I don't believe it!

747
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:54,353
Are you ganging up
to make my life hell?

748
01:06:54,547 --> 01:06:56,487
Work something out!

749
01:07:14,482 --> 01:07:16,652
It's easy without a key.

750
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:18,791
You're a right little bandit!

751
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,278
No, no television!

752
01:07:24,178 --> 01:07:26,827
Mum says we must adapt
to anything:

753
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:29,446
-life is just anything.
-She should know.

754
01:07:29,648 --> 01:07:32,682
Life's like that
when you do just anything.

755
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,156
<i>"What any visitor
would have seen</i>

756
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,172
"was a string..."

757
01:08:23,472 --> 01:08:25,512
Eating here?

758
01:08:25,712 --> 01:08:28,297
Unless you're expecting someone.
Have you eaten?

759
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,982
Please,
don't overdo the generosity.

760
01:08:31,184 --> 01:08:33,571
This is already
humiliating enough.

761
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:35,847
It's as if we weren't divorced.

762
01:08:37,231 --> 01:08:40,907
We've been to court, shit!
It's as if that didn't count.

763
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:46,915
As if it didn't exist.
You're here, totally at home...

764
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:50,468
Forgive me for making dinner
and looking after the kids.

765
01:08:51,246 --> 01:08:54,759
Who called me? Who had a delivery?
Who forgot the key?

766
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:57,347
You had no food.
I've done two washes!

767
01:08:57,551 --> 01:09:00,648
No one asked you to.
You do it to piss me off!

768
01:09:01,389 --> 01:09:03,877
I won't pay for the slightest favour.

769
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:05,965
"I've done this, you owe me that."

770
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:10,889
Admit you're a selfish asshole
and I'd recognize your talents.

771
01:09:13,325 --> 01:09:15,716
Ok, I'm out of here.

772
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:18,918
I'm not asking you to leave.
Have dinner with me.

773
01:09:29,868 --> 01:09:32,289
I know this is kind of you but...

774
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:37,637
Forgive me,
a demon was talking through me.

775
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:43,179
I had a vision of our lives earlier:
two tiny mounds of mud.

776
01:09:50,509 --> 01:09:53,127
You can't make bouquets all your life.

777
01:09:55,629 --> 01:09:57,963
You can be so excessive...

778
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:00,427
-Aren't you tired of it?
-I've never been excessive.

779
01:10:02,252 --> 01:10:04,074
Always criticizing...

780
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:06,248
It's a passion.

781
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,821
But that's why I love you.

782
01:10:12,108 --> 01:10:14,628
How's Myriam?
You're still together?

783
01:10:16,683 --> 01:10:20,481
I know, you can love two women.
It's different.

784
01:10:20,685 --> 01:10:22,855
I'm a fool to think otherwise.

785
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,960
I know that, but too bad.

786
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:31,402
The idiot is sick of your hypocrisy,
common sense, wisdom, concessions,

787
01:10:31,596 --> 01:10:33,766
modernity...
I'm old-fashioned!

788
01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:52,737
I can't manage anymore, Nigel.

789
01:10:57,578 --> 01:10:59,007
I'm here.

790
01:10:59,562 --> 01:11:02,530
No, you're not.
And that's only natural.

791
01:11:03,787 --> 01:11:06,404
Why can't I manage when others do?

792
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,247
You're not doing so badly.

793
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:13,031
Stop worrying about yourself.

794
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:21,159
If you dare to say this is a good time
to have sex, I'll murder you.

795
01:11:27,402 --> 01:11:29,312
You should get an au pair.

796
01:11:29,514 --> 01:11:31,750
-With what money?
-Mine.

797
01:11:31,947 --> 01:11:34,979
I'd rather have sex
than touch your money.

798
01:11:35,179 --> 01:11:37,729
You talk a lot about sex...

799
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:39,970
-Because I'm not getting any.
-Sure.

800
01:11:40,169 --> 01:11:41,795
Believe what you want.

801
01:11:41,993 --> 01:11:45,158
I know other guys screw you
and that kills me.

802
01:11:45,354 --> 01:11:48,582
-It makes me sick imagining you...
-Don't imagine anything.

803
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,941
How are your hospital colleagues?

804
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:56,864
First my sex life, now my colleagues.
You have to be going?

805
01:12:00,873 --> 01:12:02,945
You're an absurd woman, Léna.

806
01:12:03,145 --> 01:12:06,048
I wouldn't trust myself
if I were you.

807
01:12:08,297 --> 01:12:09,605
Well...

808
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:12,294
Get out!

809
01:12:15,466 --> 01:12:18,214
-Let me put my coat on.
-Do that outside.

810
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,452
Stop it!

811
01:12:25,704 --> 01:12:27,645
Don't touch me.

812
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:30,236
-Don't touch me!
-You're hurt...

813
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:32,033
Get out!

814
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:37,855
I don't want to see you again!

815
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:27,717
Anton...

816
01:13:31,272 --> 01:13:33,093
What's wrong?

817
01:13:33,286 --> 01:13:34,780
I fell.

818
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:50,338
Rise and shine, Anton!

819
01:13:50,855 --> 01:13:53,953
It's almost eight!
What are you doing?

820
01:14:01,829 --> 01:14:04,284
Rest, dear,
I'll see to everything.

821
01:14:13,893 --> 01:14:15,836
<i>Do you have to shout like that?</i>

822
01:14:16,037 --> 01:14:19,812
<i>I love saying "rise and shine".
I don't know why.</i>

823
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:22,434
What are they doing?

824
01:14:25,509 --> 01:14:28,258
Think I'll find a washer?

825
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:32,163
I'm no good at relief work.

826
01:14:32,357 --> 01:14:35,204
Stop it.
You're being useful for once.

827
01:14:35,397 --> 01:14:39,194
Look at this... Cat food everywhere!
Disgusting.

828
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:43,489
Where is the damn animal?
With you?

829
01:14:46,788 --> 01:14:48,130
Hello, sweetheart.

830
01:14:48,324 --> 01:14:50,745
Did you sleep well? Sit down.

831
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,788
-Can I have my bottle?
-Eat your cereal!

832
01:14:58,276 --> 01:15:00,446
I have a bottle. It's quicker.

833
01:15:00,644 --> 01:15:03,065
You're too big to play
the baby now!

834
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:06,178
-Mum says...
-She says a lot but doesn't do much.

835
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:09,599
All talk and no action!
No bottles for you.

836
01:15:09,794 --> 01:15:12,545
You'll get duck lips
and buck teeth!

837
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:14,878
You're always mean about Mum.

838
01:15:15,075 --> 01:15:17,977
You come to help
but all you do is criticize.

839
01:15:23,235 --> 01:15:25,340
Catch him!
What are you waiting for?

840
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:27,546
Too late. He knows the way anyhow.

841
01:15:27,746 --> 01:15:29,274
He hasn't eaten a thing.

842
01:15:29,603 --> 01:15:32,898
The world disgusts him.
He'd like to be a Cathar.

843
01:15:33,346 --> 01:15:34,721
What?

844
01:15:34,914 --> 01:15:38,460
The Cathars were always innocent
and always pure.

845
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:41,855
Others wanted to kill them
for showing them up.

846
01:15:55,779 --> 01:15:57,272
I'm going for a walk.

847
01:15:57,923 --> 01:16:00,224
-Can you walk on your own?
-Of course.

848
01:16:00,835 --> 01:16:03,354
-Dad can come.
-Where are you going?

849
01:16:03,555 --> 01:16:06,652
For a walk, on my own.
I won't be long.

850
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:09,184
You haven't had breakfast!

851
01:16:12,482 --> 01:16:13,693
See you later.

852
01:16:15,106 --> 01:16:18,454
She's not 10 anymore,
you can't make her stay in.

853
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:25,752
She's in no state to go out.

854
01:16:33,313 --> 01:16:34,589
Hey!

855
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,892
-Could you get Anton?
-Of course.

856
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,949
-What's wrong?
-You left in a rage this morning?

857
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:05,304
What did they tell you?

858
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:07,892
Can I eat at
the canteen with you?

859
01:17:08,096 --> 01:17:11,162
-I need to talk to you.
-We never talk.

860
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,335
Strangers can't come
to the canteen.

861
01:17:13,536 --> 01:17:16,832
I'm your mother, stupid!
I came here to see you.

862
01:17:17,026 --> 01:17:18,999
You really have a screw loose.

863
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,099
You've grown so big.

864
01:17:23,297 --> 01:17:25,336
See, you've nothing to say to me.

865
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:29,982
Come and meet me after school.
We'll go to the park.

866
01:17:30,176 --> 01:17:33,242
I promise.
I love you so much...

867
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:35,262
You're stressing me.

868
01:17:35,488 --> 01:17:37,080
See you later.

869
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,265
Anton!

870
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:36,376
-What are you doing here?
-Shouldn't I be asking you that?

871
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:40,668
I'm pretty much a regular here now.

872
01:18:40,861 --> 01:18:43,251
That table there gets
a lot of light

873
01:18:43,454 --> 01:18:45,657
and the owner loves me
like his own son.

874
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:47,195
Gérard?

875
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,238
He's doing transference onto me.

876
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:52,186
Does he have children?

877
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:53,941
How are you?

878
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:58,137
-What do you want, darling?
-A shot of whisky.

879
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,926
He calls you darling?

880
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:01,915
Yes, for a long time now.

881
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:04,630
On sunny days,
he kisses me on the lips.

882
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:07,384
The traitor...
Doing that to his own son.

883
01:19:07,903 --> 01:19:09,658
Are you spying on me?

884
01:19:09,853 --> 01:19:12,274
A little.
Are you still a walking wreck?

885
01:19:12,477 --> 01:19:14,070
I need strength.

886
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:16,601
Can I help you?

887
01:19:25,418 --> 01:19:28,735
-What time do you call this?
-Sorry I'm late.

888
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:31,110
-Where's your collar?
-Mom...

889
01:19:31,307 --> 01:19:33,696
-There's someone with me.
-Hi.

890
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,720
-Good night.
-Are you eating here?

891
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:38,468
How damn elegant!
No, he'll watch us.

892
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:40,390
Quiet, the kids are asleep.

893
01:19:40,587 --> 01:19:42,015
Anton was wiped out.

894
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:45,032
You've been letting him
stay up too late.

895
01:19:45,226 --> 01:19:47,397
His pyjamajacket is torn.

896
01:19:47,594 --> 01:19:49,699
Thanks for the advice.

897
01:19:50,058 --> 01:19:54,280
-Sorry, this is all I have.
-It's fine. I love Bart Simpson.

898
01:19:58,825 --> 01:20:00,484
I smell burning.

899
01:20:07,273 --> 01:20:08,614
Ooh!

900
01:20:12,362 --> 01:20:13,639
-What do you prefer?
-What?

901
01:20:13,834 --> 01:20:15,394
-What do you prefer?
-I've eaten.

902
01:20:15,593 --> 01:20:17,928
-Come on.
-The gratin.

903
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:19,266
-Coke?
-Yes.

904
01:20:19,466 --> 01:20:20,895
Take it.

905
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:29,028
Michel, my father.

906
01:20:30,154 --> 01:20:33,154
I thought
I'd become the invisible man.

907
01:20:33,354 --> 01:20:36,551
That would be relaxing
after a day's work.

908
01:20:37,257 --> 01:20:39,941
Your apartment's
a plumber's paradise.

909
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:43,399
There's enough work here for two
for a month at least.

910
01:20:43,593 --> 01:20:45,895
-There are leaks...
-Enough, dad.

911
01:20:46,089 --> 01:20:48,707
I do everything badly,
but no one gives a damn! Forget it.

912
01:20:48,904 --> 01:20:52,865
Maybe this young man doesn't know
what he's walked into.

913
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:55,782
-You're despicable.
-I'm Simon.

914
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:59,359
-You can call me that.
-Welcome, Simon...

915
01:20:59,561 --> 01:21:01,699
since Simon is here.

916
01:21:01,896 --> 01:21:04,285
-What do you do?
-Dumb question!

917
01:21:04,488 --> 01:21:05,863
I invite whom I want.

918
01:21:06,057 --> 01:21:08,512
With you here,
I feel I've been evicted!

919
01:21:08,712 --> 01:21:10,020
Your plate.

920
01:21:10,214 --> 01:21:13,958
I don't have much crockery left,
between Nigel's place and the move.

921
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,149
Don't you like braised endives?

922
01:21:17,352 --> 01:21:19,206
No one does in the real world.

923
01:21:19,398 --> 01:21:21,854
What kind of codswallop is that?

924
01:21:22,056 --> 01:21:24,903
People love endives
if you cook them right.

925
01:21:25,096 --> 01:21:26,852
The way you talk!

926
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,640
No cheese platter?

927
01:21:28,839 --> 01:21:32,003
Cheese after gratin?
With cheesecake to follow?

928
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:34,845
Give me strength...

929
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:52,962
-Let's not wait for them.
-Exactly, they shouldn't have left.

930
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:58,784
Sorry, but I'm suffocating.

931
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:01,410
You always have been.

932
01:22:01,606 --> 01:22:03,647
What can we do about it?

933
01:22:04,871 --> 01:22:07,008
You blame your macho father,

934
01:22:07,206 --> 01:22:10,206
your mother's guilt trips,
your pushy sister,

935
01:22:10,406 --> 01:22:12,642
your self-centred husband...

936
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:15,203
But what about you?

937
01:22:16,454 --> 01:22:19,137
There's enough oxygen
for everyone.

938
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,470
No, it's all been used up.

939
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:24,449
You're just used
to not breathing.

940
01:22:24,646 --> 01:22:27,494
Your petty life and gestures,
Dad's whims...

941
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:30,621
The diktats of some,
the problems of others...

942
01:22:30,982 --> 01:22:33,633
You think it will end one day...

943
01:22:35,462 --> 01:22:37,534
and that you'll be free,

944
01:22:37,734 --> 01:22:40,768
but it never ends.
You've wasted your life.

945
01:22:40,966 --> 01:22:43,813
I won't settle for that.
I'd rather...

946
01:22:44,005 --> 01:22:45,379
You'd rather what?

947
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:49,437
Go out with some adolescent?

948
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:52,571
Simon?
He's only five years younger than me!

949
01:22:53,221 --> 01:22:56,898
-And your children who...
-Stop judging everything I do!

950
01:23:03,331 --> 01:23:06,049
<i>What can I do with a thing like this?</i>

951
01:23:06,245 --> 01:23:08,153
<i>It should be embedded.</i>

952
01:23:08,356 --> 01:23:12,417
It's not standard. It's useless.
It needs two weeks' work...

953
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,842
-I'm going.
-Michel is explaining how...

954
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:17,378
I know. Let's go.

955
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:21,310
Sorry, Michel.
Thank you.

956
01:23:22,021 --> 01:23:24,541
Don't worry about it.

957
01:23:24,741 --> 01:23:27,358
Life without drama is pointless.

958
01:23:27,556 --> 01:23:30,786
For this family's
women at least.

959
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,306
What drama do I put you through?

960
01:23:35,461 --> 01:23:38,723
What a nerve!
I'm just mending the electricity...

961
01:23:43,077 --> 01:23:46,175
We all have parents. Who cares?

962
01:23:46,372 --> 01:23:47,484
I care.

963
01:23:47,683 --> 01:23:50,302
-They're not so bad.
-Don't talk about it.

964
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:54,777
It's crazy, lightning flashes
from your eyes when you speak.

965
01:23:56,899 --> 01:23:58,688
What shall we do?

966
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:00,825
I don't know.

967
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:06,232
-I knew you'd do that.
-So why do it?

968
01:24:06,434 --> 01:24:08,289
I don't know. Let's walk.

969
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:21,695
As a girl, I thought things had to

970
01:24:22,146 --> 01:24:24,830
remain possible as long as possible,

971
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,873
with no decisions made.

972
01:24:28,065 --> 01:24:31,131
That way, I'd be free
and not make mistakes.

973
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:33,119
My life wouldn't be cramped.

974
01:24:34,114 --> 01:24:37,792
I found my parents' life
so pathetic,

975
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:40,507
so petty, so submissive.

976
01:24:40,706 --> 01:24:44,221
When Gulven talks about you,
and he often does,

977
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,906
he always says you're a rebel,

978
01:24:47,105 --> 01:24:51,230
an unwitting revolutionary
who just wants to seem normal.

979
01:24:51,427 --> 01:24:55,354
-That's so complicated!
-I don't think so.

980
01:24:55,553 --> 01:24:57,594
You try so hard to get things right.

981
01:24:57,794 --> 01:25:00,576
You're so demanding you screw up.

982
01:25:00,769 --> 01:25:02,842
And you're so scared

983
01:25:03,586 --> 01:25:06,782
of pushing others aside,
of overshadowing them,

984
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,537
or of making them jealous maybe...

985
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:12,217
Really? You noticed that?

986
01:25:13,761 --> 01:25:17,339
If I were a man,
my life would be simpler.

987
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:20,187
Less of an ordeal.

988
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:25,593
<i>If I were a man
I'd be a captain</i>

989
01:25:25,793 --> 01:25:28,127
-I'm serious.
-I don't think so.

990
01:25:29,089 --> 01:25:31,423
You submit to too many people.

991
01:25:32,896 --> 01:25:34,806
You know, my sweet,

992
01:25:35,008 --> 01:25:39,230
your life
cannot be summed up by what you are

993
01:25:39,744 --> 01:25:41,784
nor by what you can have,

994
01:25:42,912 --> 01:25:46,491
but by what you are ready
to give up.

995
01:25:48,321 --> 01:25:50,937
It sounds like
an old wives' saying

996
01:25:51,135 --> 01:25:52,860
but it's true all the same.

997
01:25:54,432 --> 01:25:57,279
We all need something

998
01:25:57,472 --> 01:25:59,359
that we can give up.

999
01:25:59,552 --> 01:26:02,268
What if I don't want
to give anything up?

1000
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,968
In that case, my dear, tough!

1001
01:26:10,975 --> 01:26:12,221
You know,

1002
01:26:12,737 --> 01:26:14,907
I loved kissing you!

1003
01:26:15,104 --> 01:26:17,657
Really loved it.
I love your mouth.

1004
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,969
And...

1005
01:26:19,169 --> 01:26:23,510
I really liked eating
from children's plates.

1006
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:27,898
We get on well.
Are you tired?

1007
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:30,299
I don't want to pressure you...

1008
01:26:32,703 --> 01:26:35,321
but I'm naked under the sheets...

1009
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:36,600
and...

1010
01:26:37,502 --> 01:26:39,390
I'm a bit cold.

1011
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,172
<i>I'm on the other side.</i>

1012
01:26:44,767 --> 01:26:46,393
Good night, Simon.

1013
01:27:19,388 --> 01:27:21,975
<i>-Yes.
-Nigel, it's me.</i>

1014
01:27:27,421 --> 01:27:29,047
<i>-I need...
-What's wrong?</i>

1015
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,067
I need to see you.

1016
01:27:31,261 --> 01:27:33,562
<i>Has something happened to the kids?</i>

1017
01:27:33,756 --> 01:27:36,309
No, it's me. Can you let me in?

1018
01:27:40,094 --> 01:27:42,037
Can you let me in, please?

1019
01:27:42,237 --> 01:27:43,992
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

1020
01:27:44,477 --> 01:27:46,965
<i>Let's meet tomorrow.</i>

1021
01:27:52,669 --> 01:27:53,946
<i>Léna?</i>

1022
01:27:55,101 --> 01:27:57,140
<i>Are you still there?</i>

1023
01:28:00,828 --> 01:28:03,730
I'll live the rest of my life
without you!

1024
01:28:59,546 --> 01:29:01,913
Don't kiss me, please.

1025
01:29:09,947 --> 01:29:12,314
I won't ask you where you slept.

1026
01:29:16,923 --> 01:29:19,825
Been seeing this Simon long?

1027
01:29:22,811 --> 01:29:25,146
We don't have to talk about him.

1028
01:29:25,788 --> 01:29:27,379
But...

1029
01:29:27,577 --> 01:29:31,157
I imagine you brought him here
to let me know about him.

1030
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:39,127
Try using words,
it might help me.

1031
01:29:44,953 --> 01:29:47,409
My marriage is a closed case.

1032
01:29:51,642 --> 01:29:54,488
You had to sleep with Simon
to realize?

1033
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:57,360
Such tact...

1034
01:29:57,562 --> 01:30:00,178
You know what I mean.

1035
01:30:00,824 --> 01:30:03,246
Have you ever wanted to leave Dad?

1036
01:30:04,794 --> 01:30:06,418
Loads of times.

1037
01:30:07,674 --> 01:30:10,738
But my marriage helped me
to avoid doing it.

1038
01:30:11,545 --> 01:30:14,611
-Because of us...
-No, not you.

1039
01:30:15,737 --> 01:30:19,510
I've always set you aside
from the love in my life.

1040
01:30:19,704 --> 01:30:22,455
I'm married to your father,
not to you.

1041
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,172
You don't love Dad anymore?

1042
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:28,207
Not the way I used to.

1043
01:30:31,512 --> 01:30:36,247
Perhaps I don't love him anymore,
compared to how I view love.

1044
01:30:38,233 --> 01:30:40,088
But I live with him.

1045
01:30:42,073 --> 01:30:44,046
And I'm very happy.

1046
01:30:46,968 --> 01:30:49,935
I never expected
to spend my life with Nigel.

1047
01:30:52,056 --> 01:30:53,550
I told you that.

1048
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,870
But I'm sure I loved him.

1049
01:30:59,064 --> 01:31:01,399
Don't say anything. I'm slow.

1050
01:31:11,063 --> 01:31:12,470
Anton...

1051
01:31:13,751 --> 01:31:17,068
It's too early to be up.

1052
01:31:19,734 --> 01:31:21,196
What's wrong?

1053
01:31:21,399 --> 01:31:23,538
Want to sleep in my bed?

1054
01:31:41,717 --> 01:31:43,823
We'll be going now.

1055
01:31:46,294 --> 01:31:48,596
How are you doing, Anton?

1056
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:53,066
Think you can get up?
Ok, we'll carry you down.

1057
01:31:53,269 --> 01:31:54,830
Goodbye.

1058
01:32:11,541 --> 01:32:13,233
We're going with them.

1059
01:32:19,414 --> 01:32:21,323
Go and wash, dear.

1060
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:39,083
-Is he ok?
-Yes, don't worry.

1061
01:32:40,276 --> 01:32:41,903
-Ok, sweetheart?
-Let's go.

1062
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:43,344
I'll go and see Léna.

1063
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:46,889
-I'm not wanted up there.
-Nigel's here, is he?

1064
01:32:47,092 --> 01:32:49,547
We're waiting for his father.

1065
01:32:49,749 --> 01:32:51,408
What's keeping him?

1066
01:32:56,499 --> 01:32:57,710
Hello there.

1067
01:32:58,836 --> 01:33:01,870
-Packing for both?
-Nigel's taking them.

1068
01:33:02,068 --> 01:33:04,490
Léna agrees.
She couldn't manage.

1069
01:33:04,692 --> 01:33:06,578
The kids need to be together.

1070
01:33:06,771 --> 01:33:10,667
Anton will be under observation
until this evening.

1071
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,907
You can help pack the toys.

1072
01:33:13,108 --> 01:33:14,799
-No.
-What?

1073
01:33:15,124 --> 01:33:17,163
I want no part of this.

1074
01:33:17,362 --> 01:33:18,541
Part of what?

1075
01:33:18,739 --> 01:33:21,194
-Part of what?
-I'm not talking to you.

1076
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:23,784
She's crazy and driving
my kids crazy.

1077
01:33:23,988 --> 01:33:25,960
They're in danger.

1078
01:33:26,162 --> 01:33:28,552
-Don't exaggerate.
-Why did I trust her?

1079
01:33:28,755 --> 01:33:32,431
Hold on, didn't you bang some chick
behind her back?

1080
01:33:32,626 --> 01:33:35,662
Yes, and I don't regret it,
believe me.

1081
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,982
All I regret is not taking the kids
with me right away.

1082
01:33:41,236 --> 01:33:43,953
-Where's Léna?
-I sent her to shower.

1083
01:33:44,147 --> 01:33:45,489
Don't talk like that!

1084
01:33:51,219 --> 01:33:52,745
Nice and clean now?

1085
01:33:55,443 --> 01:33:58,093
He tried to kill himself
to get at me.

1086
01:33:59,411 --> 01:34:01,320
I'm no use to him.

1087
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:05,706
-I couldn't protect him.
-Cut it out!

1088
01:34:08,786 --> 01:34:10,542
I'm serious.

1089
01:34:11,795 --> 01:34:13,867
You protect José.
He trusts you.

1090
01:34:14,067 --> 01:34:16,849
Anton is afraid for me.
That's not normal.

1091
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:20,108
What's not normal
is the Yank taking your kids.

1092
01:34:20,307 --> 01:34:22,128
He looks after them better.

1093
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:23,631
That's no reason.

1094
01:34:24,467 --> 01:34:26,408
I'm so ashamed...

1095
01:34:34,514 --> 01:34:38,572
Mum, you told us to accept injustice
in order to fight it.

1096
01:34:38,768 --> 01:34:41,616
The story of Solomon
and the baby...

1097
01:34:41,969 --> 01:34:44,838
You said children
always come back.

1098
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,400
Remember the day I lost you
in the Huelgoat woods?

1099
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,127
The Huelgoat woods?

1100
01:34:53,328 --> 01:34:55,270
When did we go there?

1101
01:34:55,474 --> 01:34:58,702
We went there a lot.
This was when you were tiny.

1102
01:34:58,897 --> 01:35:00,804
Before Gulven was born.

1103
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:04,140
It was a Sunday.
I'd had a row with your father.

1104
01:35:13,681 --> 01:35:17,871
I took you off in the car
with our cat. Mao, I think.

1105
01:35:18,193 --> 01:35:21,324
<i>He ran off
and you wanted to look for him.</i>

1106
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,244
<i>Night was falling...</i>

1107
01:35:28,401 --> 01:35:30,222
<i>I don't remember.</i>

1108
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:31,976
<i>You must.</i>

1109
01:35:32,785 --> 01:35:35,151
<i>The Trembling Rock.</i>

1110
01:35:35,344 --> 01:35:37,514
With that guy,
Nicolas Gronski.

1111
01:35:37,712 --> 01:35:40,844
Dad couldn't stand him.
He drove like a maniac.

1112
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:42,764
What did we do?

1113
01:35:44,111 --> 01:35:47,178
I set off to look for Mao
with Mr Gronski

1114
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,993
and we left you at the rock.

1115
01:35:50,831 --> 01:35:55,404
We soon found Mao
but we couldn't find you again.

1116
01:35:56,623 --> 01:35:57,834
I was terrified.

1117
01:35:58,448 --> 01:35:59,974
Mum!

1118
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,541
Mum!

1119
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,184
Léna, come back!

1120
01:36:29,869 --> 01:36:31,244
<i>And?</i>

1121
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:33,572
<i>We finally found you.</i>

1122
01:36:34,959 --> 01:36:36,781
<i>It was nearly midnight.</i>

1123
01:36:37,486 --> 01:36:39,874
<i>Léna, you were
reading Hugo to her</i>

1124
01:36:40,686 --> 01:36:43,174
<i>with your trusty
flashlight.</i>

1125
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:44,934
Thank God she was.

1126
01:36:45,135 --> 01:36:48,876
You could have stayed
and let the guy look for Mao.

1127
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:50,789
Actually,

1128
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:53,987
Gronski wasn't very bright.

1129
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:57,256
After that,
he never came to the house again.

1130
01:36:57,901 --> 01:37:00,487
He wrote me some sweet
letters though.

1131
01:37:01,006 --> 01:37:03,723
Mathias wrote beautiful
letters too.

1132
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:05,290
He'd talk of my two coats.

1133
01:37:05,484 --> 01:37:08,997
"You belong to two worlds,
with two coats, and only I see them."

1134
01:37:10,733 --> 01:37:14,083
Want some good news?
The divorce is off.

1135
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:16,325
You were getting divorced?

1136
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:21,708
-You didn't tell Mum?
-It was a secret, wasn't it?

1137
01:37:21,901 --> 01:37:23,941
I love you so much, sister.

1138
01:37:25,804 --> 01:37:29,579
-Don't you want a bath?
-I just had a shower.

1139
01:37:29,772 --> 01:37:32,937
-I'll get lunch then.
-No, we're going.

1140
01:37:33,998 --> 01:37:37,891
You must think
about what you really want, Léna.

1141
01:37:38,092 --> 01:37:40,329
-Can we leave you?
-Yes.

1142
01:37:40,524 --> 01:37:42,215
Come on, Mum, out.

1143
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,740
Bye, dear.

1144
01:40:08,233 --> 01:40:12,355
<i>Augustine and Anton won't forgive you
for leaving without them.</i>

1145
01:40:13,864 --> 01:40:16,385
<i>They wouldn't have
forgiven me anyway,</i>

1146
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:18,558
<i>but it would have been
for something else.</i>
