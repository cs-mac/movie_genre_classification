1
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,191
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:37,142
-All right, Dad.
-Come on.

3
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,999
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:31,599
-I think I should make a list.
-What do mean?

5
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,093
-For your birthday gifts?
-Yeah.

6
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:36,700
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:40,804
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:43,836
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:46,136
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,781
-I think so.
-All right. That's good.

11
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:56,340
-How you doing in here, man?
-Okay.

12
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:06,120
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:10,224
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,912
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:14,597
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,469
Excuse me.

17
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:21,885
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,225
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,596
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:33,047
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an l.

21
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,035
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,411
I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.

23
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:42,752
And I made up my mind
as a young kid...

24
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:44,438
...that when I had children...

25
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:47,814
...my children were gonna know
who their father was.

26
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,265
This is part of my life story.

27
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,251
This part is called "Riding the Bus. "

28
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,077
What's that?

29
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,800
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,102
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:12,247
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,590
This machine...

33
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,240
...this machine on my lap--

34
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,311
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:20,456
He travels in the past
with this machine and....

36
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,795
--it is not a time machine.

37
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,826
It's a portable
bone-density scanner.

38
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,162
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,733
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,958
-I appreciate it.
-We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,837
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:38,100
-Well, maybe next--
-Thank you.

43
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:44,008
It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:48,418
-Hey.
-Hey, baby.

45
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,221
-What happened?
-No, nothing.

46
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:51,908
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:54,517
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,396
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,618
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,304
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,528
-Yes.
-And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:08,133
-What are you gonna do about that?
-Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:16,303
You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:17,799
That's mine.

55
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,872
There's no parking near hospitals.

56
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:22,441
That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.

57
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,473
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:27,504
-Maybe next quarter.
-It's possible.

59
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:33,641
I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:35,789
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:39,586
...to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.

62
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,024
The problem is...

63
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:51,284
...I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,465
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:58,112
Since birth?

66
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,409
-What's that?
-What?

67
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,592
-What is this?
-It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:08,162
-From who?
-Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:11,345
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,455
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:17,099
Make every side the same color.

72
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:20,551
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,812
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,568
-You already filed an extension.
-Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:32,481
That's-- It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,704
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:37,159
-And a penalty?
-Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,759
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:46,979
-Come here. Calm down.
-I have to go back to work.

80
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:58,141
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,633
A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:05,391
...a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.

83
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:08,651
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:10,454
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:13,177
...and then go to work
to turn things around.

86
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:16,974
And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.

87
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,159
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:23,572
And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...

89
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:27,062
...for this budget year
that ends September 30th.

90
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:32,278
That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1 957.

91
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,924
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:39,260
... we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.

93
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:42,290
Twenty years ago, in 1 960...

94
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,470
...our federal government payroll
was less than $ 1 3 billion.

95
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:49,271
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:54,793
During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23. 3 percent....

97
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,854
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:18,038
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,488
-I'm a stockbroker.
-Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,559
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:28,355
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,848
-That's it.
-Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,036
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:35,606
-But I need it back for Monday.
-Feed the meter.

105
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,773
I still remember that moment.

106
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:53,365
They all looked
so damn happy to me.

107
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:02,532
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,713
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:23,897
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,234
-For what?
-I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:29,957
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:32,374
You know, when l--

113
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,097
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,511
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,427
What job?

116
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:45,913
Stockbroker.

117
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:51,208
-Stockbroker?
-Yeah.

118
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:53,508
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,230
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:15,947
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:17,790
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,589
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,849
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:26,687
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,682
Probably not.

126
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:31,252
We're already two months behind.

127
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,359
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,770
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:43,296
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,017
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:50,316
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:51,849
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,224
What's the matter with you?

134
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:00,864
Linda.

135
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,858
Linda.

136
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:33,658
This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

137
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:36,842
Can I ask you a favor, miss?

138
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:40,754
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:43,324
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,473
...Iooking smalltime.

141
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,536
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,872
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:58,782
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right?

144
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:08,410
-Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
-Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:09,867
-Come with me.
-Yes, sir.

146
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,706
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:16,004
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,766
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,953
I mean, I'm-- You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:23,983
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so....

151
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:27,089
Normally I have a resume sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:30,542
-We....
-Thank you very much.

153
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,846
I need to go.

154
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:34,070
I'll bring this back.

155
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,293
-Thank you.
-Okay.

156
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:47,725
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?

157
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,490
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:13:49,682 --> 00:13:54,899
Like I said, this part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

159
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:02,455
Hey!. Hey!. Hey!. Don't move!.
Don't move!. Stay--!.

160
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:12,350
Stop!. Stop!.

161
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,611
Don't move!.
Stop this--!. Stop the train!

162
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,832
Stop! Stop!

163
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,708
The program took just 20 people
every six months.

164
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,893
One got the job.

165
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,529
There were three blank lines after
"high school" to list more education.

166
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:49,710
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:57,421
T ry and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:10,462
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,993
...made up of multiple colors
that you twist and turn...

170
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:15,678
...and try to get
to a solid color on each side.

171
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,360
This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1 98 1.

172
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,894
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,427
Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...

174
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:25,996
... who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,336
This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.

176
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,787
As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.

177
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,472
This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,272
Hey, wake up.

179
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:38,922
Eat.

180
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:42,374
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, baby.

181
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,443
-Come back without that, please.
-Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:48,435
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,966
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,036
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:54,265
Bye, Mom.

186
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:57,026
Bye.

187
00:15:57,218 --> 00:16:00,669
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,854
-ls it an adjective?
-No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,735
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:09,377
-ls "fuck" spelled right?
-Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,561
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:17,472
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:20,424
-But just don't use that one, okay?
-Okay.

194
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,687
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:24,873
My nickname.

196
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,600
We pick nicknames.

197
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,052
-Oh, yeah? What's it say?
-"Hot Rod."

198
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:34,846
-Did you have a nickname?
-Yep.

199
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,685
-What?
-"Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,676
-What's that?
-I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:45,280
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,922
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,531
-Hoss wears that hat.
-Hoss?

204
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,450
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.

205
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:57,247
-How do you know Bonanza?
-We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,891
-You watch Bonanza at daycare?
-Yeah.

207
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,882
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:07,604
-After snack? After your nap?
-After Love Boat.

209
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:14,393
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:19,455
-Yeah, what'd you put on there?
-A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:27,012
-He says he's been watching TV.
-Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:30,196
-Love Boat?
-For history. Navy.

213
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,574
That's not the Navy.

214
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,797
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:39,170
We're paying you $1 50 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:41,663
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:45,499
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:52,289
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:57,389
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:59,001
Bye.

221
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:45,298
I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:50,782
...whose name sounded so delightful,
like he'd give me a job and a hug.

223
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:54,810
I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.

224
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,498
-Morning, Mr. Twistle.
-Good morning.

225
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,071
-Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
-Hi.

226
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,948
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:04,400
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,700
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:09,616
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:12,646
-Yes, sir. You have a great day.
-You too.

231
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:20,931
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:23,232
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,497
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:29,063
I was wondering if--
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,710
Right. We can still--? Half an hour?

236
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:35,430
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,590
Hey! Hey!

238
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,967
Hey!

239
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,464
This part of my life...

240
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:54,226
-Wait!
-...this part here...

241
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,294
...it's called "Running. "

242
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,365
Hey! Hey!

243
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:01,053
Wait!

244
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,621
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,114
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,260
Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.

247
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:11,945
Which was unlikely...

248
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:14,669
...because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:17,431
I spent our entire life savings
on these things.

250
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,185
It was such
a revolutionary machine.

251
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,640
-Can you feel it, baby?
-Oh, yeah.

252
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,327
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,935
What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:33,848
...would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,679
I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.

256
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:45,586
So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.

257
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:51,224
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,555
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:03,345
Hey, man, l--

260
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:07,333
-Who's he?
-He's that guy....

261
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:21,141
-Did you forget?
-Forget what?

262
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:24,440
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,739
-Yeah, I know.
-You have two now.

264
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:39,132
Hey.

265
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,542
Hey, Mom.

266
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:52,365
One, two, three!

267
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,392
-That's a basketball!
-Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,233
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:02,185
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:04,754
-No, it's not.
-There, there.

271
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:08,091
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:17,948
-That paper's a little heavy, huh?
-Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:31,182
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,790
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down--

275
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:35,515
Whatever.

276
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,004
-What?
-Whatever, Chris.

277
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,305
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:45,181
-"Whatever" what?
-Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:46,678
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,094
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,668
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:53,160
-I'm trying to keep a clean house.
-Hey, wait a second.

283
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,998
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,412
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:04,208
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "lt'll be fine."

286
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:09,194
-So you don't trust me now?
-Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,879
-Taxi!
-Mr. Twistle.

288
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,640
-Yeah, hi.
-Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,596
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:33,742
I submitted an application for the
intern program about a month ago...

291
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,081
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly--

292
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,153
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:41,490
-Take care of yourself.
-Mr. Twistle.

294
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:43,983
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,825
How about we share a ride?

296
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,353
-All right, get in.
-All right.

297
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,830
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,745
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:05,386
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,073
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:12,328
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and....

302
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:16,433
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important--

303
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:18,735
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,762
-I can do it.
-No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:25,523
-That's bullshit.
-No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:29,014
-No, you can't.
-Let me see it.

307
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,740
Give it here.

308
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:37,721
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:39,370
Sorry.

310
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:45,622
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the center pieces never move.

311
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:48,768
So if it's yellow in the center,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:51,376
If it's red in the center,
that's the red side.

313
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:55,059
-Okay.
-So.... You can slow down.

314
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:58,203
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,006
-Yeah, I can.
-No, you can't.

316
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:01,349
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

317
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,381
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:07,370
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,946
You almost have this side.

320
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,941
Holy cow.

321
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:37,365
-You almost had that one.
-I'm gonna get it.

322
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:46,303
Look at that.

323
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:09,778
You're almost there.

324
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:36,090
-1 7.1 0.
-This is me.

325
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,466
Good job.

326
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:44,182
-Goodbye.
-Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:48,172
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:51,241
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:56,113
Two-- A couple of blocks.

330
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:59,566
-Just flip around.
-Okay.

331
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:42,410
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:44,250
-Where are you going? Come here!
-No!

333
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:47,165
-No, no, no!
-You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:48,624
-Give me my money.
-Please stop.

335
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:50,732
-Please, please, please!
-Son of a bitch.

336
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,417
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,067
-Come here!
-I'm sorry.

338
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,909
-I'm so sorry.
-I'll kick your ass!

339
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,399
-I'm sorry!
-ldiot.

340
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,020
I'll get you!

341
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:15,587
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,350
Hey!

343
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,341
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:37,605
Stop him!

345
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:43,281
Stop him!

346
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:49,955
The doors are closing.

347
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,871
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:03,457
No! No! No!

349
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:07,753
No!

350
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:32,264
-Hello?
-Hey, yeah.

351
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:34,065
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:38,323
-Chris, I missed my shift.
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:41,699
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,154
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:46,264
-What?
-Did you hear what I said?

356
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:50,866
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:52,516
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,241
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:57,808
-Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold--
-I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:06,554
It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,198
...the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:30:10,506 --> 00:30:16,219
...and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,177
And I remember thinking:

364
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:22,588
How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:27,267
That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.

366
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,373
And maybe we can actually
never have it...

367
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,293
...no matter what.

368
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:34,132
How did he know that?

369
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:41,843
Linda. Linda.

370
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,059
-Hello?
-Chris.

371
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,745
-Who is this?
-Jay Twistle.

372
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,314
-Hey.
-Dean Witter.

373
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,115
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:25,685
I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?

375
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,065
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:30,058
I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:33,854
We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?

378
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:35,542
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:41,066
-Hold on one second.
-All right.

380
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,819
Hello?

381
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:49,236
-Chris?
-Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:51,959
Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,146
-She can give you all the specifics.
-Yep.

384
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:56,140
-Okay, 41 5.
-41 5.

385
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,942
-864.
-864.

386
00:31:58,134 --> 00:32:00,091
-0256.
-0256.

387
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:03,159
-Yeah, extension 4796.
-4796.

388
00:32:03,351 --> 00:32:07,455
-Right. Call her tomorrow.
-Yes, sir. 41 5-864-0256.

389
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:08,912
-Okay, buddy.
-All right, yes.

390
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,175
-Thank you very much.
-We'll see you soon.

391
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:14,934
864-0256.

392
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:18,195
4796. Janice.

393
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,874
-Chris.
-Hey.

394
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,252
Did you--? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,246
-No. You catch the game last night?
-No, no.

396
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:28,781
You didn't see that, 1 1 8, 1 --?

397
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:31,083
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:34,764
-No, I haven't see them.
-1 1 9-1 20. Double overtime.

399
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,027
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 1 7 seconds left.

400
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:38,754
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:40,978
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,701
-What's your problem with numbers?
-864-2....

403
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:45,774
-And you owe me money.
-Yeah.

404
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,653
You owe me $1 4.

405
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:49,610
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,831
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,900
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:24,361
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:25,780
-You hear me?
-Leave me alone!

410
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,736
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:33:27,928 --> 00:33:29,615
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:32,991
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:34,640
-Do you wanna leave?
-Yeah.

414
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:37,556
-You wanna leave?
-Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:40,547
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:43,155
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,571
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:48,717
-You are so weak.
-No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:51,403
-I'm just not happy!
-Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:52,897
Just go get happy.

421
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:55,238
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,155
-Stop!
-Did you hear what I said?

423
00:33:57,424 --> 00:33:59,725
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,650
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:30,066
-How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
-Hi.

426
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:36,049
-Where's Mom?
-Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,540
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,687
Yeah, I know.

429
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,250
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,575
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:56,802
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:34:56,993 --> 00:34:59,562
-Yeah.
-All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:03,091
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:04,741
-Yeah.
-All right.

435
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,889
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,567
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,025
Christopher.

438
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:46,549
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,122
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,615
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:53,722
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission lnn motel?

442
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:55,411
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:58,901
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:02,277
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:03,619
I got painters coming in.

446
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,035
-All right, look. I need more time.
-No.

447
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:08,259
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:36:08,451 --> 00:36:13,591
All right, but I just-- I gotta have some
more time-- I got my son up in here.

449
00:36:18,232 --> 00:36:22,874
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:37:12,622 --> 00:37:14,196
Chris Gardner?

451
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:17,379
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:21,291
-Payable to the City of San Francisco.
-Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:37:21,482 --> 00:37:24,819
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,431
This is all I got.

455
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:34,255
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:37,669
-What?
-You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,275
No.

458
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,193
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:45,877
-I have to pick up my son.
-You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:50,520
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 1 0:1 5 tomorrow morning.

461
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:52,321
-I cannot stay--
-9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:54,777
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:57,346
-ls there anyone else who can--?
-I take care of him.

464
00:37:57,537 --> 00:38:00,415
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:07,856
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:13,074
-Hello.
-Hey.

467
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,914
What do you want?

468
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:20,476
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:25,116
Just keep him for the night and I'm--
And-- Just one night.

470
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,265
What happened?

471
00:38:27,494 --> 00:38:30,793
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:32,674
I'm gonna go right--
You can just--

473
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:35,090
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,695
-No.
-Come on, Linda.

475
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:42,991
-Why you doing that?
-No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:38:43,412 --> 00:38:47,325
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:50,586
-How is he?
-He's fine.

478
00:38:50,816 --> 00:38:53,730
All right, just-- All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:57,566
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:38:57,758 --> 00:39:00,635
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,358
Okay?

482
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,047
Linda?

483
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:07,040
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:10,915
All right, all right.

485
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:12,909
Thank you.

486
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:16,668
Bye.

487
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,098
I'm okay?

488
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,655
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:19,574
Yes, I did.

490
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:29,584
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:38,216
This way.

492
00:40:40,363 --> 00:40:42,280
It'll be right this way.

493
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:55,283
What is the word on that one?

494
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:17,837
Chris Gardner.

495
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,865
Chris Gardner.

496
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:24,205
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,501
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:30,571
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:34,178
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,866
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:40,161
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:41:40,353 --> 00:41:44,227
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:49,060
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:53,740
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,578
So the truth is...

506
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:59,302
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:01,258
Parking tickets?

508
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:05,171
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:07,279
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:10,386
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:12,649
Is it dry now?

512
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:14,529
I hope so.

513
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,369
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,825
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:21,089
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,540
-He said you're smart.
-Well, I like to think so.

517
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:27,609
-And you want to learn this business?
-Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:29,756
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,521
Absolutely.

520
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,976
-Jay?
-Yes, sir.

521
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:36,162
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:38,923
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,762
-Was he ever dressed like this?
-No.

524
00:42:41,954 --> 00:42:44,063
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:48,705
First in your class in school?

526
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:50,623
-High school?
-Yes, sir.

527
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:53,922
-How many in the class?
-Twelve.

528
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,800
It was a small town.

529
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:59,446
-I'll say.
-But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:42:59,636 --> 00:43:02,782
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:06,887
Can I say something?

532
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:09,648
I'm the type of person...

533
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,985
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,324
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:16,821
But I bet you what.

536
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:21,807
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,607
Is that fair enough?

538
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:26,948
Chris.

539
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,819
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,927
...without a shirt on...

541
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:36,959
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:43:41,024 --> 00:43:43,976
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:01,468
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,846
-...but you pulled it off.
-Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:44:04,037 --> 00:44:06,339
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:09,332
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:12,323
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:14,394
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime--

549
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:16,656
What are you talking--?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:19,496
-You stood here--
-Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:44:19,687 --> 00:44:20,992
-No.
-I was not aware of that.

552
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:22,719
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:26,783
-...and I need to be certain that I'll be--
-All right. Okay.

554
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:31,310
Tonight.

555
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,877
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:37,945
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:41,014
Yes, an ass-- A-hole.

558
00:44:41,283 --> 00:44:44,543
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:44:47,304 --> 00:44:49,797
You are a piece of work.

560
00:44:50,794 --> 00:44:52,290
Tonight.

561
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,110
There was no salary.

562
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:05,333
Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.

563
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:16,187
One intern was hired at the end
of the program from a pool of 20.

564
00:45:16,533 --> 00:45:17,761
And if you weren't that guy...

565
00:45:17,953 --> 00:45:20,214
...you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...

566
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:22,170
... to another brokerage.

567
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:26,658
The only resource I would have
for six months...

568
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,610
... would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.

569
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:35,097
If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.

570
00:46:20,051 --> 00:46:23,159
-I got him. I got him.
-He's asleep.

571
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:24,807
All right.

572
00:46:30,944 --> 00:46:32,747
Okay, baby.

573
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,480
I got it.

574
00:46:51,236 --> 00:46:53,231
I'm going to New York.

575
00:47:21,461 --> 00:47:23,684
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:27,597
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:30,743
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:35,422
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:44,782
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:47:44,974 --> 00:47:46,968
He should be with his mom.

581
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,962
I should have him, right?

582
00:47:49,806 --> 00:47:52,070
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:01,122
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:08,562
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:48:08,754 --> 00:48:10,174
...and I got it.

586
00:48:10,366 --> 00:48:12,820
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

587
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:16,465
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:18,497
No, it's not.

589
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:22,179
I gotta go.

590
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,663
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:58,772
And....

592
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,713
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:08,553
I know that.

594
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:51,053
-Dean Witter.
-Yes, hi.

595
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,927
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,532
-Your name?
-Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:49:58,762 --> 00:49:59,835
The message is:

598
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:05,475
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the program.

599
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:11,304
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:13,261
Is that all?

601
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,026
Yes, that's it.

602
00:50:15,217 --> 00:50:16,905
-Okay.
-Thank you.

603
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:18,593
Bye.

604
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:45,365
-Be careful with that.
-What?

605
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:48,204
Be care-- Go ahead.

606
00:51:11,104 --> 00:51:13,903
-Are we there?
-Yep.

607
00:51:26,638 --> 00:51:29,092
-Hey, you know what today is?
-Yeah.

608
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:30,896
-What?
-Saturday.

609
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,312
-You know what Saturday is, right?
-Yeah.

610
00:51:33,504 --> 00:51:35,843
-What?
-Basketball.

611
00:51:36,036 --> 00:51:38,796
-You wanna go play some basketball?
-Okay.

612
00:51:38,988 --> 00:51:41,443
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:45,739
-How about that? Wanna do that?
-No.

614
00:51:46,891 --> 00:51:49,191
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,721
I'm going pro.

616
00:51:53,948 --> 00:51:55,252
Okay.

617
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:58,129
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:00,967
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:04,150
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,986
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:52:08,178 --> 00:52:10,709
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:13,626
...I really-- You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:52:13,855 --> 00:52:16,157
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:17,845
-All right?
-All right.

625
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,801
Okay.

626
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:22,447
All right, go ahead.

627
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:46,842
Hey.

628
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,135
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:54,782
...you can't do something.

630
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:57,466
Not even me.

631
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:01,839
-All right?
-All right.

632
00:53:02,453 --> 00:53:04,563
You got a dream...

633
00:53:04,793 --> 00:53:06,903
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,549
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:12,120
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:53:16,262 --> 00:53:19,905
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:53:27,615 --> 00:53:29,111
Let's go.

638
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:31,989
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:34,520
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

640
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:37,090
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

641
00:53:38,317 --> 00:53:41,194
-You gotta trust me, all right?
-I trust you.

642
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:44,033
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

643
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,060
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:50,668
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

645
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:53,008
I don't know, Christopher.

646
00:53:53,352 --> 00:53:55,193
Dad, listen to this.

647
00:53:55,386 --> 00:53:58,722
One day, a man was drowning
in the water.

648
00:53:58,914 --> 00:54:01,293
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

649
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:03,710
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

650
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:06,970
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

651
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:09,424
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

652
00:54:09,616 --> 00:54:11,686
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

653
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:14,986
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

654
00:54:15,177 --> 00:54:18,514
And God said, "l sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

655
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:21,161
Do you like it?

656
00:54:21,353 --> 00:54:23,962
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

657
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,325
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Yes, sir.

658
00:54:31,517 --> 00:54:33,091
-You got the bill of sale here.
-Yes.

659
00:54:33,282 --> 00:54:34,625
All the information you'll need.

660
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:36,390
Thank you very much
for your business.

661
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:38,000
Thank you.

662
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:43,217
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

663
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:44,981
...7, 8, 9, 1 0.

664
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:46,593
Thank you.

665
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:51,655
-Hey, you want one of those?
-No, it's okay.

666
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:54,071
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

667
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:58,329
-You like that one? How much?
-Twenty-five cents.

668
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:15,514
This part of my life
is called "Internship. "

669
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,000
The 1 200 building is
Medley lndustrial and Sanko Oil.

670
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,341
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

671
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:24,373
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

672
00:55:24,565 --> 00:55:26,330
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

673
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:29,513
...from every Fortune 500 company
in the financial district.

674
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,391
You will be pooling
from 60 Fortune companies.

675
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:35,229
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

676
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:38,297
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

677
00:55:38,527 --> 00:55:41,635
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

678
00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:44,664
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

679
00:55:44,856 --> 00:55:49,574
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

680
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:51,799
...we'll cook the fish.

681
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:54,484
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

682
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:57,015
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

683
00:55:57,246 --> 00:55:59,662
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

684
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:01,963
That person's gonna be the guy...

685
00:56:02,156 --> 00:56:04,341
...who can turn this into this.

686
00:56:04,533 --> 00:56:07,449
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

687
00:56:07,986 --> 00:56:09,750
You, you, help me hand these out.

688
00:56:10,556 --> 00:56:13,470
This is going to be your bible.

689
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,967
You'll eat with it.

690
00:56:15,158 --> 00:56:16,769
-You'll drink with it.
-It was simple.

691
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:19,837
X number of calls
equals X number of prospects.

692
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:22,867
X number of prospects
equals X number of customers.

693
00:56:23,098 --> 00:56:26,090
X number of customers
equals X number of dollars...

694
00:56:26,281 --> 00:56:28,353
-...in the company's pocket.
-Your board exam.

695
00:56:28,545 --> 00:56:34,184
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

696
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:37,597
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass/fail.

697
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:41,049
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

698
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:43,542
Be safe, score a hundred.

699
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:47,493
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 1 0.

700
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:59,191
-Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
-Hi.

701
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:01,493
-Chris, how are you?
-I'm good. How you doing?

702
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:05,635
-Fine, thank you for asking.
-First day in there. It was exciting.

703
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:07,823
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

704
00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:09,778
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

705
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,655
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

706
00:57:12,885 --> 00:57:14,496
Oh, man, I remember mine.

707
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:17,105
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

708
00:57:17,336 --> 00:57:19,636
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

709
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:23,088
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

710
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,350
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

711
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,806
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so--

712
00:57:27,997 --> 00:57:30,223
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

713
00:57:30,452 --> 00:57:33,098
-No, go ahead.
-Good talking to you, sir.

714
00:58:01,406 --> 00:58:05,166
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

715
00:58:05,473 --> 00:58:08,235
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

716
00:58:08,426 --> 00:58:10,535
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

717
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:12,875
I'm trying to cross the street.

718
00:58:13,067 --> 00:58:16,404
-Well, you're all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

719
00:58:16,749 --> 00:58:18,246
-Where's my shoe?
-What?

720
00:58:18,438 --> 00:58:22,081
-You knocked off my shoe!
-I don't know where your shoe is.

721
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:26,224
-Where's my damn shoe?
-I don't know.

722
00:58:31,786 --> 00:58:33,203
Hey.

723
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:37,193
-Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
-No, I'm sorry.

724
00:58:37,384 --> 00:58:40,645
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

725
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:43,599
-We should wait for the police.
-I gotta go to work.

726
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,856
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

727
00:58:48,202 --> 00:58:51,577
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

728
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,314
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

729
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:07,418
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

730
00:59:13,018 --> 00:59:14,362
Dad.

731
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,737
-You don't have a shoe.
-Yeah, I know.

732
00:59:17,928 --> 00:59:20,883
-Wanna know what happened?
-Yeah.

733
00:59:21,573 --> 00:59:23,029
I got hit by a car.

734
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:25,791
-You got hit by a car?
-Yep.

735
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:29,435
-Where?
-Just right by the office.

736
00:59:29,665 --> 00:59:32,581
-No, where in your body?
-Like, the back of my legs.

737
00:59:32,773 --> 00:59:34,538
-Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
-Goodbye.

738
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:37,759
-Where you on the street?
-Yeah, I was running in the street.

739
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,751
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

740
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:42,860
Yeah, thanks.

741
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,702
I'll remember that next time.

742
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:48,268
And here I was again.

743
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:50,954
-Show up early.
-While qualified persons...

744
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:54,942
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

745
00:59:55,135 --> 00:59:56,937
-Now, Chris.
-Yes, sir.

746
00:59:57,129 --> 00:59:59,085
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

747
00:59:59,278 --> 01:00:03,036
Favors for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.

748
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:05,683
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

749
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:08,214
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

750
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:11,168
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

751
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,664
Okay, yes, thank you.

752
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:14,159
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

753
01:00:14,351 --> 01:00:17,918
-Chris?
-Yes, sir.

754
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:22,291
Feeling underrated
and unappreciated.

755
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,018
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

756
01:00:24,248 --> 01:00:26,434
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

757
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:27,930
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

758
01:00:28,122 --> 01:00:31,190
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax--

759
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,569
Okay, thank you, sir.

760
01:00:34,642 --> 01:00:39,130
Then catch the bus by 4 to the place
where they can't spell "happiness. "

761
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:41,048
Then the cross-town.

762
01:00:41,622 --> 01:00:43,311
The 22 home.

763
01:00:44,538 --> 01:00:47,031
-Hey, Chris!
-Hey. Hi, Ralph.

764
01:00:47,223 --> 01:00:50,024
-I'm waiting.
-All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

765
01:00:50,215 --> 01:00:52,210
I'm gonna get that for you.

766
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:03,333
Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.

767
01:01:03,525 --> 01:01:05,520
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

768
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,666
We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.

769
01:01:08,856 --> 01:01:11,082
-From the bottom to the top.
-Yes, sir.

770
01:01:11,274 --> 01:01:13,843
-From the doorman to the CEO.
-Okay.

771
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,103
They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.

772
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:20,211
I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.

773
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:23,431
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

774
01:01:23,624 --> 01:01:25,158
In order not to waste any time...

775
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:27,459
...I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.

776
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:29,646
Okay, thank you very much.

777
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,251
I realized that
by not hanging up the phone...

778
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:35,323
...I gained another eight minutes
a day.

779
01:01:35,515 --> 01:01:37,662
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

780
01:01:37,854 --> 01:01:40,271
-I'm calling from Dean Witter.
-I wasn't drinking water...

781
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,419
...so I didn't' waste any time
in the bathroom.

782
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,720
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity--

783
01:01:44,912 --> 01:01:47,866
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

784
01:01:48,057 --> 01:01:49,360
But even doing all this...

785
01:01:49,553 --> 01:01:53,465
...after two months, I still didn't have
time to work my way up a sheet.

786
01:02:06,162 --> 01:02:08,579
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

787
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:09,921
Walter Ribbon's office.

788
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:13,181
Yes, hello, my name is Chris Gardner.
I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

789
01:02:13,372 --> 01:02:14,486
-Concerning?
-Yes, ma'am.

790
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:15,980
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

791
01:02:16,173 --> 01:02:17,785
Just a moment.

792
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:21,275
-Hello?
-Mr. Ribbon.

793
01:02:21,467 --> 01:02:24,305
Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

794
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:26,184
-Yeah, Chris.
-Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

795
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:29,637
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

796
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:32,168
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

797
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,124
Can you be here in 20 minutes?

798
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:38,189
-Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
-Just had someone cancel.

799
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:40,376
I can give you a few minutes
before the 49ers.

800
01:02:40,568 --> 01:02:43,559
-Monday Night Football, buddy.
-Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

801
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,976
-See you soon.
-Bye-bye.

802
01:02:48,507 --> 01:02:50,503
Excuse me. Thank you.

803
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,190
-Chris, what's up?
-Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

804
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,648
Hey, do you have five minutes?

805
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,489
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon--

806
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:58,595
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

807
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:01,932
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

808
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:05,193
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

809
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:07,839
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

810
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:09,488
And you have to jimmy that.

811
01:03:09,681 --> 01:03:11,599
-Jimmy what?
-You have to jimmy the key.

812
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:16,279
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

813
01:03:31,812 --> 01:03:33,462
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

814
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,949
Oh, no!

815
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:40,596
Come on.

816
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:55,056
-Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
-Thank you.

817
01:03:59,813 --> 01:04:02,460
-Thanks a lot.
-Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

818
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:09,440
No, no, no!

819
01:04:19,107 --> 01:04:21,753
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

820
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,393
-Hi.
-Hi.

821
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,076
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

822
01:05:12,269 --> 01:05:13,611
Oh, you just missed him.

823
01:05:16,104 --> 01:05:17,563
Thank you.

824
01:05:40,693 --> 01:05:44,413
-What's that?
-Just filling out a check...

825
01:05:44,604 --> 01:05:47,021
...paying some bills...

826
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:49,130
...and a parking ticket.

827
01:05:50,934 --> 01:05:52,927
We don't have a car anymore.

828
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,267
Yep, I know.

829
01:05:58,642 --> 01:06:01,558
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

830
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,936
A couple of doctors' offices.

831
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:08,078
-On sales calls, okay?
-Okay.

832
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,676
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

833
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:17,590
-Really?
-Possibly.

834
01:06:18,012 --> 01:06:20,353
-All right?
-All right.

835
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,540
Come on, finish up.

836
01:06:23,037 --> 01:06:25,876
-Are you sure?
-Possibly.

837
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,561
Really?

838
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:01,625
-Are you bringing it to the game?
-Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

839
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,654
And maybe
we're going to the game.

840
01:07:06,113 --> 01:07:09,909
-Where are we going now?
-To see someone about my job.

841
01:07:10,255 --> 01:07:11,905
I don't understand.

842
01:07:12,097 --> 01:07:15,165
-You don't understand what?
-Are we going to the game?

843
01:07:15,356 --> 01:07:17,773
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

844
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:20,227
-You know what "possibly" means?
-Like probably.

845
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:22,950
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

846
01:07:23,142 --> 01:07:25,789
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

847
01:07:25,981 --> 01:07:28,897
-What does "probably" mean?
-lt means we have a good chance.

848
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:30,431
And what does "possibly" mean?

849
01:07:30,623 --> 01:07:33,000
-I know what it means.
-What does it mean?

850
01:07:33,192 --> 01:07:35,647
It means that we're not going
to the game.

851
01:07:37,257 --> 01:07:40,365
-How did you get so smart?
-Because you're smart.

852
01:07:45,237 --> 01:07:47,883
-Are we there?
-Yeah.

853
01:07:53,175 --> 01:07:54,672
-Mr. Ribbon.
-Yes?

854
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,665
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

855
01:07:58,162 --> 01:08:00,503
-Oh, hi. Hi.
-This is my son, Christopher.

856
01:08:00,694 --> 01:08:02,151
-Hi.
-Hey, Christopher.

857
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:04,646
-What are you doing up here?
-I came to apologize...

858
01:08:04,836 --> 01:08:07,406
-...for missing our appointment.
-You didn't need to come up.

859
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,092
We were in the neighborhood
visiting a very close friend...

860
01:08:10,283 --> 01:08:13,659
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

861
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,573
-I know you probably waited for me.
-Little bit.

862
01:08:16,804 --> 01:08:19,220
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

863
01:08:19,412 --> 01:08:21,368
Oh, come on. What's that?

864
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,897
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

865
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:28,503
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

866
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:31,226
-I have a meeting after the game.
-You're going to the game?

867
01:08:31,456 --> 01:08:33,144
-Yeah.
-Possibly.

868
01:08:34,141 --> 01:08:35,445
-Possibly.
-We're going too.

869
01:08:35,637 --> 01:08:37,211
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 1 2-year-old.

870
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,514
We were just leaving. Tim!

871
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,624
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

872
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,425
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

873
01:08:43,616 --> 01:08:45,610
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

874
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:47,260
-You got it.
-Thank you very much.

875
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,062
You take care. Here, come on.

876
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:50,520
-Say bye-bye, Chris.
-Bye.

877
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,284
Bye, Christopher.

878
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:53,972
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

879
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,965
-What--? To Candlestick?
-We're going now. Come with us.

880
01:08:57,156 --> 01:09:00,186
-Where are your seats?
-We've-- We're upper deck.

881
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:01,566
We got a box. Come on.

882
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,830
-You wanna sit in the box?
-No.

883
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:08,777
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

884
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:11,348
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

885
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:15,567
-Okay.
-Okay, kids in the back.

886
01:09:16,143 --> 01:09:18,289
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

887
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:23,698
-Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
-We don't have a car.

888
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:26,652
-Oh, my--
-What happened?

889
01:09:26,844 --> 01:09:28,148
I think I got stung by a bee.

890
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:31,178
-You all right?
-Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

891
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,862
-You're not allergic or anything?
-No, no, no.

892
01:09:34,054 --> 01:09:37,238
-Where'd he get you?
-Just right at the back of my head.

893
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,771
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

894
01:09:39,961 --> 01:09:42,033
-Does it hurt?
-Christopher, I'm fine.

895
01:09:42,225 --> 01:09:45,907
-Let me see.
-Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

896
01:09:46,138 --> 01:09:48,400
Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times...

897
01:09:48,593 --> 01:09:51,277
...in the Declaration
of Independence.

898
01:09:51,699 --> 01:09:54,154
May seem like a strange word
to be in that document...

899
01:09:54,346 --> 01:09:59,064
...but he was sort of....
He was an artist.

900
01:09:59,294 --> 01:10:03,667
He called the English
"the disturbers of our harmony. "

901
01:10:03,973 --> 01:10:05,661
And I remember standing there
that day...

902
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:08,077
... thinking about
the disturbers of mine.

903
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:12,335
Questions I had:
Whether all this was good.

904
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,406
Whether I'd make it.

905
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:20,159
And Walter Ribbon
and his Pacific Bell pension money...

906
01:10:20,352 --> 01:10:21,656
... which was millions.

907
01:10:21,848 --> 01:10:23,419
Yeah!

908
01:10:23,842 --> 01:10:26,642
It was a way to another place.

909
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,404
Wow, this is....

910
01:10:29,749 --> 01:10:31,667
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

911
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:34,813
-Thank you very much for this, really.
-Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

912
01:10:35,004 --> 01:10:38,149
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

913
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:41,103
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

914
01:10:41,372 --> 01:10:43,442
...which we believe
to be far superior...

915
01:10:43,635 --> 01:10:46,128
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

916
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:48,084
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

917
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:53,109
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

918
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,755
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

919
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:59,283
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

920
01:10:59,476 --> 01:11:01,509
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

921
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:04,693
So, you know, come on, relax.
Let's play the game. Go, go, go!

922
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:06,840
Yes!

923
01:11:09,717 --> 01:11:11,710
Yes! Yeah!

924
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:17,197
-Here you go.
-All right.

925
01:11:17,388 --> 01:11:19,076
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

926
01:11:19,306 --> 01:11:21,760
-Chris, I'll talk to you later.
-I'm gonna give you a call.

927
01:11:21,952 --> 01:11:23,563
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

928
01:11:23,756 --> 01:11:25,289
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

929
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:34,495
-Bye.
-Bye, Christopher.

930
01:12:02,764 --> 01:12:07,099
After four months, we had sold
all our scanners.

931
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:09,669
It seemed we were making it.

932
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:11,778
What's the...

933
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:14,500
-...fastest animal in the world?
-Jackrabbit.

934
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:19,910
It seemed we were doing good.

935
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:21,789
Till one day...

936
01:12:22,019 --> 01:12:23,668
...that day...

937
01:12:24,205 --> 01:12:26,047
...that letter brought me
back to earth.

938
01:12:33,143 --> 01:12:35,636
This part of my life is called
"Paying Taxes. "

939
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:38,859
If you didn't pay them...

940
01:12:39,051 --> 01:12:41,889
... the government could stick
their hands into your bank account...

941
01:12:42,502 --> 01:12:43,690
...and take your money.

942
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:44,804
Dad.

943
01:12:44,995 --> 01:12:46,913
No warning. Nothing.

944
01:12:47,105 --> 01:12:50,134
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

945
01:12:50,326 --> 01:12:53,319
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

946
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,854
I was-- I was--

947
01:12:55,044 --> 01:12:58,267
Listen, l--
That's all the money that I have.

948
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:02,562
You cannot go into my bank acc--
No--

949
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:05,018
It was the 25th of September.

950
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:06,858
I remember that day.

951
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,046
Because that's the day
that I found out...

952
01:13:09,275 --> 01:13:14,185
...there was only 21 dollars
and 33 cents left in my bank account.

953
01:13:14,377 --> 01:13:15,987
I was broke.

954
01:13:25,922 --> 01:13:28,186
-Dressed yet?
-No.

955
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:35,090
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

956
01:13:35,281 --> 01:13:37,928
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

957
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:41,534
-I need that money now, not later.
-When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

958
01:13:41,726 --> 01:13:43,566
Now!

959
01:13:47,057 --> 01:13:49,051
Hey, what's happening, man?

960
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:52,043
Wayne, I need to get
that $1 4 from you.

961
01:13:53,654 --> 01:13:55,417
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

962
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:58,563
-What? Why?
-Why what?

963
01:13:58,755 --> 01:14:01,019
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

964
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:03,128
I helped you move.

965
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:08,037
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

966
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:09,918
That's 200 yards.

967
01:14:10,109 --> 01:14:11,989
It's been four months, Wayne.

968
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:15,633
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

969
01:14:15,825 --> 01:14:18,048
-I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
-Go get my money.

970
01:14:18,241 --> 01:14:20,389
-Wayne, get my mo--
-I really don't, man. It's $1 4.

971
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,191
It's my $1 4!
Go get my money!

972
01:14:22,422 --> 01:14:24,877
-All of this for $1 4.
-Get my money, Wayne.

973
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:44,553
Dad, look at me!

974
01:14:44,975 --> 01:14:46,625
Dad.

975
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,959
-Should I go?
-Sure, man. Why not?

976
01:15:06,379 --> 01:15:07,376
-Stay here.
-Dad, look.

977
01:15:07,568 --> 01:15:09,103
-No, no. Stay right here.
-Dad.

978
01:15:09,294 --> 01:15:11,979
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

979
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,225
-Dad, where you going?
-Hey, what did I say?

980
01:15:23,139 --> 01:15:24,675
Dad!

981
01:15:24,906 --> 01:15:28,165
Dad, wait! Dad!

982
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:37,946
-Dad.
-I gotta--

983
01:15:38,138 --> 01:15:41,360
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

984
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:45,694
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

985
01:15:48,649 --> 01:15:51,218
Bring back my time machine!

986
01:15:52,522 --> 01:15:54,095
Bring my time machine back!

987
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:06,061
-Dad, where are we going?
-Just be quiet.

988
01:16:06,638 --> 01:16:09,284
Go get your things. Go.

989
01:16:31,493 --> 01:16:33,142
-Chris?
-Yes.

990
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:37,093
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

991
01:16:47,794 --> 01:16:50,173
Where are we going now?

992
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:54,047
Gotta-- We gotta
see somebody else.

993
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,074
I'm tired.

994
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,564
I know.

995
01:17:08,661 --> 01:17:12,574
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

996
01:17:12,994 --> 01:17:15,220
-I have to go now, Chris.
-No, no, no.

997
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:19,132
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

998
01:17:20,857 --> 01:17:23,045
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

999
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:25,959
-No, no. I have to fix it now.
-No.

1000
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:31,175
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1001
01:17:31,367 --> 01:17:33,401
I really have to go, Chris.

1002
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:36,200
Thank you. Thank you.

1003
01:17:36,392 --> 01:17:38,195
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1004
01:17:38,386 --> 01:17:39,998
I'll see you soon.

1005
01:18:29,861 --> 01:18:32,202
Why are our things here?

1006
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,734
Dad.

1007
01:19:15,507 --> 01:19:18,116
-Let's go. Come on.
-Where?

1008
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:21,873
-Just out of here.
-Why?

1009
01:19:22,066 --> 01:19:24,942
-We can't stay here tonight.
-Yes, we can. Open the door!

1010
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:28,011
-Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
-Open the door!

1011
01:19:29,622 --> 01:19:33,342
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1012
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:34,953
Stop it.

1013
01:19:39,019 --> 01:19:40,438
Come on.

1014
01:19:49,145 --> 01:19:50,565
Come on.

1015
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,477
Wayne!

1016
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,316
Wayne!

1017
01:20:18,182 --> 01:20:20,446
Wayne!

1018
01:20:35,326 --> 01:20:38,895
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1019
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,040
Where are we going?

1020
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:01,334
-Dad, where are we going?
-I don't know.

1021
01:21:16,177 --> 01:21:18,478
It's not a time machine.

1022
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,051
Dad.

1023
01:21:20,396 --> 01:21:21,662
It's not a time machine.

1024
01:21:21,854 --> 01:21:25,000
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1025
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:27,645
-What guy?
-The guy. He was at the park.

1026
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:29,717
He said it was a time machine.

1027
01:21:35,778 --> 01:21:36,966
Yes, it is.

1028
01:21:38,462 --> 01:21:40,188
No, it's not.

1029
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,025
-lt is.
-No, it's not.

1030
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:54,304
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1031
01:21:57,373 --> 01:21:58,485
Wanna push it?

1032
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:04,391
Okay.

1033
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:07,384
Come on.

1034
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,414
Come on, man.

1035
01:22:15,861 --> 01:22:16,858
Right here.

1036
01:22:17,242 --> 01:22:18,774
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1037
01:22:19,121 --> 01:22:21,039
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1038
01:22:21,575 --> 01:22:22,764
You gotta close your eyes.

1039
01:22:23,032 --> 01:22:24,836
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1040
01:22:26,907 --> 01:22:29,247
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1041
01:22:34,809 --> 01:22:36,535
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1042
01:22:37,225 --> 01:22:39,335
It takes a few seconds.

1043
01:22:41,636 --> 01:22:43,477
Oh, my goodness.

1044
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:45,741
Open, open, open!

1045
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:51,532
-What is it?
-Dinosaurs.

1046
01:22:51,762 --> 01:22:53,872
-Where?
-You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1047
01:22:55,176 --> 01:22:58,666
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1048
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,656
-Can you see them?
-Yeah.

1049
01:23:02,848 --> 01:23:04,190
Wait. Come on, come on.

1050
01:23:04,382 --> 01:23:05,649
-Wait, watch out.
-What is it?

1051
01:23:05,878 --> 01:23:07,834
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1052
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,327
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1053
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:11,862
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1054
01:23:12,552 --> 01:23:14,816
-Watch out!
-Whoa! Oh, my good-- A T. rex.

1055
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:18,497
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1056
01:23:19,418 --> 01:23:22,410
-We gotta find someplace safe.
-Like what?

1057
01:23:22,602 --> 01:23:24,480
We need a cave.

1058
01:23:24,672 --> 01:23:25,709
A cave?

1059
01:23:25,939 --> 01:23:27,856
-We gotta find a cave. Come on.
-Okay.

1060
01:23:28,047 --> 01:23:29,774
Come on, come on.

1061
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:32,613
Watch your back! Look out.

1062
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:34,760
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1063
01:23:34,952 --> 01:23:37,714
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1064
01:23:37,906 --> 01:23:39,095
Go ahead. Get in.

1065
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:41,089
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1066
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:48,147
-Are we safe?
-Yeah, I think so.

1067
01:24:53,316 --> 01:24:54,888
Hey.

1068
01:24:56,422 --> 01:24:57,995
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing good.

1069
01:24:58,186 --> 01:24:59,567
How are you getting along?

1070
01:24:59,759 --> 01:25:01,869
-Good. I'm good.
-You doing good?

1071
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:04,478
-How you doing?
-I'm doing great.

1072
01:25:05,589 --> 01:25:07,163
Where you going?

1073
01:25:10,307 --> 01:25:13,184
I-- Sacramento.

1074
01:25:13,837 --> 01:25:16,368
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from--

1075
01:25:16,559 --> 01:25:19,090
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over--

1076
01:25:19,283 --> 01:25:20,510
Get them over to us.

1077
01:25:20,702 --> 01:25:22,351
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1078
01:25:22,544 --> 01:25:24,309
Awesome.

1079
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,379
Hey, let them win a round.

1080
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,245
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1081
01:25:33,475 --> 01:25:36,428
-Where?
-He's outside. Please come with me.

1082
01:25:43,946 --> 01:25:45,442
Hi.

1083
01:25:48,664 --> 01:25:51,081
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1084
01:25:53,228 --> 01:25:54,801
We need a room.

1085
01:25:55,377 --> 01:25:58,215
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1086
01:25:58,407 --> 01:26:00,938
-There's just some glass work.
-Let me stop you right there.

1087
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:03,510
-I wish I could help you--
-This is my son, Christopher.

1088
01:26:03,815 --> 01:26:05,733
-He's 5 years old.
-Hi, baby.

1089
01:26:05,926 --> 01:26:08,878
-We need some place to stay.
-Okay, and I would love to help you...

1090
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,832
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1091
01:26:12,024 --> 01:26:14,939
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1092
01:26:15,131 --> 01:26:16,474
We gotta stay together.

1093
01:26:16,664 --> 01:26:18,007
We got-- We're--

1094
01:26:18,198 --> 01:26:19,925
-Okay, listen.
-You gotta have some place--

1095
01:26:20,156 --> 01:26:22,879
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1096
01:26:23,071 --> 01:26:24,528
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1097
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:27,980
-And where is it? Come on.
-Ellis and Jones.

1098
01:27:01,772 --> 01:27:07,181
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1099
01:27:07,564 --> 01:27:10,326
-Man.
-Hey, come on, man.

1100
01:27:10,518 --> 01:27:11,668
-Come on.
-Come on, what?

1101
01:27:11,861 --> 01:27:13,394
-Hey, that's my spot.
-Back off.

1102
01:27:13,587 --> 01:27:15,925
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't--

1103
01:27:18,227 --> 01:27:19,723
Dad!

1104
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:22,102
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1105
01:27:22,294 --> 01:27:23,828
Stop! Stop!

1106
01:27:24,019 --> 01:27:26,244
Get out of the line, both of you.
Both of you.

1107
01:27:26,436 --> 01:27:28,928
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1108
01:27:29,235 --> 01:27:31,078
I got here on time. I was in line.

1109
01:27:31,269 --> 01:27:32,956
I came from work, I got my son.

1110
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:35,564
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1111
01:27:35,794 --> 01:27:37,291
He sliced in front of him in line.

1112
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:39,707
-Who did?
-He did.

1113
01:27:39,976 --> 01:27:44,310
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1114
01:27:53,171 --> 01:27:55,087
That's it. No more.

1115
01:28:01,838 --> 01:28:04,679
-What's your favorite color?
-Green.

1116
01:28:04,869 --> 01:28:06,058
Green?

1117
01:28:06,289 --> 01:28:09,126
-What do you like that's green?
-Trees.

1118
01:28:09,356 --> 01:28:12,195
Trees. What else?

1119
01:28:12,426 --> 01:28:13,807
Holly.

1120
01:28:15,533 --> 01:28:19,330
-Holly. What's holly?
-The Christmas stuff.

1121
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,938
Christmas stuff.

1122
01:28:22,705 --> 01:28:24,393
What's that?

1123
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,261
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1124
01:28:36,553 --> 01:28:41,347
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1125
01:28:41,769 --> 01:28:43,456
Can you breathe?

1126
01:28:43,648 --> 01:28:45,796
-You're good?
-Yeah.

1127
01:28:46,219 --> 01:28:48,136
-I gotta go work on the scanner--
-Don't go.

1128
01:28:48,327 --> 01:28:51,396
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1129
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:55,578
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1130
01:28:56,038 --> 01:28:58,607
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1131
01:28:58,799 --> 01:29:01,177
I wanna go home.

1132
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:06,816
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1133
01:29:07,736 --> 01:29:09,424
All right?

1134
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:11,496
I'm gonna go out there.

1135
01:29:11,687 --> 01:29:14,909
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1136
01:29:15,944 --> 01:29:17,594
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1137
01:29:18,514 --> 01:29:20,548
-All right?
-All right.

1138
01:29:20,739 --> 01:29:23,003
You gotta trust me, okay?

1139
01:29:23,195 --> 01:29:25,112
You gotta trust me.

1140
01:29:25,956 --> 01:29:28,526
I trust you. I trust you.

1141
01:29:28,718 --> 01:29:30,098
I trust you.

1142
01:29:30,289 --> 01:29:33,166
-I can't hear you.
-I trust you. I trust you.

1143
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:38,460
Give me a kiss.

1144
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:53,458
-I'll just be a little while, okay?
-All right.

1145
01:29:53,918 --> 01:29:56,257
-I'll be right here.
-Okay.

1146
01:29:56,449 --> 01:29:58,560
-Can you still hear me?
-Yeah.

1147
01:29:58,751 --> 01:30:00,209
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1148
01:30:00,438 --> 01:30:02,817
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

1149
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:49,650
-Yeah.
-Like that?

1150
01:30:49,881 --> 01:30:53,371
-Yeah, put that....
-Then you go like that.

1151
01:30:53,563 --> 01:30:56,938
-ls that okay?
-I don't know. What do you think?

1152
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:58,127
Good.

1153
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:01,580
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1154
01:31:02,769 --> 01:31:05,608
-Hey, why don't you leave it?
-We can't.

1155
01:31:05,799 --> 01:31:07,832
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1156
01:31:08,023 --> 01:31:09,520
Go.

1157
01:31:14,659 --> 01:31:15,964
Hey, Chris.

1158
01:31:16,155 --> 01:31:19,377
-Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
-What's up?

1159
01:31:20,374 --> 01:31:21,486
Work trip.

1160
01:31:21,678 --> 01:31:23,827
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1161
01:31:24,057 --> 01:31:25,745
-Yes, she does.
-And you guys are both...

1162
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:27,510
...Iooking to retire at the same time?

1163
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,733
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1164
01:31:29,926 --> 01:31:31,306
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1165
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:34,835
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1166
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,251
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal...?

1167
01:31:37,443 --> 01:31:39,285
I learned to finish my work quickly.

1168
01:31:39,553 --> 01:31:41,663
I had to finish quickly.

1169
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:45,344
To get in line at Glide by 5.

1170
01:31:48,911 --> 01:31:50,753
Come on.

1171
01:31:51,213 --> 01:31:52,747
Come on.

1172
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:59,307
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1173
01:32:00,151 --> 01:32:01,839
My Captain America!

1174
01:32:02,068 --> 01:32:04,293
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1175
01:32:04,484 --> 01:32:07,630
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1176
01:32:09,855 --> 01:32:11,811
-Why don't you let the lady in?
-Hey, back up.

1177
01:32:12,003 --> 01:32:14,919
-Hey, man, that's not cool.
-Back up! Back up!

1178
01:32:22,896 --> 01:32:24,315
Come on.

1179
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:29,340
Dad, we need to get it!

1180
01:32:31,834 --> 01:32:34,365
The important thing about
that freedom train...

1181
01:32:34,557 --> 01:32:36,628
...is it's got to climb mountains.

1182
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:39,466
We all have to deal with mountains.

1183
01:32:39,658 --> 01:32:42,497
You know, mountains
that go way up high.

1184
01:32:42,879 --> 01:32:44,836
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1185
01:32:45,028 --> 01:32:46,217
-Amen, preacher!
-Yes.

1186
01:32:46,408 --> 01:32:48,634
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1187
01:32:48,941 --> 01:32:50,974
We sing about them.

1188
01:32:51,702 --> 01:32:56,995
Lord, don't move that mountain

1189
01:32:58,377 --> 01:33:04,514
Give me strength to climb it

1190
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:11,417
Please don't move
That stumbling block

1191
01:33:11,609 --> 01:33:17,900
But lead me, Lord, around it

1192
01:33:19,472 --> 01:33:24,305
My burdens, they get so heavy

1193
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:31,478
Seems hard to bear

1194
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:35,774
But I won't give up
No, no

1195
01:33:36,005 --> 01:33:37,922
Because you promised me

1196
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:44,597
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer

1197
01:33:44,788 --> 01:33:51,999
-Lord don't move that mountain
-Please don't move that mountain

1198
01:33:52,229 --> 01:33:57,254
But give me strength to climb it

1199
01:33:59,403 --> 01:34:01,319
When's your test?

1200
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,928
T omorrow.

1201
01:34:08,108 --> 01:34:09,835
Are you ready?

1202
01:34:13,595 --> 01:34:14,974
Of course.

1203
01:34:52,449 --> 01:34:53,715
Thank you, sir.

1204
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:04,801
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey.

1205
01:35:08,637 --> 01:35:11,512
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere...?

1206
01:35:11,704 --> 01:35:14,083
I have to go somewhere.

1207
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:17,343
-But I finished the whole thing too.
-Oh, good.

1208
01:35:17,534 --> 01:35:19,415
-You?
-Yeah.

1209
01:35:19,874 --> 01:35:22,714
-How'd you feel about the graphs?
-Easy.

1210
01:35:23,672 --> 01:35:27,584
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1211
01:35:27,776 --> 01:35:31,267
-Essay question?
-Yeah, on the back.

1212
01:35:40,779 --> 01:35:42,084
Hey, Chris.

1213
01:35:42,276 --> 01:35:45,421
-Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
-Yeah.

1214
01:35:45,612 --> 01:35:48,950
-Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
-I never actually got your number.

1215
01:35:50,637 --> 01:35:52,515
Here's my number. Call me, okay?

1216
01:35:52,707 --> 01:35:55,279
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1217
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:59,613
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1218
01:35:59,804 --> 01:36:01,991
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1219
01:36:02,182 --> 01:36:05,060
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1220
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:12,270
-I'll pay you back, honest.
-Five is good?

1221
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,952
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1222
01:36:28,763 --> 01:36:31,143
That's it. That's the room quota.

1223
01:36:31,525 --> 01:36:34,172
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1224
01:36:34,364 --> 01:36:37,164
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1225
01:36:37,356 --> 01:36:40,194
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1226
01:36:40,424 --> 01:36:44,529
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1227
01:37:18,091 --> 01:37:19,778
You like it?

1228
01:38:08,721 --> 01:38:12,251
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1229
01:38:15,204 --> 01:38:18,656
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1230
01:38:18,848 --> 01:38:21,533
-How much?
-Eight dollars.

1231
01:38:22,607 --> 01:38:25,791
-What's that?
-It's to repair the light.

1232
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,938
Can I see it?

1233
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:32,694
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1234
01:38:32,923 --> 01:38:37,221
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1235
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,174
I don't mind.

1236
01:38:40,635 --> 01:38:42,360
Yeah, you will.

1237
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:00,273
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1238
01:39:00,464 --> 01:39:01,578
Okay.

1239
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:04,723
-Warm enough?
-Yeah.

1240
01:39:04,992 --> 01:39:06,602
All right.

1241
01:39:08,634 --> 01:39:11,397
Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:18,646
-What?
-Did Mom leave because of me?

1243
01:39:23,018 --> 01:39:27,354
Don't-- Don't even think
something like that.

1244
01:39:28,388 --> 01:39:30,421
Mom left because of Mom.

1245
01:39:30,652 --> 01:39:32,800
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1246
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:35,293
Okay.

1247
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:46,724
You're a good papa.

1248
01:39:54,242 --> 01:39:56,159
All right, go to sleep.

1249
01:39:56,926 --> 01:39:59,764
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1250
01:40:53,886 --> 01:40:55,805
So far, so good, Chris.

1251
01:41:01,635 --> 01:41:04,090
-lt works.
-Thank you very much.

1252
01:41:04,281 --> 01:41:07,963
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.

1253
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:12,336
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1254
01:41:12,528 --> 01:41:15,174
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1255
01:41:16,286 --> 01:41:17,859
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

1256
01:41:18,051 --> 01:41:19,316
Thank you. Thank you.

1257
01:41:19,508 --> 01:41:21,388
-You ready?
-Yep.

1258
01:41:23,228 --> 01:41:25,991
-Are we going to the church place?
-No.

1259
01:41:26,221 --> 01:41:28,101
Where are we going, then?

1260
01:41:28,868 --> 01:41:31,322
-Probably stay at a hotel.
-A hotel?

1261
01:41:31,514 --> 01:41:32,511
Just for the night.

1262
01:41:32,741 --> 01:41:35,389
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1263
01:41:35,581 --> 01:41:37,230
No, thank you.

1264
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:39,838
-Ever?
-I hope not.

1265
01:41:40,068 --> 01:41:41,448
Why not?

1266
01:41:41,641 --> 01:41:44,326
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1267
01:41:44,518 --> 01:41:46,780
...and then not so much the next.

1268
01:41:46,972 --> 01:41:49,733
-Like the bus?
-Yeah, like the bus.

1269
01:41:49,925 --> 01:41:52,993
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh,
should I?

1270
01:42:05,498 --> 01:42:07,110
Sometimes when we're moving
at night...

1271
01:42:07,302 --> 01:42:09,948
...we pass houses with lights
and people.

1272
01:42:10,677 --> 01:42:12,479
Sometimes you can
hear them laugh.

1273
01:42:17,659 --> 01:42:20,880
The next day, after work...

1274
01:42:21,072 --> 01:42:23,219
... we just went to the beach.

1275
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:25,252
Far away from anything.

1276
01:42:25,444 --> 01:42:26,749
Everything.

1277
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:28,512
Just Christopher and me.

1278
01:42:30,086 --> 01:42:32,347
-Did you see me?
-Yeah.

1279
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:35,532
Far away from buses and noise...

1280
01:42:35,723 --> 01:42:41,132
...and a constant disappointment
in my ten-gallon head...

1281
01:42:42,244 --> 01:42:44,047
...and myself.

1282
01:42:44,622 --> 01:42:46,886
-Chris, thank you very much.
-Well, thank you, Dean.

1283
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:48,842
-Take care.
-You made all the right moves.

1284
01:42:49,034 --> 01:42:50,492
Thanks, Chris.

1285
01:42:52,485 --> 01:42:53,790
Because when I was young...

1286
01:42:53,982 --> 01:42:57,587
...and I'd get an A on a history test
or whatever...

1287
01:42:57,779 --> 01:43:02,190
...I'd get this good feeling about
all the things that I could be.

1288
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:07,483
And then I never became
any of them.

1289
01:43:14,694 --> 01:43:17,110
-Hey, Chris.
-Hey.

1290
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:19,834
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing fine.

1291
01:43:20,026 --> 01:43:24,015
Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1292
01:43:24,206 --> 01:43:25,588
Yeah, yeah.

1293
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:29,424
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1294
01:43:29,616 --> 01:43:31,187
I guess.

1295
01:43:34,025 --> 01:43:36,175
So one more day.

1296
01:43:36,366 --> 01:43:37,900
Getting nervous?

1297
01:43:38,437 --> 01:43:40,700
-No, I'm okay.
-Yeah?

1298
01:43:40,891 --> 01:43:42,773
Listen, whatever happens...

1299
01:43:42,963 --> 01:43:45,304
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1300
01:43:45,495 --> 01:43:46,990
I mean that.

1301
01:43:47,797 --> 01:43:49,523
Take care of yourself.

1302
01:44:03,906 --> 01:44:06,975
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1303
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:09,276
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1304
01:44:09,468 --> 01:44:11,885
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1305
01:44:12,383 --> 01:44:13,994
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1306
01:44:14,608 --> 01:44:16,142
Yes, sir.

1307
01:44:16,372 --> 01:44:17,676
No, sir, that's it.

1308
01:44:17,869 --> 01:44:20,247
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1309
01:44:21,781 --> 01:44:24,543
Chris. Come.

1310
01:44:50,816 --> 01:44:53,770
-Hi, Chris.
-Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1311
01:44:54,882 --> 01:44:56,723
-Nice shirt.
-Thank you, sir.

1312
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:58,067
-Chris.
-Hey, Jay.

1313
01:44:58,487 --> 01:45:02,591
-Chris.
-Chris, sit down, please.

1314
01:45:05,392 --> 01:45:09,304
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1315
01:45:09,496 --> 01:45:11,377
You know,
being the last day and all.

1316
01:45:11,567 --> 01:45:14,789
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1317
01:45:15,634 --> 01:45:17,321
But...

1318
01:45:17,551 --> 01:45:20,198
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1319
01:45:20,429 --> 01:45:23,228
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1320
01:45:23,919 --> 01:45:27,026
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1321
01:45:28,329 --> 01:45:30,055
Would you like that, Chris?

1322
01:45:30,938 --> 01:45:32,472
Yes, sir.

1323
01:45:32,663 --> 01:45:35,886
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1324
01:45:36,844 --> 01:45:39,875
So welcome.

1325
01:45:41,678 --> 01:45:46,434
-Was it as easy as it looked?
-No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1326
01:45:48,697 --> 01:45:50,997
-Good luck, Chris.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1327
01:45:57,137 --> 01:45:58,938
Oh, Chris.

1328
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:03,350
I almost forgot.

1329
01:46:05,306 --> 01:46:06,801
Thank you.

1330
01:46:26,364 --> 01:46:28,473
This part of my life...

1331
01:46:29,317 --> 01:46:31,427
...this little part...

1332
01:46:34,649 --> 01:46:37,180
...is called "Happiness. "

1333
01:47:21,981 --> 01:47:25,433
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1334
01:47:53,894 --> 01:47:56,195
So how many...

1335
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,266
...planets are there?

1336
01:47:59,493 --> 01:48:01,220
-Seven.
-Seven?

1337
01:48:01,719 --> 01:48:03,445
Nine.

1338
01:48:05,746 --> 01:48:07,703
Who's the king of the jungle?

1339
01:48:08,086 --> 01:48:10,734
-Gorilla.
-The gorilla?

1340
01:48:11,001 --> 01:48:12,343
The gorilla?

1341
01:48:12,535 --> 01:48:14,147
No. Lion.

1342
01:48:14,339 --> 01:48:16,832
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

1343
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:21,702
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1344
01:48:21,894 --> 01:48:23,736
-Who's there?
-Shelby.

1345
01:48:23,928 --> 01:48:25,001
Shelby who?

1346
01:48:25,193 --> 01:48:28,837
Shelby coming around the mountain
When she comes

1347
01:48:29,642 --> 01:48:30,946
-Knock knock.
-Who's there?

1348
01:48:31,138 --> 01:48:33,517
-Nobody.
-Nobody who?

1349
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,048
Nobody who?

1350
01:48:39,232 --> 01:48:42,070
Now, that's funny. I like that one.

1351
01:48:58,622 --> 01:49:17,739
THE END
