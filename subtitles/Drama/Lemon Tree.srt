00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,986
<i>Episode 23</i>

2
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:20,955
Hand over Jeong Gi Joon.

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,663
Then that would be the base
of trust you yourself create, no?

4
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:37,613
And as the head of the
political faction called Milbon,

5
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:39,756
inside the royal court,

6
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:43,989
you could just insist on
a genuine parliament, no?

7
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:00,972
You take the Haerye
and block the letters

8
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:05,329
and I, afterward

9
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:11,157
I'll spearhead Milbon and
realize Teacher Sambong's will.

10
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,013
Is it power you want?

11
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,381
If my desire

12
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,857
to create the good nation

13
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:28,990
of my thinking and of my
creed is greed for power,

14
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,798
then greed for power it is.

15
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:38,599
My identity as Milbon has been made known
to the King already, hence I can longer achieve
fame and prestige as a Confucian scholar.

16
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,204
However, I have no intention to
surrender as the King desires either.

17
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,973
What do you want?

18
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:52,720
Hand over the names of
all Milbon members to me.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,761
And declare me as the new Bonwon

20
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:00,190
and hand over the Milbon pledge to me.

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,502
Then you will give me Haerye?

22
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:11,343
Though the King has yet to appoint the date,
he has already declared he will promulgate the letters.

23
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:14,640
He would not promulgate
without the Haerye.

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,199
Hence, the Haerye is the best
weapon to block the promulgation.

25
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,114
I will make it so that you can
have the Haerye at once, Bonwon.

26
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:30,317
In everything, do as you will.

27
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:37,396
Except, not as Milbon's Bonwon,
but personally, as Jeong Gi Joon.

28
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,932
When do you want to hear my reply?

29
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,287
There isn't time.

30
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:51,572
I want the answer by
the day after tomorrow.

31
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:55,957
I will be at the inn in Mapo.
Contact me.

32
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:58,108
I will wait.

33
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:18,774
Why did you select Lee Shin Jeok between
Lee Shin Jeok and Shim Jong Soo?

34
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:19,533
Yes.

35
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:26,440
Minister Lee Shin Jeok is a veteran, so he doesn't
hold much influence over the young members.

36
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,032
Wouldn't Shim Jong Soo be
better suited to move Milbon?

37
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,862
That's possible.

38
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:43,224
However, Shim Jong Soo is lacking
in trickery, compared to Lee Shin Jeok.

39
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,282
What trickery?

40
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:48,829
Political influence, I mean.

41
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,766
All the subjects in the current royal court,

42
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:57,371
though they may each have
their fault, none are stupid.

43
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,375
They are all people to be feared.

44
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,540
Among them, to be able
to rise to the top three,

45
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,299
means he stands atop
the vertex among the fierce.

46
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,690
Though Lee Shin Jeok
is avaricious as a scholar,

47
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,494
in the ability to draw people to his side,

48
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:22,396
he is even greater than Minister Hwang Hee.

49
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:29,014
He is someone who won't hesitate to use witchcraft
if he deems the circumstance ill. So of course.

50
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:32,213
Why would you want to
appoint someone like him?

51
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:35,576
If I am to remove this and that among all,

52
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:40,587
would Minister Hwang Hee still be alive?

53
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:46,053
Since in the end, the seat of the
King isn't to remove those people,

54
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:53,060
it is to control them so that their
skills are used to better the citizenry.

55
00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:00,034
And we are now at a time when Lee Shin
Jeok's evil sleight of hand is most needed.

56
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:06,674
Even if it is by mobilizing his tricks, so that
Jeong Gi Joon can be handed over to us,

57
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:10,478
Lee Shin Jeok must find the way to do so.

58
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,751
At times, Your Majesty is truly...

59
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:21,489
Do you mean I am more cunning than my father?

60
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,025
Can't be... the royal guard commander?

61
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,225
That's what I was about to say.

63
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:36,203
My heart lives in hell.
Would I be Bodhisattva?

64
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:44,378
There are times when the process is important
and there are times when the result is important.

65
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:49,149
In creating the letters, the process
of making them is important.

66
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:55,489
But in their promulgation,
the result is important.

67
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:59,386
We must win.

68
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:03,330
<i>So that we can promulgate.</i>

69
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,234
A win is needed so that the work can start.

70
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:13,441
We must win, so that this
work for the citizens can start.

71
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:23,581
Lee Shin Jeok, you mustn't disappoint me.

72
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:26,553
No matter what.

73
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:39,133
<i>Hand over Jeong Gi Joon.</i>

74
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:45,272
<i>Then that would be the base
of trust you yourself create, no?</i>

75
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:52,113
<i>The one who betrayed Milbon is you, Bonwon.</i>

76
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:57,418
<i>My allegiance wasn't to
power or to Milbon or you.</i>

77
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,589
<i>It was solely to the great
cause of a genuine parliament.</i>

78
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:20,274
<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Deep Rooted Friends @ viki.com</i>

79
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:27,081
<i>I am a Confucian scholar of Joseon,
the beginning of Joseon and the root of Joseon.</i>

80
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:31,218
<i>This is my path.</i>

81
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,922
<i>It's him!
That guy!</i>

82
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:42,596
I heard two warriors and maidens
crossed by boat yesterday during the day.

83
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:46,167
Oh, I guess you're talking about them.

84
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,702
Yes, those people from yesterday.

85
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,705
They went to Daeseong Mountain.

86
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:51,639
Daeseong Mountain.

87
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,140
Yup, Daeseong Mountain.

88
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,476
It's a placed called Rabbit Rock.

89
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,178
Aigo...

90
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,880
The boat couldn't sail
smoothly so it was rough.

91
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,082
Take us there too.

92
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:02,883
Again?

93
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,251
How much will do?

94
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,520
We'll pay you all the way.

95
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,188
Well then, sure.

96
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,323
Get on.

97
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:15,863
You go and report to Royal Guard Commander
at once, and wait at the palace.

98
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:19,433
We'll contact you as soon
as we grasp the location.

99
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,702
Okay... be careful.

100
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,970
Let's go.

101
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:31,278
Hey, why are you getting on?

102
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,147
I need to take revenge too.

103
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:34,381
The scum who killed my sibling!

104
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,750
I'll do it.

105
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,985
I'm the reincarnation of revenge.

106
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:42,422
So you hurry and go home and
feed your sibling a memorial meal.

107
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,860
He must be quite hungry (from the other world).

108
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,727
But still...

109
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:50,698
A punk like you getting involved is
just a matter of time before you die.

110
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,267
Here, we're departing.

111
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,002
Hurry and go!

112
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:04,345
Do you see anything?

113
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,641
Nothing except the warriors.

114
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,520
Same on this side.

115
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,319
We must find a way to get out.

116
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,500
No matter how, we must complete our mission.

117
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:20,619
What?

118
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:21,456
Daeseong Mountain?

119
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:22,887
Yes, Rabbit Rock.

120
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,952
Chae Yoon and Cho Tak
are already on their way there.

121
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,004
Is this accurate information?

122
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:28,576
Yes, it's accurate!

123
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:34,542
Hence, please prepare so that the royal guard troop
can move at once as soon as the contact comes.

124
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:36,346
I got it.

125
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:40,743
You two take the first team of Palace Guard and prepare
so that Chae Yoon's message can come without fail.

126
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:42,135
Yes.

127
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:48,220
Their location is finally identified?

128
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,149
Yes.

129
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,489
Once their exact location is verified,
he will send a message to us.

130
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,691
Chae Yoon.

131
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,731
You must find So Yi.

132
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,982
You must.

133
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,141
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

134
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:12,541
<i>I will return for sure.</i>

135
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,356
<i>Since you need to leave tomorrow,
hurry and see to the preparation.</i>

136
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:40,045
<i>You should bow when
you return. What is this?</i>

137
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,308
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

138
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:49,173
<i>Your Majesty said,</i>

139
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:52,013
<i>the promise to Kang Chae Yoon...</i>

140
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:58,761
<i>Yes, after this work is done, leave
with that punk who has no manners.</i>

141
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:07,166
<i>Though I can't pull out a fortune for you,
I'll put together enough gold for a house.</i>

142
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:14,852
<i>I just hope that punk
won't make you go hungry.</i>

143
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,680
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

144
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,779
<i>So Yi.</i>

145
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:52,074
<i>Thank you.</i>

146
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,278
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

147
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:04,148
<i>Though it's true I wish
for you to be at my side,</i>

148
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:13,575
<i>it seems I will get to
breathe at last once you leave.</i>

149
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:19,998
<i>Isn't that true for you as well?</i>

150
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:27,243
<i>Day by day,</i>

151
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:30,744
<i>you must live in joy.</i>

152
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:33,014
<i>Together with Kang Chae Yoon.</i>

153
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,015
<i>Promise me.</i>

154
00:12:55,134 --> 00:13:03,141
<i>Your Majesty.
I will surely keep my promise to you.</i>

155
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:11,221
<i>There must be a way.
There has to be. Surely.</i>

156
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,560
What?

157
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,675
Why did you bring the kid here?

158
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:24,090
She was in danger because of me.

159
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,572
There was... someone chasing us.

160
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,681
How much danger
could the kid be in!?

161
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,273
To bring the kid here
under the situation?

162
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:33,861
Just leave it be.

163
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:47,456
Instead of Gaepayi
going out to see her,

164
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:50,858
it is better that Yeon Doo is here.

165
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,855
You did well to bring her here.

166
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,268
As everyone here knows,

167
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:06,440
I've conveyed all of
my intentions last time.

168
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,979
I will acknolwedge Milbon as
a political party and accept them.

169
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:15,889
I said, "come to the court
before the day of promulgation."

170
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:21,415
However, no one has yet come.

171
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:26,161
Hence, I will now make
my final proposition.

172
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:34,970
Promulgation of the letters...
on the sanghan (first ten days) of the 9th month.

173
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:38,940
Amidst the gaze of ten
thousand citizens, I will carry it out.

174
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:43,612
Your Majesty!

175
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:48,550
The Ministry of Personnel is to install Eonmun
(Hangul book) and Jeongeum (Hangul typeset) Bureau.

176
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,559
And the Ministry of Rites is to
adopt the letters into the civil exams.

177
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,124
Make preparations to carry it out.

178
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:59,294
Your Majesty, it mustn't!

179
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:02,230
Yes, it can't!

180
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,634
It cannot be!

181
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:11,707
But why is everyone like this?

182
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:17,078
I clearly said it was
a proposition, didn't I?

183
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:20,348
What kind of a nation is Joseon?

184
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:27,389
Is it a nation where a monarch's pressing of
independant threats are automatically carried out?

185
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:32,327
Joseon undoubtedly has
a system of State Council.

186
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:40,468
Hence what I have proposed just needs
to be determined by the State Council.

187
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:46,147
Just as I mentioned, the Ministry of Personnel
and the Ministry of Rites prepare to carry it out,

188
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:51,155
and submit their plans to the State Council, and the
three high councilors can discuss matters thoroughly,

189
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:53,575
and then determine a yes or no.

190
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:59,754
And I will make the decree
in accordance with their decision,

191
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,226
Hence, the most important event
of the promulgation of the letters,

192
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:07,629
rests on the approval
of the three state councilors.

193
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:11,066
Your Majesty!
That is still not permissible!

194
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,468
If you insist on the promulgation of letters...

195
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:15,103
Look here!

196
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:20,375
Didn't His Majesty just order the three state
councilors to make the decision after discussing it?

197
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:24,579
Hence, you just need to wait for the decision
by the State Council, Deputy Chief Scholar.

198
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:41,029
<i>Is that your answer to last night?</i>

199
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:45,734
<i>I haven't made a decision yet.</i>

200
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:50,338
<i>It just means I will put effort in it.</i>

201
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,145
Your Majesty.

202
00:16:57,446 --> 00:17:01,016
Do you think we will receive the approval
from the three state councilors?

203
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:05,053
I'm not sure.

204
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,958
Now we've done our best,
so we await God's disposition, no?

205
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:18,099
You guys work toward persuading
just one more if possible.

206
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,768
Yes.

207
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:27,276
Speeding up the Dong-guk-jeong-woon
[instructions of phonological structure of Chinese characters]
will be an asset in persuading the aristocrats.

208
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:28,452
Yes.

209
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,345
We will work with all our heart.

210
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:32,280
Alright.

211
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:46,194
Your Majesty,
I've completed the preface.

212
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,000
The reason for the creation of the letters,

213
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,833
and the excellent qualities to these letters,

214
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,772
I've included the principle
of all things in universe.

215
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,108
Alright.

216
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:05,146
Has Your Majesty completed the foreword?

217
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:08,817
I haven't.

218
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:23,431
<i> Our nation's speech is different from that of
China, so the language does not match the writing,</i>

219
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:28,003
<i>For this reason,
even if the ignorant citizenry</i>

220
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:32,207
<i>has the will to communicate, in the end,</i>

221
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:36,344
<i>many cannot express their intention.</i>

222
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:39,447
<i>Hence, I, for this...</i>

223
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,021
But this is where I'm stuck.

224
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:50,091
How is it that I can't seize it?

225
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,795
Such a...

226
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,766
Then, Your Majesty...

227
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:02,671
Postpone the promulgation,
even just for a few days.

228
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:07,209
Are you saying to postpone just
because I didn't quite write the foreward?

229
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:10,545
As you already know, we haven't got the
Jejahae (explanation of the design of the letters).

230
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,583
We cannot miss the promulgation no matter what.

231
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,019
With the dispersal already failed as is,

232
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:20,322
we must secure the knot when it's hard.

233
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:22,624
However, Your Majesty,

234
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:31,266
if we only recite the preface but not the explanation,
how is that really a promulgation of the letters?

235
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:38,574
Shall I look through the materials and see if I
can make a brief Jejahae (explanation of design)?

236
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:41,109
Don't do it.

237
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:45,914
Since without So Yi, we can't make a perfect
Jejahae before the promulgation anyway.

238
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:52,254
Isn't she the only person who knows the entire
process from the start of the creation of the letters?

239
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,427
It is not that I don't know Your Majesty's
heart of waiting for So Yi...

240
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:07,535
If perchance, So Yi won't
arrive by the promulgation...

241
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,359
<i>Tsk, tsk, So Yi...</i>

242
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:20,831
<i>Didn't I tell you to do not do it?</i>

243
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:23,623
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

244
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,086
<i>How come...?</i>

245
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:30,891
<I>After you come back from completing
the circulation mission, then write it.

246
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:33,863
<i>But, Your Majesty,</i>

247
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,744
<I>to prepare for the perchance...

248
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:38,682
<i>Where the first sound "geu" began,</i>

249
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:42,896
<i>and where the middle
sound "yeo" began,</i>

250
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:46,100
<i>you are the only one
who knows them all.</i>

251
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,860
<i>Though I explained each step
along the process to you,</i>

252
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,028
<i>I don't remember.</i>

253
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:53,463
<i>No.</i>

254
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:56,500
<i>I had no reason to remember.</i>

255
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,271
<i>And I don't have it written down anywhere,
for fear it may leak out somewhere.</i>

256
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:08,205
<i>Hence, you are the only one who knows
the explanation to the designs of our letters.</i>

257
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:11,735
<i>Hence, Your Majesty,</i>

258
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:13,183
<i>I will write it now before I leave.</i>

259
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,719
<i>I don't want you to.</i>

260
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:18,088
<i>I won't take it from you.</i>

261
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,369
<i>If by chance, I...
before promulgation...</i>

262
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,342
<i>Come back.</i>

263
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:30,867
<i>As for me, I will do what I
have to do inside the palace.</i>

264
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:34,281
<i>As for you, you also
complete your work,</i>

265
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,506
<i>and without fail,</i>

266
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,276
<i>come back safely.</i>

267
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,413
<i>The promulgation of the letters,</i>

268
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:47,150
<i>you have to see it with your own eyes.</i>

269
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:53,740
<i>Do you understand?</i>

270
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,626
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

271
00:21:56,626 --> 00:22:01,732
<i>I'l definitely come back.</i>

272
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:09,139
So Yi will come.

273
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:10,240
Your Majesty.

274
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,223
We...

275
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:14,511
should do our work.

276
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:20,118
And you must persuade
Choi Man Li to the end.

277
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:23,687
Yes.

278
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:35,350
What do you think,
First State Councilor?

279
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:39,703
His Majesty said he would receive the
sanction by the three state councilors.

280
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:43,337
So shouldn't we discuss it?

281
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:44,541
We have to.

282
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:49,546
However, both His Majesty's words,
as well as the words of the subjects,

283
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:52,749
I believe they all make sense.

284
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:54,518
Then...

285
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:57,487
How are we to do decide?

286
00:22:57,487 --> 00:23:03,701
I believe it is best we choose
the one with the stronger will.

287
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:08,298
What about you,
Left State Councilor?

288
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:11,902
I don't know.

289
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:16,273
My seat as State Council isn't a seat where
my personal opinion matters most, right?

290
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:20,071
To understand the intention of all
ministers and officials before deciding,

291
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:23,531
is the seat of the Left State Councilor, no?

292
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:27,751
However, I wonder what
Right State Councilor thinks.

293
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:30,087
Right State Councilor would
be the same, I believe.

294
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:33,223
He would study the sentiment
of the court vassals.

295
00:23:33,223 --> 00:23:34,991
But...

296
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:38,229
Right State Councilor personally,

297
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:41,341
would not object, I daresay.

298
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:55,979
Look here, Man Li!

299
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,515
[ resignation letter ]

300
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:01,251
Have a drink with me today.

301
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:04,700
Don't try to dissuade me.

302
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,023
Even if I am to live with the
grudge of having to resign,

303
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:10,026
I'll be against it till the end.

304
00:24:10,694 --> 00:24:16,166
Even if the promulgation of the letters is to become
that which is colossal and inevitable in history,

305
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:20,676
someone like me needs to object.

306
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:24,975
That is what makes Joseon
a nation of debateand verification.

307
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:27,711
Isn't that a testament of it?

308
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:32,315
Do you...really have to do this?

309
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:34,384
Except for this,

310
00:24:34,384 --> 00:24:37,354
I will not incite the scholar officials,

311
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:40,791
nor regulate them.

312
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:52,502
It's nearly time for the promulgation.

313
00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:56,388
What if you confess
yourself to His Majesty now?

314
00:24:56,388 --> 00:25:00,057
You just need to follow me.

315
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:01,545
Yes.

316
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:05,026
Is there anyone outside?

317
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,485
Yes, Sir.

318
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:13,423
Send a message to Gyun Jeok Hee.

319
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:16,259
Find out where Vice-Deputy Chief-Scholar
Shim Jeong Soo is lodged.

320
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:17,861
Yes.

321
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,237
What? He will do as the
three state councilors decide?

322
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:28,405
Yes.

323
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:32,843
And in addition, the promulgation date has been
set as the sanghan (first ten days) of the 9th month.

324
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:35,078
So we only have a few days left.

325
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:37,881
He's bent on pushing it forward.

326
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:41,109
<i>How will Lee Shin Jeok act?</i>

327
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,764
<i>Has he already gone
to His Majesty's side?</i>

328
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:47,524
No one has come forward as being
Milbon inside the palace as of yet?

329
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:50,927
Yes, no one has come forward yet.

330
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,831
That's a relief.

331
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:58,568
No Milbon has fallen for
His Majesty's sweet-talk.

332
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:02,511
Of course his words all sound right.

333
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,508
Almost ideal.

334
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,877
Acknowledge Milbon as a
political faction and embrace it?

335
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:11,010
However, His Majesty won't live forever.

336
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:16,125
Also, when and how His
Majesty might change his mind

337
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,587
we can't predict.

338
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:20,290
And after His Majesty passes away,

339
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:27,124
whether the next and the next king after
that will acknowledge us as a political faction,

340
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:29,599
no one knows.

341
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,501
Hence,

342
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:34,304
Milbon must remain a secret society.

343
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:39,036
So that regardless of what kind of a king is to
ascend, our existence won't be threatened by him.

344
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:40,410
<i>Sir!</i>

345
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,245
What's the matter?

346
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,726
You are truly an untrustworthy person!

347
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:15,412
No message from Kang Chae Yoon still?

348
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:17,047
Yes.

349
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:20,083
Still no news.

350
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:41,551
We just keep going in circles.

351
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,807
This mountain... something's strange.

352
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:46,843
The temple where those
scums were at last time,

353
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:50,480
it was as if though they knew I was coming.

354
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,517
They suddenly disappeared.
That's what I sensed.

355
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:55,719
How did they know I was coming?

356
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:57,854
Why are you thinking
about some other matter?

357
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:01,391
That's there, but this
is Daeseong Mountain.

358
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:05,162
I'm saying that because I get the same weird
sense here in this mountain just like that time there.

359
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:07,197
What's weird, you mean?

360
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:09,849
I don't know.

361
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,701
We circled the mountain many times.

362
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:15,705
But we didn't see even one animal.
Isn't that weird?

363
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:18,008
Now that you mention it, I didn't see any.

364
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:21,378
But how can a mountain, no animals...

365
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:24,880
not one is sighted?

366
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:32,823
I found out later, too, that
the King was feeling me out.

367
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:35,758
That Minister Hwang Hee
didn't put in a resignation letter...

368
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,428
I found out later and I was shocked too.

369
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:41,999
This is the King's discord-producing measure.

370
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:47,204
But how could you just act upon things
without even confirming with me first?

371
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:50,006
Yet I didn't see you as that...

372
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:51,775
You disappoint me so much!

373
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:54,778
So you sent Gyun Jeok Hee?

374
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:57,147
Right!
I did!

375
00:28:57,147 --> 00:28:59,816
Did you expect me to stay still?

376
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:02,685
A misunderstanding starts from something petty.

377
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:05,488
But once it starts to go
awry, it can't be controlled.

378
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:06,808
But you know that too!

379
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:09,826
This is why whether it's the matter to
put a genuine parliament into realization,

380
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:14,245
or to preserve Milbon,
how am I to work with you?

381
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:20,637
The situation gets more dire by the day now that
the King has declared a date for the promulgation!

382
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:22,953
Think carefully.

383
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:28,805
Bonwon must be devising
his last strategy as well.

384
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,677
Why this damned shit!

385
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:34,563
It's all gone bad now.
All wrong!

386
00:29:34,563 --> 00:29:39,207
Our plan to preserve Milbon apart
from Bonwon has all gone awry now!

387
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,354
Not yet.

388
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:47,095
Why do you mean?

389
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:51,661
Then you have some brilliant move?

390
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:54,579
I found out where the Haerye is.

391
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:59,503
And I asked him to name
me as the next Bonwon.

392
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:02,102
What?

393
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:04,407
You?

394
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:11,281
So in the end,
you achieved it?

395
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:14,084
Finally...

396
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,686
Hence,

397
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:18,655
what was Bonwon's reply?

398
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:21,725
He said he would give me
his answer by dawn tomorrow.

399
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:26,163
We agreed to meet near the mountain.

400
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:29,166
He will give you the answer?

401
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:32,836
Tomorrow at dawn?

402
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:40,417
So tomorrow at dawn.

403
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:44,754
I mustn't miss Shim Jong Soo's movements.

404
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:59,098
<i>The King said he will promulgate
on the sanghan date of the 9th month.</i>

405
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:02,953
So he is bent on pressing it forward.

406
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:06,715
But he said he would receive the approval of
the three state councilors of the State Council.

407
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:08,990
And he will follow their decision.

408
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,755
The approval of the
three state councilors?

409
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:12,148
Yes.

410
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:15,167
He told the three state councilors
to determine yes or no, I'm told.

411
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,792
But that is, you see...

412
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:21,529
Wouldn't that mean the King and the three
state councilors already have a pledge?

413
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,247
Hence, Minister Lee Shin Jeok has already...

414
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:25,569
That must be the case.

415
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,938
That punk must have,
for his own sake.

416
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:32,875
Therefore, the three state councilors would
surely sanction the promulgation of the letters.

417
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,808
And if that's the case,
the Milbon members will falter.

418
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:39,408
Some might even turn themselves in.

419
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:44,145
In the end, the King would be successful in
his measure to cause discord inside Milbon,

420
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:46,421
and he would promulgate
the letters as well.

421
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:51,297
However, Lee Do does
not have the Haerye.

422
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:52,411
What?

423
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:56,293
The King doesn't have the Haerye?

424
00:31:56,293 --> 00:32:00,631
Shim Jong Soo said he
would give me the Haerye.

425
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:02,860
What would that signify?

426
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:08,247
The Haerye is not inside the palace.

427
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:09,037
Then?

428
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:14,703
We get a hold of the Haerye first and we block
the circulation of the letters from the first cause.

429
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,885
What do you mean first cause?

430
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:23,851
I will kill all who know
the letters afterwards.

431
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:26,513
Truly...

432
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:30,864
You truly intend to do that?

433
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:37,342
Hasn't Lee Do already created the
match called promulgation ceremony?

434
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:43,106
Did you say the promulgation
ceremony was tomorrow?

435
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:51,297
By tomorrow, have them
have the poison ready.

436
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:52,816
By poison, you mean...

437
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:56,452
In the arrows, as well as
the swords and the spears.

438
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:59,749
They all need poison.

439
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:05,028
We must kill everyone with the attack.

440
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:10,431
And the Haerye must be
destroyed no matter what.

441
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:14,982
Even if everyone's killed,
if the Haerye remains,

442
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:18,047
the letters will revive.

443
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:22,505
Those who know the letters,
as well as the seeds of the letters...

444
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:28,496
All must be destroyed.

445
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:31,825
And the aftermath?

446
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:40,059
What about Milbon after that?

447
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,127
Bonwon.

448
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:45,596
What do you think
about Shim Jong Soo?

449
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:52,784
I don't think it's possible.

450
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:55,431
There are too many warriors.

451
00:33:55,431 --> 00:34:00,539
Even if we flee, we'll
be caught again at once.

452
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:06,623
Yeon Doo?

453
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:08,992
It's Yeon Doo!

454
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:11,406
From the Banchon tavern?

455
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:13,589
What is she doing here?

456
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:15,031
She's close with Gaepayi.

457
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:16,422
Gaepayi must have brought her here.

458
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:17,397
Good thing.

459
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:19,769
Let's ask her to rescue us.

460
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:20,601
Yeon Doo!

461
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:23,388
Why this chit... is she crazy?

462
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:24,908
Broadcast to the whole
neighborhood, why don't you!

463
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:27,196
Then what?

464
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:29,309
We need to get her to come.

465
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:31,909
Give me your handkerchief.

466
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,720
Alright.

467
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,461
Yeon Doo...

468
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:54,061
Please look at this direction.

469
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,211
She saw!

470
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:03,313
Yeon Doo saw!

471
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,335
Come out.

472
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:29,588

00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,910
Why?

474
00:35:33,907 --> 00:35:36,121
Why do you help the King?

475
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:39,916
Did you call for me because
you were curious about that?

476
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:44,588
Isn't he the enemy who killed your father?

477
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:47,457
So much so that you couldn't even sleep.

478
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:50,760
You suffered such a gruesome plight, didn't you?

479
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,086
Like I did.

480
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:56,500
And in addition,

481
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,803
like me, you blamed yourself.

482
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:03,673
For that one childish act during youth,

483
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:10,455
from which the event originated,
there is self-blame you can't escape.

484
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:15,085
That self-guilt.

485
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,187
Isn't it so?

486
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:20,290
It's true.

487
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,994
It's possible that we suffered the same plight.

488
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:31,864
In suffering that, that victim mentality and self-guilt,

489
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:33,503
are natural.

490
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:35,300
But?

491
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:43,580
Those mentalities impoverish a person incessantly.

492
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,651
I am more aware of that than anyone else.

493
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:55,258
You and I, through those long years,
we must have been trying to overcome that.

494
00:36:55,258 --> 00:37:02,098
Except that, our methods have differed.

495
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:08,839
Hence, it was the letters for you?

496
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:49,479
Victim mentality.

497
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:56,720
Though I have lived unaware of such an existence...

498
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,690
no, I think it did exist.

499
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:08,165
However, it is not due to me having
suffered such a gruesome plight.

500
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:12,102
That has to be because of Lee Do.

501
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:15,639
In order to rebuild an organization
that had pretty much collapsed,

502
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:21,111
I have lived through 20 years working as a butcher.

503
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:27,918
During that time, Lee Do became the
sage king the world heaped praised upon.

504
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:32,255
That unbearable feeling,

505
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:36,092
can you understand it?

506
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,528
But you see...

507
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:44,000
I've overcome everything now. How?

508
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,042
Precisely due to those
brilliant letters Lee Do created.

509
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:54,945
I realized, as if I were
struck by a divine revelation,

510
00:38:54,945 --> 00:38:59,716
that to block those letters that
are more brilliant than any others,

511
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:03,153
was to be the heaven's mandate to me.

512
00:39:03,153 --> 00:39:10,026
Regardless of how brilliant a King he may be.
No! Even if it's not the King, but whatever it may be!

513
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:15,198
It cannot test the thousand-year-old history.

514
00:39:15,198 --> 00:39:21,371
I hear Lee Do is going to
promulgate during sanghan.

515
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:28,044
On that day, I will assuredly block it.

516
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:37,254
And with that, the long talk
between Lee Do and me...

517
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:40,090
will end.

518
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:54,736

519
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,016
[ mom ]

520
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:09,017
Why are you looking so shocked?

521
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:14,471
By chance, do you know this court maiden?

522
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:20,184
No.

523
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,041
I don't know her.

524
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:41,871
How are we going
to find them like this?

525
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,531
How many hours has it been?

526
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:45,725
Instead of this,

527
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:48,234
let's go and get the troops spread everywhere.

528
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:50,648
No. What if Dahm and
the court maidens are

529
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,506
put into danger, what will you do?

530
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:57,823
It's just that no matter how hard
we look, not even a rat shows up.

531
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,180
A rat.

532
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:03,216
Yes, a rat!

533
00:41:03,216 --> 00:41:05,625
What is it now?

534
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,154
If someone, on purpose,

535
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:11,012
pulled out all the animals on this mountain,

536
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,405
what would be the reason?

537
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:14,774
In case,

538
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,028
something touches it?

539
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:23,249
What?!

540
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:25,238
What?
What are you saying?

541
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:29,472
You think something's going to happen on the day
of the promulgation ceremony? What do you mean?

542
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:31,097
I don't know.

543
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:34,905
But, there is definitely something.

544
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,017
We must get out somehow and alert them.

545
00:41:48,187 --> 00:41:51,206
Hey, but there's nothing.

546
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:55,966
My back's killing me.

547
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:58,404
I almost peed.

548
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:00,974
Stop!

549
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,817
It was indeed this.

550
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:14,286
It's danger warning toll.

551
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:17,537
If we follow this, there will be a bell.

552
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,668
If this string is touched,

553
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:30,670
that bell will toll.

554
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,374
And that is the warning
that an intruder is here.

555
00:42:34,374 --> 00:42:38,551
But it ends here, so what now?

556
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:39,379
We need to call them out.

557
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:40,502
What?

558
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:42,754
What the heck are you doing?

559
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:08,389
Now, if we follow this,

560
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:11,077
we'll find the place where Dahm is.

561
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:16,586
Miss So Yi.

562
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:17,793
Yeon Doo.

563
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:21,624
Miss, why are you captured here?

564
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,528
Yeon Doo.

565
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:25,850
Can you help us to get out?

566
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,612
This... I can't do it.

567
00:43:29,612 --> 00:43:31,655
We must get out now!

568
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:33,234
Help us please.

569
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:34,720
No.

570
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,346
I'm sorry.

571
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:37,692
One moment.

572
00:43:38,304 --> 00:43:42,629
Then, we won't ask you to get us out.

573
00:43:42,629 --> 00:43:45,078
Can you listen to a different favor?

574
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:47,840
What?

575
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,615
Really?

576
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:50,316
What are you doing there?

577
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:30,146
Yeon Doo.

578
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,097
Yes?

579
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:35,069
Ahjussi...

580
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:39,399
is thankful.

581
00:44:43,536 --> 00:44:45,611
And sorry.

582
00:44:46,706 --> 00:44:47,910
Okay?

583
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,464
Why?

584
00:44:52,786 --> 00:44:54,113
Nothing.

585
00:44:57,784 --> 00:44:59,195
No.

586
00:45:18,537 --> 00:45:20,145
Yeon Doo, you see.

587
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:23,575
Kill her.

588
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:27,386
Painlessly.

589
00:45:36,184 --> 00:45:38,163
Hey.

590
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:40,665
Gaepayi is looking for you.

591
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:42,802
Really? Where?

592
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:44,148
Follow me.

593
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,077
Gaepayi... where is he?

594
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:02,955
That's strange.

595
00:46:02,955 --> 00:46:04,466
He said he would come here.

596
00:46:21,022 --> 00:46:22,808
Bonwon has sent message.

597
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:27,291
He says to meet at
Naksan at 5 kyeong 5 (5 am).

598
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:29,181
<i>Finally.</i>

599
00:46:29,181 --> 00:46:31,483
<i>You're coming to answer?</i>

600
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:33,003
<i>Bonwon?</i>

601
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,794
Yeon Doo, are you alright?

602
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:51,835
Ahjussi!

603
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:53,181
It's alright.

604
00:46:56,711 --> 00:47:00,472
Yeon Doo... do you think
she got there safely?

605
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:04,048
We need her to do
the favor we asked her.

606
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,119
<i>What about Miss So Yi?</i>

607
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,623
Here.

608
00:47:08,623 --> 00:47:11,470
This is where Miss So Yi was jailed.

609
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,326
But other than Miss So Yi,

610
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:16,862
there were other court misses.

611
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:18,764
Really?
How many?

612
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:21,767
Counting Miss So Yi, three!

613
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:24,157
You take Yeon Doo down at once.

614
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:25,930
And contact Sir Royal Guard Commander.

615
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,143
Alright.
Got it.

616
00:47:27,143 --> 00:47:28,540
Be careful.

617
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,567
Let's go.

618
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:37,449
<i>Sir!</i>

619
00:47:38,391 --> 00:47:40,341
They found the location in the mountain.

620
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:42,082
Where is it?

621
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:45,310
As you already are well aware,

622
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,401
the mountain location

623
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:48,259
is discovered to be Daeseong Mountain.

624
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:50,062
Search thoroughly.

625
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:55,341
Block all routes into Daeseong
Mountain completely.

626
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:56,595
Got it?

627
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:57,942
Yes, Sir.

628
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:01,936
Your Excellency.

629
00:48:03,073 --> 00:48:05,302
It seems they've discovered the location.

630
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,045
Right now, the royal guard
and royal investigation armies

631
00:48:07,045 --> 00:48:09,114
are heading toward Daeseong Mountain.

632
00:48:11,874 --> 00:48:16,255
Send a message to
Gyun Jeok Hee at once.

633
00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:17,656
Yes.

634
00:48:24,552 --> 00:48:27,152
<i>Daylight will break soon.</i>

635
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:28,767
<i>Why aren't they coming?</i>

636
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,447
It seems he hasn't come out yet.

637
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,473
Excuse me,

638
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:48,793
but do you trust Lord Shim Jong Soo?

639
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:55,160
I apologize.

640
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,096
I've overstepped my bounds.

641
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,334
No.

642
00:49:02,331 --> 00:49:05,137
Do I trust him?

643
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:09,297
I didn't trust him.
For a long time.

644
00:49:10,086 --> 00:49:12,687
Shim Jong Soo always

645
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:17,015
seemed to be disloyal to me.

646
00:49:17,015 --> 00:49:19,235
Furthermore,

647
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:22,421
after Shim Jong Soo
came to the mountain alone,

648
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,423
I finally understood.

649
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:26,959
He never once

650
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:30,562
was allegiant to me nor Teacher Sambong.

651
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:36,464
My premonition was correct.

652
00:49:36,802 --> 00:49:38,229
He merely...

653
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:41,038
that system of a genuine parliament,

654
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,942
he was only loyal to that.

655
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,613
Not relying on people.

656
00:49:45,613 --> 00:49:48,247
He is loyal to his creed only.

657
00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:53,752
Hence, he will do well.

658
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,431
Did you summon your answer?

659
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:07,699
Bonwon?

660
00:50:21,325 --> 00:50:23,215
Why are you looking at it?

661
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:27,019
It's the Milbon pledge and the
roster of all Milbon members.

662
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:35,027
This is...

663
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:36,662
truly... ?

664
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:39,298
What you said is all correct.

665
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:41,689
Actually, I was already

666
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:44,429
troubled by thoughts
of the next generation.

667
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:46,054
You gave me the answer.

668
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:48,874
Spearhead Milbon.

669
00:50:52,744 --> 00:50:54,012
Bonwon.

670
00:50:58,884 --> 00:51:01,453
Where is that Haerye?

671
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:03,622
Do you really have it?

672
00:51:04,156 --> 00:51:07,259
I will burn and rid of that Haerye.

673
00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:09,321
The day Lee Do makes the promulgation.

674
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:11,430
I will kill Lee Do.

675
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:14,266
And I will kill all who know the letters.

676
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:16,797
Now.

677
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,705
Where's the Haerye?

678
00:51:20,906 --> 00:51:22,858
Yes.

679
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:27,664
That was created by the King,

680
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:30,215
the Haerye of the letters...

681
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,814
On the account of the white powder you
spread, we were able to get all the way here.

682
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:40,907
But is there no more of
the warning toll from here?

683
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:43,101
I've verified to this point here so far.

684
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,601
We should be able to charge
in without much resistance.

685
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:49,974
Alright, then this very moment, we charge in.

686
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:52,806
Royal Guard Commander.

687
00:51:52,806 --> 00:51:58,059
Above all else, the safety of the
hostage is top priority. Please say so.

688
00:52:02,303 --> 00:52:03,911
Of course.

689
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:08,230
The Haerye...

690
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,860
The Haerye...

691
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:24,886
is not a book.

692
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,071
The Haerye is...

693
00:52:37,753 --> 00:52:40,407
Which scum are you!

694
00:52:48,574 --> 00:52:51,867
So you've succeeded
in trailing me at last.

695
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:53,346
Gyun Jeok Hee!

696
00:52:53,346 --> 00:52:56,133
As I know it, this isn't
the time for you to bluff.

697
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,517
Well, you won't die.

698
00:53:16,517 --> 00:53:18,419
I'm told you are still of use.

699
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:21,235
I have to find out where
that Haerye or whatever it is.

700
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:48,354
They are Ming agents.
There are too many.

701
00:53:51,802 --> 00:53:53,566
Lee Shin Jeok sent you then.

702
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:57,142
You are Jeong Gi Joon?

703
00:53:57,142 --> 00:54:01,566
I will block her however it takes.
Please evade that way.

704
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:12,096
You too. Instead of getting captured by
the Ming agents, this is probably better.

705
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:15,676
Why... do as you wish then.

706
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:19,547
Attack!

707
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:13,134
Chase him!

708
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,962
Anyone who defies the federal law,

709
00:56:13,962 --> 00:56:17,194
wipe them out without sparing any.

710
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:34,341
What exactly... happened?

711
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:36,438
The royal guard troops.

712
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:40,611
Then, the warning toll didn't function?

713
00:56:40,611 --> 00:56:43,758
Hurry and evade.

714
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:47,266
Bonwon!
What about Bonwon?

715
00:56:56,865 --> 00:57:02,166
Our Black Concourse is the
top in the continent, you see.

716
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:03,773
It won't do.

717
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,747
What is it that you want?

718
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:08,923
I'm not sure.
I don't quite know either.

719
00:57:10,054 --> 00:57:13,540
Let's go together for now.

720
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:16,939
Aren't you looking for the Haerye?

721
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,130
The Haerye...

722
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:26,547
What scum are you?

723
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:28,583
When did you come?

724
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:31,516
What is it?
Who is it?

725
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:34,806
Run.

726
00:57:34,806 --> 00:57:38,614
What?
What did you say?

727
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:41,222
If you run,

728
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:44,152
you can live.

729
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:47,889
Why this scum thinks
he's so big... so he's crazy.

730
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:52,627
What are you doing?
We haven't got time.
Hurry and kill him.

731
00:57:52,827 --> 00:57:54,045
Yes.

732
00:57:55,797 --> 00:57:57,665
STOP!

733
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:02,716
All retreat.

734
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:04,305
Now!

735
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:11,312
We did nothing here.

736
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:15,016
We will just leave quietly.

737
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,154
Spare us.

738
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:23,091
<i>Spy senior, what's wrong with you?</i>

739
00:58:23,091 --> 00:58:26,761
<i>Shut up!
All retreat!</i>

740
00:58:43,745 --> 00:58:45,246
How did you know to come here?

741
00:58:45,246 --> 00:58:50,051
The mountain camp has been ambushed.

742
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:55,623
And Yeon Doo has disappeared.

743
00:58:56,925 --> 00:58:59,861
Ambushed?

744
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:01,596
What are you talking about?

745
00:59:01,596 --> 00:59:04,232
Bonwon.
Are you alright?

746
00:59:04,232 --> 00:59:07,201
The mountain camp was ambushed?
What is that talk?

747
00:59:07,201 --> 00:59:10,851
The soldiers from the royal guard.

748
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:14,075
They raided the place.

749
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,116
<i>Spy senior. 
What exactly is going on with you?</i>

750
00:59:22,116 --> 00:59:25,253
<i>There was a Tolgol mercenary troop</i>

751
00:59:25,253 --> 00:59:27,388
<i>during Yuan Dynasty's power restoration.</i>

752
00:59:27,388 --> 00:59:28,656
<i>Then he is...</i>

753
00:59:28,656 --> 00:59:32,427
<i>"Undefeatable on earth"</i>

754
00:59:32,427 --> 00:59:34,195
<i>Kareupeyi Taemukan.</i>

755
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,863
<i>But he is just one.</i>

756
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,899
<i>No one.</i>

757
00:59:37,899 --> 00:59:41,569
<i>No one can beat him.</i>

758
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:45,039
<i>Hurry and alert Peking.</i>

759
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,947
Palace guard!

760
00:59:52,947 --> 00:59:55,717
Don't worry.
It's all finished.

761
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,853
But So Yi?
Where's So Yi?

762
00:59:58,853 --> 01:00:02,423
So Yi...
So Yi got dragged away.

763
01:00:02,423 --> 01:00:03,424
Dragged away?

764
01:00:03,424 --> 01:00:06,594
Dragged away?
By who?

765
01:00:06,594 --> 01:00:07,962
To where?

766
01:00:07,962 --> 01:00:10,098
She was dragged away
by that punk Garion.

767
01:00:10,098 --> 01:00:12,633
You must find her.
Hurry!

768
01:00:14,836 --> 01:00:17,571
It seems you lost.

769
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,774
Everything.

770
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:22,209
Now.

771
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:26,115
Isn't it ended?

772
01:00:27,649 --> 01:00:32,186
Your base is gone and
your peers are captured.

773
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,391
The Haerye, you couldn't find.

774
01:00:37,992 --> 01:00:41,963
You've lost.

775
01:00:47,135 --> 01:00:48,969
<i>Haerye...</i>

776
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,272
<i>Haerye is...</i>

777
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,377
<i>Bring So Yi.</i>

778
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,718
<i>You won't be able to find it!
Because I myself...</i>

779
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:07,721
<i>have never seen it either.</i>

780
01:01:09,991 --> 01:01:13,530
<i>Can't you give me a discount here?</i>

781
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,565
<i>Mister Garion.</i>

782
01:01:15,565 --> 01:01:18,304
<i>Seriously, you scared me.</i>

783
01:01:18,304 --> 01:01:21,230
<i>Hey, why the fuss!</i>

784
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,995
<i>I have to start over now!</i>

785
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:25,138
<i>Well if you won't give me a discount...</i>

786
01:01:45,697 --> 01:01:47,079
Kill her.

787
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,420
You...

788
01:01:55,906 --> 01:01:57,207
You...

789
01:01:58,475 --> 01:01:59,734
are the Haerye.

790
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,119
Dahm!

791
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:35,098
