1
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,640
I just don't
understand it, Bob. 

2
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,040
I mean, I've logged
a lot of miles, 

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,920
I've followed the sales textbook
by the letter. 

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,080
I mean, I've applied
myself diligently. 

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
I mean,
I try and I try

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,880
and I just cannot
get in the door. 

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,240
I mean, what am I doin' wrong?
-Earl. Sit down. 

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,200
Sure, you've got
a great product, 

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,400
but you have to remember what
you're really selling yourself. 

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,360
So it's not necessarily
what I say as how I say it?

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,760
That's right, Earl.
A good salesman can sell anything. 

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,640
And I remember when
you were a good salesman

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,560
at the beginning. 

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,480
But something
seems to have changed. 

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
Now, I don't want to pry,
but is everything all right at home?

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
Everything's all right
with Margie, right?

17
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,320
Will there be anything else, gentlemen?
-Leave it. 

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,200
Just leave it.
-Yes, sir. Thank you. 

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,120
Thanks.
-I watched you

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,320
walking back and forth in front
of my desk in an agitated manner, 

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,960
smoking a cigarette without having asked
if you could smoke in my presence--

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,080
01. :21, Mark. 

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,440
Okay, listen up. Fire team
discipline in there at all times. 

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,200
Keep your radios on at all times
during the entire penetration. 

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,720
Check yourselves.
False I. D. s?

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,120
Jim.
-No wallets, no keys?

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,960
We rendezvous where?
The Watergate, room 214. 

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,240
When? At 0300 hours. 

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Jawohl,
mein ''farten fuhrer. ''

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,760
I swear to God, Frank,
I'm gonna make you a new asshole. 

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,880
Let's get the fuck out of here.
-Years of clean living are over. 

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,920
If anything goes wrong, just sit tight
You'll hear from me or Howard. 

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,560
Personally,
if anything goes wrong

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,280
I'll be calling the president
of the United States. 

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
I'm not gonna be
just a good salesman. 

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,840
I'm gonna be a great salesman.
-That's the spirit. 

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,760
Thanks. 

38
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,360
And remember, Earl:
Always look 'em in the eye. 

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,800
Nothing sells like sincerity. 

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Five men wearing
white surgical gloves, business suits

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,320
and carrying camera and electronic
surveillance equipment

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,240
were arrested early today
in the headquarters

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,280
of the Democratic
National Committee

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
in Washington. 

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
They were unarmed. 

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,960
Nobody knows yet why they were there
or what they were looking for. 

47
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
Good evening, General Haig. 

48
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Good evening,
sir. 

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,080
Judge John Sirica today

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,440
sentenced the Watergate burglars
to terms ranging up to 40 years. 

51
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,320
The White House continues
to deny any involvement. 

52
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,880
Presidential counsel John Dean

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
testified before
the Senate Watergate committee

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,680
that the scandal reaches
to the highest levels. 

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
Presidential
aides Haldeman and Ehrlichman

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
were ordered
to resign today. 

57
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,320
In a stunning announcement, White House
aide Alexander Butterfield

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,200
revealed the existence of
a secret taping system. 

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,800
Vice President Agnew resigned today

60
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,280
after pleading no contest
to a charge of income tax evasion. 

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,200
The president has fired

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
the Watergate special prosecutor,
Archibald Cox, 

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,000
provoking the greatest constitutional
crisis in American history. 

64
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,920
On Capitol Hill today, 

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
eight resolutions calling for
the impeachment of the president

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
were referred to the judiciary committee
by the House of Representatives. 

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,080
It was disclosed to Judge Sirica

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
that there is an
18-and-a-halfminute gap

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,880
in the June 20, 1972
taped conversation

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
between the president
and Bob Haldeman. 

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,680
Reactions of shock and anger are coming
from all sectors of the nation. 

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,080
Judge John Sirica
has ordered the president

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,960
to turn over his tapes
to special prosecutor Leon Jaworski. 

74
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,800
The tapes contain conversations
between the president and his aides

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,680
and are believed to include discussions
of the Watergate scandal. 

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,560
The White House has not yet responded
To Judge Sirica's order, 

77
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,920
and it is not yet known
whether the president will comply. 

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah. 

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,840
These are the tapes you requested,
Mr. President. 

80
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
Okay. 

81
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,360
Cocksucker!

82
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,320
Nixon's never been good
with these things, Al. 

83
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,240
I'll take care of it, sir. 

84
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,920
Do you mind, sir?

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
Oh. 

86
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,240
Sorry.
-Okay. Go on. 

87
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,480
You know, Al, 

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,120
if Hoover were alive, 

89
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,120
these tapes would never
have gotten out. 

90
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,720
I want the little shit back. 

91
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
-Yeah. 

92
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
Not like the others. 

93
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,200
Dean, McCord, the rest. 

94
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,400
We never got our side
of the story out, Al. 

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,840
People have forgotten. 

96
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Such violence. 

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,120
The tear gassing,
the riots, 

98
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,040
burning the draft cards, 

99
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,880
the black panthers. 

100
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,080
We fixed it, Al,
and they hate me for it. 

101
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
'Cause it's Nixon. 

102
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,120
They always hated Nixon. 

103
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,440
You're all set, sir. 

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Okay.
-Good night, Mr. President. 

105
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,120
Good night, Al. 

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,760
Hey, Al. 

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
Men in your profession

108
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,760
give 'em a pistol
and then leave the room. 

109
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,920
I don't have a pistol,
Al. 

110
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,680
Oh. Goddamn it. 

111
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
They did what?

112
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
Evidently to install bugs
and photograph documents. 

113
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,440
It was a fishing expedition. It was
their fourth attempt at the D. N. C. 

114
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,400
O'Brien doesn't even use that office. 

115
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,440
It's possible
they were looking for evidence

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,840
of an illegal Howard Hughes
donation to the Democrats. 

117
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,240
The Democrats could make an issue
of your Hughes money. 

118
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,160
It was a legal contribution. 

119
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,520
It's not clear the burglars even knew
what they were looking for. 

120
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
They were headed for McGovern's office
Later that same night. 

121
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,480
Did Mitchell know about this?
-I don't know. 

122
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Mitchell's out of his mind right now.
Martha put her head through a window. 

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Jesus. Through a window?

124
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah, they're taking her to Bellevue.
Maybe she'll stay this time. 

125
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,640
Martha's an idiot. She'll do anything
to get Mitchell's attention. 

126
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,120
If Mitchell had been minding the store
instead of that nut Martha, 

127
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,160
we wouldn't have this kid MacGruder
running some third-rate burglary. 

128
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,720
We feel the bigger concern
is Gordon Liddy. 

129
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,360
Liddy? That fruitcake? What about him?
-That's just it, sir. 

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,280
He is a nut. 

131
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,640
He used to work here with the plumbers,
turns up running this Watergate caper. 

132
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,960
Remember his plan to firebomb Brookings
using Cubans as firemen? 

133
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,520
What's Liddy got?
-He was using some campaign cash

134
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,200
that was laundered for us through
Mexico, the F. B. I. 's onto it. 

135
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,440
We could have
a problem with that. 

136
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,160
But that's just a campaign
finance violation. 

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,160
So, if--Yeah, if Liddy
takes the rap for Watergate, 

138
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
we can take care of him
and that lets us off the hook. 

139
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,160
I don't have time for all this shit.
Just handle it, Bob. 

140
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,680
Keep it out of the White House.
I gotta see Kissinger. 

141
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,640
He's throwing a tantrum,
threatening to quit. Again. 

142
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,680
What else?

143
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,600
Well, sir, uh, 

144
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,560
one of the people implicated
is still on the White House payroll. 

145
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,640
Who?
Not another goddamn Cuban. 

146
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,360
Uh, no, sir.
A guy named Hunt. 

147
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,480
Howard Hunt, sir. 

148
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
Hunt? Howard Hunt?

149
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,920
Dumb bastard left his White House
phone number in his hotel room. 

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,880
He works for Colson. 

151
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,040
He used him
on the Pentagon papers. 

152
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
This guy dumped his wiretapping stuff
into his White House safe. 

153
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,760
We're trying to figure out when he
stopped being a White House consultant. 

154
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,680
Howard Hunt is working
For the White House?

155
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,600
Jesus Christ. 

156
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,280
This is goddamn Disneyland.
Since when?

157
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,520
Since Chappaquiddick.
He wanted dirt on Kennedy. 

158
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,360
Colson brought him in.
-You know Hunt, sir?

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,440
Yeah, on the list
of horribles. 

160
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,280
I know what he is and I know
what he tracks back to. 

161
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,160
He was involved in the plumbers?
-Oh, definitely. 

162
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,040
Colson had him break into Bremer's
apartment after Bremer shot Wallace

163
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,800
to plant McGovern's
campaign literature. 

164
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,600
I had nothing to do
with that. 

165
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,760
He was in this Ellsberg thing too?
-Yes. You approved it, sir. 

166
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,080
I did?

167
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,520
It was right after
the Pentagon papers broke. 

168
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,880
They went in to get his psychiatric
records. We were working on China. 

169
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,360
Fuck. 

170
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,520
Out!

171
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,440
What the fuck?

172
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,040
You're not supposed to take pictures
of me! Take pictures of the files!

173
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
Give me that fucking film!

174
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,280
Howard Hunt. 

175
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,200
Jesus Christ. 

176
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,400
You open up that scab,
you'll uncover a lot of pus. 

177
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,840
What do you mean?

178
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Where's Hunt now?
-He's in hiding. 

179
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,840
He sent Liddy in
to talk to Dean. 

180
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
And?
-He wants money. 

181
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Then pay him. 

182
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,680
I told him to get out of the country.
It's crazy to start a relationship--

183
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,560
What the hell are you doing, John,
screwing with the C. I. A. ?

184
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,120
I don't care how much he wants.
Just pay him. 

185
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,560
What are we
paying him for, sir?

186
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,520
Silence. 

187
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,720
But, sir, you're covered. 

188
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,680
It's only
this Ellsberg thing, 

189
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,560
and if that comes out,
it's national security. 

190
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,880
I say we cut ourselves loose from these
clowns, and that's all there is to it. 

191
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,520
No, it's more than that.
I want Hunt paid. 

192
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,440
We've never done that before, sir.
How do we do it?

193
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,400
We should set up a Cuban defence fund
on this and take care of all of 'em. 

194
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Should we talk to Trini about paying?
-No, keep Trini out of this. 

195
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,360
And for God's sake,
keep Colson out. 

196
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,520
It's time to baptize
Our young counsel here, Mr. Dean. 

197
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,040
That means John can never talk about it.
Attorney-client privilege. 

198
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,960
So get to it.
-Uh-huh. 

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,680
John, you stay close to this, okay?
-Don't worry, sir. 

200
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,640
Good. 

201
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,200
Okay. 

202
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,520
Did I approve
the Ellsberg thing? Huh?

203
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,640
You know, I'm glad we tape
all these conversations, but

204
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
I never approved the break-in
At the Ellsbergs'. 

205
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,880
Oh, maybe I approved it
After the fact. 

206
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,360
Someday we gotta start
transcribing these tapes. 

207
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
You approved that before the fact
because I went over it with you. But I--

208
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,080
But no one's gonna see these tapes.
-That's right. 

209
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,960
And it's really more of
a problem for Ehrlichman. 

210
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,320
He's the one who fixed Hunt up
with the phony C. I. A. I. D. s. 

211
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,720
But what else does Hunt
have on us?

212
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,000
We gotta turn off
the F. B. I. , Bob. 

213
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,800
You go to the C. I. A. and tell Helms
that Hunt is blackmailing the president. 

214
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,640
Tell him Hunt and his Cuban friends
Know too damn much, 

215
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,520
and if he goes public--
if Hunt goes public--

216
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,400
it will be a fiasco
for the C. I. A. 

217
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,360
He'll know what I'm talking about.
-All right. 

218
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,680
Play it tough. That's the way they play
it, and the way we're gonna play it. 

219
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,560
Don't lie to Helms and say
there's no involvement. 

220
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,400
Just say this is a comedy of errors--
bizarre--without getting into it. 

221
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
And, uh--

222
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,840
Say the president believes it's gonna
open up the whole Bay of Pigs again. 

223
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,720
And tell Helms he should call
the F. B. I. , call Pat Gray

224
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,600
and say that we wish,
for the sake of the country, 

225
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,280
that, uh, don't go any further
into this hanky-panky, period. 

226
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
Bay of Pigs?

227
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,640
That was Kennedy's screw-up.
Why would that threaten us?

228
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,880
Just do what I say, Bob. 

229
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,600
The only problem with that, sir--

230
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,000
It does get us into
obstruction of justice. 

231
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,880
It's got nothing to do with justice,
Bob. It's national security. 

232
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,800
How is this national security?

233
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,200
The president says it is. 

234
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,280
Now, this isn't
a moral issue, Bob. 

235
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,160
My job is to protect this country
from its enemies, 

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,120
and its enemies are
inside the walls. 

237
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,280
We gotta keep
our enemies at bay

238
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,360
or our whole program
goes down the tubes. 

239
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
Uh, Vietnam, China,
the Soviet Union. 

240
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,280
When you look at
the big picture, Bob, 

241
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,640
damn.
-We end up doing good in this world. 

242
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,200
So let's not screw it up
with a shit-ass, third-rate burglary. 

243
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,360
What should I tell
Ziegler to tell the press?

244
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,600
Tell 'em what we always tell 'em.
Anything but the goddamn truth. 

245
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
Fuck!

246
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,440
Say the president believes it's gonna
open up the whole Bay of Pigs again. 

247
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,560
Put me in this position--
-Bay of Pigs?

248
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,680
Expose me like this.
-Why would that threaten us?

249
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,600
Why don't they
Just fucking shoot me?

250
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,600
In the election of 1860, 

251
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,120
Abraham Lincoln said the question
was whether this nation could exist

252
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,400
half-slave or half-free. 

253
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,920
In the election of 1960
and with the world around us, 

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,720
the question is whether the world
will exist half-slave or half-free. 

255
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,240
And I think,
in the final analysis, 

256
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,400
it depends upon what we do
here in the United States. 

257
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,280
It's time America started moving again. 

258
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
Mr. Nixon?

259
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,080
When it comes
to experience, 

260
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
through the years I have sat
on the National Security Council;

261
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,520
I have been in the cabinet; I have met
with the legislative leaders--

262
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
Relax, everybody,
relax. 

263
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,600
I've had discussions with
35 presidents, 9 prime ministers, 

264
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,040
two emperors
and the Shah of Iran. 

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,800
Jesus Christ. Has he told them
How many push-ups he can do yet?

266
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Let's take
hydroelectric power. 

267
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,720
What the hell happened to him?
-He just got out of the hospital. 

268
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,600
He hasn't taken one hour off
during this campaign, thanks to you. 

269
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,160
When we consider
the line up of the world, 

270
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,040
we find there are
590 million people on our side, 

271
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,520
800 million people
on the Communist side--

272
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
Shoulda slapped makeup on him.
-It's not a beauty contest. 

273
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,400
We'd better hope not.
-And 600 million people are neutral. 

274
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,280
What are you doing to him, Murray?
Look at him. He's not well. 

275
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,760
He doesn't have to debate Kennedy.
-The odds are 5-3 against us. 

276
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,360
When it comes to politics--
-He can win without doing this. 

277
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,400
Senator Kennedy,
you have one minute for a rebuttal. 

278
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,600
Castro is only the beginning of our
difficulties throughout Latin America. 

279
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh, shit, he's gonna do it.
Here it comes. 

280
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,960
We have seen Cuba
go to the Communists. 

281
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,840
Eight jet minutes
from the coast of Florida. 

282
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,440
We must at tempt to strengthen the
democratic anti-Castro forces in exile. 

283
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,000
These fighters have had virtually
no support from our government. 

284
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,000
Son of a bitch!
-What? What?

285
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,320
Kennedy was briefed
Last week by the C. I. A. 

286
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,200
He's using it against us.
He wellshed on the deal. 

287
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,600
If we had provided aid, we might never
have had Castro. Why didn't we?

288
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,560
Mr. Nixon?

289
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,360
Man, he's treading water.
-All right, come on. 

290
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,240
He violated national security, Dick.
Attack the bastard. 

291
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,480
the Constitution of the
United States, so help me God. 

292
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,080
Mr. Nixon. 

293
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah. Uh--

294
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,360
Uh, I think--

295
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,760
I think that's
the sort of, uh, 

296
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,120
very dangerous
and irresponsible suggestion--

297
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,720
It's over. More coffee?

298
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,040
Helping the Cuban exiles
who oppose Castro would, uh, 

299
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,040
not only be a violation
of international law, 

300
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,600
it would be an open invitation
for Mr. Khrushchev--

301
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,720
It's still very close. 

302
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,080
Uh, Senator Kennedy's lead

303
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,080
is about, uh, 700,000. 

304
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,240
Think maybe Daley
stuffed the ballot boxes himself?. 

305
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,560
In Texas, they had
the goddamn cattle voting. 

306
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,240
The closest race in history, Dick,
and he stole it. Son of a bitch. 

307
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,760
He outspent us and he still cheated.
A guy who's got every thing. 

308
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,680
I can't believe it. 

309
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
We came to Congress
together. 

310
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,320
We were like brothers,
for Christ's sake. 

311
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
It all figures. It's an obvious fraud.
-We ask for a recount. 

312
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,000
Don't be ridiculous. 

313
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,880
Nobody has ever contested
a presidential election before. 

314
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,400
Who's gonna do the counting?
The Democrats control Texas, Illinois. 

315
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,360
We shift 25,000 votes
in two states. 

316
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,240
And how long will that take?
Six months, a year?

317
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,160
Meanwhile, what happens
to the country, Herb?

318
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,040
If I'd called his shot, I'd have won.
-That's what I say. 

319
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,960
Made me look soft. 

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,880
''I feel very sorry for Nixon
-No. 

321
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,400
''because he does not know
who he is. 

322
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
A teach stop he has to decide which
Nixon he's going to be at the moment, 

323
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,400
which must be very exhausting. ''
Jack Kennedy. 

324
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,640
It's a disgrace.
-Nixon is a shifty-eyed goddamn liar. 

325
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,360
''If he had to stick to the truth,
he'd have very little to say. 

326
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,960
If you vote for Nixon, then you
oughta go to hell. ''Harry S. Truman. 

327
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,200
That's what killed us, Dick.
Not Cuba. 

328
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,640
It's the personality problem. You gonna
let the Democrats get away with this?

329
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,560
Goes to Harvard. 

330
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,160
His father hands him everything
on a silver platter. 

331
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,440
All my life they've been
sticking it to me. 

332
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
Not the right clothes, not
the right schools, not the right family. 

333
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,520
And then he steals from me. 

334
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,840
He says I have no class,
and they love him for it. 

335
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,760
You're only 47. 

336
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,960
If you contest this election,
you'll be finished. 

337
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,280
You got ta swallow this one. 

338
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,160
They stole it
fair and square. 

339
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,400
We'll get 'em next time,
Dick. 

340
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,880
We'll get'em
Next time. 

341
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,240
What makes you think there's
gonna be a next time, Murray?

342
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,640
Because if he's not
this Nixon, 

343
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,560
he's nobody. 

344
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,160
Good morning, sir.
-Hi. 

345
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,120
Hi. 

346
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,040
Hi. 

347
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,920
We lost. 

348
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,280
I know. 

349
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,200
I hate to lose. 

350
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,200
It makes us
human. 

351
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,120
It's not fair,
Buddy. 

352
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,760
I can take
the insults. 

353
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,680
I can take
the name-calling. 

354
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,600
But I can't take
the losing. 

355
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,520
I hate it. 

356
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,760
We don't have to put ourselves
through this again, Dick. 

357
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,560
We worked for it.
We earned it. 

358
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,480
It's ours. 

359
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,520
It is.
We know that. 

360
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,880
And it's enough
That we know. 

361
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,520
Just think
Of the girls. 

362
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
They're still young. 

363
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,800
We never see them. 

364
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,720
I lost my parents
when I was young. 

365
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,600
I don't want them
to lose theirs. 

366
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,080
Maybe I should
Get out of the game. 

367
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,480
What do you think,
Buddy?

368
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,840
And go back to
being a lawyer. 

369
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,680
End up with something solid,
some money at the end of the line. 

370
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
You know, I, uh, 

371
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,840
keep thinking of
my old man tonight. 

372
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,760
He was a failure too. 

373
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,240
You're not a failure,
Dick. 

374
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,080
You know how much money he had
in the bank when he died?

375
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,360
Nothing. 

376
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
He was so damned honest. 

377
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,840
But I miss him. 

378
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,080
I miss him
a hell of a lot. 

379
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,400
Dad! Dad!
-I got the beets for him. 

380
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,320
Dad.
-Is she in there?

381
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Come on, give me a chance.
-I don't have time for you right now. 

382
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
I got work
to do. 

383
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,240
How is thy son?
-Very well, thank you. 

384
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,160
What'd he say?

385
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
He said, In life,
there's no free ride. 

386
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,880
What'd you say?
-I didn't need a ride, I need a suit. 

387
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,280
Oh, no. Harold. 

388
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,400
He doesn't respond well
to humor. 

389
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Maybe Mother can help
straighten it out. 

390
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,400
I'd rather get a whippin' than
listen to another of her talks. 

391
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,680
Relax, Dick. 

392
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,080
Donald, finish thy sweeping
then pick out the bad apples. 

393
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,000
Yes, Mother. 

394
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,920
I'm working. 

395
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,080
Richard, come with me,
would thee?

396
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,320
Wh-Why me?

397
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Ooh. 

398
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Because Harold hast father's
will is no reason to admire him. 

399
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,320
Let Harold's worldliness be a warning
to thee, not an example. 

400
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,240
Yes, Mother. 

401
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,560
Harold may have lost touch
with his bible, 

402
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480
but thee must never lapse. 

403
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,560
Now, give it to me. 

404
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,680
Do not tell a lie,
Richard. 

405
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,520
The corn silk cigarette Harold gave
thee behind the store this morning. 

406
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,680
I don't have them.
Mother, I--

407
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,520
I promise
I didn't smoke. 

408
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,400
I see. 

409
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,800
Well, then, Richard, we have
nothing more to talk about, do we?

410
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Please! Please. 

411
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,240
Mother, I'm sorry.
It was--

412
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,920
It was just one time. 

413
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm sorry. 

414
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,920
So am I. 

415
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,680
Thy father will have to
know of thy lying. 

416
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,040
No, please, don't--
don't--don't tell him. 

417
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,920
I'll never do it again.
I promise. Please. 

418
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,840
Richard, I expected
more from thee. 

419
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,720
Please, Mama. 

420
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,040
I shall never
Let thee down again. 

421
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,360
Then this shall be
our little secret. 

422
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,080
Remember,
I see into thy soul. 

423
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,480
Thee may fool the world, 

424
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,400
even thy father, 

425
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,600
but not me, Richard. 

426
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,560
Never me. 

427
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,040
Mother, 

428
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,360
think of me always
as thy faithful dog. 

429
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,520
Thank you.
-We'll be in the next room. 

430
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,040
Richard. 

431
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,000
Is it my turn?

432
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,560
O heavenly Father,
we humbly thank you--

433
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,560
I'll do it. There's a couple
Of things I wanna say. 

434
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,120
Could thee at least remove
thy apron, Frank?

435
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,040
This blood
pays the bills, Hannah. 

436
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm not ashamed of
how I earn my money. 

437
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,920
Heavenly Father, 

438
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760
you told Adam in the garden,
after that business with the snake, 

439
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,920
that man would have to earn his way
by the sweat of his face. 

440
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,800
Well, as far
as I can tell, Father, 

441
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,960
what was true in Eden is true
in Whittier, California. 

442
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,440
So we ask you now to remind certain
Of our young people

443
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,120
the only way to get a new suit to go to
the promenade with Margaret O'Herlihy--

444
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,880
who happens to be
a Catholic, by the way--

445
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,960
is to work for it. 

446
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,920
Amen.
-Amen. 

447
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
Amen.
-Amen. 

448
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,520
Are we gonna pray now,
Daddy?

449
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,120
Don't be silly. 

450
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,080
You think
this is funny?

451
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,560
Maybe a trip to the woods hed'll
straighten you out. 

452
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,880
Pretty soon you boys are gonna
have to get out there and scratch. 

453
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,760
'Cause you're not gonna get anywhere on
your good looks-just ask those fellas. 

454
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,160
Charity's only
gonna get you so far, 

455
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,920
even with saints
like your mother around. 

456
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,440
Struggle's what gives life meaning.
Not victory, struggle. 

457
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,360
When you quit struggling,
they've beaten you. 

458
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,680
And then you end up in the street
with your hand out. 

459
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,280
My mother was a saint, 

460
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,400
but my old man
struggled his whole life. 

461
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,640
They could call him
a little man, a poor man, 

462
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,600
but they never beat him. 

463
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,000
I always tried
to remember that

464
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,840
when things
didn't go my way. 

465
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,760
Let's really get fired up now!
-Get on your stand, Nixon!

466
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,600
28! 44!

467
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,160
Come on, get in there!

468
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,040
What's Nixon doing here?
-He thinks he can make it. 

469
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,760
Four years of being
a tackling dummy. Poor guy. 

470
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,080
Let's go, Nixon!

471
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,800
Hike!

472
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,640
Worst athlete I've ever seen. 

473
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,440
But
he's got guts. 

474
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,200
Okay, let's go!
Let's do it!

475
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,160
In California's gubernatorial race, 

476
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,040
Richard Nixon has returned
to the political arena

477
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,200
in what is shaping up to be
a long and acrimonious bid

478
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,000
against popular incumbent
Edmund G. Brown. 

479
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,640
Brown's campaign has benefited greatly
from the support of President Kennedy, 

480
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,560
while Nixon has had trouble
convincing voters

481
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,920
this is not another run
for the presidency. 

482
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
With only a few precincts
left unreported, 

483
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,920
all indications are of
another defeat for Nixon, 

484
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,080
who lost the presidency just two
years ago by a paper-thin margin. 

485
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,400
It seems his brief political
comeback--

486
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,120
You making a statement?

487
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,040
Thank you, Fidel Castro. 

488
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,080
You're not going to blame Castro.
-I sure am!

489
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,000
Goddamn missile crisis united
the whole country behind Kennedy. 

490
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,000
And he was supporting Brown.
People were scared, that's why. 

491
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,040
I suppose Castro staged the
whole thing just to beat you. 

492
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,800
Buddy, before you join the jubilation
of my being beaten again, remember:

493
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,720
people vote not out of love
but fear. 

494
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
They don't teach that at Sunday school
Or the Whittier Community Playhouse. 

495
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,800
I'll go check with our people. 

496
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,840
I'm glad they don't,
Dick, 

497
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,880
because life is tough
and it is unfair, 

498
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,800
and sometimes you forget that
in your self-pity. 

499
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,920
Happy days are here again
-You forget sometimes, Dick, 

500
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,920
that I had a life before you,
before California--

501
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,240
Let us sing a song
Of cheer again--

502
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,400
Cocksucker!

503
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,560
Don't you want to listen to
Gov. Brown's victory speech?

504
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
Nope. Not going to listen to
any more speeches ever again. 

505
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
Amen to that. 

506
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,480
It's over, Dick.
-I'll concede in the morning. 

507
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,440
Not that. 

508
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,760
Buddy?

509
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,360
I have always
stood by you. 

510
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,720
I campaigned for you
when I was pregnant. 

511
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,560
During Checkers, when Ike
wanted you out, I told you to fight. 

512
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,480
This is different,
Dick. 

513
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,400
You've changed. 

514
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,680
You've grown more bitter,
like you're at war with the world. 

515
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,280
You weren't that way
before. 

516
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,200
I'm 50 years old now,
Dick. 

517
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,120
How many millions of miles
have I traveled?

518
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,920
How many millions of peoples' hands
have I shaked that I just don't like?

519
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,320
How many thank-you notes
have I written?

520
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,200
It's as if I, I don't know,
Just went to sleep a long time ago

521
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,080
and missed
the years between. 

522
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,960
I've had enough. 

523
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,200
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

524
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,160
I want a divorce. 

525
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,760
My God. Divorce?

526
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,080
What about the girls?

527
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,000
The girls'll grow up. 

528
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,840
They only know you
from television anyway. 

529
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,760
It'll ruin us,
Our family. 

530
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,920
You're ruining us. If we stay with you,
you'll take us down with you. 

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,800
This isn't political, Dick.
This is our life. 

532
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,680
Everything's political,
I'm political, you're political. 

533
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,600
No, I'm not.
I'm finished. 

534
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,520
Well, this is just
What they want, Buddy. 

535
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,400
Don't you see?

536
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,120
They want to drive us apart,
to beat us. 

537
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,600
We can't let them
do it. 

538
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,000
We've been through
too much together, Buddy. 

539
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,440
We belong together. 

540
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,840
That's what you said
the first time we met. 

541
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,440
You didn't even know me. 

542
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,360
Oh, yes, I did. 

543
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,200
I asked you to marry me,
didn't I?

544
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,120
On our first date. 

545
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,960
I said it
because I knew--

546
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,640
I knew
you were the one. 

547
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,440
So solid. 

548
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,080
So strong. 

549
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,240
So beautiful.
-I'm Pat Ryan. 

550
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,160
Uh, 

551
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,760
Richard Nixon.
-Pleasure to meet you. 

552
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,560
Pleasure to meet you. 

553
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,920
Are you happy I called?
-In a way, yes. 

554
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,080
Don't tell me you've been
cutting my part. 

555
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,440
Of course, honey, you know I would
never deceive you. Don't you?

556
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,640
You were the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen. 

557
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,040
I don't want to lose you. 

558
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,080
Ever. 

559
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,040
Dick, don't. 

560
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,880
You really want me
to quit?

561
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,160
We can be happy. 

562
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,560
We really can. 

563
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,120
The girls and I
love you, Dick. 

564
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,480
And if I stop

565
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,000
there'll be
no more talk of divorce?

566
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,080
I'll do it. 

567
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,560
No more. 

568
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,240
Are you serious? 

569
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,400
Yeah. I'm out. 

570
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,120
Is that the truth?

571
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,560
I'll never run again. 

572
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,440
I promise. 

573
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah. 

574
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,080
I love you, Buddy. 

575
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,920
I love you. 

576
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,840
I love you. 

577
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,640
Where are they?

578
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,520
Dick, you don't have to make a
statement. Herb covered 'em for you. 

579
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,440
No!

580
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,000
Gentlemen, Mr. Nixon
is a man who is graceful in defeat, 

581
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
and if he was
here with us--

582
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,680
Can I have
some quiet, please?

583
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,360
Give the--
just a second!

584
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,280
Can I have some quiet,
please? Quiet!

585
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,320
Thank you!

586
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,840
Mr. Nixon!

587
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,800
I believe Governor Brown has a heart, 

588
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,680
even though he believes
I do not. 

589
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,520
Uh, I believe
he's a good American, 

590
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,240
even though he feels
I am not. 

591
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,440
I'm proud of the fact that I defended
my opponent's patriotism. 

592
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,080
Uh, you gentlemen didn't report it,
but I'm proud that I did that. 

593
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,600
And I would appreciate it, for once,
if you would just print what I say. 

594
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
Uh, for 16 years, 

595
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,560
uh, ever since the Hiss case,
you've had a lot of fun. 

596
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,480
A lot of fun. 

597
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,320
But recognize you have
a responsibility, 

598
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,160
if you're against the candidate,
to give him the shaft. 

599
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,040
But if you do that, at least put one
lonely reporter on the campaign

600
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,920
who will report
what the candidate says now and then. 

601
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,600
Uh, I think, 

602
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,800
all in all, I've given
as good as I've taken. 

603
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,280
But as I leave you, I w--
I want you to know--

604
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Just think what you're
gonna be missing. 

605
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,720
Uh, you won't have Nixon
to kick around anymore. 

606
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
Kick around anymore. 

607
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,120
Because, gentlemen,
this is my last press conference. 

608
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,520
Thank you and good day.
-Mr. Nixon!

609
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,280
Is this the end of politics for you?

610
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,360
Here in California

611
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,400
we can officially write the political
obituary of Richard Milhouse Nixon. 

612
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,560
As mall town lawyer like Lincoln,
Nixon became a representative at 33

613
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,560
and a senator at 35

614
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,920
as part of the post war Republican sweep
of the congressional elections

615
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,800
that attacked F. D. R. 's
big-government new deal. 

616
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,320
Running as
a South Pacific veteran, 

617
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,640
victories over Congressman Jerry Voorhis
and Senator Helen Gahagan Douglas

618
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,080
made it clear that,
to Nixon, politics was war. 

619
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,520
He didn't have opponents,
he had enemies. 

620
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,400
Why, she's pink, right down
to her underwear!

621
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,920
Nixon became one of
the leading lights

622
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,960
on the notorious House Un-American
Activities Committee, 

623
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,160
questioning labor leaders, Spanish Civil
War veterans, Hollywood celebrities. 

624
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,880
If I had my way, they'd all
be sent back to Russia. 

625
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,320
But it was the Alger Hiss case
that made Nixon a household name. 

626
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
One of the architects
Of the United Nations, 

627
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,760
intimate of F. D. R.
and Oliver Wendell Holmes, 

628
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,480
Alger Hiss was
a State Department diplomat

629
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,760
accused by freelance journalist
Whittaker Chambers

630
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,680
of passing secret documents
to the Soviet Union. 

631
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,800
Hiss is lying.
-Hiss claimed he was being set up

632
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,920
by Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover to
discredit the new deal's policies. 

633
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,320
I am not, and never have been,
a member of the Communist party. 

634
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,200
The case came down
to an Underwood typewriter

635
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,240
and a roll of film
hidden in a pumpkin patch. 

636
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,600
I asked Hiss if he'd known Chambers. 

637
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,880
When he said no,
I knew he was lying; I knew I had him. 

638
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,520
After two trials, Hiss was convicted
not of spying but of per jury. 

639
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,480
To some, Nixon was a hero
and a patriot. 

640
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,400
But to many, he was
a shameless self-promoter. 

641
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,480
Eleanor Roosevelt
angrily condemned him. 

642
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,480
Nixon continued to tear into Truman,
Acheson and the Democratic party

643
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,240
for losing mainland China
in 1949

644
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,920
and blamed the Korean War
on a weak foreign policy. 

645
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,960
I promise to expose and
to continue to expose

646
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,360
the people that have sold
this country down the river!

647
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,480
His speeches, if more subtle than those
Of his Republican all Joe McCarthy, 

648
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,560
were just as aggressive. 

649
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,240
The direct result of Truman's decision
is that China has gone Communist!

650
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,080
Mao is a monster!
Why?

651
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,400
Who in the State Department
is watching over American interests?

652
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,800
Who has given the Russians
the atomic bomb?

653
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,520
The Soviet Union is an example of a
slave state in the ultimate development. 

654
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,280
Driven by demons that seemed
more personal than political, 

655
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,080
Nixon became Eisenhower's
vice presidential candidate in 1952. 

656
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,040
Then came the Checkers crisis. Nixon was
accused of hiding a secret slush fund. 

657
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,400
About to be kicked off the ticket,
he went live on national television

658
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,200
in an unprecedented
appearance. 

659
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,040
I'm going to give to this television
audience a complete financial history. 

660
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,920
Everything I've earned, spent,
-The list included their house, 

661
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,800
their Oldsmobile, Pat's cloth coat.
-everything I own. 

662
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,640
And lastly, in what was
to become history, 

663
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,560
a sentimental gift
from a Texas businessman. 

664
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
You know what it was?
It was a little cocker spaniel dog

665
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,440
in a crate that he'd sent all the way
from Texas--black and white, spotted. 

666
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,600
And our little girl Tricia,
the six-year-old, named it Checkers. 

667
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,600
58 million people saw it.
-And like all kids, they love the dog. 

668
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,960
It was shameless it was manipulative
-I just wanna say right now, 

669
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,840
regardless of what they say about him,
we're gonna keep him. 

670
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
It was a huge success. 

671
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,800
He stayed on the national scene, 

672
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,680
serving two terms as vice president
under Eisenhower. 

673
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,080
Against Khrushchev
at the Kitchen Debate in Moscow

674
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,240
and stoned by Latin mobs
in Venezuela, 

675
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,720
Nixon once again became
a national hero. 

676
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,760
But it all came to a crashing end
against Kennedy in 1960

677
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,280
and Pat Brown
in California in '62. 

678
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,400
And thus ends a great
American political story. 

679
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,560
The truth is, we never knew who
Richard Nixon really was, 

680
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,920
and now that he is gone
we never will. 

681
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,520
Poor little Tricia.
-Her daddy couldn't get a job

682
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,920
in this city
when he got out of Duke. 

683
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,800
Every white-shoe lawyer firm turned
me down. Didn't have the right look. 

684
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,520
I couldn't even get into the F. B. I.
-Hi! How are ya?

685
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,880
Did you catch that picture of you
in the news last week, Dick?

686
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,760
You were standin' on Fifth Avenue.
-Oh, yeah. 

687
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,680
You were lookin'
Straight ahead

688
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,720
and everyone else was lookin' the other
way, like you just farted or somethin'. 

689
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,480
It said-It said, 

690
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,400
Who remembers
Dick Nixon?

691
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,280
Unbelievable.
I was screamin'. 

692
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,160
Yeah, that was hilarious,
Martha. 

693
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,800
They were were waiting
For the light to change. 

694
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,320
Typical of the press,
They wouldn't correct it--

695
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,960
We oughta catch Rocky
before he leaves. 

696
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,640
I'm sure it's just
a run of bad luck, Mr. Nixon. 

697
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,520
He can walk this direction, can't he?
-I don't know. 

698
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,360
I've read some nice things about you.
-Maybe where you come from. 

699
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,760
But where I come from, Dick Nixon is
as misunderstood as a fox in a henhouse. 

700
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,680
And do you know why?

701
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,160
Because, my darlin', they all think
that your smile and your face

702
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,120
are never in the same place
at the same time. 

703
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,040
You and me, we're gonna have to
work on that, sweetie. 

704
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,280
Someone freshen Martha's drink.
She's down a quart. 

705
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,200
Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

706
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,520
I think he is frightened by my charm.
-I know I am. 

707
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,400
Pat can't stand her.
-It's a thing she does. 

708
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,360
She talks at night. 

709
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,160
Talks all day too. How the hell
can you put up with her, John?

710
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,040
Well, I'm in love with her.
And she's great in bed. 

711
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,000
If a Rockefeller can't become
president of the United States, 

712
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,920
then what is
the point of democracy?

713
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,840
The point
Of democracy is

714
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,720
that even the son of a grocer
can become president. 

715
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,520
And you came damn close, Dick.
How are you? Hi, John. 

716
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,360
New York treating you all right? I'm
sorry I haven't been able to see you. 

717
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,840
You're looking happy, Rocky.
-Happy. Happy, Dick Nixon. 

718
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,920
You remember him.
-Nice to see you again. 

719
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,640
You're obviously making him happy.
-Repartee, Dick! Marvelous!

720
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,600
What you predicting?

721
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,240
Your boy Goldwater
gonna split the party?

722
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,120
Some say you are, Rocky.
-Let me tell you something. 

723
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,720
Every time the Republican party is a
home to extremism, we lose the election. 

724
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,400
You oughta know better than anybody.
-Yeah. 

725
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,280
This guy Goldwater
is as stupid as McCarthy. 

726
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,560
And McCarthy never did you any good
in the long run, now, did he?

727
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,240
That's right. 

728
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,960
I hate these
cocktail parties. 

729
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,560
John, I'm in hell. 

730
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,840
I'll be mentally dead in two years
and physically dead in four. 

731
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,760
Make some money, Dick. 

732
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,640
Prove yourself
to the Wall Street crowd. 

733
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,920
Let Goldwater and Rockefeller
take the fall against Kennedy. 

734
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,720
I don't know. I miss
making love to the people. 

735
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,680
I miss
entering a room. 

736
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,680
I miss the
pure acting of it, John. 

737
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
I gotta get back
in the arena. 

738
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time!

739
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,040
Right this way, ladies and gentlemen. 

740
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,520
It's for you, it's for me.
It's Studebaker for 1963. 

741
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Amen. Bless you
for being here. 

742
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,480
There's a man that loves Studebakers.
-Can I get your autograph?

743
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,040
The ex-vice president
-Mr. Nixon, please run again!

744
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,600
Of the United States,
Richard M. Nixon!

745
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,920
You throw
a hell of a party, Jack. 

746
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,120
The party ain't even
started yet. 

747
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,080
I've asked these gals out to the ranch
for a little private thing. 

748
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,960
We're gonna have some fun,
I guarantee ya. 

749
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,840
And there's some fellas
I'd really like you to meet. 

750
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,680
Trini and I got an early plane. We're
hoping to be back in New York for--

751
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,280
These guys are real interesting.
And quiet too. The girls are too. 

752
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,240
It's not often us Texans
Get an opportunity

753
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,720
to entertain the future president
of the United States. 

754
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,080
Like you said, Jack,
I'm just a New York lawyer. 

755
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,960
We'll see about that.
-Mr. Nixon, are you gonna run again?

756
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,320
I don't know about that.
-He will! I guarantee it!

757
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,560
Buy me a convertible?

758
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,440
I'll buy you
a diamond ring. 

759
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,920
Hello, baby.
-Hey, wait, wait, wait. 

760
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,840
This is Julie there. 

761
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,760
And that's Tricia.
-Oh, yeah. 

762
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,040
She reminds me a bit of you, Sandy.
-She really is wholesome. 

763
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,360
But, um, what about you?
What do you like?

764
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,160
Well, I like music.
-I like jazz. 

765
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,040
Jazz, yeah.
Guy Lombardo. 

766
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,920
How about rock'n'roll? Elvis Presley?
-Yeah, he's good. 

767
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,840
Yeah. Decent guy. 

768
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,200
Well, I guess for me
It also, um, depends on

769
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,720
what I'm doin'
to the music, Dick. 

770
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,480
Yeah. 

771
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,960
So, uh, what's it like
bein' so famous and all?

772
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,040
A vice president!

773
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,440
Well, it's, uh,
not like that, Sandy. 

774
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,400
You see, the reason I got into politics
in the first place was, 

775
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,240
well, uh, to do something
for the people. 

776
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,360
So, how are
you two doing?

777
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,840
You know, Dick, there's more
privacy in the back of the--

778
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,320
No, Trini,
we're fine here. 

779
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,520
Okay. 

780
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,800
Hell, Kennedy just pissed Cuba away
to the Russians. Just pissed it away!

781
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,680
And he doesn't know what the hell
he's doin'in Vietnam. 

782
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,280
These are dangerous times, Dick,
especially for business. 

783
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,320
Agreed.
-We know what you tried to do for Cuba. 

784
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,120
If you had been elected in '60,
Castro would be dead now. 

785
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,640
Gentlemen, I tried.
I told Kennedy to go into Cuba. 

786
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,240
He heard me and
he made his decision. 

787
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,040
I appreciate your sentiments. I've heard
them from many fine Cuban patriots. 

788
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,400
But it's nothing I can
do anything about. 

789
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,760
It's a long drive to Dallas, and Trini
and I have a plane to catch tomorrow. 

790
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,360
So--
-Dick, these boys want you to run. 

791
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,720
Absolutely.
-That's right. 

792
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,640
Now, they're serious. They can deliver
the South and put Texas in your column. 

793
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,160
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
That'll never happen. 

794
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,000
I don't think you know how much people
hate Kennedy down here. 

795
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,320
He's comin'to town tomorrow, and they
will run his ass outta town on a rail!

796
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,280
Damn right.
-That we will. 

797
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,120
We are willing to give you a shit
pot full of money to get rid of him. 

798
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,040
More than you
ever dreamed of. 

799
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,640
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64
with all the money in the world. 

800
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,680
Suppose Kennedy
don't run in '64. 

801
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,240
Not a chance. 

802
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,960
Yeah. 

803
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,360
Well, gentlemen, I promised my wife
I, uh--I'm out of politics. 

804
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,560
You just came down here for the weather.
Is that right, Mr. Nixon?

805
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,520
I came down here to close
a deal for Studebaker. 

806
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,520
What about '68, Dick?

807
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,440
Five years, Trini. 

808
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,680
In politics,
that's an eternity. 

809
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,600
Dick. 

810
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,520
Your country
needs you. 

811
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,080
Unfortunately the country's
Not available right now. 

812
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,600
President Kennedy's due in
from Fort Worth in about an hour. 

813
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,960
Kennedy is due in.
-Yeah, I know. 

814
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,880
Come on!

815
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,280
Let's go through here. Excuse us.
-Excuse me. Coming through. 

816
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,200
Excuse us.
-Thank you. 

817
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,560
Please step away from the gate there.
-Sorry. 

818
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,560
Go find the pilot.
Let's get out of here. 

819
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,480
Look, Edgar, these, uh--
these guys were really strange. 

820
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,400
I mean, you know,
extremists. 

821
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,600
Strange?
-Right-wing stuff. 

822
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,520
Birchers?
-Birchers, yeah. 

823
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,880
This thing's pretty straight, Dick.
-In Dallas, Lee Harvey Oswald--

824
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,720
Oswald's got
a Cuba connection?

825
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,840
To Castro?
-maximum security facility. 

826
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,720
He's a Communist. That makes sense. 

827
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,520
Okay, well,
thank you, Edgar. 

828
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,160
Senator Ted Kennedy,
arriving early this morning

829
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,400
with his mother
and sister, Eunice. 

830
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,240
Hoover says this Oswald
checks out as a--

831
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,920
a beatnik, a real bum. 

832
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,520
Dick, you should
call Bobby. 

833
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,520
Ah, he doesn't want me
At the funeral. 

834
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,560
You don't have to go.
-DeGaulle's gonna be there. 

835
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,520
McMillan. Adenauer. 

836
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,000
We go now to the rotunda--

837
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,400
Nixon can't not
be there. 

838
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,280
Then call him.
I'm sure it was an oversight. 

839
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,160
Thousands, of mourners
-Yeah. 

840
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,040
will pay their respects
-Jesus. 

841
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,960
to their fallen leader. 

842
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,160
It's awful. It's an awful thing
For this country. 

843
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,120
Dick. 

844
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,920
Huh?
No, it's his way, uh--

845
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,840
He hates me. 

846
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,800
He and Teddy. 

847
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,720
They always hated me. 

848
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,520
They lost their brother.
You know what that means, Dick. 

849
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,800
relaxed with his family
in Hyannis Port. 

850
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,640
These are perhaps the last images
of him alive with his family. 

851
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,480
Please make it stop!

852
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,800
Hold him tighter. 

853
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,960
Hold him tighter. 

854
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,040
Hold him tighter. 

855
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,200
Daddy, please!
Make it stop!

856
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,120
Hold him tighter. 

857
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,080
The infection's
spread to his spine. 

858
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,040
Come on!

859
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,760
Stop it!

860
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,000
Get off!

861
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,720
You're it!

862
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,880
No. No, don't!

863
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,160
If I'd been president,
they never would've killed me. 

864
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,840
Vice President Johnson,
shown here being sworn in--

865
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,600
Dick, are you gonna call? Bobby.
-Hmm?

866
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,440
has taken the reins of power
in a smooth transition. 

867
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,360
I'll go through Johnson. 

868
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,280
We'll be invited. 

869
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,600
This is a sad time for all people. 

870
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,040
I ask for your help. 

871
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,680
and are
going to see Vietnam through

872
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,080
to an honorable peace

873
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,280
to defend
an honored cause, 

874
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,240
whatever the price,
whatever the burden, 

875
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,400
whatever the sacrifice

876
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,760
that duty
may require. 

877
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,160
Accordingly, 

878
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,120
I shall not seek

879
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,960
and I will not accept

880
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,960
the nomination of my party
for another term as your president. 

881
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,680
Good night,
and God bless all of you. 

882
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,720
Johnson's withdrawal
resurrects Richard Nixon

883
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,880
as a strong Republican candidate
with a secret plan to end the war. 

884
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,600
His mother, Hannah Nixon,
just before her death last year, 

885
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,200
commented on
her son's chances. 

886
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,640
Mrs. Nixon, do you think your son
will ever return to politics?

887
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,640
I-I don't think
he has a choice. 

888
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,800
He has always
been a leader. 

889
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,080
Do you think he'd make
a great president, Mrs. Nixon?

890
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,800
If he's on God's side,
yes. 

891
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,720
You must be very proud
Of your son. 

892
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,600
I have always been proud
of all of my children. 

893
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,000
Of course,
no one can see into the future. 

894
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,160
We didn't know
this day would come. 

895
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,720
Where'd he go?
-In the side door. 

896
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,640
Is that Mitchell?
-Shit!

897
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,440
I thought that guy
was gonna kiss your hand. 

898
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,360
Congratulations, sir.
-Yeah, thanks. 

899
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,240
Jesus, Dick!
I've never seen anything like it. 

900
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,640
Even the goddamn Times
is saying you've got it. 

901
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,560
Vietnam's gonna put
you in there, Chief. 

902
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,720
We got the press this time.
-We got the big mo. We're back. 

903
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,960
So you've decided. 

904
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,680
Were you planning
to tell me?

905
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,120
We haven't announced
anything yet, but--

906
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,720
Jesus, uh--
Pat. 

907
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,560
Uh, wait in the living room,
Will you, fellas? What is it, John?

908
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,400
You need her, Dick. In '60,
she was worth five, six million votes. 

909
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,880
Yeah. Don't worry.
I'll use the old Nixon charm. 

910
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,320
In there. Okay?

911
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,560
Who could resist that?

912
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,560
Buddy?

913
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,440
You should be going.
Primaries are soon, aren't they?

914
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,640
New Hampshire.
-I love you, Buddy. I need you. 

915
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,200
I don't want them
to love me. 

916
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,080
But I need you
Out there. 

917
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,400
It won't be
like the last time. 

918
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,840
The war's crippled
the Democrats. 

919
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,520
I can win.
We deserve it. 

920
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,560
It's ours, Buddy,
at last. 

921
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,480
Nobody knows that
Better than you. 

922
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,680
Frank Nixon's boy. 

923
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,200
Do you remember
what Mom said?

924
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,080
We're not like other people.
We--We don't choose our way. 

925
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,080
We can really
change things, Buddy. 

926
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,640
We got a chance to get it right.
We can change America. 

927
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,840
It was our dream, Buddy,
together, always. 

928
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Do you really want this, Dick?
-Yeah. This, above all. 

929
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,840
And then you'll be happy?
-Yeah, you know I will. 

930
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,280
Yes! I will.
Yeah. 

931
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,480
Then I'll be there
For you. 

932
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,280
And we are gonna win this time.
I can feel it. 

933
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,520
Yeah!

934
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,920
You're the strongest woman
I ever met, Buddy. 

935
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,280
Can I just ask for one thing?
-Anything. 

936
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,680
Would you kiss me?
-Yeah!

937
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,280
I'm a new person.
Hey!

938
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,080
My thanks to all of you. And now it's
on to Chicago, and let's win there. 

939
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,000
Thank you very much. 

940
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,880
I would never question,
uh, Senator Kennedy's patriotism. 

941
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,560
But promising peace at any price
-Right there. 

942
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,360
is, uh, exactly what
the North Vietnamese want to hear. 

943
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,080
Cue the crowd. 

944
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,080
Go to this
bald guy. Yeah, he's great, isn't he?

945
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,080
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, 

946
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,760
have a plan
to end the war immediately. 

947
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,560
But not for
peace at any price, 

948
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,280
but peace with honor. 

949
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,400
What do you think this plan is, Edgar?
A nuclear attack?

950
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,280
He's lying, Clyde.
Always has. 

951
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,480
That's why Nixon's
always been useful. 

952
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,560
Gracias, amigo.
-De nada, senor. 

953
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,600
Hold still. 

954
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,160
Okay, who's next?
-The Negro. 

955
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,720
No, we gotta have a Negro.
This guy right here. 

956
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,760
Negro, front row. 

957
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,120
Mr. Nixon, sir.
-Yeah. 

958
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,760
We-We all know that you
have built your career

959
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,840
on smearing people
as Communists. 

960
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,160
And now you are building your campaign
on the divisions in this country, 

961
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,200
stirring up hatred and turning people
against each other. 

962
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,360
What the fuck's he doing?
He's making a speech!

963
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,360
Cut him off.
-I can't. This isn't Russia. 

964
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,440
He sounds like a negro.
He's saying all these negro things!

965
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,520
What's he doing?
-He sounded white when we screened him. 

966
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,560
He doesn't sound white now.
He sounds like Angela Davis. 

967
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,480
When are you going to tell us
What you really stand for?

968
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,360
Put on a commercial.
-There are no commercials. 

969
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,440
Go to commercial!
-You bought the whole half hour, baby. 

970
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,040
Are you going to take off that mask
-Shit!

971
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,000
and show us who you really are?

972
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,240
Shut up and sit down!
-Okay. Okay. 

973
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,280
It's a high hard one, Chief.
-Okay, okay. 

974
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,200
Park it.
-There are divisions in this country--

975
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,400
That's because you created them.
-I did not create them. 

976
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,600
The Democrats did.
If it's dialogue you want, 

977
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,160
you're more likely to get it from me
than from people burning down cities. 

978
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,280
Dr. King said the same thing.
-Oh, please. 

979
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,200
Do you know, young man,
who a great hero is? Abraham Lincoln. 

980
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,720
Abraham Lincoln.
-Lincoln. Is he beautiful, huh?

981
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,720
He believed in common ground.
He brought this country together. 

982
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,800
I love that man. I love him. 

983
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,160
I want the son of a bitch who
Got that agitator to be fired!

984
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,440
I have another question.
-There's a little girl sitting here. 

985
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,440
A little girl sitting with a sign.
-Bag the spook. 

986
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,680
Can you see the little girl?
-Okay. 

987
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,320
There are three simple words. :
''Bring us together. ''

988
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,240
That is what I want, and that is what
the great majority of Americans want. 

989
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,600
And that is why
I want to be president. 

990
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,440
To bring us together. 

991
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,840
Give me a break, Mary.
-Now, you all know me. I'm one of you. 

992
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,600
I grew up here,
a stone's throw from here, 

993
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,560
on a little lemon ranch
in Yorba Linda. 

994
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,600
It was the poorest lemon ranch
in California, I can tell you that. 

995
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,080
The poorest lemon ranch in California,
I can assure you of that. 

996
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,800
My dad sold it before
they found oil on it. 

997
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,440
My dad sold it before
they found oil on it. 

998
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,520
But it was all we had.
-But it was all we had. 

999
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,400
My dad built the farm.
-Huh. You're new here. 

1000
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,360
What's your name?
-Joaquin, Mr. Hoover. 

1001
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,280
Oh. 

1002
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,840
My father sacrificed
everything he had

1003
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,800
so that his sons
could go to college. 

1004
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,360
A gentle Quaker mother quietly wept
-Oh, Christ. 

1005
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,800
When he went to war.
-Turn this crap off, Clyde. 

1006
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,720
It's giving me a headache. 

1007
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,920
You may go, Joaquin. 

1008
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,360
I want to see him,
Clyde. 

1009
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,560
Edgar, he works
in the kitchen. 

1010
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,280
Not the boy, you idiot.
Nixon. 

1011
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,720
You hear what he said in Oregon

1012
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,280
about me having
too much power?

1013
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,440
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again.
Who do you want?

1014
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,360
Kennedy?

1015
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,320
Never. 

1016
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,320
He'll fry in hell
For what he did to me. 

1017
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,240
But Nixon don't know that. 

1018
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,200
Which is why I'm gonna have to
remind him that he needs us

1019
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,600
a hell of a lot more
than we need him. 

1020
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,440
And they're off!!

1021
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,720
Your boy's
on the way up. 

1022
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,720
You know, I met this guy
years ago in Havana. You know that. 

1023
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,120
Come on!

1024
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,040
He's folding, Johnny. 

1025
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,640
Now, now, now.
You just wait a second now. 

1026
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,480
Olly's boy on the inside!

1027
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,400
And a tragedy!

1028
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,280
A bit extreme, isn't it?

1029
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,360
It's the drama.
Look, the crowd loves this shit. 

1030
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,120
Hey, there's Randolph Scott
Over there. Look at that. 

1031
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,840
Cash these for me,
would you, Johnny?

1032
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,720
Easy! Easy, easy!

1033
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,200
It's a two-dollar bet, Edgar.
You got thousands coming on this. 

1034
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,480
I mean, what the fuck?
-I told you, just cash it, Johnny. 

1035
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,160
And don't swear around me.
Come on. 

1036
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,440
Uh-huh.
Hello. 

1037
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,560
Edgar. 

1038
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,080
Wonderful to see you. Clyde.
-Mr. Nixon. 

1039
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,760
Hi.
-Thank you for coming, Richard. 

1040
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,800
Okay. Oh. Winning?

1041
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,440
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
Are you gonna win?

1042
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,760
You should ask Bobby. 

1043
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,280
Little Bobby.
-Yeah, Bobby Kennedy. 

1044
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,200
Yeah. 

1045
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,080
Walk with me down to the paddock.
I'd like to look at the horses. 

1046
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,920
Uh, can we talk here?
I got the police chiefs in San Diego. 

1047
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,440
Actually, I'm trying to
spare you an embarrassment. 

1048
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,160
That was Johnny Roselli,
you just passed. 

1049
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,280
He's on his way back. 

1050
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,280
Roselli?
Johnny Roselli?

1051
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,600
Yes. You know him,
Richard? No?

1052
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,040
From Cuba?

1053
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,200
Hey, Johnny Roselli.
How're you doin'?

1054
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,520
Dick.
-How are you?

1055
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,800
I never met the man.
Uh--

1056
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,160
Well, I know you've, uh, 

1057
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,680
been very careful not to. 

1058
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,800
That's why I'm so concerned. 

1059
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,000
Okay. 

1060
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,080
And they're off!!

1061
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,360
You'll win the nomination. 

1062
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,080
Yeah, it could be 1960
all over again, Edgar. 

1063
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,040
Love you, Dick!

1064
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,520
And Bobby's got the magic
like a goddamn rock star. 

1065
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:31,040
They climb all over each other
Just to touch his clothes. 

1066
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,720
He'll ride his brother's corpse
right into the White House. 

1067
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,480
Hmm. 

1068
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,720
If things remain
as they are. 

1069
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,040
He's got
the anti-war vote. 

1070
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,960
Or he'll steal it,
like his brother. 

1071
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,760
Bobby's a mean little
son of a bitch, Edgar. 

1072
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,640
He had the I. R. S. audit my mother
when she was dying in the nursing home. 

1073
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,160
I know.
-We should shoot the son of a bitch. 

1074
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,800
I wanna fight
Just as dirty, Edgar. 

1075
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,640
His women.
Use his women. 

1076
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,640
Any information you have. 

1077
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,480
The son of a bitch
is not going to steal from me again. 

1078
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,720
Can you back me up on this?

1079
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,680
Can I count
on your support?

1080
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,560
I look at it from the point of view that
the system can only take so much abuse. 

1081
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,480
It adjusts itself eventually.
-Yeah. 

1082
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,560
But there are times
there are savage outbursts. 

1083
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,680
The late Dr. King,
For example. 

1084
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,840
Amoral hypocrite. 

1085
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,120
Screwing women
like a degenerate tomcat, 

1086
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,440
stirring up the blacks,
preaching against our system. 

1087
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,000
Sometimes the system comes
very close to cracking. 

1088
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,960
We've already had one radical
in the White House. 

1089
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,160
I don't believe it would
survive another. 

1090
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,120
Well, like I said,
uh, Edgar--

1091
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,200
You ask if you can count
on my support. 

1092
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,000
As long as I can count
on yours. 

1093
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,200
Yeah, the old queen
did it on purpose. 

1094
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,320
No, he wasn't protecting me.
He was just putting me on notice. 

1095
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,560
That he knew Roselli?
-No. 

1096
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,120
Hoover knew
a lot of gangsters. 

1097
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,640
Johnny Roselli wasn't
Just any gangster. 

1098
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,000
Johnny Roselli was one
Of the gangsters

1099
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,280
who set up Track 2
in Cuba. 

1100
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,360
No, I know his name.
It was Bob Engel. 

1101
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
Oh, well, I know
all about that. 

1102
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,240
I don't understand that.
Track 2 is Chile. 

1103
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,760
Yeah, Chile, the Congo,
Guadalajara, Iran, Cuba. 

1104
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:44,560
Wherever there was need
for an executive action capability, 

1105
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,480
there's Track 2. 

1106
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,400
In Cuba, Track 1 was, uh,
the Bay of Pigs invasion. 

1107
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,840
Track 2 was our idea. 

1108
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,800
We thought that
the invasion wouldn't work

1109
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,760
unless we got rid
of Castro. 

1110
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,520
So we asked ourselves, uh, 

1111
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,480
who else wants Castro dead?

1112
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,240
Was it the Mafia
Or money people?

1113
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,160
So we put together
Track 2. 

1114
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,560
First assassination attempt
was, uh, in '60. 

1115
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,360
Uh, just before the election.
-Before?

1116
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,120
Eisenhower approved that?
-Yeah. 

1117
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,120
Well, he didn't veto it. 

1118
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,240
I ran the
White House side

1119
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,120
and, uh, the mob contact
was Johnny Roselli. 

1120
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,280
One of the C. I. A. guys
was this jackass

1121
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,200
Howard Hunt. 

1122
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,920
Jesus. 

1123
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,840
Yeah. Not just Howard Hunt,
but Frank Sturgis

1124
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,080
and all those other Cubans. 

1125
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,520
All of them in Watergate--

1126
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:02,080
Uh, they're all involved
in Cuba. 

1127
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,960
Yeah, Hunt reported
to my military aide. 

1128
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,240
I don't know how much
Hunt knows, or, or the Cubans, 

1129
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,800
but you never know. 

1130
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,720
So you
wanted Castro dead. 

1131
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,240
Every body wanted
Castro dead. 

1132
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,200
You know, if Hunt
and the others are C. I. A. , 

1133
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,000
why don't we just dump this
back in the C. I. A. 's lap, 

1134
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,920
let Dick Helms
take the fall?

1135
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,080
Because. 

1136
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,840
Because Helms knows,
knows too much. 

1137
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,000
If there's anyone in this country
who knows more than me, 

1138
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,200
it's Hoover and Helms, and you
don't fuck with Dick Helms, period. 

1139
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,640
All right. 

1140
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,920
But why, if Kennedy
was so clean in all this, 

1141
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,760
didn't he cancel Track 2?
-Because he didn't even know about it. 

1142
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,640
The C. I. A. ,
uh, never told him. 

1143
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,560
They just kept it going. 

1144
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:03,000
It had a life of its own
like it was some, uh, 

1145
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,120
kind of a thing,
you know?

1146
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,960
It doesn't even know it exists. It eats
people when it doesn't need 'em anymore. 

1147
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,240
Two days after the Bay of Pigs, 

1148
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,640
Kennedy called me and reamed me out. 

1149
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,960
He just found out
About Track 2. 

1150
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:27,040
You never told him?
-I didn't want him to get the credit. 

1151
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,960
He said I'd stabbed him
in the back

1152
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,200
and called me a two-bit
grocery clerk from Whittier. 

1153
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,960
Fever if I kissed you
fever if I held you tight

1154
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,680
Huh.
-Fever in the morning

1155
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,120
Fever all through the night
-That's the last time I ever saw him. 

1156
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,120
Play it on the runway
in Paris

1157
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,400
See, when I saw Bobby
lying there on the floor, 

1158
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,200
Arms stretched out like that,
his eyes staring, 

1159
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,160
I knew then
I'd be president. 

1160
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,640
His death paved the way,
didn't it?

1161
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,560
Yeah. 

1162
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,720
Vietnam, the Kennedy's

1163
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,600
cleared a path through the wilderness
just for me. 

1164
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,560
Over the bodies. 

1165
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,400
Four bodies. 

1166
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,720
You mean two. 

1167
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,600
Two bodies. 

1168
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,400
Four. 

1169
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,880
How many did you have?

1170
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,920
Hundreds of thousands?

1171
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,680
Where would we be
without death, huh?

1172
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,400
Abe?

1173
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,080
Who's helping us?

1174
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,080
Is it God,
or is it

1175
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,720
death?

1176
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,000
Harold. 

1177
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,960
Why don't you sit down, huh?

1178
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,960
Here. 

1179
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,160
That was a whopper. 

1180
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,840
You'll be able
to do it now. 

1181
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,120
What?
-Go to law school. 

1182
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,080
Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it.
-Harold. 

1183
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,240
Mama expects great things
from you. 

1184
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,080
Can I--
Can I get you anything?

1185
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,960
Relax, Dick. 

1186
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,120
It's just me, huh?

1187
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,920
The desert's so beautiful,
isn't it?

1188
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,040
I want to go home, Dick. 

1189
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,960
Time to go home. 

1190
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,320
You--

1191
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,680
You're not gonna quit on me now,
are you, Harold?

1192
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,360
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

1193
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,200
Richard. 

1194
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,440
I can't. 

1195
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,800
You must. 

1196
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,160
This law school, it's a gift
from thy brother. 

1197
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,480
He had to die
For me to get it?

1198
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,480
Something has to come
Of this. 

1199
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,200
It's meant
to make us stronger. 

1200
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,840
Thee art stronger than Harold,
Stronger than Arthur. 

1201
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,680
God has chosen thee
to survive. 

1202
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,680
What about happiness,
Mother?

1203
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,560
Thee will find thy peace
At the center, Richard. 

1204
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,480
Strength in this life, 

1205
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,200
happiness in the next. 

1206
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,720
Hey! Hey!

1207
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,040
Now tell me you didn't
Want this, Buddy. 

1208
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,840
Hey!

1209
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,320
When the strongest nation
in the world can be tied down

1210
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,720
for four years
in a war in Vietnam

1211
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,760
with no end in sight;

1212
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,840
when the richest nation in the world
can't manage its own economy;

1213
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,240
when the nation with the greatest
tradition of the rule of law

1214
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,560
is plagued by
unprecedented lawlessness;

1215
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,240
when a nation that has been known for
a century for equality of opportunity

1216
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,880
is torn by unprecedented
racial violence

1217
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,240
when the president of the United States
cannot travel abroad

1218
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,200
or to any major city
at home

1219
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,880
without fear
of a hostile demonstration, 

1220
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,840
then it is time for new leadership
for the United States of America. 

1221
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,440
As we look at America, we see cities
enveloped in smoke and flame, 

1222
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,960
millions of Americans
crying out in anguish, 

1223
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,160
''Did we come all the way
for this?

1224
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,400
Did American boys die in Normandy
and Valley Forge for this?''

1225
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,080
I pledge to you
That the current wave of violence

1226
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,400
will not be the wave
of the future. 

1227
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,560
Let us begin by committing ourselves

1228
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,600
to the truth--to find the truth,
to speak the truth

1229
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,520
and to live the truth. 

1230
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,720
A new voice is being heard
across America today. 

1231
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,680
It is not the voice
Of the protesters or the shouters. 

1232
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,400
It is the quiet voice of the majority
Of Americans who've been forgotten--

1233
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,520
the non-shouters,
the, uh, non-demonstrators. 

1234
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,000
They're the good people. They work hard
and they save and they pay their taxes. 

1235
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,560
Now, who are they?
Let me tell you who they are. 

1236
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,280
They're in this audience
by the thousands. 

1237
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,080
They're the white Americans
and black Americans, 

1238
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,680
Mexican and Italian Americans. 

1239
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,000
They're the great
silent majority, 

1240
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,120
and they have
become angry, finally. 

1241
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,160
Angry, not with hate,
But angry, my friends, 

1242
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,080
because they love America

1243
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,200
and they don't like what's happened
to America these last four years. 

1244
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,400
Let us understand. 

1245
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,240
North Vietnam cannot defeat
or humiliate the United States. 

1246
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,280
Only Americans
can do that!

1247
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,440
I say to you tonight--

1248
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,720
I say to you tonight we must have
a new feeling of responsibility, 

1249
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,280
of self-discipline. 

1250
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,440
We must look to renew
state and local government. 

1251
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:22,440
We must have a complete reform of a big,
bloated federal government. 

1252
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,360
Those of us in public service know

1253
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,840
we can have full prosperity
in peacetime. 

1254
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,480
Yes, we can cut
the defence budget. 

1255
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,360
We can reduce, uh,
conventional forces in Europe. 

1256
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,480
We can restore
the natural environment. 

1257
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,560
We can improve health care and make it
more available to all people. 

1258
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,000
And yes, we can have
a complete reform of this government. 

1259
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,320
We can have a new
American revolution!

1260
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:01,160
The whole world is watching!

1261
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,720
The whole world is watching!

1262
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,760
It'd be a disaster. 

1263
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,920
There's a lot of sympathy
out there for Cambodia. 

1264
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,840
Tiny, little, neutral
Buddhist country. 

1265
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,960
They'll be rioting in the streets,
on your front lawn!

1266
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,880
Building the
Cambodian army up?

1267
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,520
My God, that would be harder
than a Vietnamese Army. 

1268
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,240
They have no tradition. 

1269
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,960
Mr. President, the government
there will collapse. 

1270
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,600
So you're saying, do nothing.
-No, sir, continue the bombing. 

1271
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,080
The same old horseshit.
Well, that's not good enough. 

1272
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,520
I'm sick of being pushed around
by the, uh, Vietnamese

1273
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,800
like we're some, uh,
you know, pitiful giant. 

1274
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,560
They're using our P. O. W. s
to humiliate us. 

1275
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,640
What we need now
is a bold move into Cambodia, 

1276
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,600
and go right after their,
uh, V. C. base camps, 

1277
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,440
and, uh, uh, make 'em scream,
hit 'em in the ass. 

1278
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,760
What do you think, Henry?
-Well, as you know, 

1279
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,240
most of my staff have weighed in
against this incursion. 

1280
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,120
They believe it will fail to achieve
anything fundamental militarily

1281
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,120
and will result in crushing criticism
domestically. 

1282
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,280
I didn't ask what your staff thinks.
What do you think, Henry?

1283
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,760
What I think is,
they're cowards. 

1284
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,600
Their opposition represents the
cowardice of the eastern establishment. 

1285
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,560
They don't realize,
as you do, sir, 

1286
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,120
that the Communists
only respect strength, 

1287
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,560
and they will only negotiate
in good faith

1288
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,920
if they fear the mad man, Nixon.
-Exactly!

1289
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,840
Unpredictability is our best asset. 

1290
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,320
We gotta take the war to 'em, hit'em
where it hurts, right in the nuts. 

1291
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,640
More assassinations.
Right, Al?

1292
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,680
That's what they're doing,
Mr. President. 

1293
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,960
See, your people in the State
Department, Bill, they don't understand. 

1294
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,960
You gotta--
-Mr. President. 

1295
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,400
You gotta electrify people with bold
moves. I mean, bold moves make history. 

1296
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,560
Like, uh, Teddy Roosevelt,
T. R. , 

1297
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,840
rushing up San Juan Hill. 

1298
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,040
Small event, but dramatic.
People took notice. 

1299
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,400
Yes, well, they'll take notice,
all right. 

1300
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,720
If we sneak out of this war, 

1301
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,160
another will start
a mile down the road. 

1302
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,960
We bite the bullet here
in Cambodia. There. 

1303
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,120
We bomb the hell
out of these people. 

1304
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,800
Tonight American
and South Vietnamese units

1305
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:24,040
will attack the headquarters of the
entire Communist military operation

1306
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,560
in South Vietnam. 

1307
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:29,440
This is not an invasion
of Cambodia. 

1308
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:34,360
We take this action not for the purpose
of expanding the war into Cambodia, 

1309
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,040
but for the purpose
of ending the war in Vietnam. 

1310
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:43,600
All across the nation, 

1311
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,400
major student protests against
the U. S. invasion of Cambodia

1312
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,560
rocked college campuses. 

1313
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,160
At Jackson State, two Negro students
were killed and ten were wounded. 

1314
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,520
Unanimously united behind--
-In the streets of New York City, 

1315
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,080
student protesters were attacked
by construction workers

1316
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,040
supporting President Nixon's policies. 

1317
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,680
In Washington, protesters have
barricaded the White House

1318
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,680
and are camping out
at the Lincoln Memorial. 

1319
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,640
We don't want your fucking war!

1320
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,600
See, when I think of those kids
out there in Vietnam, doing their duty, 

1321
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,800
uh, I bet they were scared. 

1322
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,120
I-I was
when I was there. 

1323
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,400
But when it comes down to it, you
really have to look up to these men

1324
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,560
because they're
the greatest. 

1325
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,400
No more war! No more war!

1326
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,320
I mean, you see these bums,
you know, blowing up the campuses, 

1327
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,600
burning books
and so forth. 

1328
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,360
And they call themselves,
uh, flower children. 

1329
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,280
I call them spoiled rotten. 

1330
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,400
And I tell you what
would cure them. 

1331
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,880
A good, old-fashioned trip
to my Ohio father's woodshed. 

1332
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,840
Right, Julie?
-Right, Dad. 

1333
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,400
That's what these bums need. Well, Kurt,
thanks and congratulations. 

1334
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,400
Thank you, sir.
-Yeah. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Bye. 

1335
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,520
Less than 24 hours
after president Nixon called them bums, 

1336
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,520
four students were shot dead
at Kent State University in Ohio. 

1337
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,120
Enraged student groups
across the country

1338
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,800
are calling for a general strike tomorrow to shut down the

entire university system until the Vietnam War is ended. 

1339
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,880
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.
Now, stop this pussyfooting around. 

1340
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,280
I mean, dead kids. How the hell did we
give the Democrats a weapon like this?

1341
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,880
Well, one way or the other,
Kent State is not good. 

1342
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,800
We have to get out
in front of this thing. 

1343
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,360
Follow the money. Follow the money.
-Sir?

1344
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,920
These kids are being manipulated
by the Communists, 

1345
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,880
like Chambers and Hiss. 

1346
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:00,040
What's the matter with you?
-This isn't'48. They'll never buy it. 

1347
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,400
How do you know that, John?
What's Hoover found, for God's sake?

1348
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,160
Well, he called the other day, sir.
He asked for President Harding. 

1349
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,760
We can have a national prayer day.
-Never complain, never explain. 

1350
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,480
Come on, these are not
fraternity pranks, John. 

1351
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,800
No, this is anarchy.
It's a revolution. 

1352
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,200
I wouldn't go that far, sir.
-Why not?

1353
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,000
Is it worth it, sir?
I mean--

1354
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,440
Is the war worth a one-term presidency?
Because that's what we're looking at. 

1355
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,600
I will not go down as the first
American president to lose a war. 

1356
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,880
Going to Cambodia,
bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos, 

1357
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,280
buys us time so we can get out and give
the South Vietnamese a fighting chance. 

1358
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,080
Exactly, sir.
-If we keep our heads, we'll win. 

1359
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,520
What, win Vietnam, sir?
-No, no. 

1360
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,600
No, but we can drive a stake through
the heart of the Communist alliance. 

1361
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:51,680
Henry's getting strong signals
from the Chinese. 

1362
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,280
They fear the Vietnamese
more than the Russians

1363
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,200
and they're worried
about a united Vietnam. 

1364
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,040
Now, if we stick it out,
we'll end up negotiating separately

1365
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,760
with both the Chinese
and the Soviets. 

1366
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,840
And we'll get better deals
than we ever dreamed of from both. 

1367
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,640
That is triangular diplomacy,
gentlemen. 

1368
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,520
Exactly,
Mr. President. 

1369
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,160
That's what geopolitics
is about. 

1370
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,600
The linking of the whole world
for self-interest. 

1371
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,960
Ron, how I can explain that on TV
to a bunch of simpleminded reporters

1372
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,880
and, uh, weeping mothers. 

1373
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,440
Yeah, but what am I telling
the press about Kent State?

1374
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,400
Ah, tell 'em what the hell you like.
They don't understand anyway. 

1375
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,280
Excuse me, sir. 

1376
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,040
Are you saying you're going
to recognize Red China?

1377
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,120
That would cost us
our strongest support. 

1378
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,000
No, I can do this because
I spent my whole career

1379
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,280
building anti-Communist
credentials. 

1380
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,480
If Kennedy or Johnson tried it, they'd
have crucified them, and rightfully so. 

1381
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,000
Damned risky, Mr. President.
Why don't we wait until the second term?

1382
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,880
This will get us a second term, John.
-This will get me a second term. 

1383
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:57,720
Damn it, without risk,
there's no heroism, there's no history. 

1384
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,600
Nixon was born to do this.
Give history a nudge. 

1385
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,120
Come on!
-Hear, hear. 

1386
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:06,240
I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work
we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to. 

1387
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,720
That's right. And if necessary,
I'll drop the big one. 

1388
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,840
We have to entertain
the possibility. 

1389
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,720
Goddamn it!
Who cooked this damn steak?

1390
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,920
Manolo, there's blood all over my plate.
Take it away. 

1391
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,840
I'm sorry, sir. 

1392
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,760
Are you all right?

1393
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,760
Yeah. 

1394
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,640
My brother, Harold, was the same age
as those kids, John. 

1395
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:53,960
Tuberculosis got him.
-Come on, it wasn't your fault. 

1396
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,760
The soldiers were kids too.
They just panicked. 

1397
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,200
Yeah. 

1398
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,120
They were throwing rocks,
John, just rocks. 

1399
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,320
They don't think I feel, 

1400
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,880
but I feel too much
sometimes. 

1401
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:16,760
I just can't let our whole policy
be dominated by our sentimentality. 

1402
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,280
You're doing the right thing.
Don't let 'em shake you. 

1403
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,560
No. 

1404
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,880
You know, it broke my heart
when Harold died. 

1405
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:30,680
That was a long time ago.
-Yeah. 

1406
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:34,760
I think that's when it starts--
when you're a kid. 

1407
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,160
The laughs and snubs
and slights you get

1408
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,920
because you're poor
or Irish or Jewish

1409
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,600
or just ugly. 

1410
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,320
Get off that.
That leads nowhere. 

1411
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,400
But you should offer condolences
to the families of those kids. 

1412
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,840
Sure. 

1413
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:00,560
I'd like to.
I'd like to offer my condolences. 

1414
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,120
But Nixon can't. 

1415
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,520
Manolo?

1416
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,520
Mano?

1417
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,720
Mr. President.
Yeah. 

1418
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,240
I-I'm sorry.
I-I was asleep. 

1419
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,960
What can I get you?

1420
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,600
Well, you know.
Of course. 

1421
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,680
Do you miss Cuba,
Manolo?

1422
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,600
Yes, Mr. President. 

1423
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,400
We let you down,
didn't we?

1424
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,480
Your people. 

1425
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,800
That was Mr. Kennedy, sir. 

1426
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,440
Oh. 

1427
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,320
You don't think
he was a hero, do you?

1428
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,600
He was a politician. 

1429
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,040
Did you cry when he died?

1430
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,600
Yes, sir. 

1431
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,600
Why?

1432
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:46,000
I don't know. 

1433
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,920
He made me... 

1434
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,320
... see the stars. 

1435
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,680
How did he do that?

1436
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,880
Those kids. 

1437
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,200
Why do they hate me
so much?

1438
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,600
Hi. I'm Dick Nixon. 

1439
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,480
Hi there. 

1440
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,880
Hi. Where you from?
Syracuse. 

1441
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:57,160
Oh, yeah,
the, uh, Orangemen. 

1442
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,760
Now, there's
a football program, uh... 

1443
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,960
... Jim Brown and that, uh,
other, uh... 

1444
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,000
... tailback... the one
with the blood disease. 

1445
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,640
Ernie Davis.
Yeah, right, right, right. 

1446
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,520
I used to play a little ball
myself at Whittier. 

1447
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:17,720
Of course, they used to use me
as atackling dummy. 

1448
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,160
We didn't come here
to talk about football. 

1449
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,480
Yeah, I understand that. 

1450
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:28,960
How old are you, young lady?
Nineteen. 

1451
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,600
Yeah. 

1452
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,480
Well, probably most of you think
I'm a real S. O. B. I know that. 

1453
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,560
I understand how you feel. 

1454
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,920
But, you know,
I want peace too. 

1455
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,120
But peace with honor.
What does that mean?

1456
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,120
Well, you can't have peace
without a price. 

1457
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,840
Sometimes you have to be,
uh, willing to fight for peace... 

1458
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,840
... and sometimes to die. 

1459
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:56,720
Yeah? Tell that to the G. I. s who
are going to die tomorrow in Vietnam. 

1460
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,640
What lets you kill
women and children?

1461
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,800
What you have to understand is we're
willing to die for what we believe in. 

1462
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,720
That's right.
It's the truth. 

1463
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,640
Yeah. 

1464
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,080
Look, that man up there... 

1465
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,960
... he lived in similar times. 

1466
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:16,320
Oh, he had chaos, civil war,
hatred between the races. 

1467
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,040
This is all bullshit.
Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room... 

1468
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,960
... at the White House
and just pray. 

1469
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,720
But, you know, Liberals... 

1470
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,040
... act like idealism belongs to them. 

1471
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,520
That's not true. 

1472
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,920
My family... 

1473
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,160
... went Republican because
Lincoln freed the slaves. 

1474
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,040
My grandmother
was an abolitionist. 

1475
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,840
It was Quakers who founded
Whittier, my hometown. 

1476
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:45,080
Uh, to abolish slavery. 

1477
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,800
They were, you know,
conservative bible folk... 

1478
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,800
... but they had a powerful
sense of right and wrong. 

1479
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,480
Forty years ago...
I was like you. 

1480
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,960
Looking for answers. 

1481
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,920
See?

1482
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,800
Tricky Dick himself. 

1483
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,840
My mother used to feed hobos
stopping over at our house. 

1484
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,120
Sure, we got him.
Don't push, pig. 

1485
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:13,960
Move away.
It's okay, Bob, they are just
wrapping my fence, now I... 

1486
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,040
In fact, we agree on a lot
of things, don't we?

1487
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,120
No, we don't. 

1488
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,400
You say you want to end
the war, so why don't you?

1489
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,720
Change always
comes slowly. 

1490
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,560
I pulled out more
than half the troops. 

1491
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:32,400
I'm trying to cut the military budget
for the first time in 30 years. 

1492
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:36,880
I want a volunteer army.
But it's also a question of American credibility. 

1493
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,760
Our... Our position in the world.
Come on, Mr. Nixon. 

1494
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,880
It's a civil war between Vietnamese. 

1495
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,040
You don't want the war.
We don't want the war. 

1496
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,760
The Vietnamese don't want the war. 

1497
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,640
So why does it go on?

1498
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,200
You should be going, Mr. President.
Okay. 

1499
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,120
Please. 

1500
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,240
You can't stop it, can you?

1501
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,760
Even if you wanted to. 

1502
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,440
'Cause it's not you, it's the system. 

1503
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:13,400
The system won't let you stop it. 

1504
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,320
That's right. 

1505
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,400
There's... There's more
at stake here... 

1506
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:23,320
... than what you want or what I want.
Then what's the point?

1507
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:27,160
What's the point of being president?
You're powerless!

1508
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:30,600
No!
No, I'm not powerless. 

1509
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,240
Because I understand
the system, I believe I can, uh... 

1510
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,560
... I can control it,
maybe not control it totally... 

1511
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,240
... but tame it enough
to make it do some good. 

1512
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,120
Sounds like you're talking
about a wild animal. 

1513
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,400
Yenah, maybe I am. 

1514
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,600
We really must go,
Mr. President. Please. 

1515
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,880
Hey, what about the war, man?
When you gonna get us out?

1516
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,840
The old man's moving. 

1517
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,200
Move it. Getaway.
She got it, Bob. 

1518
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,000
Nineteen-year-old college kid.
What? Who?

1519
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:05,440
She understood something that's taken me
25 years in politics to understand. 

1520
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,240
The C. I. A. , the Mafia,
those Wall Street bastards. 

1521
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,440
Sir?
The beast. 

1522
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,840
Nineteen year old kid.
She called it a wild animal.
Yes, sir. 

1523
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,640
Before his judgment seat... 

1524
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:26,480
Oh, be swifr, my soul
to answer him be jubilant, my feet... 

1525
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:31,200
Our God is marching on... 

1526
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,400
Glory, glory, hallelujah... 

1527
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:37,440
Glory... 

1528
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,000
In Washington,
the size of the crowds... 

1529
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,000
... have swelled to over a quarter
of a million demonstrators... 

1530
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,560
... protesting the ongoing war
in Vietnam. 

1531
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,000
What's wrong?

1532
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,400
We're just not going
to buckle to these people. 

1533
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,080
No more war!

1534
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,880
It's beautiful. 

1535
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:15,840
Yes, thank you. 

1536
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:29,280
Princess, may I?

1537
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,680
Thank you. 

1538
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,920
I'm very proud of you
today, Princess. Very. 

1539
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,840
Thank you, Daddy. 

1540
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,920
Yeah?

1541
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,320
Some very secretes says on Vietnam
have been leaked to the New York Times. 

1542
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,240
I know, I know. Not now, Chuck. 

1543
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:20,080
The New York Times.
Get Ron over here. 

1544
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,120
It's the happiest day of my life. 

1545
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,080
The New York Times
began publishing today... 

1546
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,200
... the first in a series
of 47 volumes... 

1547
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,880
... of top-secret Pentagon tapes... 

1548
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,800
... relating to the war
in Vietnam. 

1549
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,840
The papers, leaked
by defence analyst Daniel Ellsberg... 

1550
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,560
... reveal a pattern of government lies
and American involvement in the war. 

1551
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,600
Mr. President,
we are in a revolutionary situation. 

1552
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,200
We are under siege.
The Black Panthers, the Weathermen. 

1553
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:59,240
The State Department under Rogers
is leaking like a sieve. 

1554
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:03,120
And now this little,
insignificant little shit Ellsberg... 

1555
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,440
... publishing all the diplomatic
secrets of this country... 

1556
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,360
... is destroying our ability
to conduct foreign policy. 

1557
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,120
I wonder if many people here wouldn't
think that ten years in prison... 

1558
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,640
... was very cheap if they could
contribute to ending this war. 

1559
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:18,920
The man has become a drug fiend. He shot
people from helicopters in Vietnam. 

1560
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,480
He's had sexual relations with his wife
in front of their children. 

1561
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,080
He sees a shrink in L. A.
The man's all fucked up. 

1562
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,120
And now he's trying
to look good for the Liberals. 

1563
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,880
And if he gets away with it,
Every body will follow his lead. 

1564
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,800
This man must be stopped
at all costs. 

1565
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:37,640
I'm as frustrated as you are Henry, but don't
you think this is a Democrat problem?

1566
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,480
They started the war.
It makes them look bad. 

1567
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,120
But, Mr. President,
the Russians, the Vietnamese... 

1568
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,280
... it makes you look like a weakling!
Goddamn it. 

1569
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:49,200
How long have we had this jackass dog?
Two years?

1570
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,360
He still doesn't come. We need a dog
that looks happy when the press is here. 

1571
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,760
He's photogenic. Try new biscuits.
Aw, fuck it. 

1572
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,240
He doesn't like me, John.
It's your fault, Henry. 

1573
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:00,880
I beg your pardon?
It's your people talking to the press. 

1574
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,400
Uh, this Ellsberg,
wasn't he a student of yours at Harvard?

1575
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,600
I mean, he's your idea, Henry.
So why are you running for cover?

1576
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,680
Well, yes,
we taught a class to get her at Harvard... 

1577
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,800
... but you know these back-stabbing
Ivy League intellectuals. 

1578
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,640
No, I don't, Henry. I don't.
Prosecute the New York Times. Go for injunction. 

1579
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,760
Yeah, but it's not, bottom line,
gonna change a goddamn thing, John. 

1580
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,120
The question is how do we
screw Ellsberg so bad... 

1581
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,680
... it puts the fear of God
into all leakers?

1582
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,240
The other issue is how the hell we stop
these leaks once and for all?

1583
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:34,160
Now, someone is talking to the press.
We gotta stop these leaks at any cost, Henry. 

1584
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:37,480
You hear me? Then we can go
for the big pic... China, Russia. 

1585
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,160
Sir, if I might?
Go, Chuck. 

1586
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,320
We can do this ourselves. 

1587
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,720
The C. I. A. and the F. B. I.
aren't doing the job. 

1588
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:49,360
Now, we can create our own intelligence
unit right here inside the White House. 

1589
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,040
Well, why not?

1590
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:57,440
Our own intelligence to plug the leaks?
Yeah. 

1591
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,600
Like plumbers.
Plumbers. 

1592
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:06,120
I like it.
I like the idea. 

1593
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,400
Yeah, but, uh,
is it legal?

1594
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,800
Has it ever
been done before?

1595
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,800
Oh, sure. 

1596
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,880
Lyndon, J. F. K. , F. D. R. 

1597
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:21,400
Truman cut the shit out of my
investigation of the Hiss case in '48. 

1598
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,360
What he did was illegal. 

1599
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,320
You know, with this kind of thing,
you got to be brutal. 

1600
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,720
A leak happens, the whole damn place
should be fired. 

1601
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:32,160
Really, I mean, you do it like
the Germans in World War II. 

1602
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,280
They went through these towns,
and a sniper hit one of'em... 

1603
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,240
... they'd line the whole
goddamn town up and say... 

1604
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,280
"Until you talk,
you're all getting shot. "

1605
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,840
Really, I think that's
what has to be done. 

1606
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,160
I don't think you can
be Mr. Nice Guy anymore. 

1607
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:46,600
You just whisper the word
to me, and I'll shoot Ellsberg myself. 

1608
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,320
We're not Germans.
Yeah. 

1609
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,640
Ellsberg's not the issue. 

1610
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,560
The Pentagon papers aren't the issue. 

1611
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,480
It's the lie. 

1612
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,440
Mr. Hiss is lying. 

1613
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,720
Yeah. 

1614
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,640
Remember, John,
back in '48?

1615
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,440
Nobody believed Alger Hiss
was a Communist except me. 

1616
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:09,560
Well, they loved Hiss like they loved
this Ellsberg character. 

1617
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,240
He was their kind-
Ivy League establishment. 

1618
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:14,840
I am not,
and never have been... 

1619
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,800
Mr. Hiss is lying.
Mr. Hiss?

1620
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,400
I was dirt to them, nothing.
And Dick kicked the shit out of'em. 

1621
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,160
I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied
about knowing Chambers. 

1622
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:28,440
The documents were old and out of date,
just like these Pentagon papers. 

1623
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,680
The key thing we proved
was that Hiss was a liar. 

1624
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:34,440
Then people bought
that he was a spy. 

1625
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,360
It's the lie that gets you. 

1626
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,880
All right, Henry,
we're gonna go your way. 

1627
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,600
Crush this Ellsberg
same way we did Hiss. 

1628
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,400
There is no other choice,
Mr. President. 

1629
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,560
We're gonna hit him so hard, he'll look
like everything that's sick and evil... 

1630
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,480
... about the eastern establishment. 

1631
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:52,240
You and your plumbers, you're gonna
get all the dirt on this guy. 

1632
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,040
Let's see him going to the bathroom
in front of the American public. 

1633
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,240
And when we finish with him,
they'll crucify him. 

1634
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,600
Then we'll get our second term. 

1635
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,080
The claws are out,
Frank. 

1636
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,680
You seen the guys?
They're around. 

1637
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,560
Why? You gota customer?

1638
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:27,120
The White House. 

1639
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,640
You're fuckin' me.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank. 

1640
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,080
We're gonna plug leaks. 

1641
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,480
Who are we workin' for?
A guy named Gordon Liddy. 

1642
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,320
He thinks he's Martin Bormann. 

1643
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:40,080
He wants to meet you. 

1644
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:43,080
Gordon Liddy,
Frank Sturgis. 

1645
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,000
Hey, Frank. 

1646
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:53,520
Did you see the look on
Hoover's face? He's redder than a beet. 

1647
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,480
That little closet fairy's
got no choice. 

1648
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,720
He hates McGovern and Kennedy
so much, he's gotta love me. 

1649
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,240
And Lyndon?
He looked old, didn't he?

1650
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,640
Have you talked to Lyndon?

1651
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:07,880
Yeah, I asked him, "Lyndon, what would
you do on a scale of one to ten?"

1652
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,640
He said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy.
Bomb them where they live. "
Yeah. 

1653
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:16,280
Bob, tell Trini I'll be
in Key Biscayne at 4:00. 

1654
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,560
With Pat?
No, alone. 

1655
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,000
Uh, Pat's staying here
with Mrs. Eisenhower. 

1656
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:23,840
Yes, sir.
Good. 

1657
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,600
Hi, Buddy.
What are you doing here?

1658
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,560
I missed you. 

1659
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:34,200
Why don't we go down
to Key Biscayne together?

1660
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,080
Because I have to relax. 

1661
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:45,640
You know, I was, uh,
just thinking tonight. 

1662
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:49,840
Remember when you used to
drive me on dates with other boys?

1663
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,760
Yeah. 

1664
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,440
You didn't want to let me
out of your sight. 

1665
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:57,200
Yeah. Sure. 

1666
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,640
It was a long time ago. 

1667
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,960
Yes, it's been a long time. 

1668
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,880
Now, look, Buddy. 

1669
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,400
I don't need that. 

1670
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,680
I'm not Jack Kennedy. 

1671
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,640
No, you're not. 

1672
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,840
So stop comparing yourself to him. 

1673
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,760
You have no reason to. 

1674
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:40,040
You have everything you ever wanted. 

1675
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,280
You earned it. 

1676
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,680
Why can't you just enjoy it?

1677
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,120
I do.
I do in my own way. 

1678
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:51,520
Then what are you
scared of, honey?

1679
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,760
I'm not scared, Buddy. 

1680
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,440
You don't understand. 

1681
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,440
They're playing for keeps,
Buddy. 

1682
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:07,880
You know, the press, the kids,
the Liberals out there. 

1683
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,440
They're out there trying to
figure out how to tear me down. 

1684
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,720
They're all your enemies?
Yes. 

1685
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,720
You, personally?

1686
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,640
Yes!

1687
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:22,160
Listen, this is about me. 

1688
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:25,000
Why can't you understand that?

1689
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,880
I mean, you of all people. 

1690
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,920
It's not the war. 

1691
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,840
It's Nixon!

1692
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,240
It's not Vietnam, it's Nixon.
They want to destroy Nixon. 

1693
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,600
If I expose myself just the slightest bit,
they'll tear my insides out. 

1694
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,560
You want that?
You know?

1695
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:45,440
You want to see that, Buddy?
It's not pretty!

1696
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:49,280
Sometimes I think
that's what you want, Dick. 

1697
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:52,080
What the hell are you saying?

1698
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,600
Are you drunk?

1699
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,160
Jesus, you sound just like them now. 

1700
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,800
I gotta keep fighting,
Buddy, for the country. 

1701
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,040
These people running things,
the elite!

1702
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:09,760
They're just soft,
chicken-shit faggots. 

1703
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:12,800
They don't have
the long-term vision anymore. 

1704
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,680
They just want to cover their ass
and meet girls and tear each other down. 

1705
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:20,320
Oh, God, this country's in deep,
deep, deep trouble, Buddy. 

1706
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:22,800
I have to see this
through, you know. 

1707
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:26,040
Mother would have expected
no less of me. 

1708
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,120
I'm sorry, Buddy. 

1709
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,720
I just wish you knew
how much I love you, that's all. 

1710
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:40,800
It took me a long time to fall
in love with you, Dick, but I did. 

1711
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:44,280
And it doesn't make you happy. 

1712
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:47,120
You want them to love you.
No, I don't. I'm not Jack Kennedy. 

1713
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:49,600
They never will, Dick. 

1714
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:53,760
No matter how many elections
you win, they never will. 

1715
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:10,240
History
will never be the same. 

1716
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,680
We're taking a step into the future. 

1717
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,480
Liddy, give them the folder.
We have changed the world. 

1718
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:19,120
Five, ten.
Let's see what else you got. 

1719
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,200
I must say, you look very good,
Mr. Chairman. 

1720
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:52,200
Looks can be deceiving. 

1721
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:55,560
Uh, we know what risks
you've taken in inviting us here. 

1722
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:57,480
I took no risk. 

1723
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:01,560
I am too old to be afraid
of what anyone thinks. 

1724
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:10,200
Don't ever trust them. 

1725
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:12,160
They never tell the truth... 

1726
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,080
... or honor their commitments. 

1727
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:17,640
Vietnamese are like Russians. 

1728
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:19,560
Both are dogs. 

1729
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:23,320
Mr. Chairman, there's an old saying
in my country:

1730
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,320
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend. 

1731
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,280
That has the added virtue of being true. 

1732
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,120
Your writings
have changed the world, Mr. Chairman. 

1733
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:39,280
Bullshit. 

1734
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,640
My writings mean absolutely nothing. 

1735
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,600
I want to know your secret. 

1736
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:49,200
My secret, Mr. Chairman?

1737
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:59,000
How a fat man gets so many girls. 

1738
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:04,680
Power, Mr. Chairman... 

1739
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:07,960
... is the ultimate aphrodisiac. 

1740
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:16,040
You know,
I voted for you in your last election. 

1741
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,840
I was the lesser of two evils. 

1742
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:24,200
You are too modest, Mr. Nixon. 

1743
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,600
You are as evil as I am. 

1744
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,440
We are the new emperors. 

1745
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:33,920
We are both from poor families... 

1746
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,280
... and others pay to feed
the hunger in us. 

1747
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,960
In my case,
millions of reactionaries. 

1748
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,120
In your case,
millions of Vietnamese. 

1749
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:47,480
Uh, civil war is always
the cruelest kind of war... 

1750
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:50,840
... but our two nations
were forged by revolution. 

1751
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,760
The United States, China. 

1752
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,200
Peace? Is peace
all you're interested in?

1753
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,600
The real war is in us. 

1754
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,640
History is a symptom of our disease. 

1755
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,400
In a surprise Christmas bombing of Hanoi... 

1756
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:19,760
... president Nixon delivered more tonnage than
was used at Dresden in World War II. 

1757
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:24,000
It is without doubt the most brutal
bombing in American history. 

1758
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:27,000
Newspapers are calling it
a Stone Age tactic... 

1759
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,360
... and Nixon a maddened tyrant. 

1760
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,600
Nixon's response:

1761
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:35,600
"When the Vietnamese take the Paris
peace talks seriously, I'll stop. "

1762
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,880
A penny for your thoughts. 

1763
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,640
Just think of the... 

1764
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:59,040
Think of the life
Mao's led. 

1765
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,080
In '52 I...
I called him a monster. 

1766
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,280
Now he could be
our most important ally. 

1767
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,240
Only Nixon could've done that. 

1768
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,680
You're a long way
from Whittier. 

1769
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,560
Yep. 

1770
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,480
Yes, I am. 

1771
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,360
Congratulations, Dick. 

1772
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,280
Mr. Ziegler. 

1773
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,040
Mr. President, the press guys
asked if you could come back. 

1774
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:29,520
The hell with them.
I'll go back, Mr. President. 

1775
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:34,880
No, uh, they want you, Mr. President.
I, uh... I think it would be a good move. 

1776
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,800
Oh?

1777
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,720
Who's back there?
Everybody. 

1778
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,600
Okay. 

1779
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:46,120
Gentlemen,
I go now to discover... 

1780
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:49,000
... the exact length, width
and depth of the shaft. 

1781
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president. 

1782
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,200
Oh, it's the president.
Hi. 

1783
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,120
Hi.
Hi. 

1784
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:04,640
Mr. President...
Congratulations, sir. 

1785
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:07,480
Well done!

1786
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,880
Thank you, sir!

1787
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,600
Bravo, sir!
Thank you. 

1788
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,640
Congratulations!

1789
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,240
Well... 

1790
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:33,120
... it looks to me like we're gonna lose
a war for the first goddamn time. 

1791
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,040
Yep. 

1792
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:37,920
And you're goin'
right along with it, Dick... 

1793
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,320
... buyin' into
this Kissinger bullshit... 

1794
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:44,000
... this detente with Communists. 

1795
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:47,480
Detente.
Sounds like a couple of fags dancin'

1796
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:55,840
Jack, we're not living in the same
country you and I knew in '46. 

1797
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,720
Our people are just not gonna sacrifice
in major numbers for war. 

1798
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,120
Can't even get'em to accept
cuts in their gas tax. 

1799
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:05,280
Now, the Arabs and the Japanese
are draining the gold reserves... 

1800
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:09,240
If we'd won in Vietnam,
we wouldn't be having this conversation. 

1801
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:13,880
It's nobody's fault, Jack.
It's change. It's a fact of history. 

1802
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,320
Even that old cocksucker
J. Edgar Hoover's dead. 

1803
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:19,720
Now who'd have thought that possible?

1804
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,640
How's the food over there
in China, Mr. Nixon?

1805
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:25,080
Oh, it's delicious,
if you're president. 

1806
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,000
So, uh... 

1807
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,240
... what are you gonna do
about that Allende fella... 

1808
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,160
... nationalizing our businesses
in Chile?

1809
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,080
You gonna send Kissinger
down there?

1810
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:39,400
We're gonna get rid of him,
Allende
just as fast as we can. 

1811
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,240
He's at the top of the list.
How about Kissinger along with him?

1812
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,280
Now, Kissinger's
misunderstood. 

1813
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,600
He acts like a Liberal for
his establishment friends... 

1814
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:51,960
... but he's even tougher than I am.
So Kissinger stays. 

1815
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:54,720
Just like Castro,
Mr. Nixon. 

1816
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:58,880
Yeah. He stays. 

1817
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,040
And you are comfortable
with that decision, huh?

1818
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,440
Desi's got a point. 

1819
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:12,000
What the hell are we gonna do about the
Communists right here in our own backyard?

1820
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,400
What do you really mean,
Jack?

1821
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,920
I mean I got federal price
controls on my oil. 

1822
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,760
And the rag heads are beatin'
the shit out of me, Dick. 

1823
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,680
And your E. P. A.
environmental agency... 

1824
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,480
... has got its thumb so far up my ass
it's scratchin' my ear!

1825
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,440
Sir, I think it's time for us to be...
Let him finish, Bob. 

1826
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:33,760
I gota federal judge orderin' me to bus
my grandkids halfway across this town... 

1827
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,400
... to go to school
with some nigger kids. 

1828
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:40,200
Now, Dick...
Mr. President... 

1829
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:43,800
... aren't you forgetting
who put you where you are?

1830
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:48,720
The American people
put me where I am, Jack. 

1831
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,680
Really?

1832
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,880
Well, that can be changed. 

1833
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,840
In a heartbeat. 

1834
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:06,720
Jack, I've learned politics
is the art of compromise. 

1835
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,040
I learned it the hard way.
I don't know if you have. 

1836
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:12,760
Well, let me tell you this, Jack. 

1837
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,880
If you don't like it,
there's an election in November... 

1838
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:19,040
... and you can take your money out
in the open and give it to Wallace. 

1839
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:22,400
How about it, Jack?
Willing to do that?

1840
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:27,840
Hand this country over to some pansy
Poet socialist like George McGovern?

1841
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:32,960
'Cause if you're not happy
with the E. P. A. up your ass... 

1842
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,520
... try the I. R. S. 

1843
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,560
Goddamn, Dick. 

1844
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:40,760
You're not threatening me, are ya?

1845
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,160
Presidents don't threaten, Jack. 

1846
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,200
They don't have to. 

1847
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:51,000
Good day to you, gentlemen.
Thank you. 

1848
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:17,920
With third party candidate
George Wallace out of the race... 

1849
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,080
... paralyzed by
an assassin's bullet... 

1850
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:22,160
Richard Nixon
has crushed George McGovern... 

1851
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:25,120
... in the 1972
presidential election. 

1852
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:28,720
It is the second-biggest
landslide in American history. 

1853
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,840
Four more years!

1854
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:31,480
As the new term begins... 

1855
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:34,840
... it does not seem the Watergate
investigations have damaged Nixon... 

1856
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,680
... politicaly in any significant way. 

1857
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:41,560
Probably our biggest achievement
as an administration... 

1858
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:43,480
... when it's all said and done... 

1859
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,880
... isn't China or Russia. 

1860
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,480
It's pulling out of Vietnam
Without a right-wing revolt. 

1861
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,400
I believe you're right. 

1862
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:54,280
Even the presidency
isn't enough anymore. 

1863
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,200
Sir?

1864
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:01,800
The presidency by itself
won't protect us, Bob. 

1865
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,720
We're beyond politics now. 

1866
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,720
Mr. Ehrlichman. 

1867
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:12,560
Yeah. 

1868
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:15,760
Sir, just in from Paris. The Vietnamese
have accepted Henry's peace proposal. 

1869
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,000
Good. 

1870
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:20,760
The bombing worked. They're caving.
Congratulations!

1871
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:24,200
That mad bomber theory
wasn't so crazy after all. 

1872
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:28,840
Henry is coming back to join us. He
wants to be included in the photographs,
of course. 

1873
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,760
There's a surprise. 

1874
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:34,120
This could be it. This could be it.
Four long years. Jeez. 

1875
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:38,760
Incidentally, I don't know if this is
the right time, but you should know. 

1876
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,800
Bill Sullivan at the F. B. I. got
back to us with his report on Kissinger. 

1877
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:47,760
I didn't wanna bring it up because of...
Go on. 

1878
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:51,200
Well, Sullivan, uh,
thinks he's the one. 

1879
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,960
Henry's the leaker. 

1880
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,440
Yeah, I knew it. I knew it
from '69 on and I said it all along. 

1881
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,840
Yeah, I remember.
I didn't, Bob. 

1882
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,240
Come on. 

1883
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:12,800
Looks like he talked to, uh,
Joe Kraft and the Times. 

1884
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:15,600
Claims that he was dead set
against the bombing... 

1885
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:20,080
... that you were unstable and that
he has to handle you with kid gloves. 

1886
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:22,480
That explains his press notices. 

1887
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,640
Working both sides of the fence.
Jew-boy Henry. 

1888
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:27,560
My God. 

1889
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,440
He talked to the New York Times?
Yes, he did. 

1890
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,280
We ought a fire his whining
ass right now, when he's on top. 

1891
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:37,160
You know what, sir? I would set the right example
for the rest of this administration. 

1892
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:40,520
I would personally
volunteer for that assignment right now. 

1893
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,920
No. No. 

1894
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,400
He's our only star right now.
He'd go crying to the press. 

1895
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:55,800
He'd crucify us. 

1896
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:58,200
Son of a bitch. 

1897
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:00,720
Get someone on our staff
on his ass. 

1898
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,360
Tap his phones.
I wanna know everyone he talks to. 

1899
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,160
Let's see how long
the Kissinger mystique lasts. 

1900
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:09,040
So, John, what about
these Watergate clowns?

1901
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,400
This, uh,
Sirica's crazy. 

1902
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:14,280
Thirty-five year sentence.
No weapons, right?

1903
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:18,560
No injuries. Uh, there's no success.
It's just ridiculous. 

1904
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:22,120
Sirica's just trying to force someone
to testify, but they're solid. 

1905
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:24,040
What about this
Washington Post crap?

1906
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:26,280
Uh, Woodwind
and Fernstein. 

1907
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:28,480
Bernstein, sir.
Who the fuck are they, anyway?

1908
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:31,400
Bob, you working on revoking
their television license?

1909
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,320
Yes, sir, I am.
Good. 

1910
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:36,640
Well, uh, they're trying to connect
Bob and John with the secret fund. 

1911
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,640
But they don't have much.
They don't have anything. 

1912
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:43,520
The F. B. I. 's feeding me
their reports. 

1913
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:46,880
I-I didn't think you should lose
any more sleep over it, sir. 

1914
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,800
Good man, John,
good man. 

1915
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:04,920
I can therefore announce that our long
and tragic involvement in Vietnam... 

1916
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,840
... is at an end. 

1917
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:09,720
Our mission is accomplished. 

1918
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:13,000
Uh, we have a cease-fire... 

1919
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:17,720
... and our prisoners of war
are coming back home. 

1920
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:22,880
South Vietnam has the right
to determine its own future. 

1921
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:25,920
So, we have peace with honor. 

1922
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:33,800
The president will take
some of your questions now. 

1923
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:35,800
Mr. President!
Dan. 

1924
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:38,200
Isn't it true little has been
achieved in this agreement... 

1925
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,560
... that the Communists have not
been offering since 1969... 

1926
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:43,360
... that in fact your administration has
needlessly prolonged the war... 

1927
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,640
... and escalated it to
new levels of violence?

1928
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:48,520
I will, uh, try to, uh... 

1929
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:51,360
... answer that question
in some detail. 

1930
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,440
Mr. President!

1931
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:55,160
What is your reaction
To James McCord's statement... 

1932
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,880
... that high-level White House officials
were involved in the Watergate break-in?

1933
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,840
Well, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. 

1934
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:05,880
The Washington Post is reporting
that Mr. Haldeman and Ehrlichman... 

1935
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:08,880
... secretly dispersed up to
$900,000 in campaign funds. 

1936
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,600
Is there any truth to that?
Now, let me make this perfectly clear. 

1937
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:15,920
I will not respond to the charges
of the Washington Post. 

1938
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,960
Nor will I comment on a matter
that is currently before the courts. 

1939
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:25,080
Sir, do you intend to cooperate with
Senator Ervin's committee?

1940
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:28,000
Will you agree to the appointment
of a special prosecutor?

1941
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:30,080
Mr. President!
Mr. President!

1942
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:32,960
Mr. President!

1943
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,000
Thank you!

1944
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:43,000
Mr. President,
shouldn't you... 

1945
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,920
Ron, get in there
and do something!

1946
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,400
I end the longest war
in American history... 

1947
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:55,040
... and they keep harping
on this chicken-shit!

1948
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:57,920
God!

1949
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:03,320
You know who's behind this, don't you?
Teddy Kennedy. 

1950
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:07,160
Yeah, he drowns a broad in his car,
and he can't run for president... 

1951
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:10,040
He did get pretty burned
at Chappaquiddick. 

1952
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,880
My point exactly! Somebody had to die
before he got his shit in the papers!

1953
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:17,120
Fucking Kennedy's getaway
with everything! Goddamn them!

1954
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:20,000
You see me
screwin' everything that moves?

1955
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:23,360
For Christ's sake, I did what
the New York Times editorial page... 

1956
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,600
... said for me to do!

1957
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:27,520
I ended the war!

1958
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:31,240
I got S. A. L. T. One with the Russians;
I opened China. 

1959
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:34,120
So why are these assholes
turning on me?

1960
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:37,040
'Cause they don't like the way I look,
where I went to school!

1961
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:40,560
Because they're not Americans.
Yeah, right. They don't trust America. 

1962
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:44,440
Why would they? Hmm? They just come here
to stick their snouts in the trough. 

1963
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:47,040
Who are these people?
Sulzberger. 

1964
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:50,360
Their parents are gold traders from
eastern Europe, with due respect, Henry. 

1965
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:53,200
They buy things. They come
to "Jew" York city and buy up things. 

1966
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:58,040
And one of the things they buy,
Mr. President, is the New York Times. 

1967
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:01,640
You know what? You should be proud,
because they'll never trust you, sir. 

1968
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:04,040
Because we speak
for the average American. 

1969
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:06,440
You know why
they're turning on me?

1970
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:10,120
It's because they're not
serious about power, that's why. 

1971
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:14,480
They're playing with power.
They're forgetting the national interest. 

1972
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:18,800
In the old days people knew
how to hold power, how to set limits. 

1973
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:22,200
They wouldn't have torn this country
apart over a third-rate burglary. 

1974
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:25,560
For Christ's sake, now all
they care about are their egos... 

1975
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:27,480
... looking good
at cocktail parties. 

1976
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:29,920
Beating out other papers
and chasing girls. 

1977
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,760
Wondering whether someone
said something nice about them. 

1978
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:34,680
All short-term,
frivolous bullshit. 

1979
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:38,160
Ben Bradlee worrying about
Teddy Kennedy liking him. 

1980
02:04:38,240 --> 02:04:40,080
Get Mr. Dean in here,
Will you?

1981
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:42,920
Mr. President, I fear we are
drifting toward oblivion here. 

1982
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,360
We are playing
a totally reactive game. 

1983
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,800
We have to get ahead
of the ball. 

1984
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,120
Now, we all know
that you are clean. Right?

1985
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:55,480
Then let's take off
the gloves. 

1986
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:58,520
Let's do a housecleaning.
Housecleaning?

1987
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:09,080
No, it could be ugly,
Henry, really ugly. 

1988
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:11,960
It must be done, sir.
Your government is paralyzed. 

1989
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:14,360
All kinds of shit could come out.
The Ellsberg thing. 

1990
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:17,240
You knew about that, didn't you, Henry?
Well, I heard something. 

1991
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:20,080
It sounded idiotic.
"Idiotic. " Yeah, I suppose it was. 

1992
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:23,000
I thought it was your idea
to expose Ellsberg as a sex fiend. 

1993
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,720
I guess somebody just
took you too literally. 

1994
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:29,880
I never suggested a bunch of imbeciles
break into a psychiatrist's office. 

1995
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:34,000
It doesn't matter. The point is you
might lose your media darling halo... 

1996
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:36,840
... if the media start sniffing
around our dirty laundry. 

1997
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,600
Sir, I never had anything to do with
That and I resent the implication... 

1998
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:43,720
Resent it all you want, Henry,
but you're in with the rest of us. 

1999
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,000
Cambodia.
Ellsberg. 

2000
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:47,920
The wiretaps you put in. 

2001
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,600
The president wants you to know you
can't just click your heels... 

2002
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:53,200
... and head back
to Harvard Yard. 

2003
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:57,720
It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in
the wind twisting with everyone else's. 

2004
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:08,560
Sir. 

2005
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,600
Yeah?

2006
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:15,600
There are times when even
the president can go too far. 

2007
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,920
You played it perfectly, sir. 

2008
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,280
That cocksucker'll think twice
before he leaks again. 

2009
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,000
Yeah. 

2010
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:29,480
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl
every time he pulls the chain. 

2011
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:31,040
Pardon them all. 

2012
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:34,680
Hunt and the Cubans have nothing
to lose now. 

2013
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:38,080
Nobody's going to investigate crime, for
which the criminals have already been pardoned. 

2014
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:41,440
Yeah, I like that, it is a good solution.
Yeah, but it'll never do. 

2015
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,200
Pardoning them means we're all guilty.
The press, the people'll go nuts. 

2016
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:47,040
Am I supposed to just sit here
and watch them coming closer... 

2017
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,960
... eating their way
to the centre?

2018
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,280
Lyndon bugged;
so did Kennedy. 

2019
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,280
F. D. R. cut a deal
with lucky Luciano. 

2020
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:55,880
Christ, even Eisenhower
had a mistress. 

2021
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:59,240
What's so special about me?
Huh?

2022
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:05,920
I know. I just know we've made
too many enemies. 

2023
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:10,280
There are things I can say
what other people said, and they'd be lies. 

2024
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,920
When I say them,
nobody believes me anyway. 

2025
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:19,280
Then, we're going to have to
give them Mitchell. 

2026
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:22,040
Mitchell's family. 

2027
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:26,600
Either it goes to Mitchell,
or it comes here. 

2028
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:30,160
John's right, boss. 

2029
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:32,320
It's not personal. 

2030
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,320
It's just the way
the game is played. 

2031
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:36,640
Sometimes
you gotta punt. 

2032
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,520
He's wrong, you know. 

2033
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:48,880
About Kennedy and L. B. J. and Truman.
How so?

2034
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:52,240
Well, I mean, sure, they did stuff,
Bob, but nothing like this. 

2035
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,400
I mean, forget about the break-in,
the, the enemies list... 

2036
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:57,320
... the, uh... You know?

2037
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:00,720
You got the attempted firebombing of
the Brookings Institution. 

2038
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,920
Planting McGovern stuff on
the guy that shot Wallace?

2039
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,160
Trying to slip L. S. D.
to Jack Anderson?

2040
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,360
The old man plays politics harder
than anybody else, John. 

2041
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:10,920
You think
this is about politics?

2042
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,160
Do you think L. B. J. would have ever
asked Hunt to forge a cable... 

2043
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:18,440
... implicating Kennedy in the assassination
of the president of Vietnam?

2044
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:21,280
How long have you known Bob, 20 years?
This is the Roosevelt Room... 

2045
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,200
... named after
our 26th president... 

2046
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,480
This is about Richard Nixon. 

2047
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:28,120
You got people dying because
he didn't make varsity football. 

2048
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:30,920
You got the Constitution
hanging by a thread... 

2049
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,480
... because he went to Whittier,
not to Yale. 

2050
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:36,560
And what is this Bay of Pigs thing?

2051
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:39,080
Goes white every time
you mention it. 

2052
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:45,320
It's a code or something.
Well, shit, even I figured that out. 

2053
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,400
I think he means... 

2054
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,560
... the Kennedy assassination. 

2055
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,840
Yeah?
They went after Castro... 

2056
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:55,240
... and in some crazy way
it got turned back on Kennedy. 

2057
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:58,320
I don't think the old man
knows what happened. 

2058
02:08:58,360 --> 02:08:59,560
But he's afraid to find out. 

2059
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,640
Created a Frankenstein
with those damn Cubans. 

2060
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:08,320
Eight words back in '72:

2061
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,280
"I covered up. "

2062
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,240
"I was wrong. "

2063
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,920
"I'm sorry. "

2064
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:17,160
And the American public
would've forgiven him. 

2065
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:20,280
But we never opened
our mouths, John. 

2066
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,200
We failed him. 

2067
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:24,240
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"?

2068
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,200
That'll be the day. 

2069
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:28,960
His whole suit of armour
would fall off. 

2070
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,880
So, you tell Mitchell. 

2071
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,840
Yeah. 

2072
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:36,720
And John, you do know
that we're next, don't you?

2073
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:53,280
You're early, John. 

2074
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,440
If you'd been that stealthy at the
Watergate, we wouldn't be in this mess. 

2075
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,280
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Yes. 

2076
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:07,320
Take out the money. 

2077
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:10,280
The president would like to know if
that was the last payment. 

2078
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:12,240
I'll bet he would. 

2079
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:14,480
Is it?

2080
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,880
In Richard Nixon's long history
of underhanded dealings... 

2081
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:19,680
... he's never had better value
for his money. 

2082
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:23,520
If I were to open my mouth,
all the dominoes would fall. 

2083
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:26,680
Can I ask you a question?

2084
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:31,280
How the hell you have the temerity to blackmail
the president of the United States?

2085
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:34,160
That's not the question,
John. 

2086
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:36,440
The question is,
why is he paying?

2087
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:38,240
To protect his people. 

2088
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:41,120
I'm one of his people.
The Cubans are his people. 

2089
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:43,040
And we're going to jail
for him. 

2090
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:47,320
Howard, you will serve no more
than two years, then he'll pardon you. 

2091
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:49,840
Maybe.
Maybe not. 

2092
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:54,160
But you don't leave your men
on the beach, John. 

2093
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:57,040
You don't make them
beg for their money like thieves. 

2094
02:10:57,080 --> 02:11:00,280
You don't dump men with families
who've served their country. 

2095
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:03,160
He didn't know.
This thing has gotten out of hand. 

2096
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:06,640
You think a man as controlled as Richard
Nixon would've allowed a break-in... 

2097
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:10,360
... at the Democratic National Headquarters
without knowing it?

2098
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:15,000
You think Mitchell or Haldeman wouldn't
have run it by him at least once?

2099
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:17,880
The president's men
did nothing... nothing... 

2100
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:20,080
... without Richard Nixon's
permission. 

2101
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:26,320
John, sooner or later... 

2102
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,720
... sooner, I think... 

2103
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,000
You're going to learn the lesson
that's been learned... 

2104
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:34,480
... by everyone who's ever gotten close
to Richard Nixon. 

2105
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:39,760
That he's the darkness reaching out
for the darkness. 

2106
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:43,920
And eventually
it's either you or him. 

2107
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,360
Your grave's
already been dug, John. 

2108
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:05,440
F. B. I.
director-designate L. Patrick Gray... 

2109
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:08,320
... shocked the Senate
by revealing that John Dean... 

2110
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:11,200
... has been secretly receiving
F. B. I. reports on Watergate. 

2111
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:14,080
Crown, this is Echo Six.
How are you, sir?

2112
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:16,960
Gray also said that Dean lied
when he claimed Howard Hunt... 

2113
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:18,960
... did not have an office
in the White House. 

2114
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:21,200
How is he?
He's in a bad mood. 

2115
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:23,200
He's running late.
Have a seat. 

2116
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:29,680
This is the sort of thing
Mafia people can do. 

2117
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:31,600
Washing money
and things like that. 

2118
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:34,480
We just don't know about these things
because we're not criminals. 

2119
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,880
How much you need?

2120
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:40,320
I would say these people
will cost a million dollars... 

2121
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:42,240
... over the next two years. 

2122
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:45,000
We could get that.
Uh-huh. 

2123
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:49,200
Get a million dollars in cash.
I know where it could be gotten. 

2124
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:53,680
I'm still not confident
we can ride through this. 

2125
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:57,440
Some people are gonna have to go to
jail. Hunt's not the only problem. 

2126
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:00,720
Haldeman let me use
the $350,000 cash fund in his safe... 

2127
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:02,640
... to make the payments. 

2128
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:06,280
Ehrlichman had a role-a big role-
in the Ellsberg break-in. 

2129
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:08,280
Oh, I don't know
about that. 

2130
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:10,920
And-And I'm... 

2131
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:16,080
I think it's time we begin to think
in terms of cutting our losses. 

2132
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:23,520
You're saying cut
our losses, John, and, uh, all the rest. 

2133
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:27,360
And, you know, suppose the thing blows
and they indict Bob and the others?

2134
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,720
Jesus, you'd never recover
from that, John. I mean, uh... 

2135
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:34,600
No, it's better to fight it out
instead and not let people testify. 

2136
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:38,800
Sir, I, I still don't think
we can contain this anymore. 

2137
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:43,040
There's a cancer on the presidency,
and it's growing... 

2138
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:45,480
... with every day-
Jesus, you know, every... 

2139
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,000
Everything's a crisis among the
upper intellectual types, the softheads. 

2140
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:52,040
The average people don't think
it's much of a crisis. 

2141
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:56,280
For Christ's sake, this is not Vietnam.
No one's dying here. 

2142
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:58,680
I mean, isn't it ridiculous?
I agree. It's ridiculous, but, uh... 

2143
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:02,520
It's goddamn crazy!
Goldwater was right when he said... 

2144
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:04,920
"For Christ's sakes,
everybody bugs everybody else. "

2145
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,840
We know that. 

2146
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:11,680
It's the cover-up, John, not the deed,
that's really bad here. 

2147
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:16,480
If only Mitchell could step up
and take the brunt of it, you know. 

2148
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,320
Give 'em the hors d'oeuvre. 

2149
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:22,680
Maybe they won't come back
for the main course. 

2150
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:25,560
You know, that's
the tragedy in all this. 

2151
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:30,040
Mitchell's gonna get it anyway,
so it's time he assumed responsibility. 

2152
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:31,960
You're not
paying attention. 

2153
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:35,040
He won't.
He's told Ehrlichman he won't. 

2154
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:38,280
You tell
my good friend Dick... 

2155
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:42,520
I got into this by not paying attention
to what these bastards were doing. 

2156
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:46,520
I don't have a guilty conscience,
and he shouldn't either. 

2157
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:49,320
Yeah. 

2158
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:54,000
Well, he's right. 

2159
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:57,840
Maybe it is time to, uh, go
the hang-out route, John. 

2160
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:00,720
Uh, a full and thorough
investigation. 

2161
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:02,840
Uh, we've cooperated
with the F. B. I. 

2162
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:05,800
We'll cooperate
with the Senate. 

2163
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:08,720
What have we got to hide?
No, we've nothing to hide. 

2164
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,920
No.
Nothing to hide. 

2165
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,960
You know, the only...
the only fault in the plan is... 

2166
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:17,040
... they're not gonna believe the truth;
that's the incredible thing. 

2167
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:18,960
I agree.
It's, uh, it's tricky. 

2168
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:22,640
Everything seems
to lead back here. 

2169
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:25,720
People would never understand.
No. 

2170
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:28,600
John, I want you to getaway
from this madhouse. 

2171
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:30,520
I want...
these reporters. 

2172
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:35,240
I want you to go up to Camp David
for the weekend and write up a report. 

2173
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:37,920
Put everything you know
about Watergate in there and say... 

2174
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:40,320
"Mr. President,
here it all is. " Okay?

2175
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:44,040
You want me to put it all
in writing over my signature?

2176
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:46,960
Well, uh... 

2177
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,840
... nobody knows more about this thing
than you do, John. 

2178
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:53,720
You know, the details. Thatstuff
I don't know. But. 

2179
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:56,720
Uh-huh. 

2180
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:01,280
Sir, I'm not going to be
the scapegoat for this. 

2181
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:04,160
Haldeman and Ehrlichman are
in it just as deep as I am. 

2182
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:07,040
No, now, John,
you don't wanna start down that road. 

2183
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:08,960
I remember, uh... 

2184
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,840
Whittaker Chambers
telling me back in '48... 

2185
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:13,920
He was a man
who suffered greatly. 

2186
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,720
And he said, "On the road
of the informer, it is always night. "

2187
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:21,920
Now, uh... It's beyond you,
or even me, John. 

2188
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,960
It's the country. The presidency.
I understand that, sir. 

2189
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:27,880
You know, I...
You know how I feel about loyalty. 

2190
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:31,720
I-I'm not gonna let any of my people
go to jail, that I promise you. 

2191
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:35,400
The important thing is to keep this
away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. 

2192
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:39,720
I'm trusting you to do this, John, and
I have complete confidence in you. Okay?

2193
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:42,960
I'll work on it.
Say hi to that wife of yours. 

2194
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,880
Yes, sir.
Good. 

2195
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:46,800
Shit. 

2196
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,720
It happens. 

2197
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,400
The place is a shambles.
Hey!

2198
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:58,080
I was determined that we should get
to the bottom of Watergate... 

2199
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:02,960
... and the truth should be fully brought
out, no matter who was involved. 

2200
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:07,560
Today, in one of the most difficult
decisions of my presidency... 

2201
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:11,880
I accepted the resignations of two of my
closest associates in the White House... 

2202
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:14,200
Bob Haldeman
And John Ehrlichman... 

2203
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:18,240
... two of the finest public servants
it has been my privilege to know. 

2204
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:24,880
More light, Chief?

2205
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:26,800
No, Bob. 

2206
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:34,720
Six bodies. 

2207
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:39,040
The counsel to the
president, John Dean, has also resigned. 

2208
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:41,920
I will not place the blame
on subordinates... 

2209
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,800
... on people whose zeal
exceeded their judgment... 

2210
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:49,120
... and who may have done wrong in a cause
they deeply believed to be right. 

2211
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:53,280
In any organization... 

2212
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:56,200
... the man at the top must bear
the responsibility. 

2213
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:59,200
That responsibility, therefore,
belongs here in this office... 

2214
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,160
... and I accept that. 

2215
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:04,560
There can be no whitewash
At the White House. 

2216
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:06,960
Two wrongs
do not make a right. 

2217
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,840
Now, I love America. 

2218
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:13,320
God bless America,
and God bless each and every one of you. 

2219
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:17,880
And we're clear. 

2220
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,360
Out. 

2221
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:42,000
Thank you. 

2222
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:50,120
Are you going
to Key Biscayne?

2223
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:54,400
Yeah.
When?

2224
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:57,800
Tomorrow. 

2225
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:06,840
Ron told me that, um... 

2226
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:10,680
Bob Haldeman has been calling
But you won't talk to him. 

2227
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:15,000
If he's convicted,
will you pardon him?

2228
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:19,600
No. 

2229
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:29,440
Why are you cutting yourself off
from the rest of us?

2230
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:35,640
Can't we discuss this?
What exactly do you want to discuss?

2231
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:37,760
You.
What you're doing. 

2232
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:42,000
What am I doing?
I wish I knew. 

2233
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,920
You're hiding. 

2234
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:47,080
Hiding what?

2235
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:50,280
Whatever it is you've been hiding. 

2236
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:52,200
You're letting it
destroy you, Dick. 

2237
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:57,360
You won't even ask for hel... 

2238
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:03,200
Manolo, uh... 

2239
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:05,120
Mrs. Nixon's finished. 

2240
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:12,160
I am the only one
left, Dick. 

2241
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:15,200
If you don't even
talk to me... 

2242
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:26,640
Brezhnev's coming
in three days. 

2243
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:30,640
I don't wanna deal with them
and him and you. 

2244
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:36,000
Howmuch more...
Howmuch more is it going to cost?

2245
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,800
When do the rest of us
stop paying off your debts?

2246
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:46,800
I'd like to finish
my dinner in peace... 

2247
02:20:46,840 --> 02:20:49,360
... if it's not too much
to ask. 

2248
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:55,800
No, it isn't. 

2249
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:01,280
I won't interfere
with you anymore. 

2250
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:03,880
I'm finished trying. 

2251
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:05,680
Thank you. 

2252
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:09,520
"Thank you"?

2253
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:13,000
Dick, sometimes I understand
why they hate you. 

2254
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:22,640
The committee will come to order. 

2255
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:24,840
Counsel will call
the first witness. 

2256
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:27,400
Mr. John W. Dean, III. 

2257
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:29,360
After I departed
the president's office... 

2258
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:32,960
I went to a meeting with Haldeman
and Ehrlichman to discuss the matter. 

2259
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,840
The sum and substance
of that discussion was... 

2260
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:40,640
... the way to handle this now was
for Mitchell to step forward. 

2261
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:43,600
It was a disappointment
to me because it was quite clear... 

2262
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:46,280
... that the cover-up, as far as
the White House was... 

2263
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:48,280
Was concerned,
was going to continue. 

2264
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:51,160
Why is he doing this?
He's our goddamn lawyer. 

2265
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:54,040
If he had a problem,
why didn't he come talk with us?

2266
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:57,240
Remember, the weasel's got no proof. 

2267
02:21:57,320 --> 02:22:00,680
It's still an informer's word
Against the president's. 

2268
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:03,360
... were all indictable
for obstruction of justice. 

2269
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:07,200
That was the reason I was disagreeing
with all that was being discussed. 

2270
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:09,120
Give 'em hell,
general. 

2271
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:18,440
Mao taught me in 1963

2272
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:23,240
If I have nuclear weapons... 

2273
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:27,440
... let 400 million
Chinese die... 

2274
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:30,720
300 million will be left. 

2275
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:34,800
Mao!
Yeah. 

2276
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:38,640
I can tell you what happened. 

2277
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:40,760
You want names?
I can give you Haldeman. 

2278
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,120
I'm talking about the president. Mao!

2279
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,160
We all know
I can give you the president. 

2280
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:48,840
... this man
in his dog heart. 

2281
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:53,480
You want him to be your ally?

2282
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,440
Uh, well, he was your ally
for 20 years, Leonid. 

2283
02:22:57,480 --> 02:22:59,600
Yes, yes, Dick.
Da, da, da, da. 

2284
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:02,480
Da. 

2285
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:04,960
Mr. Nixon... 

2286
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:10,800
Life is the best teacher,
and therefore it must not interfere... 

2287
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:14,160
... with the building of the S. A. L. T. Two
treaty between our great countries. 

2288
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:21,040
Peace in our era is possible. 

2289
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:25,880
Excuse me, uh, Leonid.
It's okay, Dick. It's okay. 

2290
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:42,720
He's spilling his guts to the Ervin
committee. And, uh, unfortunately... 

2291
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:49,120
Da. 

2292
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:01,200
Did you... 

2293
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,120
Daddy?

2294
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:05,040
What?

2295
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,960
Did you cover it up?

2296
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:15,080
You think I'd do something
like that, honey?

2297
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:20,240
Well, then you can't give up. 

2298
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:22,400
You just can't. 

2299
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:25,760
You're one of the best presidents
this country has ever had. 

2300
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:29,240
You've done what Lincoln did... brought
this country back from civil war. 

2301
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:32,320
You can't let your enemies
tear you down. 

2302
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:34,760
You've gotta stay
and fight. 

2303
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:37,160
I'll go out there
and make speeches. 

2304
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:40,760
Nobody knows the real you, how sweet
you are, how nice you are to people. 

2305
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:42,680
I'll tell them. 

2306
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:47,960
You're the most decent
person I know. 

2307
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:53,560
I just hope I haven't
let you down, Kitten. 

2308
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:57,920
They just don't know
the real you. 

2309
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:00,960
They just don't know. 

2310
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,040
Tricky Dick always knew
What was goin' on. 

2311
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:09,240
Every last goddamn detail. 

2312
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:13,480
And my husband is not going
to take the rap this time. 

2313
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:16,560
They know they can't shut me up.
Probably end up killin' me. 

2314
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:18,960
She doesn't know what she's talking
about. Stop bothering her!

2315
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:21,840
Hell, she's nuts.
You bastards have seen to that. 

2316
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:25,120
Are you and Martha gonna
get back together again?

2317
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,800
Our marriage is finished, thank you
very much. Stick that up your keister!

2318
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:38,280
Now, were the visitors that went
into the White House warned... 

2319
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:41,960
... that their conversations
with the president would be taped?

2320
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:44,840
Again, I am
not aware of the technical details. 

2321
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:47,720
On Friday, we have
the high school students from Ohio. 

2322
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:50,600
Saturday is the National
Women's Republican Club. 

2323
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:53,760
In a development that could
break Watergate wide open... 

2324
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:55,680
... former White House aide
Alexander Butterfield... 

2325
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:58,320
... testified today before
the Senate Select committee. 

2326
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:01,680
He revealed a taping system that
may have recorded conversations... 

2327
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:04,560
... in the White House,
the executive office building... 

2328
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,480
... and even members
of his own family. 

2329
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:08,880
All calls
to the White House... 

2330
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:11,880
... of whatever nature and character,
would be taped?

2331
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:14,600
Yes, the tape
would not discriminate. 

2332
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:17,480
None of them had knowledge that
Their conversations were being taped?

2333
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,400
This is a stunning revelation. 

2334
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:22,280
If such tapes exist, they could
tell us, once and for all... 

2335
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:26,280
... what did the president know,
and when did he know it. 

2336
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:28,480
I want Hunt paid. 

2337
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:31,560
It's time to go the hang-out route. 

2338
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:33,480
If they fear the madman... 

2339
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:35,880
It's a legal contribution.
Who the hell authorized this?

2340
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:37,800
Colson?
The Bay of Pigs. 

2341
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:40,200
If you tell Helms
that Howard Hunt... 

2342
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:43,880
There's a cancer
on the presidency, and its growing... 

2343
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:46,280
... with every day... 

2344
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:50,120
If Hunt goes public,
it'll be a fiasco for the C. I. A. 

2345
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:52,360
They're like love letters. 

2346
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:55,240
You should burn 'em. 

2347
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:58,560
Why didn't you?

2348
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:04,160
They're evidence.
You can't legally destroy evidence. 

2349
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:08,120
You don't expect me to believe that
for one minute, do ya?

2350
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:12,160
Huh?
Does it matter what's on 'em?

2351
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:14,000
Really? Murder, Dick?

2352
02:27:14,040 --> 02:27:18,280
Sex? Your secrets,
your fantasies?

2353
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:21,440
Or is just me and you and...
Don't be ridiculous. 

2354
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:24,480
I remember Alger Hiss. 

2355
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:27,360
I know how ugly
you can be. 

2356
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:29,760
You're capable
of anything. 

2357
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:40,440
It doesn't really matter
at the end of the day what's on them... 

2358
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:42,360
... because you have
absolutely no remorse. 

2359
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:44,200
No concept of remorse. 

2360
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:49,000
You want the tapes to get out.
You want them to see you at your worst. 

2361
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:51,160
You're drunk.
Oh, yeah!

2362
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:53,760
No one'll ever see
those tapes, including you. 

2363
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:56,840
And what would I find out
that I haven't known for years?

2364
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:01,120
What makes it
so damn sad... 

2365
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:04,000
... is that you couldn't
confide in any of us. 

2366
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:07,080
You had to make a record
For the whole world. 

2367
02:28:07,160 --> 02:28:09,480
They were for me.
They're mine. 

2368
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:11,400
They're not "yours". 

2369
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:14,040
They are you. 

2370
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:22,680
You should burn them. 

2371
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:44,960
What has changed in you, Richard?
Go away!

2372
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:58,880
These guys went after Castro
seven times, ten times. 

2373
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:02,720
What, do you think people like that,
just gave up? They just don't walk away. 

2374
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:11,000
What, seven, ten times?
I never said this. 

2375
02:29:11,080 --> 02:29:14,680
Ten tim... Never.
You think people like that gave up?

2376
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:17,800
Castro.
These guys went after Castro. 

2377
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:26,840
If this got out,
they'd blame me for everything. 

2378
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:28,840
Forget Kennedy or Johnson.
It's Nixon!

2379
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Whoever killed Kennedy... 

2380
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:52,040
... came from this thing we created,
this beast. 

2381
02:29:57,520 --> 02:29:59,640
In the latest bombshell... 

2382
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:02,680
... the president's lawyers revealed that
there is an 18-and-a-halfminute gap... 

2383
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:04,640
... in a critical Watergate tape. 

2384
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:08,480
Reactions of disbelief and anger
are being heard across the country. 

2385
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,840
My God. 

2386
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:15,920
Pat!

2387
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:18,680
Pat!

2388
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:21,600
Has he had chest pains?
He woke up coughing blood!

2389
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:24,000
I'm in charge here!
Has he been short of breath?

2390
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:26,120
No, and he's sure that he has T. B. !
Why T. B. ? 

2391
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:29,720
Because his family had it.
His brother had it. 

2392
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:34,520
I think it's flooded.
Richard. 

2393
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:39,640
Get those I. V. s started. 

2394
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:43,480
Please lie down, Dick. 

2395
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:45,360
They need you to lie down!
Sedate him!

2396
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:47,240
Dick. Dick. 

2397
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:53,080
Richard?

2398
02:30:53,160 --> 02:30:55,200
Mother. 

2399
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:59,320
Maybe a trip
to the woodshed'll... 

2400
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:02,600
Daddy?

2401
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:42,880
Vice President Agnew
has resigned today... 

2402
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:46,080
... pleading no contest to charges
of income tax evasion. 

2403
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:51,000
This follows Special Prosecutor
Cox's continuing investigation... 

2404
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:52,960
... into President Nixon's finances. 

2405
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,840
The president paid no income tax Lie down, Dick. 

2406
02:31:55,880 --> 02:31:58,720
... in the years 1970, '71 and'72
They need you to lie down. 

2407
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:02,120
... and may have used funds to improve his
residence in San Clemente, California. 

2408
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:05,080
Where's the blood coming from?
What's wrong with him?

2409
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:08,360
He's got an acute viral pneumonia
and a very serious phlebitis. 

2410
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:12,160
It could go into his lungs.
Oh, no. 

2411
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:15,560
The president
has returned to the White House. 

2412
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:17,760
But Archibald Cox has declared war
by issuing a subpoena... 

2413
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:20,080
... for nine
of the president's tapes. 

2414
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:23,400
Never! Over my dead body.
It's the president's personal property. 

2415
02:32:23,480 --> 02:32:27,920
I'll never give up my tapes to a bunch
of Kennedy-loving, Democrat cocksuckers. 

2416
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,880
This could trigger the impeachment. 

2417
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:31,960
They'll go
to the Supreme Court. 

2418
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,320
I appointed three of those bastards.
They'll never get my tapes. 

2419
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:38,200
Can the president afford
to ignore a subpoena?

2420
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:42,040
Who the hell does Cox think he is? I've
never made a dime from public office. 

2421
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:44,440
I'm honest.
My dad died broke. Jesus. 

2422
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:48,920
That son of a bitch Cox, he went
to the same law school as Jack Kennedy. 

2423
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,840
The last gasp
of the establishment. 

2424
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:54,680
Yeah, they got the hell
kicked out of 'em in the election... 

2425
02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:57,040
... so now they gotta squeal
about Watergate... 

2426
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:59,640
'cause we were the first real threat
to them in years. 

2427
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:04,480
We would've changed it so they couldn't
have changed it back in 100 years. 

2428
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,400
Yeah. 

2429
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:09,280
If only the, uh... 

2430
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:11,200
Mr. President.
What?

2431
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:14,080
Sir, Congress is, uh...
No, over here, sir. 

2432
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:16,640
Sir, Congress is considering
Four articles of impeachment. 

2433
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:19,880
Yeah. For what?
They're very serious charges, sir. 

2434
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:22,320
First, abuse of power.
Yep. 

2435
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:24,720
Second, obstruction of justice.
Yeah, what else?

2436
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:27,160
Third, failure to
cooperate with Congress. 

2437
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:29,520
And last, bombing Cambodia, sir. 

2438
02:33:29,560 --> 02:33:32,880
They can't impeach me for Cambodia;
the president can bomb anybody he likes. 

2439
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:35,760
That's true.
We'll win that, but the other three... 

2440
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:38,160
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
It's Ron, sir. 

2441
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:41,040
They sell tickets to an impeachment
like a damn circus. 

2442
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:44,400
Okay, so they impeach me.
Well, fuck 'em!

2443
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:47,760
Yeah, well, it's just
a matter of mathematics. 

2444
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:51,160
How many votes we have in the Senate?
About a dozen. 

2445
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:54,760
A dozen? Jeez, I got
half of 'em elected. 

2446
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:57,640
Okay, so I got
the South and, uh... 

2447
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:00,040
Goldwater and his boys. 

2448
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:02,920
I'll take my chances in the Senate.
Yes, we should. 

2449
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:06,760
This damn leg.
Well, then, sir, we'll, uh... 

2450
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:10,680
... have to deal with the possibility
of removal from office... 

2451
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:12,640
... loss of pension
and possibly... 

2452
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:14,560
... possibly
even prison. 

2453
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:17,600
Yeah, well, plenty of people
did their best writing in prison. 

2454
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:20,400
Gandhi, Lenin.
That's right. 

2455
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:23,320
What I know about this country,
I could rip it apart. 

2456
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:27,080
If they want a public humiliation,
that's what they'll get. 

2457
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:29,960
Yes, they will.
I will never resign this office. Never. 

2458
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:32,840
Where the fuck am I? What's in there?

2459
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:35,720
The P. O. W. s and their families.
Oh. I'm supposed to be... 

2460
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:37,640
Compassionate, grateful...
Proud. 

2461
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:39,560
Sir?
Proud. Of them. 

2462
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:41,720
Oh, yes, of course.
Fire him. 

2463
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:44,600
Who?
Cox. Archibald Cox. Fire him!

2464
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:47,120
He works for the attorney general. 

2465
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:50,080
Only Richardson can fire him.
May I echo my concern here, sir?

2466
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:52,720
Then tell Richardson
to fire him!

2467
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:55,080
Well, Richardson won't do that, sir.
He'll resign. 

2468
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:57,040
The hell he will.
Then fire him too. 

2469
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:00,280
If you have to go all the way down to
the janitor at the justice department... 

2470
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:02,440
... fire that son of a bitch.
He's asked for it. 

2471
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:05,880
Mr. President,
may I just say something, sir?

2472
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:09,640
I think that you should
welcome this subpoena. 

2473
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,640
Why?
Well, sir... 

2474
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:15,160
... the tapes can only prove
that Dean was a liar. Right?

2475
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:17,080
That's right, sir. 

2476
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,480
Well, there's more. 

2477
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:24,760
There's more than just me. 

2478
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:27,240
You can't break, my boy. 

2479
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:29,520
Even though it's ended. 

2480
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:32,520
You can't admit, even to yourself,
when it's gone. 

2481
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:35,880
Uh, do you think
those P. O. W. s in there did?

2482
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:41,280
Now, there's some people,
and we both know them, Al... 

2483
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:45,640
... think you can go stand in the middle
of a bull ring and cry "mea culpa, mea culpa"... 

2484
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:49,480
... while the crowd is hissing and booing
and spitting on you. 

2485
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:53,360
Well, a man doesn't cry.
I don't cry. 

2486
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:55,360
You don't cry. 

2487
02:35:55,400 --> 02:35:57,280
You fight. 

2488
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:02,160
Okay. 

2489
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:04,120
Ladies and gentlemen... 

2490
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:06,040
... the president
of the United States!

2491
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:15,040
We interrupt this program for
a special report from NBC news. 

2492
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:19,120
The country is in the midst of the
most serious constitutional crisis... 

2493
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:21,000
... in its history. 

2494
02:36:21,080 --> 02:36:23,360
President Nixon has fired
special prosecutor Archibald Cox. 

2495
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:25,760
Attorney General
Elliot Richardson has quit... 

2496
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:29,440
... and his deputy William Ruckelshaus
was fired when he refused to fire Cox. 

2497
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:32,120
Acting Attorney General Robert Bork
has executed President Nixon's orders... 

2498
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:34,720
... and fired the special prosecutor. 

2499
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:37,600
In an attempt
to head off impeachment proceedings... 

2500
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:40,280
... the president has agreed to release
transcripts of46 taped conversations. 

2501
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:43,560
Gerald Ford
was sworn in as vice president. 

2502
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:47,360
Citing wrongdoing, a judge has dismissed
all charges against Daniel Ellsberg. 

2503
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:50,640
A grand jury has indicted former
Nixon aides Haldeman, Ehrlichman... 

2504
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:55,040
I mean, you're a lawyer, for God's sake.
How can you let this shit go through?

2505
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,960
Look. This.
Nixon can't say that. 

2506
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:00,360
Well, you did say it, sir.
Never! I never said that about Jews. 

2507
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:02,320
Makes me sound
like an anti-Semite. 

2508
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:05,360
We can check the tapes again.
No need. I know what I said. 

2509
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:09,280
Have you lost your mind?
Look, Al! Nixon can't say this!

2510
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:13,400
'Niggers. Niggers. " It can't say that!
We could delete it. 

2511
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:16,280
We're doing the best we can.
Well, it's not good enough!

2512
02:37:16,360 --> 02:37:19,120
Would you have us black it out, sir?
We could write "expletive deleted. "

2513
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:23,200
Cut all these 'goddamns'
and 'Jesus Christs' out. 

2514
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:25,360
Jesus.
Mr. President. 

2515
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:28,280
Don't you see that all these
deletion marks in the transcripts... 

2516
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:32,720
... make it look as though you...
you do nothing but swear?

2517
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:38,000
It soils
my mother's memory. 

2518
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:41,520
You think I want the whole goddamn world
to see my mother like this?

2519
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:43,440
Raising a dirty-mouth?

2520
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:47,480
We could start again, sir, but we don't
really have the staff to do that. 

2521
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:51,840
Then start over!
Just start over!

2522
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:54,880
The world will see
Only what I show 'em!

2523
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:57,560
From page one, Al.
Page one, Ron!

2524
02:37:57,640 --> 02:38:01,080
Ron, get in there and do something.
All this stuff... 

2525
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,840
Five seconds,
Mr. President. 

2526
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:13,920
And four, three, two... 

2527
02:38:19,720 --> 02:38:21,920
Good evening,
my fellow Americans. 

2528
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:23,840
Tonight I'm
taking an action... 

2529
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:27,680
... unprecedented in the history
of this office. 

2530
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:31,200
I had no knowledge of the cover-up
till John Dean told me about it... 

2531
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:34,680
... on March 21st, a year ago.
I think I'm going to throw up. 

2532
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:37,560
... no payment to Hunt
or anyone else be made. 

2533
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:40,000
He's lost touch with reality.
I've made my mistakes... 

2534
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:43,960
... but in all my years of public life,
I have never profited... 

2535
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:47,200
Can you imagine what
this man would have been... 

2536
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:50,080
... had he ever been loved?
I've earned every penny. 

2537
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:52,000
In all of my years
of public life... 

2538
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:54,200
I have never obstructed justice.
It's a tragedy... 

2539
02:38:54,280 --> 02:38:57,840
... because he had greatness in his grasp.
I welcome this examination. 

2540
02:38:57,880 --> 02:39:01,040
But he had the defects
of his qualities. 

2541
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:03,920
I made $250,000 from a book
They'll crucify him. 

2542
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:05,840
Does anybody really care anymore?

2543
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,720
Which many of you were
good enough to purchase. 

2544
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:12,880
... and what happens after?

2545
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:14,720
... every year. 

2546
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:19,480
When I, in 1968, decided to become
a candidate for the president... 

2547
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:21,440
I decided
to clean the decks... 

2548
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:23,800
... and to put everything
in real estate. 

2549
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:27,760
So, that's where the money came from.
That's all I own. 

2550
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:30,680
That's what we have,
and that's what we owe. 

2551
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:33,880
Because people have got to know
whether or not their... 

2552
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:35,800
... president is a crook. 

2553
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:38,160
Well, I am not a crook. 

2554
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:41,040
I've earned everything I have... 

2555
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:44,240
She does have a respectable
Republican cloth coat. 

2556
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:47,480
And I always tell her, uh,
she'd look good in anything. 

2557
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:50,400
There has never been
any feathering of nests. 

2558
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:52,800
Not in this
administration. 

2559
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:55,120
Now, let me just say this... 

2560
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:58,480
And I want to say this
to the television audience. 

2561
02:39:58,520 --> 02:40:01,600
The Supreme Court ruled today eight to
nothing that President Nixon's claims... 

2562
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:04,680
... of executive privilege
cannot be used in criminal cases... 

2563
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:07,880
... and must turn over subpoenaed tapes.
The House Judiciary Committee... 

2564
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:09,800
... has voted 27 to 11

2565
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:12,200
... to recommend impeachment
to the full House. 

2566
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:15,080
The deliberations now go
to the House floor. 

2567
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:18,440
In its report, the committee offers
evidence Nixon obstructed justice... 

2568
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:20,400
... on at least 36 occasions... 

2569
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:22,680
... that he encouraged his aides
to commit perjury... 

2570
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:25,600
... and that Nixon abused
the powers of his office. 

2571
02:40:25,640 --> 02:40:28,000
In a separate report,
the Senate Select committee... 

2572
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:29,920
... details the misuse
of the I. R. S. 

2573
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,840
... the F. B. I. , the C. I. A.
and the justice department. 

2574
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:36,600
It denounces the plumbers
and it raises the question... 

2575
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:40,800
... of whether the United States
had a valid election in 1972. 

2576
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:55,320
Come in. 

2577
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:09,720
Victory at Sea, Al.
Henry. 

2578
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:12,120
The Pacific Theatre. 

2579
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:16,440
Christ, you can almost hear
the waves breaking over the decks. 

2580
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:24,600
I'm afraid we have another problem,
Mr. President. 

2581
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:26,520
Excuse me, gentlemen. 

2582
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:33,040
June 23rd, '72, sir. 

2583
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:40,880
Your instructions to Haldeman
regarding the C. I. A. and the F. B. I. 

2584
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:43,520
So?

2585
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:45,920
Your lawyers
feel that... 

2586
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,160
... it's
the smoking gun. 

2587
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:51,320
That's totally out of context.
I was protecting the national security. 

2588
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:53,240
Sir, the deadline
is today. 

2589
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:58,800
Can we get around this,
Al?

2590
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:01,840
It's the Supreme Court,
sir. 

2591
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:04,440
You don't get around it. 

2592
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:10,160
If, uh... 

2593
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:14,480
If you resign, you can keep your tapes
as a private citizen. 

2594
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:17,000
You could fight them
For years. 

2595
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:21,560
What if I stay?

2596
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:25,680
You have the army. 

2597
02:42:26,680 --> 02:42:28,480
The army?

2598
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:31,760
Lincoln used it. 

2599
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:39,800
We'll have civil war. 

2600
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:42,360
How do you see this?

2601
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:47,200
Oh, God. 

2602
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:49,840
We can't survive this,
sir. 

2603
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:54,520
They also... 

2604
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:57,560
... have you instructing Dean
to make the pay off to Hunt. 

2605
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:01,400
There's nothing in that statement
the president can't explain. 

2606
02:43:01,480 --> 02:43:06,640
Sir, you talked about opening up
the whole Bay of Pigs thing again. 

2607
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:09,920
That's right.
On the June 20 tape. 

2608
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,320
The one with
the 18-minute gap. 

2609
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:13,560
I don't know anything
about that. 

2610
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:16,440
You mentioned the Bay of Pigs
several times. 

2611
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:20,320
Sooner or later, they're going to
want to know what that means. 

2612
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:23,200
They're going to want to
know what's on that gap. 

2613
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:26,680
It's gone. No one will ever
find out what's on it. 

2614
02:43:28,480 --> 02:43:31,320
They might... 

2615
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:33,280
... if there was
another recording. 

2616
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:37,320
We both know
it's possible. 

2617
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:43,160
I know for a fact... 

2618
02:43:43,240 --> 02:43:45,840
... that it's possible. 

2619
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:50,280
I've spoken to Ford. 

2620
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:52,520
There's
a very strong chance... 

2621
02:43:52,560 --> 02:43:54,440
... that he'll pardon you. 

2622
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:57,800
I don't need a goddamned deal,
for God's sake. I... 

2623
02:43:57,880 --> 02:44:02,000
This is something that
you will have to do, Mr. President. 

2624
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:07,440
I thought
you'd rather do it... 

2625
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:09,360
... now. 

2626
02:44:13,320 --> 02:44:15,160
I'll wait outside. 

2627
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:22,840
Sir. 

2628
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:26,680
May I say, sir,
that if you stay now... 

2629
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:30,840
... it will paralyze the nation
and its foreign policy. 

2630
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:37,320
You always had a great
sense of timing, Henry. 

2631
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:39,640
When to give... 

2632
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:41,560
... and when to take. 

2633
02:44:43,880 --> 02:44:47,800
How do you think Mao
and Brezhnev will react?

2634
02:44:47,880 --> 02:44:50,880
Do you think they'll
remember us, Henry... 

2635
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:53,520
... after all the great things
you and I did together... 

2636
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:56,480
... as some kind of... 

2637
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:58,400
... of crooks?

2638
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:00,560
They will understand. 

2639
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:05,520
To be undone by a third-rate burglary
is a fate of biblical proportions. 

2640
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:11,760
History will treat you far more kindly
than your contemporaries. 

2641
02:45:11,800 --> 02:45:16,040
Yeah. Depends who writes
the history books. 

2642
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:20,560
I'm not a quitter,
never have been. 

2643
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:23,640
But I'm not stupid either. 

2644
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:27,120
A trial would kill me.
That's what they want. 

2645
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,600
They won't get it. 

2646
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:31,960
Fuck 'em. 

2647
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:56,200
If they harass you, I too will resign,
and I will tell the world why. 

2648
02:45:56,280 --> 02:46:00,680
Don't be stupid.
The world needs you, Henry. 

2649
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:02,560
You always saw
the big picture. 

2650
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:09,360
You were my equal
in many ways. 

2651
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:21,800
You're the only friend
I got, Henry. 

2652
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:25,960
Do you ever pray?

2653
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:32,840
You know, believe
in a supreme being?

2654
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:36,440
Uh, not really. 

2655
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:38,520
You mean on my knees?

2656
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:44,600
My mother used to pray
a lot. 

2657
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:50,320
It's been a long time
since I really prayed. 

2658
02:46:55,880 --> 02:46:57,760
Let's pray, Henry. 

2659
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,440
Let's pray a little. 

2660
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:04,280
Just you and me. 

2661
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,480
I hope this doesn't
embarrass you, Henry. 

2662
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:16,240
No. Not at all, no. 

2663
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:18,560
This is not going to leak, is it?

2664
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:25,840
Don't be too proud,
Henry. 

2665
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:29,680
Never be too proud
to go on your knees before God. 

2666
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:44,160
God. 

2667
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:52,320
How can a... 

2668
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:54,800
How can a country
come apart like this?

2669
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:58,240
What have I done wrong?

2670
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:02,440
I opened China. 

2671
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:05,080
I made peace
with Russia. 

2672
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:07,000
I ended the war. 

2673
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:11,760
I did what I thought
was right. 

2674
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:18,160
Uh... 

2675
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:20,680
God, why do they
hate me so?

2676
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:24,800
It's unbelievable.
It... It's insane. 

2677
02:48:24,880 --> 02:48:29,520
Oh, M-Mom, I'm sorry.
God, please forgive me, God. 

2678
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:32,720
I didn't mean it.
I didn't know what to do. 

2679
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:36,080
I don't know why
this is happening to me. 

2680
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:38,480
I can't believe... 

2681
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:46,480
Al. 

2682
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:03,600
They smelled the blood
on me this time, Al. 

2683
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:06,480
I got soft, you know?

2684
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:10,160
A rusty, metallic smell. 

2685
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:12,080
I know it well, sir. 

2686
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:14,600
It came over from Vietnam,
you know?

2687
02:49:14,680 --> 02:49:17,920
Sir?
That smell. 

2688
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:21,040
I mean, everyone
suffered so much. 

2689
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:24,240
Their boys killed. 

2690
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:27,760
Uh, they need to
sacrifice something. 

2691
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:30,720
You know, appease
the gods of war. 

2692
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:33,640
Mars, Jupiter. 

2693
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:39,120
I am that blood,
General. 

2694
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:43,960
I am that sacrifice. 

2695
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:47,400
In the highest place
of all. 

2696
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:55,800
Yeah. All leaders must
finally be sacrificed. 

2697
02:49:55,880 --> 02:49:59,680
Things won't be the same
after this. 

2698
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:01,800
No, I played
by the rules. 

2699
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:05,360
Rules changed right
in the middle of the game. 

2700
02:50:05,440 --> 02:50:08,720
There's no respect
for American institutions anymore. 

2701
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:13,480
No, people are cynical. 

2702
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:16,520
The press... ah, the press
is out of control. 

2703
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:21,600
People spit on soldiers. 

2704
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:24,240
Government secrets mean nothing. 

2705
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:27,880
I pity the next guy
who sits here. 

2706
02:50:31,080 --> 02:50:32,920
Good night,
gentlemen. 

2707
02:50:38,720 --> 02:50:40,560
Mr. President. 

2708
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:18,920
When they look at you... 

2709
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,320
... they see
what they want to be. 

2710
02:51:23,720 --> 02:51:26,720
When they look at me... 

2711
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:29,120
... they see what they are. 

2712
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:36,840
Dick, please don't. 

2713
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:45,200
I can't. 

2714
02:51:45,240 --> 02:51:48,120
I don't have
the strength anymore. 

2715
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:51,680
It'll be over soon. 

2716
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:55,360
No, it's going to start now. 

2717
02:51:55,440 --> 02:51:58,120
Oh, Buddy. 

2718
02:51:58,160 --> 02:52:00,160
If I could just sleep. 

2719
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:02,200
If I could just sleep. 

2720
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:04,880
There'll be time for that.
Yeah. 

2721
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:11,920
You know, once... 

2722
02:52:11,960 --> 02:52:14,520
... when I was sick as a boy... 

2723
02:52:14,600 --> 02:52:17,840
... my mother gave me
this stuff... 

2724
02:52:17,880 --> 02:52:20,560
... and she made me
swallow it. 

2725
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:22,960
It made me throw up
all over her. 

2726
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:29,120
I wish I could
do that now. 

2727
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:37,720
I'm so afraid. 

2728
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:40,120
There's darkness out there. 

2729
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:45,960
I could always see
where I was going. 

2730
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:47,880
But it's dark out there. 

2731
02:52:49,280 --> 02:52:53,240
God, I've always been
afraid of the dark. 

2732
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:57,760
Buddy. 

2733
02:53:23,440 --> 02:53:25,960
There are many fine careers. 

2734
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,680
This country needs
good farmers... 

2735
02:53:28,760 --> 02:53:33,720
... good businessmen,
good plumbers... 

2736
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:35,640
... good carpenters. 

2737
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:38,760
I remember my old man. 

2738
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:43,480
I think that they would have
called him sort of a... 

2739
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:46,600
... sort of a little man,
a common man. 

2740
02:53:46,680 --> 02:53:50,280
Well, he didn't consider
himself that way. 

2741
02:53:51,320 --> 02:53:54,160
You know what he was?

2742
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:56,680
He was a streetcar motorman first. 

2743
02:53:56,760 --> 02:54:00,240
Then he was a farmer. 

2744
02:54:00,320 --> 02:54:02,160
Then he had a lemon ranch. 

2745
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:05,680
It was the poorest lemon ranch
in California, I can assure you. 

2746
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:08,000
He sold it before
they found oil on it. 

2747
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:14,360
Then he was a grocer. 

2748
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:16,840
But he was a great man... 

2749
02:54:16,880 --> 02:54:19,360
... because he did his job. 

2750
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:22,240
And every job counts
up to the hilt... 

2751
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:25,720
... regardless of what happens. 

2752
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:30,400
Nobody will ever write a book,
probably, about my mother. 

2753
02:54:30,440 --> 02:54:33,280
Well, I guess
all of you would... 

2754
02:54:33,360 --> 02:54:36,040
... say this
about your mother. 

2755
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:40,960
My mother was a saint. 

2756
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:42,880
And I think of her... 

2757
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:46,520
... two boys dying
of tuberculosis... 

2758
02:54:46,600 --> 02:54:49,240
... and seeing each of them die. 

2759
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:51,160
And when they died... 

2760
02:54:55,320 --> 02:54:59,880
Yes, she will have no books
written about her. 

2761
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:04,520
But she was a saint. 

2762
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:09,000
Now, however,
we look to the future. 

2763
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:14,120
I remember something, uh,
Theodore Roosevelt wrote... 

2764
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:16,320
... when his first wife died... 

2765
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:18,400
... in his twenties. 

2766
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:21,520
He thought the light
had gone from his life forever. 

2767
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:25,680
But he went on, and he
not only became president... 

2768
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:28,240
... but as an ex-president,
he served his country... 

2769
02:55:28,320 --> 02:55:32,160
... always in the arena,
tempestuous, strong... 

2770
02:55:32,240 --> 02:55:34,880
... sometimes right,
sometimes wrong. 

2771
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:37,120
But he was a man. 

2772
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:39,760
And as I leave... 

2773
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:43,560
... that's an example I think
all of us should remember. 

2774
02:55:43,640 --> 02:55:46,280
See, we think sometimes
when, uh... 

2775
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:49,000
... things happen
that don't go the right way;

2776
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:52,760
... we think that when someone
dear to us dies... 

2777
02:55:52,840 --> 02:55:55,200
... uh, when we lose
an election... 

2778
02:55:55,280 --> 02:55:57,440
... or when we suffer defeat... 

2779
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:59,360
... that all is ended. 

2780
02:55:59,440 --> 02:56:01,280
Not true. 

2781
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:03,920
It's only a beginning,
always... 

2782
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,720
... because the greatness comes,
not when things go always good for you... 

2783
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:09,800
... but the greatness comes... 

2784
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:11,760
... when you're really tested... 

2785
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:15,280
... when you take some knocks,
some disappointments... 

2786
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:17,480
... when sadness comes. 

2787
02:56:17,560 --> 02:56:21,360
Because only if you've been
in the deepest valley... 

2788
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:25,200
... can you ever know
how magnificent it is... 

2789
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:29,280
... to be on the highest mountain. 

2790
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:35,760
So I say to you on this occasion... 

2791
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:38,720
... we leave, proud of the people
who have stood by us... 

2792
02:56:38,800 --> 02:56:43,240
... and worked for us and served
this government and this country. 

2793
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:46,080
They want you to continue
to serve in government... 

2794
02:56:46,120 --> 02:56:48,240
... if that is what you wish. 

2795
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:51,600
Remember,
always give your best. 

2796
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:53,440
Never get discouraged. 

2797
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:55,360
Never be petty. 

2798
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:59,360
Always remember,
others may hate you. 

2799
02:56:59,440 --> 02:57:03,520
But those who hate you
don't win unless you hate them. 

2800
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:08,160
And then,
you destroy yourself. 

2801
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:11,840
And so we leave with high hopes
and good spirits... 

2802
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:13,800
... and with deep humility. 

2803
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:15,840
And I say to each
and every one of you... 

2804
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:18,840
... not only will we always
remember you... 

2805
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:20,840
... but always you will be... 

2806
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:23,240
... in our hearts. 

2807
02:57:23,280 --> 02:57:25,520
And you'll be... 

2808
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:27,720
... in our prayers. 

2809
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:31,200
And only then will you find
what we Quakers call... 

2810
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:34,640
"peace at the center". 

2811
02:57:47,960 --> 02:57:51,240
He gave of
himself with intelligence and energy... 

2812
02:57:51,320 --> 02:57:53,520
... and devotion to duty. 

2813
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:56,320
Richard Nixon was buried
and honored by five presidents... 

2814
02:57:56,360 --> 02:57:59,400
... on April 26, 1994... 

2815
02:57:59,440 --> 02:58:04,120
... less than a year after his
beloved wife, Pat, had died. 

2816
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:07,280
Nixon always maintained that
if he had not been driven from office... 

2817
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:12,520
... the North Vietnamese would not
have overwhelmed the South in 1975. 

2818
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:17,200
In a sideshow, Cambodian society was
destroyed and mass genocide resulted. 

2819
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:19,240
The second half of the 20th century... 

2820
02:58:19,320 --> 02:58:22,040
... will be known
as the age of Nixon. 

2821
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:24,280
In his absence,
Russia and the United States returned... 

2822
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:28,040
... to a decade of high-budget
military expansion and near war. 

2823
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:31,720
Nixon, who was pardoned
by President Ford... 

2824
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:34,360
... lived to write six books... 

2825
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:36,960
... and travel the world
as an elder statesman. 

2826
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:39,160
For the remainder of his life... 

2827
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:41,920
... he fought successfully
to protect his tapes. 

2828
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,400
The National Archives
spent 14 years... 

2829
02:58:44,480 --> 02:58:46,640
... indexing and cataloging them. 

2830
02:58:46,720 --> 02:58:51,320
Out of 4,000 hours,
60 hours have been made public. 

2831
02:59:11,059 --> 02:59:14,697
Oh, Shenandoah

2832
02:59:14,778 --> 02:59:19,022
I long to see you

2833
02:59:19,103 --> 02:59:22,862
And hear

2834
02:59:22,943 --> 02:59:26,096
Your rolling river

2835
02:59:27,874 --> 02:59:30,946
Oh, Shenandoah

2836
02:59:31,028 --> 02:59:36,714
I long to see you

2837
02:59:36,794 --> 02:59:40,254
Way

2838
02:59:40,333 --> 02:59:44,151
We're bound away
