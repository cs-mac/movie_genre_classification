My brother manages a huge

my brother manages a huge
food warehouse.

Food warehouse.
They're always hiring

455
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,626
they're always hiring
forklifters, and they pay them

456
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,860
forklifters, and they pay them
like 20 bucks an hour.

457
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,128
Like 20 bucks an hour.
I don't know how to drive a

He isn't gonna hire me.
Yeah.

Yeah.
I'll tell him to.

I'll tell him to.
I got to check this out

I got to check this out
first.

First.
Just let yourself out when

just let yourself out when
you're ready.

473

You're ready.
You have the 30 bucks you owe

you have the 30 bucks you owe
me for dinner last night?

Me for dinner last night?
That's not even including the

that's not even including the
blow.

Hi.
I came to get my black

I came to get my black
sweater.

I texted you like five times.

I texted you like five times.
You -- you told me I could

you -- you told me I could
borrow it.

Borrow it.
I'm sure your grandfather can

I'm sure your grandfather can
buy you one.

501

Why'd you tell Melissa and
Jessica that I couldn't afford

Jessica that I couldn't afford
to go to D.C.?

Afford it.
I didn't mean for you to tell

I didn't mean for you to tell
everyone.

That's the bitchiest thing

that's the bitchiest thing
you've ever done to me.

You've ever done to me.

It's Italian.

Well, of course you'll need your

well, of course you'll need your
nylons and your heels and some

nylons and your heels and some
lipstick, but with some

00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,591
lipstick, but with some
tailoring, it might work.

547
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,726

How does it feel?

548

How does it feel?
Is it comfortable?

549

Is it comfortable?
The suit feels fine.

You know what why I got you
a red car?

565
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,529
A red car?
Because red cars get the most

because red cars get the most
tickets.

567

Tickets.
So, if you get any tickets, you

568
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,733
so, if you get any tickets, you
have to pay for it yourself.
