[Emily] Uh...

170
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,789
Hey, what happened
to you by the way?

171
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,124
You weren't at work today.

172
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,834
I called, but...

173
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,379
Steven,
I can't talk right now. I...

174
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,422
I...

175
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,259
Something came up
and I need your help.

176
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:38,927
[Steven] Really?

177
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,222
I have to move right away,
tomorrow morning.

178
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,474
What about work?

179
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,562
Steven, I need your help.

180
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,021
I don’t know.

181
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,901
Steven, can't you drive over or
send one of the guys and a car?

182
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,612
Um... Well...

183
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,407
I...

184
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,535
Okay, yeah,
I'll send somebody over.

185
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,078
Great.

186
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,496
What time?

187
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,124
Um... Eight o'clock.

188
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,210
Yeah, okay, I'll try.

189
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,921
Thanks a million, Steven.
Really.

190
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,550
Thank you.

191
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,641
You know, young lady,
there is a telephone,

192
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,102
a pay telephone in the lobby.

193
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:34,065
Oh, I... I'm terribly sorry,
I didn't realize.

194
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,735
Don't be sorry, you didn't know.

195
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,154
Right. Thanks again.

196

-Emily, you better come to work.
-What?

00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,024
Never mind, it's my fault.
Goodbye, Steven.

Shouldn't you think this out?

00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,976
I have...
Can't live here anymore.

00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,236
[Andrea] Have you told Steven
what happened?

257
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,030
[Emily] What for?

258
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,909

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,250
[Emily] Marin? He says,

262
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,252
"Hmm, what do you think."
A lot of that.

263
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,048
I was never very comfortable
with Dr. Marin anyway,

264
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,551

from here on in,

my money goes for rent.

Emily?

294
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,105
I'm sorry,
I should've left the door open.

295
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,774
Come on in.

296
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,622
Would you like to have a seat?

297
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,968
[Jim]
I'll be with Persky, Bob.

299
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,441
He came back.

300
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:20,735
When?

301
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,819
[Emily sighs]

302
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,447
This morning.
He tried to break in,

303
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,740
but Andrea stopped him.

304
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,873
And the other night?

305
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,261
He had a...

306
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,516
He had a knife.

307
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,771
He kept putting it at my throat,

308
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,316
and... my mouth.

309
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,071
I couldn't breathe and I...

310
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,619
He tore open my coat...

311
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,294
Made me pull... my bra down.

312
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,300
He had a tape recorder and...

313
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,637
I had to make sounds.

314
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,600
It was awful.

315
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,062
He scared the hell out of me.

316
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,109
Did you see his face?

[sighs]

318
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,034
Today I... real quick and...

319
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,164
Well, he was a creep.

320
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:09,594
Look, how about
if I give you a ride home?

321
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,138
Oh, no, no.

322
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,099
It's not necessary.
[stammering]

323
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,185
I can take a cab,
I really like cabs.

coming by the desk.

331
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,717
-Flag her a cab, will you?
-[Jackie] Sure.

We put your stuff upstairs.

My stuff?

335
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,835
A girl. A girl in a sports car,
made two trips.

336
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,963
Thank... thank you.

337

[Emily I'm...
I'm not much of a drinker.

No, I can't.

But I'd love to have lunch
with you this week.

By the way,
what happened with the police?

Well, they were very nice.

-Really?
-Mhmm.

But they don't know
who did it, of course.

No, not yet.

Oh, the house is new to her.
She...

You didn't mean
to hurt Andrea, did you?

369
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,422
[Andrea] Doesn't matter.

370

-Here.
-I'm sorry about the scratch.

371

How're you getting home?

372
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,518
Taxi.

373
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,852

Uh-uh. I'll drive you.

Oh, couple of minutes.

You, uh, you did
a little disappearing act.

How did you find me?

380
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,611
That's a trade secret.

381
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,156
You called "Missing Persons."

Oh, there's this little bakery.

00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,217
Well, actually,
it's a restaurant too,

386
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,096
and once a week, I, uh...
I drive over the bridge and I...

387
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,807
I get these little cakes
they make.

[gentle music playing]

389

So I thought I'd stop by
and see how you were doing.

Thank... thank you.

You know the restaurant bar...
It's terrific.

392

I'll have to try it sometime.

Would you like
to get a bite tonight?

I, um... I can't. I'm sorry

Anyway, this place, you know,
it's gonna look great...

when you fix it up.

Alright.

it’s very important

538
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,181

01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,233
In a hospital atmosphere.

662
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,571
I made arrangements for you
to be admitted this evening.

663
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,243
I'll go with you and...

664
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,163
We can have a short session
when you get settled.

665
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,043
Of course, we'll...
we'll get a second opinion.

666
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,297
But for now...

667
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,217
for your own piece of mind...

668
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,846
I think we should go ahead.

I've got work to do.
I'll be back. Okay?

688
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,771
Take her upstairs.
I'll see you back at the car.

who bought a telescope
in the last eight or nine days.

I want it tonight.

Yes, she... yes...

Well, I can’t find

Don't lie to me.

You did.

886
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:29,587
You said it.

I told him exactly what you do.
Exactly.

[stammering]
Yes!

896
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,926

I want to hear you say,
"Yes, I understand."
