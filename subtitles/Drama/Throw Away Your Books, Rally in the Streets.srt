1
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:28,333
Don't cry. Let's go.

2
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:32,343
Can you walk?

3
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,343
Is it OK?

4
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,353
Let's put on your shoes.

5
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:51,363
Slowly. Is it OK?

6
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:57,683
Ken, I love you.

7
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:04,433
Sitting in the darkness
of the local flea-pit...

8
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:14,773
Stinking, and sucking a sweet...

9
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:21,493
I love watching you do all your killing.

10
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:55,893
Just the memory of it...

11
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,903
Sends shivers up my spine.

12
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:13,623
I've never killed anyone.
I've never used a kitchen knife.

13
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:23,213
I'm so scared of people.

14
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:28,473
I'm so gutless.

15
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:35,773
What a snivelling wretch I am!
A salary of 20,000 yen.

16
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,523
I have no friend.

17
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:41,693
No courage.

18
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:44,193
No home.

19
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:47,863
Always sleeping...

20
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:54,373
...in the all-night cinema.

21
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:26,613
Oh, that shakes me up!

22
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:32,453
Ken, I love you!

23
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:39,793
I was born in Korea
and brought up in Japan.

24
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:44,963
In order to speak without stuttering...

25
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:51,013
...I choose only words which
I can say without stuttering...

26
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:56,183
...and string those words together.

27
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:01,393
So I often end up saying things...

28
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,813
...which I didn't really mean to say.

29
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:11,283
When I was at primary school...

30
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:18,493
In our primary school textbook
there was a piece called:

31
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:24,163
"Carry the sun in the core of your heart"

32
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:28,383
But I couldn't say "core."

33
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:34,803
I kept saying "co-co-core" -
so they nicknamed me "chicken."

34
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:50,523
On another occasion I was
rushed to the doctor...

35
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,863
...after doing too much deep breathing.

36
00:07:57,493 --> 00:08:00,993
They say that if you keep
singing continuously...

37
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,583
...you'll stop stuttering.

38
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:05,793
I've tried it 100 times.

39
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,633
Stuttering is an ideology.

40
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:20,603
The sun stutters...

41
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:24,353
...as it rises between buildings

42
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:30,903
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony...

43
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:33,903
...it stutters.

44
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:38,993
The peace in Vietnam...

45
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,873
...it stutters across fire-swept land.

46
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:48,833
The clouds are stuttering tramps.

47
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,133
The Korean Strait...

48
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,003
...is a stuttering frontier.

49
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:57,633
Have you noticed?

50
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:02,303
Order and obedience are smooth.

51
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:05,773
But the sun stutters.

52
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:10,693
The heart stutters.

53
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,153
Resistance movements stutter.

54
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,153
Stutter.

55
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:20,703
Stutter and shout.

56
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:26,083
Me...

57
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:34,173
I'm a shamefaced stutterer.

58
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:46,143
But it's because I stutter...

59
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:52,353
...that I can chew over words properly.

60
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,403
In my own mouth.

61
00:09:57,693 --> 00:09:58,573
My own words.

62
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:11,123
As I was saying, then, it's not good
for old people to stay at home.

63
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:14,833
It might seem a bit cruel,
but they should move out.

64
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:21,053
- Did you ask this man to come here?
- Not exactly.

65
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:26,013
You mean he's come in here uninvited,
on his own? He's an intruder!

66
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,643
A thief!

67
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:31,933
But don't you want to have
someone to talk to?

68
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:39,363
At our Old People's Society, we've
learned a lot from the American system.

69
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:43,323
- In America...
- I don't like America.

70
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:47,913
Even people who don't like America
like running hot water...

71
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:52,463
...their own cars, Hollywood movies -
a high standard of living.

72
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:59,093
- Where are you off to?
- To buy cigarettes.

73
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:02,883
The minute we have a serious
discussion, you disappear.

74
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:08,263
You want that man to take me away.

75
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:12,893
But old people's homes aren't
some kind of hell, you know.

76
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,893
There are several different kinds.

77
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:21,983
Some with private bathrooms and toilets.

78
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:25,403
A home? But who for?

79
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:26,863
I'll drive you over.

80
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:31,953
Stop joking. I don't want to go there!

81
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:36,713
You made me nervous right from the start.

82
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:42,593
A Japanese smoking a foreign cigarette,
dropping ash everywhere!

83
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:44,843
Go away!

84
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:48,643
But your son asked me to come here.

85
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:53,103
Masaharu? That's impossible.

86
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:58,773
I raised him from a child,
all on my own.

87
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,943
He couldn't survive without me.

88
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,033
Wait a second.

89
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:21,043
Who wrote this letter?

90
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,933
Was it you, Masaharu?

91
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:40,563
It was really you.

92
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:46,363
Yes, I took a lot of trouble over it.

93
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:52,163
I'm not as beautiful as that.

94
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:55,453
I'm not young any more.

95
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,673
It's a mother who's crossed the water.

96
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:11,763
Come on, come on, everyone.

97
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:14,853
It's not a tale from this world.

98
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:18,313
It's a tale from the swamps of hell

99
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:22,563
Rather than despair as you
plait your white hair...

100
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:26,483
Rather than live counting
your wrinkles...

101
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:32,783
...it's better to ring bells,
like the ravens.

102
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,793
Ghosts and the living dead.

103
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:44,043
The wrinkled old man and woman
go into the swamp...

104
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:49,053
...and come out of it stripped
of their wrinkled skins.

105
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:58,023
At the bottom of the swamp
are countless dead men's skins.

106
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:02,313
Look... it's all stripped clean.

107
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:09,613
Here's Yohei, from the second-hand
clothes shop.

108
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:15,373
He's 75 this year.

109
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:44,853
And this new bride is 102.

110
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:19,973
And this wife is 95.

111
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:30,983
Mother!

112
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:33,903
Mother!

113
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,963
You must be mistaken,
I don't have any children.

114
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:53,423
In those days everyone respected me
and looked after me.

115
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:57,303
My son above all.

116
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,433
Father!

117
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:08,603
Where's my father?

118
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:14,363
Do you know where my father is?

119
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,163
Is father there?

120
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:37,173
Everyone's ready.

121
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:40,093
Yes, I'm getting dressed.

122
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:51,313
I don't want to.

123
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,533
Come close to your mother.

124
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,413
Smile!

125
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,123
You must really look down on me!

126
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:30,993
Why?

127
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:37,763
Because I didn't do anything...

128
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,333
You're still thinking about that rabbit?

129
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:51,983
Yeah. Whenever I took the rabbit in my arms,
he would kick on my breasts with his legs.

130
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,773
- Your breasts?
- Yeah, right here.

131
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:59,223
Right here.

132
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:05,423
You look so happy whenever
you talk about the rabbit.

133
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:15,113
Should we go out to eat?
I've got a bit of money today.

134
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:21,703
How about a Western restaurant?

135
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:25,293
I don't know how to eat there.

136
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,063
No problem, I'll teach you.

137
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:35,063
There are certain things in this world,
which I left inside a cave.

138
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:38,473
I slept wherever I could find a bed.

139
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:42,443
And while soundly sleeping, I dreamed.

140
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,303
In a dream, I saw a man
with a wooden stick.

141
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:50,363
He came out of a dark room.
In his other hand, he was holding a book.

142
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:57,663
His back was bent under the weight
of his luggage, just standing there.

143
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,363
I was looking at him!

144
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:04,963
He opened his book and was
reading and crying.

145
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,353
And he kept shivering without pause.

146
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,933
Finally, he couldn't restrain himself.
He started yelling in a miserable voice:

147
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,763
"What can we do for the betterment of life?"

148
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:19,403
What are you reading?

149
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:25,493
It's a book about how books can have a
profound liberating influence on people.

150
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:53,513
What would you like?

151
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:57,783
- What do you think?
- You can just order.

152
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,143
- This one.
- OK, I see.

153
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:23,413
Spoon. It's for eating soup.

154
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:26,383
When you eat soup from your plate...

155
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:34,423
...you use it like this:
Fill it up like this, and eat.

156
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:45,153
Then, when you come to the main course,
you take the fork and knife.

157
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:50,513
You use this part, then cut it like this.

158
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,063
And then put it in your mouth.

159
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,443
I won't be able to do it.

160
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,403
- It's OK, it's simple.
- Simple?

161
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,753
If we come here two or three times...

162
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,973
But I don't know when we'll come here again.

163
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:16,683
Well, I think I'll bring you here
for your next birthday.

164
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:29,483
Do you know these people?

165
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:31,203
Can we sit here?

166
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:41,083
- Your girlfriend?
- No, my sister.

167
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:44,113
- Let me introduce you. This is Reiko.
- How do you do?

168
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:45,813
Do you often come here?

169
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:49,223
Mr. Omi brought me here
two or three times before.

170
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:56,023
Roast beef and wine, please.

171
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:59,253
- What about you?
- I'll have roast beef, too.

172
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:05,203
So, this is your sister.

173
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,083
You look quite similar.

174
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:14,043
You haven't come to practice recently.

175
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:17,743
I've been distracted.

176
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:22,193
And even people with
completely different faces...

177
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:25,793
...if only their manner of
thinking is aligned...

178
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:31,973
Upon entering a book, they can reach a common
ground where communication is possible.

179
00:22:31,973 --> 00:22:33,633
That's what we're talking about.

180
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:40,173
You could say that books are...

181
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:50,563
Though many of them seem really good,
I think they would be difficult to handle.

182
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:54,673
You need practice.
I've already ordered food.

183
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,083
But it must be hard to eat.

184
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:59,803
For Americans, nothing could be simpler.

185
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:03,253
For them, it's hard to imagine
what could be hard about it.

186
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:07,573
If you feel tense, you should
just get some brandy.

187
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:10,443
Don't force yourself.
Be at ease at the table.

188
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,503
Young people should have a fun time.

189
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:18,763
In Europe there has been
a new trend recently.

190
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,293
Young people leading a vagrant life.

191
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:25,253
They leave their parents and come together
to live in groups of five people.

192
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:29,913
They live together,
and they are their own parents.

193
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:32,743
They aren't looking for
anything in particular.

194
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,133
And they don't divide stuff
into mine and yours.

195
00:23:35,753 --> 00:23:38,033
No matter if it's food or clothing,
it's all shared property.

196
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:40,803
Like a commune.

197
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:43,313
- Women too.
- But...

198
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:47,253
It's precisely because someone
interested in sports...

199
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:50,933
...can find his new home in the team.
That's why I'm urging you to join.

200
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:54,143
- And there won't be any jealousy?
- Jealousy?

201
00:23:57,153 --> 00:24:00,153
For a guy, jealousy is a real problem!

202
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:08,653
"If the end of the world comes tomorrow,"

203
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:19,293
"I will plant an apple tree."

204
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,343
-Gheorgiu

205
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:32,643
In August 1970, a child was born to me.

206
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:38,233
Nobody gave me permission...

207
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:47,783
In August 1970...

208
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:54,713
I called it Jenla.

209
00:24:56,993 --> 00:25:00,373
Nobody gave me permission.

210
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:10,053
In August 1970...

211
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:16,823
Another woman fell pregnant.

212
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:22,853
Nobody gave me permission.

213
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:30,783
In August 1970...

214
00:25:33,963 --> 00:25:39,113
I thought of the name for this child.

215
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:44,903
Nobody gave me permission.

216
00:25:58,143 --> 00:26:02,313
I'll teach you a new dance.
Come and dance.

217
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:09,073
It's so boring in this country.
Nobody wants to dance.

218
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,283
Do you want to know something?

219
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,163
- What's the best book?
- Come again?

220
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:22,083
- What's the best book you've ever read?
- The Bible, of course.

221
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:25,673
What part do you wash first
when you take a bath?

222
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:30,053
I start by washing the bathtub.

223
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:32,973
- Are you hairy?
- What?

224
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,883
- Are you on the hairy side?
- Yes, in parts.

225
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,143
What magazine do you like best?

226
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:41,933
"Playboy," I guess.

227
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:44,853
Are you tragic or comic?

228
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:49,363
Put some more feeling into your questions.
Don't just read them out.

229
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:53,193
- Can you laugh in English?
- In English?

230
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:56,243
It's the same as in any language.

231
00:26:56,613 --> 00:27:01,543
- How often do you go to the loo?
- Go on... God alone knows.

232
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:04,333
How many men have you cheated?

233
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:08,503
Hey, wait a minute now, I'm serious.

234
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,133
What bad effects do books
have on people?

235
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:13,213
Bad effects?

236
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:19,263
Well, it's getting more difficult
to find men to collect the rubbish.

237
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:22,183
What's the best book to
read in the loo?

238
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:27,483
The Bible, probably.
I read it every day.

239
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:31,523
- What part do you hide when you're naked?
- When I'm stripped? Nothing

240
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:37,363
- Do you ever count the stars?
- At night, I haven't the time to count.

241
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:41,333
When can you count them?

242
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:42,783
The stars?

243
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:47,793
At night, when you put out the light.

244
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:50,503
Then you can see the stars a bit.

245
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:53,583
- How about Marx's "Das Kapital"?
- Come again?

246
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:56,843
- Marx's "Das Kapital"
- I don't know it.

247
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:01,303
Hey there, what are you doing?

248
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:07,133
You can see what I'm doing.
I'm eating a rice-ball.

249
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,193
Have you no family?

250
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:13,203
Yes, but I don't want to go back home.

251
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,523
Why not?

252
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:18,823
I've won the lottery.

253
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,243
The national lottery.

254
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:27,333
I bought it in front of the
Ikebukuro station.

255
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:34,003
I won five million yen.
But I've no one to leave it to.

256
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:40,263
I don't smoke Japanese cigarettes.

257
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:44,263
I had a son.

258
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,023
But he's dead.

259
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:52,273
And now I've got no one any more.

260
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:03,953
I'll give five million to anyone
who's kind to me.

261
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:09,293
To anyone who'd take good care of me.

262
00:29:10,293 --> 00:29:14,923
Anyone who'd take care of
an old woman like me.

263
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:22,473
Ever since I was born, no one
has ever been kind to me.

264
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:29,273
I'd give five million yen just to be
treated with real kindness.

265
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:48,493
- Everyone was looking for you.
- Everyone?

266
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,793
But she has no family.

267
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:53,753
That's not true, she has a son
and two grandchildren.

268
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:55,713
I don't know them.

269
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,053
I don't know him.

270
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,263
Don't make a fool of me,
I'm Kin, your neighbour.

271
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,973
I don't know him.

272
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:11,983
She's won five million yen.

273
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:17,023
You're joking!
She made me kill a rabbit.

274
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:21,823
When no one talks to her,
she tells lies and steals.

275
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:29,203
At first when she was arrested,
we used to go along and bail her out.

276
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:33,833
But she enjoyed that.
That's why she stole things.

277
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:39,423
She'd steal tissues, ladies' shoes
or children's clothes.

278
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:45,473
She stole something again
only the other day.

279
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,553
It's no good, Grandma.

280
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:52,813
Cry "Wolf! Wolf!" and it will work
once, but not twice.

281
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:58,363
So this time she's cooked up another
story about winning the lottery.

282
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:04,653
She's a good-for-nothing old woman.

283
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:24,803
An old bag of bones.
A useless old grandmother.

284
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:36,813
A useless old grandmother!
A bag of bones.

285
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:55,703
I'm not going home.
I'm not going back.

286
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:07,033
- A noodle stall?
- That's right.

287
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:09,413
What will you do with it?

288
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:12,583
I want my father to go back to work.

289
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:14,413
With the noodle stall?

290
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:20,173
Yes. He used to push a stall around
selling Chinese noodles.

291
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:24,303
I'd like him to go back to it.

292
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:29,763
You'll find a stall easily enough.

293
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:32,933
You're very good to your father...

294
00:32:33,773 --> 00:32:36,733
...buying him a stall with your money.

295
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:39,313
It's not out of affection.

296
00:32:41,153 --> 00:32:44,863
I just want my father
to earn his own living.

297
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:49,073
I'm tired of having to
feed him like I do.

298
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:56,003
Wait inside, I'll just finish off.

299
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:57,713
Can I take a shower?

300
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:02,713
All the same, isn't it love?

301
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,473
I have nothing to do with my family.

302
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:09,053
I don't even remember them any more.

303
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:16,353
When the family fulfilled different
functions it still had some meaning:

304
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,863
Economic, hierarchical, educational...

305
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:26,193
...recreational, protective,
and religious.

306
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:31,453
But now the State and society
have taken over those functions.

307
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:34,083
All that's left is affection.

308
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:40,423
Blood ties are still at
the heart of it all.

309
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:44,713
They're the most clannish thing.

310
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,093
Maybe I'm not at the bottom line yet.

311
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:51,143
I still dream about my father.

312
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:55,063
You just need time, that's all.

313
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:03,523
What's up?

314
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:06,863
Nothing.

315
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,323
I envy you, Mr Omi.

316
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:57,493
Come over here. We'll make a threesome.

317
00:34:57,993 --> 00:34:59,793
Come on.

318
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:07,733
- It's a present.
- Really?

319
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:10,693
- We're both going to fly.
- Where do you get on?

320
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:12,743
There, but don't tell Omi.

321
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:18,993
I've been in this plane before.
I've already flown in it.

322
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:23,123
Don't say a word to Mr. Omi.

323
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:28,253
- It won't fly.
- It will fly.

324
00:36:28,463 --> 00:36:30,753
Liar! Liar!

325
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:53,403
I hope you can get me some nice soap.

326
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:04,143
Can anybody give me a towel?

327
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,493
No response at all!

328
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,543
Where did they all go?
What to do...

329
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:17,913
A scholar, a cute boy, a lawyer,
a driver... Just someone!

330
00:37:18,743 --> 00:37:21,273
And even the owner here is gay.

331
00:37:23,183 --> 00:37:25,433
How terrible!

332
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,523
Hey, shave me a bit, shave me!

333
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:39,203
Hey you, murderous little devil!

334
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:40,803
I am telling you, little murderer!

335
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:43,033
Come here and shave me!

336
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:06,473
699, 700...

337
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:15,483
I've got no razor.

338
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,503
Then get tweezers.

339
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:22,073
They've been taken away, too.

340
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:28,573
Oh poor me!
What are we gonna do then?

341
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:31,493
Maybe you'd better not ask about it.

342
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:34,303
You know, I am really good with cooking.

343
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:43,793
Don't tell me that's what you're gonna do.
Even reading books is better.

344
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:47,193
- Iwanami Library of Classics, you know...
- Iwanami?

345
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:49,483
I've been reading Snow White again.

346
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,523
Yeah, it's so close to your heart!

347
00:38:53,533 --> 00:39:01,353
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all?

348
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:03,923
Yeah, it's me!

349
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:11,273
Hey, tell me, what is
my fairest feature?

350
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:16,673
Didn't you promise to wash my
cute underwear in the bathroom?

351
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:19,063
Why didn't you?

352
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:23,553
Is our nuisance of a landlord spraying
insecticide again? That stinking bastard.

353
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:32,403
He killed them again.
How tragic.

354
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:42,573
Whenever my body enters warm suds,
I feel immersed in dazzling radiance!

355
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:45,573
There is no way to avoid it.

356
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,573
I've always kept an account
of all the fish I fry.

357
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:52,963
I've already fried...

358
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,843
...more then 700 of them.

359
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:06,593
Someone is calling again.

360
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:20,183
It can't be... A visitor?

361
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,613
What a surprise.

362
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:31,113
Is this kid a visitor? What should we do?

363
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:34,623
What should we do? Make him come over!

364
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:48,233
Does he even know where he is?

365
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:52,473
I hope he doesn't think
it's an educational institution.

366
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:56,463
He must have been in trouble
with the world.

367
00:40:56,463 --> 00:41:00,303
I wonder if he wants us to use
our hands or our mouths?

368
00:41:00,303 --> 00:41:02,273
Look at his wide-open eyes!

369
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:04,903
How cute!

370
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:10,383
There are no men or women here.

371
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:12,523
As long as there is a body...

372
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:16,433
It's gonna be like this!

373
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:03,833
Setsuko! Is Setsuko there?

374
00:42:04,753 --> 00:42:06,963
I've brought you a rabbit.

375
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,473
I don't need it any more.

376
00:42:10,973 --> 00:42:12,843
You wanted one so badly.

377
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:16,973
- I'm not a child any more.
- It cost me 1,200 yen!

378
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:20,273
Go away, I want to change.

379
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,523
Go away! And shut the door!

380
00:42:41,963 --> 00:42:44,833
When I'm a whore...

381
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:52,933
...I'll buy a huge bar of soap...

382
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:59,773
...to wash the boy I love.

383
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:21,503
When I grow up to be a whore...

384
00:43:22,793 --> 00:43:26,963
...I'll leave the door open...

385
00:43:29,383 --> 00:43:34,133
...so the swallows can come in
from the sea.

386
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:56,703
How many days does it make now...

387
00:43:58,163 --> 00:43:59,583
...since Grandma left?

388
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:02,293
Stop fretting.

389
00:44:03,663 --> 00:44:06,713
- Where's she gone?
- Is your football OK?

390
00:44:07,963 --> 00:44:11,633
You have to keep up with the training.

391
00:44:12,343 --> 00:44:14,553
Guts - that's what it takes.

392
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:16,763
Father...

393
00:44:18,893 --> 00:44:21,103
Don't you want to go back
on the noodle stall?

394
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:23,853
Never mind me, just worry about yourself.

395
00:44:28,353 --> 00:44:34,363
If you're not going to school any more
you have to find a job.

396
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:42,493
No, just give me back the 2,000 yen
I lent you.

397
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,043
To do what?

398
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,253
I want to buy a pair of trousers.

399
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:50,833
That's it.

400
00:44:51,593 --> 00:44:56,013
One way in and two ways out -
that's a pair of trousers.

401
00:44:57,053 --> 00:45:01,933
I thought it was going to be
something intellectual.

402
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:05,853
But it's just a pair of trousers.
Stupid, isn't it?

403
00:45:10,693 --> 00:45:11,613
Where are you off to?

404
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:39,933
You've been sending notes
to that girl recently.

405
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:41,943
- I dumped her a long time ago.
- A long time ago?

406
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:42,903
Really!

407
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:44,943
If you did, how come you're
still seeing her?

408
00:45:44,973 --> 00:45:45,913
It doesn't matter.

409
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,943
- What do you mean?
- I've already found another one.

410
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,913
- You're such a slut!
- What?

411
00:45:50,953 --> 00:45:52,953
Who cares how good those chicks are!

412
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,073
Where's Chikara?

413
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,113
Haven't you heard?

414
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,823
There've been rumours.

415
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:03,493
The police were round.

416
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:06,623
Why? What could he have done?

417
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:09,453
Something political.

418
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:13,173
An American soldier was wounded.

419
00:46:13,383 --> 00:46:17,383
- He's had it.
- That's too pessimistic.

420
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:26,053
- Is Mr. Omi there?
- No, he's at home.

421
00:46:44,573 --> 00:46:51,573
THE CITY IS AN OPEN BOOK.
WRITE ON ITS INFINITE MARGINS!

422
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:22,663
How many times have you
argued with your father?

423
00:47:23,873 --> 00:47:28,553
Have you ever tried to make your
father earn his own living?

424
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:29,483
What?

425
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:34,503
If I wanted this, I'd make my father
set up a stall in the street.

426
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:39,763
After the war, my father had a
noodle stall, but then he closed it.

427
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:43,493
And now he isn't doing anything.

428
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:48,193
So, one of my friends is selling a
cheap stall, and I decided to buy it.

429
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:51,283
With this, I want to get my dad
back in the noodle business.

430
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:53,953
That's my plan.

431
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:59,493
Even though it's just a stall,
I think that if I get it going...

432
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:03,663
...and keep encouraging my dad,
it can't go wrong.

433
00:48:03,663 --> 00:48:06,973
If it's cheap, people will
come and buy it.

434
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:08,343
What do you think?

435
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:11,193
You seem quite confident.

436
00:48:11,643 --> 00:48:13,523
Where are the two of you going?

437
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:16,363
You look happy.

438
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:20,783
Don't go. It's not worth seeing.

439
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:22,243
Don't you think?

440
00:48:28,503 --> 00:48:31,383
- Where are you off to?
- What do you want?

441
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:35,303
There's nothing to see down that way.

442
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:56,243
What are you looking at?
There's nothing to look at.

443
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:05,243
He looks so stupid in that red shirt.

444
00:49:24,813 --> 00:49:26,973
Bloody fool.

445
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:32,023
Where's he going?

446
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:36,983
You're either sad or you're cheerful.

447
00:49:37,363 --> 00:49:42,823
I've got too much up my sleeve
to go anywhere.

448
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,123
You can't beat that.

449
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:49,503
You can't beat anything.

450
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:14,213
- Who is it?
- It's me.

451
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:16,073
What's happened?

452
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,653
Nothing special.

453
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:22,863
So what do you want?

454
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:30,083
- I can't live like this any more.
- What are you on about?

455
00:50:33,173 --> 00:50:34,293
Have you left home?

456
00:50:37,843 --> 00:50:38,803
Have you beaten your father up?

457
00:50:40,923 --> 00:50:43,093
Or have you sold the old woman?

458
00:50:45,093 --> 00:50:47,053
No, you can't do anything.

459
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:53,523
The most you can do is
to clean that pigsty.

460
00:50:59,193 --> 00:51:01,693
I want to go to America.

461
00:51:04,243 --> 00:51:09,623
How much money do you need
to get to America?

462
00:51:10,493 --> 00:51:13,083
You can push your
noodle stall to America.

463
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:18,793
Please open up.

464
00:51:21,213 --> 00:51:23,093
I want to pay you for the stall.

465
00:51:24,473 --> 00:51:28,763
I'll open the door if you like,
but you'll be shocked.

466
00:51:30,313 --> 00:51:33,483
- Why?
- I've got a woman in here.

467
00:51:36,983 --> 00:51:40,983
If that's all it is,
I'm already quite used to it.

468
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:46,993
Mr. Omi...

469
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:52,493
Open the door.

470
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:56,713
OK, come in.

471
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:06,093
What's going on, Setsuko?

472
00:52:06,973 --> 00:52:09,053
I'm going to live here.

473
00:52:11,353 --> 00:52:13,473
He said I can live here.

474
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:19,363
I've learned to make pot-au-feu.

475
00:52:20,153 --> 00:52:21,863
I can cook anything now.

476
00:52:27,783 --> 00:52:31,873
- And Reiko? Don't you love her any more?
- I love her as well.

477
00:52:33,703 --> 00:52:36,163
Let's go home. He's using you.

478
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:38,623
Come on!

479
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:41,383
You're making a mistake.

480
00:52:42,343 --> 00:52:43,963
Don't upset me!

481
00:52:45,093 --> 00:52:46,013
We're going home.

482
00:52:47,383 --> 00:52:49,553
Go away! Go on!

483
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:52,103
Leave me alone!

484
00:52:57,813 --> 00:53:01,693
Father, what good is history?

485
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:04,573
Explain it to me.

486
00:53:06,073 --> 00:53:08,533
That's how the book started.

487
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:11,703
What book?

488
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:15,163
Don't make fun of me.

489
00:53:16,003 --> 00:53:19,163
We can only live through what we do...

490
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:23,213
Through the way that we act.

491
00:53:24,923 --> 00:53:26,263
It was too late.

492
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:31,053
I hid in the cinema toilets.

493
00:53:32,593 --> 00:53:34,473
A cop followed me.

494
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:40,103
He shone his torch to
find me in the dark.

495
00:53:40,943 --> 00:53:44,443
I can't go home any more.

496
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:50,953
It was like...

497
00:53:52,243 --> 00:53:54,073
Suddenly, I remembered something.

498
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:58,453
I'd left a new shirt in the
airing cupboard at home.

499
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:05,423
I was going to wear that shirt to go
down to the Tanaka workshop.

500
00:54:07,253 --> 00:54:10,673
If they'd taken me on,
I'd have been a worker.

501
00:54:11,473 --> 00:54:14,973
I could have been a simple
"stay-at-home."

502
00:54:17,223 --> 00:54:22,143
The film will be over soon,
and no one will remember me.

503
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,023
When it ends...

504
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:27,233
...only the white screen remains.

505
00:54:31,243 --> 00:54:32,783
The white screen.

506
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:43,463
Who said "Everyone will be
world-famous for 15 minutes?"

507
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:49,673
All that's left to show are these dozens
of men disappearing with this film.

508
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:53,843
And this blank screen.

509
00:54:55,643 --> 00:54:57,433
I've got no home.

510
00:54:58,103 --> 00:54:59,353
I've got no country.

511
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,773
There's no world for me.

512
00:55:03,443 --> 00:55:05,693
None of that existed
right from the start.

513
00:55:07,403 --> 00:55:12,403
Alone, without any family,
only photographs count.

514
00:55:13,073 --> 00:55:17,873
With a photo in my hand,
I draw "Auld Lang Syne."

515
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:20,163
My "Auld Lang Syne."

516
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:40,313
When I was at school, I picked up
a little lizard in the park.

517
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:49,903
I kept it in a cola bottle
and it grew too large to come out.

518
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:54,323
A lizard in a cola bottle!

519
00:55:55,573 --> 00:55:57,743
A lizard in a cola bottle!

520
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:05,293
You don't have the strength
to get out! Do you, Japan?

521
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:07,373
Do you, Japan?

522
00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:12,343
The perpetual humiliation is
bubbling in the Korean Straits!

523
00:56:12,923 --> 00:56:16,223
Is it worthwhile dying for my country?

524
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:02,683
What is it?
Just look at him!

525
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,683
What's up with you?

526
00:58:06,913 --> 00:58:10,463
Let go! This stall is mine.

527
00:58:14,173 --> 00:58:18,843
It's my stall! I bought it
with my own savings!

528
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:33,563
- It's mine, I tell you!
- You stole it!

529
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:41,613
- You stole it!
- We can prove that it's stolen!

530
00:58:58,383 --> 00:59:01,973
You stole it, father! You fool!

531
00:59:31,663 --> 00:59:34,163
You bloody fool!

532
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:39,843
You fool! Let go! Let go of me!

533
00:59:53,683 --> 00:59:55,643
You fool! You fool!

534
01:01:30,623 --> 01:01:32,043
Turn on the lights.

535
01:01:35,423 --> 01:01:36,833
The film ends here.

536
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:40,343
Now it's my turn to speak.

537
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:45,933
When you think about it...

538
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:50,813
...a film can only live in the dark.

539
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:53,933
When the lights go up like that...

540
01:01:54,393 --> 01:01:57,603
...the world of the film is blotted out.

541
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:03,613
In this film I dreamed of
the human aeroplane.

542
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:10,083
After the shooting, when
I got back to my room...

543
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:13,293
...with all my moaning and groaning...

544
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:15,293
...I dreamed...

545
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:20,213
...I dreamed of the human aeroplane.

546
01:02:21,883 --> 01:02:22,883
I wonder why.

547
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:29,223
And bit by bit, while that went on,
the line between life and film disappeared.

548
01:02:30,603 --> 01:02:32,933
I no longer know what I've become.

549
01:02:33,523 --> 01:02:35,313
And in my dreams...

550
01:02:36,023 --> 01:02:38,813
...I was falling and falling...

551
01:02:39,653 --> 01:02:42,023
I don't know why.

552
01:02:42,733 --> 01:02:47,613
But even if I don't understand,
I did fall.

553
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:52,493
And as I was falling I thought:

554
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:58,293
"There's nothing to hold on to."
That's why I was falling.

555
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:06,263
Scene 1

556
01:03:07,303 --> 01:03:10,473
Kominato, Hiranai

557
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:14,103
Higashi-Tsugaru, Aomori, Eimei Sasaki.

558
01:03:15,103 --> 01:03:19,563
This is me speaking,
after the clapper board goes.

559
01:03:21,023 --> 01:03:24,733
I speak words written by other people,
in other people's speech.

560
01:03:26,493 --> 01:03:32,493
And while the camera turns,
I call Mr. Saito "father."

561
01:03:33,953 --> 01:03:38,463
But bit by bit it becomes real.

562
01:03:39,003 --> 01:03:42,503
And Mr. Saito really becomes "father."

563
01:03:42,713 --> 01:03:45,553
Then someone says "Cut!"

564
01:03:46,963 --> 01:03:48,763
"Next scene."

565
01:03:49,343 --> 01:03:51,803
"Hurry up!"   "Action."

566
01:03:52,223 --> 01:03:57,143
That's how it is. And you go on
to the next scene.

567
01:03:57,393 --> 01:04:00,103
The next scene begins with another lie.

568
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,773
The lie of lies.

569
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:05,653
And between one "cut" and another...

570
01:04:06,193 --> 01:04:11,743
...I am caught up under
the cold February sky.

571
01:04:11,993 --> 01:04:15,583
This fantasy takes hold of me bit by bit.

572
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:24,463
I can't go home on the screen any more.

573
01:04:26,213 --> 01:04:31,423
Polanski, Nagisa Oshima, Antonioni...

574
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:38,183
All that is a world that disappears
when the lights go up.

575
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:44,193
You just try showing a film
in broad daylight...

576
01:04:44,693 --> 01:04:46,363
...on the wall of a building.

577
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,533
Goodbye.

578
01:04:51,443 --> 01:04:52,953
I won't be back.

579
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:57,993
A family for 28 days' shooting.

580
01:04:58,373 --> 01:05:01,793
A State only 28 days old.

581
01:05:03,043 --> 01:05:05,173
A father just for 28 days.

582
01:05:06,383 --> 01:05:09,713
28 days of disillusion and anger.

583
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:13,433
28 days of ashes and hope.

584
01:05:15,223 --> 01:05:20,143
I'm taking off my costume
and moving on somewhere else.

585
01:05:21,773 --> 01:05:24,273
A human aeroplane for only 28 days.

586
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:27,903
A Tokyo life 28 days long.

587
01:05:33,073 --> 01:05:34,993
I loved Humphrey Bogart.

588
01:05:56,383 --> 01:05:57,893
I loved Cinemascope...

589
01:05:59,553 --> 01:06:00,473
...town shooting...

590
01:06:01,893 --> 01:06:03,773
...love scenes...

591
01:06:05,393 --> 01:06:07,103
I loved Mr. Sukita, the cameraman...

592
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:11,613
...Mr. Terayama, the director;
Mr. Usui, the assistant.

593
01:06:11,783 --> 01:06:15,403
I loved the whole of that world,
but I don't love the cinema.

594
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:21,623
Goodbye.

595
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,503
Goodbye, cinema.

596
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,793
Goodbye.
