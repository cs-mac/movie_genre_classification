1
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,200
VENUS IN FUR

2
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
VENUS IN FUR
AUDITION HERE

3
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,940
No! Someone like that doesn't exist!

4
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,220
A young woman, sexy, expressive,
of classic education

5
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
and some spark of brains...

6
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,660
No one is able to pronounce
"inextricable" without vocal coaching.

7
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,500
Listen...

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,060
Honey, back then a woman of Wanda's age

9
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,660
already had a husband,
five kids and tuberculosis.

10
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,020
She was a woman.

11
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,740
Today they all talk like kids on helium:

12
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,300
"Hey, that's freaky,

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,180
absolutely phat, ey!"

14
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,980
I only saw 35 chicks,

15
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,700
dressed like hookers or dikes.

16
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,100
I would make a better Wanda.

17
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,500
I'd only need a dress and
some stockings. Hello?

18
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,540
Honey?

19
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,460
Damn! Hello?

20
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,260
Knock, knock!

21
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,420
Am I too late?

22
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,860
Fuck, I'm too late.

23
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,460
Fuck it.
- "Venus in Fur"? They're all gone.

24
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,060
I'm sorry, I came from
the other side of Paris.

25
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,180
Cell batteries are dead and my heel
got stuck in a ventilation grille.

26
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,580
Then this creep in the subway...
Why am I telling you this?

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,100
He rubbed himself against me
all the way. Then the thunderstorm.

28
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,460
Fuck it! It's not my day!

29
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,700
Nutty fucking shit!

30
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,220
There's Valium in the meds cabinet.
Should I...

31
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,220
It's ok. It's always the same.
Thank you Lord for making my life easy.

32
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,100
By the way: I am Vanda Jordan.

33
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,500
Vanda?

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,300
There you go. I even have
the right name.

35
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,300
Or do you know a lot of Vandas?

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,220
I'm perfect for that role!
But the train got stuck

37
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,940
while someone was trying to fuck
me from behind. Who are you?

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,580
Thomas Novachek.
- Pleasant.

39
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,740
Hey, one moment...
aren't you the author?

40
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,780
Yes... no...
I adapted it for the stage.

41
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,700
So you're the director too?
- Certainly!

42
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,140
I love your plays. The ones I know.
"Anatomy of Shadows"...

43
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,380
Awesome, I read it twice.
- That's no play of mine.

44
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm so dumb. I meant the other one.

45
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,460
That's embarassing.

46
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,340
Anyway. This play is marvellous.
At least what I read of it.

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,700
Quite hot. Sexy I would say.

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,500
Erotic, if someone's into submission
and stuff like that.

49
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,020
Leather and collar is
usually not my style.

50
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,780
I am more low-key.

51
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,780
But it helps me getting into the role.

52
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,380
The play is about sadomasochism,
isn't it?

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,140
Not quite. It takes place in 1870.

54
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,100
Got it!
That doesn't really look 1870ish.

55
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,540
No.
- But maybe they already dressed

56
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,940
like that back then?
- Who knows?

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,140
I got a photo and a CV.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,820
Where is it? Ah, there you are.

59
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,180
Thanks.

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,700
It's a bit short, but I am good and
would be perfect for that role.

61
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,540
They say I've been awesome
playing Hedda Gabler.

62
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,860
Theater at the Urinal? I must have
missed that venue's last season.

63
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,020
Did you have an appointment?
- Yes, 14:15 o'clock.

64
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,700
I'm a bit late, I know.

65
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,300
Vanda who?
- Jordan, Vanda.

66
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,180
I'm always asked:
"Is that a stage name?"

67
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,820
I can't find you on that list.

68
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,100
Really? My agent told me
that everything's arranged.

69
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,380
Am I really not on that list? 14:15?
- Please...

70
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,900
Fuck!
Thanks again oh Lord. Well...

71
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,220
Now that I'm here...
- Wait, what are you doing?

72
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,620
I even have a costume!

73
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,500
No.

74
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,660
Just a sec, I've got an awesome dress...
- Nonessential!

75
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,140
What? You won't let me audition?
- No, I won't let you audition.

76
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,420
But we could try.

77
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,540
No one's here to play your partner.
- So I'll play it with you.

78
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,300
Would be an honor to play
it with the author.

79
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,420
Adaptationer.
- That would be cool.

80
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,380
To play it with the adaptationer.
- Stop it!

81
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,180
To be honest Mademoiselle...
- Vanda.

82
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,660
We're looking for
someone a bit different.

83
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,220
What are you looking for?
- Someone with a bit more...

84
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,820
I see. Save your troubles.
Someone unlike me.

85
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,220
I'm too small, too tall, too old,
too young. My CV is too short.

86
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,340
I got it.

87
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,820
Listen...
- This really gets on me!

88
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,260
It's not that bad.
- It's not fair.

89
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,780
This really gets on me.

90
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,700
After a fucking day like that...

91
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,260
There will be new auditions soon.

92
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,820
But I'm here now.
So I won't have to come back.

93
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,140
Listen Vanda.
I had a hard day.

94
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,420
Only blanks auditioned.
One with braces.

95
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,140
It would be a bad moment.
I need to relax

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,620
and I am awaited for dinner.
- For dinner, right?

97
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,140
When I'm relaxed it's going
to be better.

98
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,100
Thanks for coming. I salute
your awesome costume.

99
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,860
We'll meet soon.
- I doubt that, but thanks.

100
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,940
You seen to be nice.
It's just that silly fucking job.

101
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,260
Not to mention the 30 Euros spent
for that fucking dress.

102
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,060
Doesn't it look like 1800 something?
- Yes, just like 18... something.

103
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,140
That fits.
All the way Vanda.

104
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,500
A loose dress because they all
despised their asses back then.

105
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,340
That's a misconception. Women back then...
- Look how the dress suits me!

106
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,140
Be nice!

107
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,940
Yes!
- Thank you!

108
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
The line broke...

109
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,660
No!

110
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,700
No, I'm talking to someone
who just entered.

111
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,340
I'll buy Sushi on my way home, ok?

112
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,580
Would you help me with that?

113
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,540
Thomas Novachek himself

114
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,820
will speak the dialogue with me!
- That won't make it easier for you.

115
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm not an actor.
- You're perfect.

116
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,100
Ideal for the role of Kowalski.
- Kusiemski!

117
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,620
You are Kusiemski.
- Not quite.

118
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,340
At your service Sir.

119
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,300
Where do we start?
You decide.

120
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,340
First scene.

121
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,820
Got your dialogue?

122
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,620
It's a little worn.

123
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,300
Who gave you the complete text?
- I don't know.

124
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,660
My agent.
- How did he obtain it?

125
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,620
What's the problem? Is it top secret?
Ain't I supposed to see it?

126
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,340
Never mind.

127
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,540
Did you read it?
- Yes, I ran over it on the train.

128
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,900
I got that is it based on something.
Maybe Lou Reed's song "Venus in Furs"?

129
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,900
It's based on an austrian
novel, "Venus in Furs"

130
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,260
by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch.

131
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,060
I bet you read it in austrian!

132
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,140
That might be.

133
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,340
The book caused a scandal in 1870.

134
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,460
No wonder.
Essentially it's sado-maso-porn.

135
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,340
It's not.
- You don't consider it pornographic?

136
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,660
Not at all! Considering the fact that
it was written in medieval times...

137
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,100
"Venus in Furs" is a most beautiful
love-story, a true gem in world literature.

138
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,980
Really? For me it's porn.

139
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,100
Being an actress I'm familiar
with sadomasochism.

140
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,540
"Masochism" stems from "Sacher-Masoch",
because of that book.

141
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,420
Masochism, Masoch,
I should have recognized that.

142
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,700
So he gave a name to
sadomasochism. Cool.

143
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,620
That was not his aim.
- Of course.

144
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,140
He thought he was writing something
serious, but all others called it porn.

145
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,820
And you transcribed from him.
- Adapted!

146
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,820
I invented dialogs and situations.

147
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,780
A lot of me is in there.
- Brilliant!

148
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,500
Where does it take place?

149
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,620
It takes place in a tavern

150
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,300
in a secluded part of Austria-Hungary.

151
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,140
Austria-Hungary...
Please help me.

152
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,460
It's complicated.
- So it's a marvellous tavern?

153
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,340
Yes, hot springs for rich people.

154
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,740
Extravagant. As the curtain rises

155
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,140
Kusiemski is reading in his room
and drinks his morning coffee.

156
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,340
Then: knock, knock. Entrance Wanda.

157
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,580
And that's "symbolic" for the character?
That he is reading?

158
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,620
There are still people left who read.
Actually real books made of paper.

159
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,940
Even today.
- Ouch! Bull's eye.

160
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,180
So, this guy... What's his name?
Sevran, Savrine...

161
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,980
Severin von Kusiemski.

162
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,420
Exactly? What's he like?
What tics does he have?

163
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,740
Give me some adjectives...
something!

164
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,700
Rich, idler, typical for that time,
smart, well-travelled, educated...

165
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,340
Intellectual.
- If you prefer it that way.

166
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,300
"If you prefer it that way"! Awesome!
When did I hear that the last time?

167
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,460
I don't know...
- So he's distinguished, like you.

168
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,580
Aren't we going to talk about her?
- I know her inside out,

169
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,300
but if you want.

170
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,340
In many ways she's a typical
woman of her time

171
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,620
despite the principles she pretends to.

172
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,180
Despite what?
- The principles she pretends to.

173
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,820
At first she seems accurate,
self-confident, cultivated...

174
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,340
Duh! What else?
Something I don't already know!

175
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,860
Something...?
It's ok. Doesn't matter.

176
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm alright!

177
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,900
May I change the lightning?

178
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,700
What's wrong with it?
- A bit exaggerated, don't you think?

179
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,620
Make yourself at home.

180
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,780
Isn't it better like that?

181
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,420
Not bad.
- Wait.

182
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,020
I wouldn't know which button to hit.

183
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,980
Right.

184
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,460
It's much better now.

185
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,260
That's the sofa I assume?

186
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,540
Yes, that's the sofa.

187
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,020
A desk.

188
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,820
The book she's returning to him.

189
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,340
A postcard... brilliant!

190
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,220
What's that?

191
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,500
A phallic symbol?
- Leftovers of the last play.

192
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,420
A belgian production...

193
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,300
The western "Ringo" as a musical...

194
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,540
Where should I stand?

195
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,820
Wherever you like.

196
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,740
Not that centered.

197
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,820
More to the left or to the right,
seen from the audience? - More left!

198
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,140
Should we read the
dialogue in advance?

199
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,140
No, let's do it! Until where?

200
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,980
Until the end of page 3.
- And then you'll kick me out?

201
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,620
Let's start for a beginning.
- And after that I get kicked out.

202
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,140
It comes to my mind...

203
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,380
That sentence on page 0,

204
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,180
that citation...

205
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,140
The epigraph?
- Exactly.

206
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,180
"Almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath
delivered him into the hands of a woman."

207
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,140
That's a citation from the novel.
It stems from the Book of Judith.

208
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,980
From the bible?
- The biblical Apocrypha, yes.

209
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,620
I don't know. Don't you
consider that sexist?

210
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,180
"Almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath
delivered him into the hands of a woman."

211
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,380
I only cite the book.
- But you put it on page 0.

212
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,620
No offence, it doesn't matter.
I'm just an actress, but...

213
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,900
I forgot my fur. She's wearing
a stole made of fur, right?

214
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,340
That's correct.

215
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,580
Fur... Fur...
pillowy fur...

216
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,700
Exactly.
- Maybe it's not...

217
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,300
The seething sea ceaseth and thus
the seething sea sufficeth us.

218
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,180
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

219
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,660
I'm waiting.

220
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,620
Betty Botter bought a bit of butter.

221
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,260
Knock, knock!
- Come in.

222
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,180
Herr Doctor Severin von Kusiemski?

223
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm sorry to disturb you.

224
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,540
My name is Wanda von Dunajew.

225
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,220
I inhabit the room above yours.

226
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Yesterday evening I found this book...

227
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,140
a copy of "Faust"

228
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,700
with your book plate

229
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,660
while sitting under the birch tree
next to the statue of Venus.

230
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,100
Thank you very much.

231
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,380
I've informed the
chambermaid this instant.

232
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,700
I would have sent it to you

233
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,820
but it contains a quite daring postcard.

234
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,220
A Tizian, isn't it?

235
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,540
Yes. "Venus with the Mirror",
one of my favorite paintings.

236
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,140
Your Venus is worn out...

237
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,940
just as your book.

238
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,180
Is she faithful?

239
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,100
Pardon?
- To the original?

240
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,860
Yes, it's an exact copy.

241
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,860
I comprehend your fascination.
A charming painting.

242
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,500
Thank you for bringing it back.

243
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,580
I couldn't miss that strange
poem on the back cover.

244
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,500
"To Venus in Fur".
Did you write it?

245
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,020
Those are just doggerel verses.

246
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,900
Doggerel... really?

247
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,020
To love, to be loved

248
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,900
what fortune

249
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,980
and yet it's brilliance fades

250
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,220
against the dolorous joy

251
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,980
of worshipping a woman
making us her toy

252
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,740
to be the slave of a beautiful tyrant

253
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,300
that rides roughshod over us

254
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,060
my goddess, my dictatorship
my Venus in Fur.

255
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,140
Interesting perception!

256
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,060
In your place I would

257
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,700
take proper care of this bookmark.

258
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,780
I appreciate your discretion.

259
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,460
Would you care to sit down,
Ms. Dunajew?

260
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,060
Thank you.

261
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,540
May I take your fur?
- That's very kind of you.

262
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,020
A tartar fur, right?

263
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,500
Caucasian sable,
presumably from Kazakhstan.

264
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,260
Caucasian sable
from Kazakhstan, exactly.

265
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,620
Kusiemski stares at the fur
in his hands.

266
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,460
But you are trembeling,
Mr. Kusiemski!

267
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,900
Please forgive me.

268
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,780
Would you care for a drink?

269
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,140
Gladly. Coffee would be wonderful.

270
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,980
Take some of mine.
- How kind of you.

271
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,900
Two cubes of sugar, please.
- He pours the coffee.

272
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,780
I hope my heels don't cause to
much noise up there?

273
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,380
Not at all.

274
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,380
Walk your heels as much as you like.

275
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,460
So you're a poet, Mr. Kusiemski.

276
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,020
During my idle hours.
- And a fancier of fur.

277
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
The love for fur is...

278
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,300
I skip that passage.
- No, read it!

279
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,380
The love for fur is
inherent in all of us.

280
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,500
A constitutional passion.

281
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,700
Please try a little harder!

282
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,140
The love for fur is
inherent in all of us.

283
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,060
To caress a mellow fur is
a constitutional passion...

284
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,980
to sense that peculiar titillation,
that elextricity...

285
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,020
I don't know why but within you it
seems more than a gift of nature.

286
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,660
Maybe your mother enwrapped you
in sable when you were a baby.

287
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,020
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.

288
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,860
Actually...

289
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,140
one of my aunts nourished
a real passion for fur.

290
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,380
That explains everything.

291
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,940
We are all quite easily allegeable
yet inextricable.

292
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,140
"Inextricable"? What do you mean?
- Life transforms us to what we are...

293
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,980
We reached the end of page 3.

294
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,780
In fact, in fact.

295
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,420
That was good Vanda, really good.

296
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,340
I struggeled through it.

297
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,340
It didn't seem so.

298
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Well kid, that's called creating
atmosphere. I told you I'm a pro.

299
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,300
It was very good...

300
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,820
I'm blushing.
- Not perfect...

301
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,180
Of course.
- Let's go on a bit.

302
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,620
Kusiemski's lenghty monologue.
We jump to...

303
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,740
No, read it!
It helps me getting into character.

304
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,420
You're good, Thomas.
- I just pretend...

305
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,220
No, you're really good. Do you
have someone in mind for Kusiemski?

306
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,660
No, there are several options...

307
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,820
Do it yourself!
- Of course!

308
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,180
Seriously, you would be good.

309
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,340
It's hard to expect something
like that of actors...

310
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,500
You're the director.
It's your job to torture actors.

311
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,740
It's my first production.
- One couldn't tell.

312
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,620
Directors never understand anything.
What I've been through...

313
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,620
That's why you are perfect.
You know the direction.

314
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,820
I have a precise perception.

315
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,820
Alban Berg's "Lyrical Suite"
during transitions...

316
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,180
Brilliant!
- You know it?

317
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,020
No, but can you see what I mean?
You know the characters inside out.

318
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,740
As Kusiemski, and I say that
spontanously, you should...

319
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,060
try an accent or something like that.
- Yes, he's distinguished.

320
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,380
Distinguished, exactly.
- With a hint of...

321
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,260
of nobility, yes.

322
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,060
Is it adequately distinguished
if I express myself like that?

323
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,540
Or completely idiotic?
- No, a bit ludicrous, but brilliant.

324
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,380
You wouldn't have a robe
with you by any chance?

325
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,860
Sure!

326
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,140
I was kidding.
- Want to try it?

327
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,020
It'll help you.
It'll fit just perfect.

328
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,540
It's marvellous.

329
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,700
A historic robe?
- At least I was told it is.

330
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,260
"Siegfried Mueller,

331
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,260
Vienna,

332
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,180
1869."

333
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,260
I haven't seen that.

334
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,340
40 Euros, not bad, isn't it?

335
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,460
Awesome, like it was made for you!
How do you feel in it?

336
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,980
Very good. It fits just perfect.

337
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,580
You look hot in it.

338
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,820
Hi sweety!

339
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,100
How much was the collar?

340
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,340
It's from the time
I walked the streets.

341
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,060
Just kidding! Let's go a bit back.
That'll help you.

342
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,100
Maybe your mother enwrapped you
in sable when you were a baby.

343
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,420
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.

344
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,300
Actually one of my aunts nourished
a real passion for fur.

345
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,620
This is difficult for him.
- No wonder.

346
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,580
Well, then show it!

347
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,340
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.

348
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,300
Actually...

349
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,180
one of my aunts nourished
a real passion for fur.

350
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,740
That explains everything.

351
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,620
We are all quite easily
allegeable yet...

352
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,500
inextricable.

353
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,500
"Inextricable"?
What do you mean?

354
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,300
Life transforms us to what we are...

355
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,020
in an unforseen instant...

356
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,220
Do you like the coffee?

357
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,140
I've barely touched it,
but it's marvellous.

358
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,300
That's symbolic, right?

359
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,980
He's the coffee. She's barely touched
him, yet she's bowled by him already.

360
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,980
You see right
through me.

361
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,140
Did you experience such
an unforseen instant?

362
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,860
Yes. But I don't want
to bore you.

363
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,300
Not at all, it's gripping. Like one
of those english crime stories.

364
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm waiting for that mysterious
aunt with the passion for fur.

365
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,140
We can skip that really...
- No, I want to hear it.

366
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,420
I'm waiting for that mysterious
aunt with the passion for fur.

367
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,740
I was an infernal child.

368
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,660
Spoiled and cruel.
I tortured the domestics.

369
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,420
And our cat.

370
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,260
And I've been very unmannerly
towards one of my aunts.

371
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:24,060
The countess was an impressive woman,
voluptious and... eerie.

372
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,300
What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing.

373
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,260
To speak out loud those words
written at 2 o'clock in the morning

374
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,820
is something different.

375
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,420
You do it very well.
So, what did your aunt do?

376
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,220
One evening she took revenge.

377
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,660
She entered my room

378
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,980
dressed in her long, black coat
made of russian fox fur.

379
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,900
In her hand a birch freshly
cut from a birch tree.

380
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,820
The cook and the
kitchenmaid followed.

381
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,420
She took off her fur coat
and rolled up her sleeves.

382
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,420
I tried to escape,

383
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,660
but the other women grabbed me,

384
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,260
took down my trousers and
threw me onto the fur.

385
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,260
They held me while
my aunt chastised me,

386
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,860
with the birch.

387
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,780
My buttocks and
shanks burnt.

388
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,740
The maids urged her on.

389
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,420
They laughed at me,
called me a sniveller.

390
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,700
I bridled but my aunt
kept birching me

391
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,540
until I begged her to stop,

392
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,220
until I begged her to have mercy.

393
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,740
After she had stopped she forced
me to thank her on my knees.

394
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,420
She forced me to kiss her feet.

395
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,780
Then she left my room after
she warned me that she'll return.

396
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,500
All that in front of
our domestics

397
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,420
and our cat.

398
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,500
Since that instant for me fur
isn't just simple fur anymore

399
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,380
and a birch's
not just a twig.

400
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,300
In that short instant she
transformed me to what I am.

401
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,860
Did she return?

402
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,220
Yes, in my dreams, dressed in
black fur with a birch in hands.

403
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,540
She's coming every night.

404
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,500
My poor, poor friend.
- Poor?

405
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,620
She taught me the most
precious of all lessons.

406
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,380
What did she teach you?
- That there's nothing more sensual

407
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,380
than pain and nothing more
exciting than humiliation.

408
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,180
The countess did great work.

409
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,820
She became my ideal,
do you understand?

410
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,300
Since then I'm looking
for a woman like her

411
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,140
and when I meet her,
I'll marry her.

412
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,020
Thomas, that passage is brilliant.

413
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,420
Thanks. It was a lot of work.

414
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,060
So it basically is
a play about child-abuse.

415
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,820
Are you mad? What has
child-abuse to do with this?

416
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,860
Nowadays everything has to be attributed
to some fucking social problem!

417
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,340
Child-abuse is no...
- No, but please don't be that banal.

418
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,820
This is not anthropology or
sociology, but theater!

419
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,780
Yes, but nevertheless...
- It's about more than

420
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,180
physical punishment!
- All right, I'm sorry!

421
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,140
What depleted society are we in?

422
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,980
Why has everything to be
attributed to something?

423
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,700
What's next? Sexism...
racism... class struggle?

424
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,220
Without any doubt you
are unique, Mr. Kusiemski.

425
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,620
In your place I'd be cautious.

426
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,900
Maybe your ideal woman is more
atrocious than you wish for.

427
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,700
I'll take that risk.

428
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,620
I know what you are.
A hyper-sensualist.

429
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,140
An ascetic man of desire.

430
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,780
What about you, Ms. Wanda von Dunajew?
What or who are you?

431
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,020
I'm a heathen, which means that
I am young, beautiful and rich

432
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,700
and I want to relish it
as much as I can.

433
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,300
I won't waive anything.

434
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,900
I respect your principles.

435
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,420
Spare me your respect.

436
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,460
I'll love and delight the one
delighting me.

437
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,100
But only as long as he delights me.
After that I'll find another.

438
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,740
Nothing is more atrocious than
the infidelity of a woman.

439
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,340
For a woman there are
worse things: forced fidelity.

440
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,100
Can I move on the stage?
- Yes, of course.

441
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,860
In our society a woman only
has power through a man.

442
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,660
What will become of a woman
after she'll be equal to a man?

443
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,740
When she will become herself?

444
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,620
Little Wanda is quite
ahead of her time.

445
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,420
Vanda... Where did you
obtain the whole text?

446
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,220
I'm a quick learner.

447
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,060
You know everything by heart!

448
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,900
Haven't you said that Wanda is
very well adapted despite...

449
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,700
the priciples that she pretends to.
- Exactly.

450
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,540
You mean she doesn't believe in it?
- She talks about women's rights, bla...

451
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,460
Does "principles that she pretends to"
mean she's only staging something?

452
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,260
I want that alliteration:
"Priciples that she pretends to".

453
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,740
Got that. You sold your soul

454
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,540
for an alliteration.

455
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,580
I plead guilty.

456
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,100
Confidentially Thomas,
you're a bad boy.

457
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,980
If I may say so:

458
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,340
You are more than a heathen,
you are a goddess.

459
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,260
Really? Which one?
- Venus.

460
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,660
Is Wanda actually Venus
or am I just mad?

461
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,460
Venus took man-shape
to cause him a headache.

462
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,460
Not really...
That means: not quite...

463
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,020
Ok, I got it. That ambivalence
is intended, right?

464
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,820
Ambiguity.
- Exactly.

465
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,460
Actually it's like with the "bacchae".
- Right. What are the bacchae again?

466
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Just kidding.
An old play, right?

467
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,740
A very, very old play, yes.
- Citizens of Corinth!

468
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,700
Testikulus is in front of you,
a poor mortal man

469
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,500
cursed by the gods for his sins

470
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,260
and completely fucked up
until eternity!

471
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,300
A play like that?
- Yes, a play like that.

472
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,300
Dionysus comes to earth

473
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,900
and transforms the King of Thebes
to jell-o in womens garment.

474
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,260
Sounds hot.
- And the furious women of Thebes,

475
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,460
the bacchae, rip him to pieces.

476
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,460
Dionysus returns home triumphant.
- I think I know it.

477
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,580
But here it is Aphrodite and not Dionysus.
- Of course.

478
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,540
And she is...
- The greek version of Venus.

479
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,900
The same person?
- The same goddess.

480
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,060
All hail Aphrodite!

481
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,700
All hail Aphrodite!
Am I unbearably pedantic?

482
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,540
Yes, but it's sweet.

483
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,380
What do we do?

484
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,540
You seem to me
like a goddess.

485
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,300
Really?
Which one?

486
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,100
Venus.

487
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,860
But Venus can only command slaves.
- Then I shall look for one.

488
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,260
Do you wish to be my slave
Doctor Kusiemski?

489
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,780
I am already.

490
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,460
I am your slave since
you entered this room.

491
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,420
What?
Already in love with me?

492
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,780
Passionately. I suffer as if
I would have known you forever.

493
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,540
Subdue me!

494
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,860
Stand up and step aside.

495
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,540
I confess that you
fascinate me.

496
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,020
I like your honesty and
the clarity of your thoughts.

497
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,620
You're not unattractive
on the outside.

498
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,780
But I disturst men
subdueing themselves.

499
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,460
There is no trap.
Love me!

500
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,260
Can you see it?
You're giving me orders already.

501
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,100
Marry me.

502
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,100
I'm a frivolous woman,
Mr. Kusiemski.

503
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,860
To love me you have
to be very brave.

504
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,820
You know my priciples.

505
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,100
I don't care. I want to marry you.
- You don't know me.

506
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,380
Dominate me!
- That's absurd.

507
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,300
I bestow all power over me
upon you. Forever!

508
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,460
Unconditional. Do with
me what pleases you.

509
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,460
Dominate me.
Beat me if you long to.

510
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,620
Well, that's unexpected.

511
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,620
Place yourself right over there.

512
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
What?
- Move to the center... back there.

513
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,900
I like it here.
- No, go there! You take the power.

514
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,820
So you have to take
a powerful position.

515
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,140
Say it again.

516
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,220
Well, that's unexpected.

517
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,220
That doesn't work.
- Don't move. Try it.

518
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,420
I bestow all power over me
upon you. Forever!

519
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,180
Unconditional. Do with me
what pleases you. Dominate me.

520
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,060
Beat me if you long to.
- Well, that's unexpected.

521
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,860
You don't even try.

522
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,700
I stand where you want me to
and speak my lines.

523
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,820
It's only an audition.
- I want to see

524
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,460
if you're able
to be conducted.

525
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,100
So do as I tell you
and stay there.

526
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,060
I bestow all power over me
upon you. Forever!

527
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,660
Unconditional. Do with what
pleases you. Dominate me.

528
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,860
Beat me if you long to.
- Well, that's unexpected.

529
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,740
Right, that's better.
- Go on.

530
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,100
What's your deepest wish?
- To be your property.

531
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,300
To be taken up with your elevated
nature. To dress and undress you.

532
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,220
To hand you your stockings
and to put on your shoes.

533
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,220
To live without a will of my own.
- That's what you call love?

534
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,140
The only possible love.

535
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,340
In love and in politics only
one partner should reign.

536
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,460
One has to be the hammer
and the other one the anvil.

537
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,900
I'm willing to be the anvil.

538
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,060
I quit here.

539
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,700
No, go on, I love it!

540
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,780
Thomas, you really have some
knowledge on women.

541
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,020
You understand them.

542
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,460
The results of long
lasting studies.

543
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,780
Where was I?
- You were the anvil.

544
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,740
Wanda,

545
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,860
i'm looking for agony and
you're looking for pleasure.

546
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,380
Never let other people's
feelings dominate you.

547
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,860
Use your lover as
he would use you.

548
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,540
Dominate him, squeeze him out.
- You're incredible.

549
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,780
If not as a husband then please
accept me as your slave.

550
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,300
Be of divine atrocity.
- To the man that loves me?

551
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,180
I'd worship you even more.
- I don't want that.

552
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,900
All women long to be worshipped,
like God. Create me.

553
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,700
Ruin me. Crush me.

554
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,020
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,540
No, I haven't left yet.

556
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,140
No, everything's fine.

557
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,100
I don't know.
Quite soon I suppose.

558
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,020
I call you when I leave.

559
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,340
Love you too, sweetheart. Ciao.

560
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,420
All right.

561
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,060
I'm sorry.

562
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,100
The audition?
I don't know. We'll see.

563
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,460
I'm at the temp agency. Maybe
they have something for me.

564
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,660
As a typist. Nightshifts
in a lawer's office.

565
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,860
"The contract has to be ready
by tomorrow" and so on...

566
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,940
I don't know!

567
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,300
We'll see.
That's life.

568
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,380
That's life, right?
Bye!

569
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,100
Unbelievable.

570
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,700
Your better half?
- Is that expression still in use?

571
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,340
How'd you call "your better half" today?
- I don't know. "Asshole"?

572
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,020
I see.

573
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,620
You want to know why I lied?
- That's none of my business.

574
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,900
Like Wanda says it:
"I won't waive anything."

575
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,380
Other mothers do have
fuckable sons too.

576
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,140
You are the hammer and he is the anvil?
- What should I say?

577
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,220
"Suit yourself, honey"?
That's not love, only sex.

578
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,740
No dice for fucking alone.
That's what the play is about, right?

579
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,780
Is it?

580
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
You want to fool me?

581
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,540
I don't know. Do you believe?
- Don't act like that!

582
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,460
For once, tell me what you think.
One can't discutate like that.

583
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,580
You want some coffee?

584
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,780
What's wrong?
- Are you hitting at me, Tom?

585
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,500
Not at all. I simply
offer you some coffee.

586
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,820
Symbolic coffee?
- Not at all. Real coffee.

587
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,380
What would your wife think about
you offering me "real" coffeee?

588
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,740
I'm not married.
- No? I thought so. The call you got...

589
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,020
My fiancée.
- What would your fiancée think?

590
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,540
Didn't you say: "In theater there
are plenty of opportunities for sex."

591
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,180
You read that?

592
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,900
I was young.
My first interview.

593
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,220
Have you been married before?
- No, never.

594
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,300
Still living with your mother?

595
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,580
I'm not that eccentric.

596
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,420
Is fox fur your thing?
- No, love is my thing.

597
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,500
Then you're really eccentric.
- And my wife has to be my muse.

598
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,100
So the fiancée has wings and everything?
- Yes, in my perception of love

599
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,100
one has to devote oneself completely...
- You plunge into it.

600
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,660
Headfirst. With fireworks,
ecstasy and thunderbolts.

601
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,860
Coffee or no coffee?

602
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,900
Only as a slave I would subdue
myself to a man for my whole life.

603
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,260
We're not quite a match,
Mr. Kusienski.

604
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,900
We neutralize each other.
- We are made for each other.

605
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,100
Don't you feel it Wanda?

606
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,340
Don't you feel it too?

607
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,060
I'm offering you probation.
A contract. Just like in business.

608
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,460
One year. To prove that
you are the right one.

609
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,660
A year is long...
- Don't interrupt.

610
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,860
I beg you pardon.

611
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,460
I set up a contract binding you to
be my slave for one year.

612
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,940
So she's really prepared. I bet
she's planned it out beforehand.

613
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,460
You think so?
- Stop that. You're the author.

614
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,780
I'm not so sure if she has
"planned everything".

615
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,340
That's no affectation on my side.
- So you want ambivalence.

616
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,860
Ambiguity.
- Right.

617
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,420
Or she's just horny and
up for anything.

618
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,380
I never looked at it that way.
- Or it's even more eccentric:

619
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,620
Be my slave for one year. Then
you're allowed to fuck me. Ambivalence.

620
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,300
Ambiguity.

621
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,100
For me, so to speak for Kusiemski,
you may be his last, his sole chance.

622
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,500
Is that so? For what?
- To live.

623
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,060
He wants to know if she's into
whipping. He has her audition.

624
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,260
She has him audition too.
- He is perverted.

625
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,460
She's an object. Like all women
were around 1800 something.

626
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,020
What?

627
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,740
Who are you
Ms. Vanda Jordan?

628
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,460
I am a heathen...
- No, seriously.

629
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,460
You're hitting on me again.

630
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,140
What's your background?
Your history?

631
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,820
I'm a soldiers child,
raised here and there.

632
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,220
Where, which cities, which coutries?

633
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,980
I set up a contract binding you
to be my slave for one year.

634
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,940
Your wish is my command.
- Let's shake hands!

635
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,740
They shake hands.

636
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,460
A greek officer is visiting.
- A Greek?

637
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,020
From Athens.

638
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,420
He's riding a white stallion
and wears black leather boots.

639
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,740
Get me his room number.

640
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,500
But Wanda...

641
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,620
What?

642
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,380
Reluctant already?
- Forgive me.

643
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,340
Wait for me tomorrow in the birch copse.
Next to the statue of Aphrodite.

644
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,900
What time?
- Wait until I deign to come!

645
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,260
Very well.

646
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,140
Don't dare to come without
the room number of the Greek.

647
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,500
Kiss my foot.

648
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,420
He kneels down and kisses her foot.

649
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,020
I love that passage.
Boom! "Kiss my foot!"

650
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,340
Now bring me my fur.

651
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,620
Severin...

652
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
How should this end?

653
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,460
That's up to you
Ms. Wanda von Dunajew.

654
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,180
It's not up to me.

655
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,300
Thank you for the coffee slave.

656
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
Now I'll have some.

657
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,700
Coffee is what I mean.

658
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,300
That was intense. That handshake
was really electrifying.

659
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,860
The pleasures of a time when everyone
was much more introverted.

660
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,980
When simple conversation was still erotic.
- There was nothing besides conversation.

661
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,100
But the novel has a different start.

662
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,340
The novel?

663
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:59,180
Where's the initial scene? Venus naked
in fur appears to him at the fireplace.

664
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,660
Did you read the novel?
Did you read "Venus in Furs"?

665
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,580
I ran over it.

666
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,100
So you lied when you asked:
"Is it based on something?"

667
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,940
I wanted a headstart.
Why did you erase that scene?

668
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,420
I didn't know where to put it.
- To the start, before he meets Wanda.

669
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,340
"Venus in Fur" without Venus doesn't work.
The same actress can do it.

670
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,260
I'll do the nude scene
at the same price.

671
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,100
I'll think about it.

672
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,980
Let's improvise.
It'll help you getting ideas.

673
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,700
We have to change the lightning.
Where are we at the start?

674
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,500
In Kusiemski's room,
in the middle of the night.

675
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,180
Ok, in the middle of the night,
2 o'clock in the morning.

676
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,820
Let's dim it a bit.

677
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,220
Fireplace to the left.

678
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,420
Like that.

679
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,580
Good.

680
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,620
Let's see... What's Kusiemski
doing in that moment?

681
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,500
I don't know. He reads.
- Of course.

682
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,140
No?
To much cliché?

683
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,820
He reads when Wanda enters.
He can't read at the start.

684
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,060
This isn't the public library.

685
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,180
He could write in his diary.
- I like that.

686
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,420
Ok, I am Venus.

687
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,180
Why not.

688
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,100
Act as if I was naked.
- Are you hitting on me?

689
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,860
You're a big boy.
Act as if I was your fiancée.

690
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,220
It's my first time.
- All girls say that.

691
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,860
It's true for me.

692
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,420
The fireplace is flaring up.

693
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,580
We see Venus, nude,
lasciviously wrapped in fur.

694
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,420
Go on, enwrap me with fur.
You're the director.

695
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,780
I said: lasciviously.

696
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,940
Now go to your desk.

697
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,580
Stay in character.

698
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,220
Write in your diary.

699
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,140
Write for real!
- I am.

700
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,340
Aloud! How should
one know, who you are?

701
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,500
It's the start of the play.

702
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,300
The stage brightens up gradually.

703
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,460
One can hear the ticking
of an old clock.

704
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,260
22. October 1870.

705
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,620
Two o'clock in the morning.

706
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,180
I'm visiting hot springs

707
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,500
surrounded by forests
and mountains.

708
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,580
A moonless night.

709
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,780
Darkness and silence reign.

710
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,300
Wait, I can hear...
a sparrow.

711
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,220
A nightingale.
- A nightingale.

712
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,060
And the howling of
a cat in heat.

713
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,660
I feel... terribly alone.

714
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,340
Unhappy, unsatisfied...

715
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,140
What? Have the Germans
invaded again?

716
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,460
I hope I don't disturb you.

717
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,780
Not at all.

718
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,260
All hail Aphrodite.

719
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,100
So you didn't forget me?
- Forget you?

720
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,460
My dearest and oldest enemy?

721
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,660
You're too kind.

722
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,020
Won't you kiss my hand?

723
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,380
Better! But Thomas...

724
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,260
Did I say "Thomas"?

725
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,340
But Severin, it's cold in here.

726
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,780
At any instant I visit you
I catch a cold.

727
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,220
See?
My bronchia are mucus-ridden.

728
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,180
If you wouldn't run around naked...

729
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,620
But I am Venus. I have to be naked.
That's part of my job.

730
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,660
Don't you want to take off
that raspy garment

731
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,380
to nestle up against me?

732
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,500
There's space in my fur.

733
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,780
No, thank you.

734
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,460
I brought this mink
especially for you.

735
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,780
Fresh from the Olympus.
It's divine.

736
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,460
See.
"Made in Olympus".

737
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,700
Why should I take
interest in your mink?

738
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,460
But Severin.

739
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,940
I know you're little weakness.
It's not women you're interested in.

740
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,460
It's their fur.

741
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,900
You should marry an otter.

742
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,180
I'd prefer an otter
to any woman I know.

743
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,900
But if I spread my legs
below that fur

744
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,180
would you refuse love?
- Is it love you're offering me?

745
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,420
No, what you desire is power.

746
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,140
You dare to refuse me?
- Yes.

747
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,460
Severin,

748
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,540
in time you'll crawl at my feet.
You'll conjure me.

749
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,980
Never.

750
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,100
You're already mine.

751
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,660
For all eternity.
- Never!

752
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,300
I'll visit you again.

753
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,180
She exits!

754
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,860
Man!
- Not bad, isn't it?

755
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,860
Yes, but...

756
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,620
You can use it just like that.
- In a way... yes.

757
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:07,180
At least more or less.
- The Marlene-Dietrich-Accent fits, no?

758
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,700
Yes, it's good. It irradiates
Kusiemski on another level.

759
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,620
He acts coyly with Venus:
"No, you slut."

760
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,060
And the next day with Wanda:
"Take me, please!"

761
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,220
It could get dark at the end
and then brighten up again.

762
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:27,100
The next morning: knock, knock.
Venus is back, disguised as Wanda.

763
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,140
To take revenge.
- Yes, brilliant!

764
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,700
So it's you, right?
- What?

765
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,660
He is you.

766
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,300
Kusiemski-Novachek,
Novachek-Kusiemski.

767
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,180
No, that's not me.

768
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,500
You said that a lot of you is in there.

769
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,660
So you must be Wanda?

770
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,300
The play has nothing to do with me.
- Of course, you're just the author.

771
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,020
Oops! The "adaptationer".

772
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,980
"If a critic states that this
is me I'll kill him!"

773
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,060
I'm allowed to create characters, right?
- Of course, Doctor Novachek.

774
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,460
And completely by coincidence you find
them in an old sado-maso-novel.

775
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,220
It's a famous book.

776
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,540
So you didn't have your own
"unforseeable instant" at the age of 12?

777
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,500
In the library?

778
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,340
No.

779
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,100
With a cat?

780
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,820
No.

781
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,300
Do you still wait for your
"great moment"?

782
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,660
I'm waiting for nothing.

783
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:29,270
The relationship between
those two fascinates me.

784
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,390
Very complex and diverse...
- Of course.

785
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,390
I love the emotional
depth of the characters.

786
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,270
You won't experience
that nowadays.

787
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,910
This passion doesn't exist anymore.
- You should know my friends!

788
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,590
Well!
I'm blissfully ignorant!

789
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:55,350
Does your fiancée not
bind and whip you?

790
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:56,910
No.

791
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:00,070
Ask her.
Maybe the fiancée agrees.

792
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,230
Stop saying "the fiancée".
- I'm sorry.

793
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,070
What does your "better half"
think of the play?

794
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,750
Not much.

795
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,270
She might fear that
people think it's you.

796
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,630
We don't fear that. Neither me nor her.
- Let me guess: Your...

797
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,750
Marie-Cécile.

798
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,910
I bet she's younger than you.
Good family.

799
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:29,750
Presumably she was raised in a beautiful
domicile far out in the country.

800
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,510
At the coast, near La Baule.

801
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,270
Nantes to be precise.

802
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,150
But I bet her family went
every weekend to La Baule.

803
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,390
To a beautiful mansion with garden.

804
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,390
She sails.

805
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,710
She loves seafood.

806
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,310
Correct.

807
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,630
She's tall.
A little authoritarian but never mean.

808
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,350
Impressive hairstyle.

809
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:01,310
Long legs and two beautiful...

810
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,750
eyes.

811
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,870
She's smart.
Elitist pre-study in Paris.

812
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,390
The humanities at Louis-le-Grand
and École normale supérieure?

813
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,270
Am I greatly wrong?

814
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,350
The humanities at Henri-IV, ESSEC.
- She did a PhD?

815
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,950
She's doing her
doctorate in sociology.

816
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:23,110
She owns a dog. Let me think...
Presumably a labrador.

817
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,470
His name is... He has an original,
intellectual name.

818
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:30,830
Bourdieu?

819
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:33,870
Derrida.
You're quite educated.

820
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,270
She is the main earner.

821
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,510
Second rate theater with a belgian
cactus doesn't earn much.

822
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:43,870
No. Her family has a lot of dough.
Right?

823
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,270
Of course I'm right.

824
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,990
But you are the artist.

825
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:52,590
That's what she loves about you.
That and your sensitivity.

826
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,310
Maybe you're the first really
sensitive man she got to know.

827
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,150
She loves books, opera,
ballet and stuff like that.

828
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,550
In the evenings you watch ARTE
and discuss literature.

829
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,910
Then you have convenient sex.

830
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,470
Nothing's more relaxing than a
bit of convenient sex.

831
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,470
But there's a voice in your head.

832
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,270
A voice longing for something different.

833
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,910
I don't know what but it speaks out loud.

834
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,230
But your content.

835
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:33,390
You really like her and will
lead a convenient, little life.

836
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,390
Watch ARTE and discuss literature.

837
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:41,030
Then you'll have kids who will do it
just the same and then you're dead.

838
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,750
Shall we go on reading?

839
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,430
Yes, let's take it up again.

840
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,990
The next day in the birch copse?
- Ok.

841
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,990
Let's pretend this is
the statue of Venus.

842
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,750
All hail Aphrodite!

843
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,270
All hail Aphrodite...

844
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,630
Shall we discuss the scene
beforehand?

845
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,310
No Severin.

846
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:14,670
That's not right. All those ideas
about slavery and submission.

847
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,390
You depraved me with your talking.

848
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,470
Deep inside you you'd enjoy
to dominate a man.

849
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,750
No.
- To torture him perhaps.

850
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:24,910
No!

851
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,790
Admit it.
- That's not me.

852
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,350
I appeal at your reason!
- To hell with reason.

853
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,510
Don't you understand?

854
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:37,710
You will never be safe
in the hands of a woman

855
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,550
no matter what woman.

856
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,310
That sentense is so sexist

857
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,990
I could scream.

858
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,510
Why sexist?

859
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,710
You will never be safe
in the hands of a woman.

860
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,310
It's in the book.
- The book is sexist.

861
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,390
No, it's not!

862
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,990
On the contrary, it's...
- Yes, I know.

863
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,990
A classic in world literature, right?

864
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,870
I didn't mean to say that, but...
- And this?

865
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:05,550
That's not a Tizian my friend.
That's sado-maso-porn.

866
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,070
The whole thing is one big cliché.
- How?

867
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,710
He gets a beating and
is into sadomasochism?

868
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,990
That was the case with Sacher-Masoch!
- And in your case?

869
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,030
No!
- So how do you know?

870
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,230
For me it deals with two people
wo are united forever.

871
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,390
Their hearts are chained together.
- Through perversion.

872
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,190
Through passion!

873
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,630
His passion!
- The chemistry between them releases it!

874
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:33,430
Pure sex and class struggle.
Innocent Wanda

875
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,150
meets a sicko.

876
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,750
You don't understand anything.
- She says: "You've depraved me."

877
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,550
Maybe she always longed to dominate

878
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,910
and he just triggered that desire.
- Maybe she's just a woman.

879
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,750
That play is like some
old misogynic treatise.

880
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:53,110
He forces her into a power game and
afterwards blames her. It's like that!

881
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,550
How?
- Well, in the end she has him

882
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,870
whipped by the Greek and
leaves him with the cock in hands

883
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,510
and then she should be the guilty one?
He wanted all that!

884
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,630
I think little Kusiemski
fancies the Greek.

885
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,430
How can you be so stupid?

886
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:13,350
How can you play Wanda that good
and then talk that stupid about her?

887
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,990
And everything else?

888
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,030
Stupid, ignorant actress!

889
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,430
Dopey cow!
Dumb Dora!

890
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,990
Fuck!

891
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,230
I'm sorry.
- Pardon?

892
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:46,350
I'm sorry.
I lost my temper.

893
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,990
Ok, but what's said is said.

894
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:52,550
The essence of the play is:
Mistrust your lust.

895
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,150
Because she might knock
on your door.

896
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,590
One doesn't fool a goddess,
that's what it's about!

897
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,390
If you like it that way.

898
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,590
How is it expressed nowadays:
"If you like it that way"?

899
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,350
"For all I care."

900
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,790
If you say so.

901
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,430
Thank God there are no goddesses.

902
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,310
otherwise we'd be in trouble.

903
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:24,310
Ok, you're right.
I accept what you say.

904
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,390
Can we...

905
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,790
Can we go on?

906
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,070
Please, Vanda.

907
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:00,110
Don't you understand? You'll never
be safe in the hands of a woman,

908
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,630
no matter what woman.

909
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,430
We're both adventurers, Wanda.

910
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,350
We explore the boundaries
of human nature.

911
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,350
You're sick.

912
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:13,270
The countess poisened you.
You have to accept the consequenses.

913
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,950
But you like it as much as I do?
- No.

914
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,790
You long for power over me.
- No.

915
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,790
You love to give orders.

916
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:27,430
I beg you in all humility.
Command me as you please.

917
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,550
You're a deranged visionary,
a fanatic,

918
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,830
prepared to do anything
to live your dreams.

919
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,830
You are my dream.

920
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:39,070
Withdraw from me Severin
before it's too late.

921
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,750
Do you love me?
- I don't know.

922
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:48,070
Decide!
Do something to find out.

923
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,350
How?

924
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,110
Do what all lovers do.

925
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,390
Let me suffer.

926
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,910
That disgusts me and
I hate to pretend.

927
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,030
I'm not your aunt.
I am me!

928
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,990
Again.
Provoce him.

929
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,030
I'm not your aunt.
I am me!

930
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,550
Give everything!
- What do you want from me?

931
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,830
I'm not the fucking aunt.
I am me!

932
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,550
So what?
- I don't know.

933
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,390
There's something different in the air!
- I just wanted more.

934
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,550
That's not me!
I just need a fucking job.

935
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,750
I'm not your aunt.
I am me!

936
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,070
How's that?

937
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,430
Good, very good.

938
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,070
I can't accept the role,
it's too much for me.

939
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,030
Please stay, Vanda.

940
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,350
Plead for it.

941
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,630
I beg you.
- You're corrupt.

942
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,150
Don't you see that I'm
completely at your mercy?

943
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,190
Liar.

944
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,350
It's not like that. Much more
it's you who dominates me.

945
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:56,350
You? My slave?
Dominate you?

946
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,670
Right, huh?
- What?

947
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:01,070
He speaks of her power
but acutally he dominates her.

948
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,190
The more submission
the more power.

949
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,270
That's weird.
- That's complex.

950
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,110
So here's the aforesaid contract.

951
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:20,830
After you sign you owe
me complete obedience.

952
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,430
You are my slave.

953
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,830
You give up your identity.

954
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,790
Your body, your soul,

955
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:30,710
your honor is forever mine.

956
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,870
Sign here.

957
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,710
Well?

958
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,510
I assumed one year.

959
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,390
Pardon? Are you dictating
your conditions?

960
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,670
May I read it?

961
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,310
Why?
Do you mistrust me?

962
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,150
Sign.

963
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:03,710
Good.

964
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,710
From now on you
call me "Madame".

965
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,830
And you only speak
when I allow you to.

966
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,430
You serve my meals.

967
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,150
You wait for my orders
in the hallway.

968
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,510
You dress me and undress
me in the evening.

969
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,670
You hand me my stockings
and put on my shoes.

970
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,110
I call you Thomas.

971
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,430
It's "Gregor" in the script.
- I changed it.

972
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,830
From now on I'll call you Thomas.

973
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,230
You wear the livery of domestics.
- As a noble man...

974
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,150
As a noble man you should
keep your word.

975
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,430
According to our contract
you are my slave.

976
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,270
Your slave,
not your servant.

977
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,070
I don't see a difference.

978
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,470
Is this a game?
- That's the way I am.

979
01:02:55,670 --> 01:03:00,430
I'm stubborn, headstrong and greedy.
I finish what I begin.

980
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:02,950
Resistance makes me even more tenacious.

981
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,630
But inside of you there's
a noble nature.

982
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:09,350
What do you know of it
besides your fantasies?

983
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:12,470
Excuse me.
I'm dispicable.

984
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,150
Passport and money.

985
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:20,790
Give it to me!

986
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:29,390
Tomorrow we're leaving to Florence.

987
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,670
I'll travel in the first class,
you in the third.

988
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,150
Third class?

989
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,830
You eat and sleep with
the domestics.

990
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,470
Well, Thomas,
what's wrong?

991
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:43,470
Where should this end?

992
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:46,150
End?
We haven't even begun.

993
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,830
But Wanda...
- She slaps him.

994
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,790
She kisses him.

995
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,070
She caresses his cheek.

996
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:02,070
Did I hurt you my love?

997
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,710
Yes, it was awesome.
- Good.

998
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,110
Have you gathered
information on the Greek?

999
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:16,750
He's called Alexis and he's a count.

1000
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:20,470
He's beautiful, isn't he?
- He's absolutely enchanting.

1001
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:23,390
Didn't I tell you! Kusiemski
fancies the Greek.

1002
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,670
You book a loge next to his
for todays opera.

1003
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,870
I'll allow Alexis
to seduce me.

1004
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,470
But... Wanda.

1005
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:42,630
What's wrong?

1006
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,590
Can't I decide
the way I want?

1007
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,430
You electrify me.
- Be silent doggy!

1008
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,630
Bring me a birch.

1009
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,870
He brings a birch.

1010
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,270
Can you hear the whipping?

1011
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:14,110
It brings my nerves in motion.

1012
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,830
I want to hear you
whine at every hit.

1013
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:20,870
I want to see Mr. Kusiemski
cry like a little girl.

1014
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:24,430
I'm excited.
The air is burning.

1015
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,430
What have you done?

1016
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:30,150
Bla, bla, bla.
- What? Bla, bla, bla?

1017
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:33,190
What? She transforms
into a wicked witch.

1018
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:36,470
"The air is burning,
my nerves in motion".

1019
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,470
The only things missing are
lightning and drums rolling.

1020
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,670
Listen...
I like you Tom.

1021
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:47,710
I honestly think you're great,
but that's really corny.

1022
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,590
Corny?

1023
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:52,350
Corny? In which way?
It's the play.

1024
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,390
This is my play!
A unique piece.

1025
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:58,270
No one talks me into
something else.

1026
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,670
You're ignorant.

1027
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:14,470
No one trashes my work!
If they play the role or not.

1028
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:17,430
Go to hell.
- Ok, that's your thing.

1029
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:22,110
She draws a knife
and holds it to his throat.

1030
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:29,150
God, how I despise you!

1031
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,670
What are you doing?
What is it, Wanda?

1032
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,230
I see through this game.

1033
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,670
You wish to use me... bind me.

1034
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:39,310
I don't wish to.

1035
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:43,590
If you only knew what kind
of pleasure that feeling is.

1036
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,430
You know what?

1037
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:48,790
Something for
the labor union...

1038
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:51,590
Do I have the role or not?

1039
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,070
I give it to you with pleasure.

1040
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,790
That's what you're saying now.
Let's write it down.

1041
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,110
Yes.
- Piss off Marie-Cécile!

1042
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,670
I'm still here to finish something.

1043
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:08,110
He's fucking me Marie-Cécile!

1044
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:11,110
He fucks my ass.
- I don't know. Soon.

1045
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,710
He's fucking me like
a labrador in heat!

1046
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:19,070
Start dinner without me.
I'll be there soon, ok?

1047
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:24,630
Isn't there some of
yesterdays lamb left?

1048
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:28,390
I call you when I leave.

1049
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,310
Bye then. Yes.

1050
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,430
Yes, quite ok.

1051
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,870
I don't know!

1052
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:56,110
I come home when
I come home.

1053
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:58,310
Fuck you!
Ciao!

1054
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,830
I'm sorry.
- There was no one on, right?

1055
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,350
What?

1056
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:10,310
You only pretended to speak.
- That was my better half.

1057
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,950
What kind of a guy is he?
- Why does it have to be a guy?

1058
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:19,430
Why would you've
done it?

1059
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:20,830
What do you think?

1060
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,750
You didn't like that
I answered the phone.

1061
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:27,550
Female revenge?
Something like that?

1062
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,110
Something like that, yes.

1063
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,790
Any other director would have
jumped my bones already.

1064
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:38,270
I'm different.
- What nonsense.

1065
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:41,310
You were uncertain.
Otherwise you would have done it.

1066
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,790
Wrong.

1067
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:46,070
What if I'd allow it?

1068
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,750
Why do you know so much
about Marie-Cécile?

1069
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,430
I know her from training.
- Of course.

1070
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,070
She looks nice.

1071
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,430
Very pretty, really.

1072
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:05,150
We talked in the locker room...

1073
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,990
women's talk.

1074
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:13,190
I told her of my acting and my
retraining as a private detective.

1075
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,750
She told me of her friend,

1076
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,590
a mysterious type, an author.

1077
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,470
She gave me some money
for spying on you.

1078
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:26,630
To find out who you are.
If you genuinely love her.

1079
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:30,030
Gathering premarital information.

1080
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:35,310
With a check on your certificate of
conduct and your financial situation.

1081
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,870
I'm supposed to meat her
later on in a hotel...

1082
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,870
to give her detailed information.

1083
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:52,990
She's really sexy. Congrats!

1084
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,670
You're incredible.

1085
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,270
If a man says that
I sense a trap.

1086
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:00,750
Caught me.

1087
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:09,070
Marie-Cécile never showers in the studio.
- Really?

1088
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:11,390
But she was wet.

1089
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,670
Shall we do the ending?

1090
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:16,830
Yes.

1091
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,070
Wear this.

1092
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,470
Thomas, you let me wait.

1093
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:52,830
I'm grief-stricken, Madame.
I polished the silver.

1094
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:56,350
You look elegant in your livery.

1095
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:58,630
Thany you, Madame.
- Turn around.

1096
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,750
Oh yes.
Absolutely irresistable.

1097
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,710
But still your just a domestic.

1098
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,110
Something's missing, Thomas.

1099
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:14,670
Where's that from? That's not in the...
- I improvise.

1100
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:17,270
Something's missing.

1101
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:35,070
Very elegant!
The topping on the cake.

1102
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:39,110
Does this feel good?
- Very good, Madame.

1103
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:42,990
When you're wearing this
I could almost fall in love with you.

1104
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:44,910
Almost fall in love...

1105
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:46,950
Don't you love me?

1106
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:50,350
You're a bore.
That constant whining.

1107
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:53,590
Is it the count?
Are you in love with him?

1108
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,830
He followed me to Florence.

1109
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,910
He doesn't love you.
For him you're just one of a bunch.

1110
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,510
Bastard!
Watch the way you talk!

1111
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,510
Bring my boots.

1112
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:04,950
Yes, Madame.

1113
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,390
Not there.
In the bag.

1114
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:11,470
Idiot!
- Yes, Madame.

1115
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:15,270
From now on you call me "Mistress".
That's more degrading.

1116
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:16,950
Yes, Mistress.

1117
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:33,470
You like my boots?

1118
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:36,630
Yes, Mistress.

1119
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,790
You want to put them on?

1120
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,150
Yes, Mistress.

1121
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,190
You should put them on me!

1122
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,390
Yes, Mistress.

1123
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:26,830
Tomorrow I might bind you to
the fig-tree in the garden

1124
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:29,990
and sting you with my
golden hairpin.

1125
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:36,510
Or... I harness you
completely naked to a plow

1126
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:38,910
and rush you with the whip.

1127
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,190
Would you like that?

1128
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,190
Oh yes, Mistress.

1129
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:52,950
I'm very pleased with you, Thomas.
Maybe I give you some candy.

1130
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:58,950
Is there anything else to do, Mistress?
- Yes, one last thing.

1131
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:03,110
Tell your Marie-Cécile that
you're not coming home.

1132
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,070
I can't do that.
- Really?

1133
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,870
You can't?

1134
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:11,590
No, I can't.

1135
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,750
No cop-outs.

1136
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,470
Marie-Cécile, it's me.

1137
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:38,510
"I won't come home."

1138
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:41,470
I won't come home.
- No excuses.

1139
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:44,150
I can't tell you why.
- Tell her "see you."

1140
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,510
See you.

1141
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:48,190
Hang up and switch
off your cell.

1142
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,310
Isn't that wonderful?

1143
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,510
You and me. Here.

1144
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:03,070
It's really nice here.

1145
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:04,830
Peaceful.

1146
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,510
I don't know where I am.

1147
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,550
Come on.

1148
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,910
A life is ahead of you.
Ahead of us.

1149
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,670
Ahead of us both.

1150
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:19,990
Ahead of us and
your friend, the count.

1151
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:23,070
Don't annoy with with him.

1152
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:26,630
I don't punish you enough.
That's the problem.

1153
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:30,070
Just now I wanted to
take you into my arms.

1154
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,750
You wished to do that?
Really?

1155
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:34,990
Come.

1156
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,110
Come here.

1157
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:47,150
Lay your arms around me.

1158
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,270
You see?

1159
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:58,430
I can give you the feeling of regained
freedom for just an hour, dummy.

1160
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:02,750
You'll soon understand that
it's me to decide what you are.

1161
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,310
An animal.

1162
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,190
An object.

1163
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,870
An empty space I can fill.

1164
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:13,630
I won't allow that.

1165
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,030
I don't want that.
I refuse.

1166
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,350
Pardon?

1167
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,430
I wrote you a letter.
- A letter?

1168
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,910
Maybe a breakup note?

1169
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:28,350
Has the humiliation you
desired become unbearable?

1170
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,310
Has the humiliation
you desired...

1171
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:34,190
I can't play that.
I don't understand it.

1172
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:35,910
But it's...

1173
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:37,790
it's quite precise.

1174
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:40,710
What should I do?
How do you imagine the scene?

1175
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:43,390
That's the moment...
What does he say again?

1176
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:46,350
I wrote you a letter.
- A letter?

1177
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:52,150
Maybe a breakup note?
Has the humiliation you desired...

1178
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:53,750
Lie down.

1179
01:17:55,830 --> 01:18:00,150
Has the humiliation you
desired become unbearable?

1180
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:03,590
You sure carry it around all day

1181
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:07,030
yet you're too afraid
to show me! Well?

1182
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:10,910
Where is it? Show me this masterpiece.

1183
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,390
A little entertainment
would do me good.

1184
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:18,630
That's good, Tom.
You're awesome!

1185
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,870
You should play Wanda.

1186
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:22,350
No, no.

1187
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,030
Of course.

1188
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,430
Be Wanda.

1189
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,390
You understand her
better than me.

1190
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:33,590
You created her.
You know her innermost.

1191
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:37,390
I'm not familiar with her dialogue.
- Of course you are.

1192
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:44,350
Be careful, Severin.
- I do my best, Mistress.

1193
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,230
And as usual your best
is not enough.

1194
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,670
Bring my fur.

1195
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:04,190
Yes, Mistress.

1196
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:08,870
Bring a bottle of champagne
and two glasses.

1197
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:11,990
Count Alexis will arrive soon.
- But Mistress...

1198
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:15,390
If you don't like it then
leave my presence.

1199
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:19,070
Your fur, Mistress.

1200
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:27,190
Will you marry
count Alexis, Mistress?

1201
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:31,750
I don't want to lie, Severin.
That man makes me shiver.

1202
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,350
Brilliant!

1203
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,310
One moment.

1204
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:37,550
Sit down.

1205
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:45,150
He dominates my thoughts.

1206
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,190
He has a grip on me.

1207
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:40,790
He dominates my thoughts
and never lets me go.

1208
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:45,390
He makes me suffer.
- Brilliant.

1209
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:48,790
But I embrace this anguish.
- Come closer.

1210
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:08,670
If he asks for my hand, I'll say yes.
From the deepest of my heart.

1211
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,470
You're magical.

1212
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:16,390
Have you noticed that
you make him jealous?

1213
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,950
I told him everything about us.

1214
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,950
Did he threaten to kill you?

1215
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,110
Indeed.

1216
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,710
Did he hit you?
- Yes.

1217
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:31,790
And you allowed that?
- Yes, it was heavenly.

1218
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,710
More intensity.

1219
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:39,870
Yes, and it was... heavenly.

1220
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:41,950
Rub it in his face!

1221
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,510
Yes!

1222
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:44,990
And it was heavenly!

1223
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,710
I kill you both.

1224
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,670
I tear out your hearts and
feed them to the dogs.

1225
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,390
Be cursed.

1226
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:57,150
Yes, kill me!
Comfort me, Severin!

1227
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:02,350
I can't endure this comedy anymore.
- Comedy? What comedy?

1228
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:04,630
How can you love me?

1229
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:07,750
I was awful to you.
Don't you understand?

1230
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:10,550
I did it to save you.
To heal you.

1231
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,950
To show you how
much I love you.

1232
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:17,950
So none of it was real?
- Nothing.

1233
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:21,030
It was all a game,
just theater?

1234
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:24,670
And the contract?
- Ah, the contract...

1235
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:29,350
My sweet little dummy.

1236
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:39,750
I love you since the moment
I first saw you. I just couldn't tell.

1237
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:43,430
I'm not the one you think I am.
I am weak.

1238
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,230
I'm all lost.

1239
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:46,750
Not bad.

1240
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:49,430
I should be subdued!

1241
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,430
I should be bound
and whipped.

1242
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,750
I bind you with my stockings
to the statue.

1243
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:57,350
You want that, don't you?

1244
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,950
Oh yes, I beg you.

1245
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:06,110
Do with me what pleases you.

1246
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:12,510
Promise me to never leave me.
- I swear to never leave you.

1247
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,390
Rise!

1248
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:40,790
Hands!

1249
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:48,950
I dreamt of this moment
since I first saw you.

1250
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:51,230
Louder! Much louder!

1251
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:56,030
Humiliate me. Degrade me,
dominate me!

1252
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:59,470
Good, Tom.

1253
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,670
Very good, really.

1254
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:04,990
Brilliant.
But do you know what's the problem?

1255
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:07,750
Whatever one says or does,
this play

1256
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:11,630
degrades and insults women.
It's pornography.

1257
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,390
What are you talking about?

1258
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:17,310
Look at you. A virgin in needs.
A helpless stupid cow

1259
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:20,030
humiliating herself in front of her
husband: "Hurt me, I'm just a woman!"

1260
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:22,790
Damn! Fucking shit!

1261
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:26,990
Strong emotions.

1262
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:30,750
Good. There's no passion
like that anymore.

1263
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:31,910
Vanda...

1264
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:34,950
Thank me!

1265
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,310
Thank you.

1266
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,350
"Thank you" who?

1267
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:41,910
Thank you, Mistress.

1268
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:45,710
You wanted to manipulate
a dumb, little actress

1269
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,230
to satisfy your perverted needs?

1270
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,070
Create your own personal female
monster of Frankenstein?

1271
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:54,630
Thought you could humiliate me?
- No, I swear it.

1272
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:57,630
Thank you, Mistress.

1273
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:59,750
"Thank you, Goddess."

1274
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:03,150
Thank you... Goddess.

1275
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,430
Fuck!

1276
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:09,270
Bacchea of Thebes!
We dance to the rythm of Bacchus!

1277
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:38,590
Almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath

1278
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:43,470
delivered him into the hands of a woman.
