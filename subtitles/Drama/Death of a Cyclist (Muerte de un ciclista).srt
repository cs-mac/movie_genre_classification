INTERNATIONAL CRITICS PRIZE
CANNES 1955

2
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,063
Screenplay by J. A. BARDEM
Based on a Story by L. F. De lgoa

3
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,683
DEATH OF A CYCLIST

4
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,664
He's still alive.

5
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,602
Juan!

6
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,399
I'm frightened.

7
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,706
Why? Nobody saw us.

8
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,870
Are you sure?

9
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,873
It's late.

10
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,849
Yes, it's late.

11
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,222
- Will you call me?
- Of course.

12
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,857
<i>All right, all right.</i>

13
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,293
<i>They're making the most of it!</i>

14
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:06,337
If a husband gives his wife a bracelet
for no special reason, it means -

15
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,767
Business is going well.

16
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,740
A new bracelet versus
a thousand impoverished customers.

17
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,275
It means -

18
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,414
He's cheating on her.

19
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,981
- It means -
- He loves her.

20
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,280
Love, love, love!

21
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,583
When's dinner around here?

22
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,760
- Be patient, Rafa.
- When do we eat?

23
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,895
You mind if we wait
for Carmina and Jorge?

24
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,395
Jorge's too important
not to wait for him.

25
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,930
What's that?

26
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,103
You like it?
It just came to me.

27
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,205
- What's it called?
- "Blackmail."

28
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,635
I saw you.

29
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:50,647
5:30 p.m., the highway to France,
in a Fiat, going 60 mph.

30
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,580
- Destination?
- Unknown.

31
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,720
Reason for journey?
- Tourism.

32
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,153
Anything to declare?
Jewels? Drugs?

33
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,494
Sins?
- Just personal effects.

34
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,458
Lovers?

35
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,420
- Madam is waiting dinner for you.
- What?

36
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,057
Dinner.

37
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,693
I'll be right there.

38
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,804
Forgive me.

39
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,807
- Carmina and Jorge?
- They're always late. I never wait.

40
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,482
Is something wrong?

41
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,918
Is something worrying you?

42
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,459
No, Mother. Why?

43
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,889
- How are classes going?
- Fine.

44
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,091
Will they make you a professor?

45
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,465
I don't think so.
I'd have to work too hard.

46
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,938
Then work. You can go out
to the ranch. It'll be quiet there.

47
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,872
And boring.

48
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,681
Of course.
I keep my affairs in order.

49
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:33,181
Yes. Carmina is happily married.

50
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,878
I fulfill my role as black sheep.

51
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,523
The virtuous brothers
are deceased...

52
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,887
and the family's glory
is on display behind glass.

53
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,494
And here!

54
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,324
Anything wrong with that?

55
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,762
No, it's just fine.

56
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,472
It's Miss Carmina.

57
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,982
Mother?
Yes, I know we're very late.

58
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,282
We stayed at the Castros' place.

59
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,756
Jorge says you must excuse us.

60
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,657
What a pity!
Juan's gone too?

61
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,354
It's Mother.

62
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,368
You forgive us, don't you?
We'll have lunch tomorrow.

63
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,630
We couldn't stay long tonight anyway.
We're all dressed up.

64
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,401
No, at the American embassy.
All right.

65
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:36,773
María José sends her regards.
Tell Juan we're waiting for him.

66
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,494
It was your sister.

67
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,860
She and Jorge send their regards,

68
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,471
and so does Mrs. Castro.

69
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,869
They're waiting for you
at the party.

70
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,168
I'll pass.

71
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,107
- Not interested?
- In my sister?

72
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:11,409
No, the party.
María José and that crowd.

73
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,914
Not much.

74
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,679
Neither Carmina,
nor her husband Jorge -

75
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,254
your son-in law
and my brother-in-law.

76
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,290
Why not?
He's a fine man.

77
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,621
He should be,
as high up as he is.

78
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,354
Isn't he good to us all?
And to you?

79
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,798
Sure. I owe my modest salary
as assistant professor to him.

80
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,369
You might be made professor.

81
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,470
For that matter...

82
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,200
I might be dean too,

83
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,470
thanks to Jorge,

84
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,544
but...

85
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,841
My brother Juan's a failure.

86
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,815
<i>- Why?
- He doesn't want to do anything.</i>

87
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,682
- A pity, isn't it?
- What?

88
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,384
The way Juan is destroying his future.
Jorge could help him so much.

89
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:00,999
At no time in history have such
marvelous circumstances come together.

90
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,394
He always sounds
like he's giving a speech.

91
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,573
At no time, I tell you!

92
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,338
One of the rare men who can talk
for hours yet say nothing.

93
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,844
<i>You might ask, "In other moments,
in other circumstances,</i>

94
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,348
<i>have similar opportunities
not arisen?"</i>

95
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,750
<i>No, a thousand times no!</i>

96
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,083
<i>With this I conclude my talk.</i>

97
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,726
<i>This voice of mine falls silent,</i>

98
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:34,867
<i>this voice that reaffirms once more
our vigilant and unwavering position</i>

99
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:39,595
<i>on every aspect
of our life as a nation.</i>

100
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,700
<i>His final remarks
met with vigorous applause.</i>

101
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,007
<i>The party continued
in a stylish and congenial tone,</i>

102
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,512
<i>heightened by the presence
of notable figures.</i>

103
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:54,083
<i>Our society ladies
took up a collection</i>

104
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,846
<i>for the Christmas campaign,</i>

105
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,685
<i>raising much more
than in preceding years.</i>

106
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,996
<i>"Keep the change, ma'am."</i>

107
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:11,928
<i>Tucson, Arizona. A terrible fire
has cost the Bardem Stores $800,000.</i>

108
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,982
- What?
- Wouldn't you like to come?

109
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,714
Where?

110
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,186
What's the matter?

111
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,093
Haven't you been listening?
- I'm sorry. You were saying?

112
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,926
- I was talking about that trip.
- Take me along.

113
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,398
On a business trip?

114
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:48,232
Business ends at sundown
all over the world.

115
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,500
How do you spend
your evenings?

116
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,905
Missing you.

117
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,544
You know I always miss you.

118
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,355
Do you really want to come?

119
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,349
You come here.

120
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,403
We could leave right away

121
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,442
and escape.

122
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,674
From what?

123
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,216
Everything.

124
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,514
Always the same faces.
Every day like all the others.

125
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,384
Nothing ever happens.

126
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,253
You really think so?

127
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:46,822
Miguel, let's leave right away.

128
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,820
It must be shown that
the outline of the toroid

129
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,550
is equal to the circumference -

130
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,488
If we suppose that the center
of the circumference

131
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,625
describes an ellipse
of semi-axis M and N,

132
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,957
the parametric equations
of this ellipse will be -

133
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,433
DEATH OF A CYCLIST

134
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,918
Eliminating alpha
gives us equation No. 1...

135
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,261
...an orthogonal projection
on plane Z=0

136
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,663
of the base circumference
of the surface...

137
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,212
Go away!

138
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,237
Miguel, Emperor is ready.

139
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,702
I should say!
He ran five furlongs in -

140
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,434
- In 1.4.
- Let's give Emperor a hand.

141
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,017
- He died.
- Who?

142
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,484
The cyclist.

143
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,986
Did it say so in the paper?

144
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,319
Nothing else?
- Just that.

145
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,495
I see.

146
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,665
I assume they know nothing
about the car.

147
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,355
What are we going to do?

148
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,831
I can't think of anything.
Wait.

149
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,970
To be found out?

150
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:17,370
- We have to stay calm.
- And make a plan.

151
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,441
- Will I see you later?
- Yes.

152
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,738
Hey, María José! Juan!

153
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,282
Have you seen the paper?
- Anything important?

154
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,612
Depends what you call important.

155
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,413
- What is it?
- Wait a minute.

156
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,217
Not the editorials.
The comics are dumb.

157
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,553
Sports - nothing.

158
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,663
"News in brief." Here it is.
Let's see.

159
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,632
Don't you love the news in brief?

160
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:48,296
"House under construction collapses."
"Crime of passion."

161
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,203
"Death of a cyclist."
Here it is.

162
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,042
"Theft." Thieves stole
Piluca Bravo's emerald necklace.

163
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,682
Isn't that great?

164
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,665
I'm sure he knows.
He has to.

165
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,073
We're ruined, Juan!

166
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,944
Nobody could know.
Nobody saw us.

167
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,677
He did.
He told me so last night.

168
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,322
What did he say exactly?

169
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,890
He saw you
on the highway in your car.

170
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,153
He saw you - and only you.

171
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,853
That's different.

172
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,466
What about the paper?
He knows everything.

173
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,000
Think about it.

174
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:57,141
It could be a coincidence,
an innocent remark.

175
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,868
Isn't that possible?

176
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,108
I don't know.
I'm so frightened.

177
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,446
I'm afraid, Juan.

178
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,985
What are we going to do?
- There's nothing we can do.

179
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,558
Just wait, right?
For what?

180
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,991
We have to find out.
- What?

181
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,291
What they know.

182
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,832
The police. Rafa.

183
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,803
We have to find out what we did.

184
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,167
We killed a man, didn't we?

185
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,205
All right.
I'll look into it.

186
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,138
- I'll see to Rafa.
- Be careful.

187
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,284
- Of Rafa?
- Everything.

188
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,922
You might reveal one thing
while trying to cover up another.

189
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,751
Like what?
That I love you?

190
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,694
No, not here.

191
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,349
I'd like a word with you.

192
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,228
With me?

193
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,632
What's the matter?
- I failed my exam.

194
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,833
Your name is
Matilde Luque, isn't it?

195
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,341
And they failed you.
That's a shame.

196
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,570
It's not fair.

197
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,811
Perhaps not.
Professors make mistakes too.

198
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,476
It wasn't the professor.
It was you!

199
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,182
- Me?
- You were reading the paper.

200
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,360
I presented my problem perfectly.

201
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,825
- How do you know?
- Because I do!

202
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,329
And so do my classmates.
- So I read the paper. What else?

203
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,331
Nothing.
You told me to go away.

204
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,935
Then the grades came out,
and I had failed.

205
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,769
Perhaps you're right,
but there's nothing I can do.

206
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:16,107
There's one solution.
Go see the dean.

207
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,545
Why? Your brother-in-law
is very powerful.

208
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,418
Say that again.

209
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,111
Any dispute with the university
would be useless.

210
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,349
You have the university
and your brother-in-law on your side.

211
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,162
Is that the rumor?

212
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,903
That I have
my brother-in-law's protection?

213
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,067
You're brave.
I like that.

214
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,644
- Forgive me.
- For what?

215
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,817
You've been honest.
Besides, it's true.

216
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,285
It's you who must forgive me.

217
00:20:56,488 --> 00:21:00,356
I treated you unfairly.

218
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,223
It's not that. The worst part
is that there was no reason.

219
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,729
You just suddenly cut me off.

220
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,498
Why?

221
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,326
Why?

222
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,906
I'm not sure I can explain.

223
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,575
I was thinking
of personal matters.

224
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,975
I may have a serious problem.

225
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,540
It's the only possible reason.

226
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,819
- It will do.
- Try and forgive me.

227
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,616
Why not?
There's a simple explanation.

228
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,519
Your selfishness.

229
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,173
<i>Number 21.</i>

230
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,510
"Summer."
Do you get it?

231
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,917
It lacks clarity.
No firmness in the line or colors.

232
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:09,958
It's very tentative,
don't you think?

233
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,323
Well, that's all.

234
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,829
Now you tell me why.
- Why?

235
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:18,469
Why we've come here today,

236
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,662
why this interest
in a third-rate art show.

237
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,307
Just what is it you want?

238
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,478
To know.
- To know... abstract art?

239
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,646
Cold.

240
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,543
- Klee's influence on modern painting?
- Cold.

241
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,911
- What I earn as an art critic?
- Freezing.

242
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,916
- How much I like you?
- Warmer.

243
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,645
- What you suspect?
- Hot.

244
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,484
- What I want?
- Sizzling.

245
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,693
You see, it's all very simple.

246
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:49,060
The hard part
is finding out where to start.

247
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,095
I am Rafael Sandoval, or Rafa.

248
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:58,174
Good for nothing, but granted entrance
to the most exclusive circles.

249
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,277
At your charity balls,

250
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,414
at parties for wealthy merchants
and landowners,

251
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:08,951
I, art critic, represent culture
with a capital C.

252
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:15,558
I eat your caviar, drink your whiskey
and smoke your cigarettes.

253
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:20,391
In exchange - and I'm the loser
in the bargain - I endure you all.

254
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,830
- And you're bored stiff.
- No, I'm really not.

255
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,969
It's fun observing you.

256
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:31,040
I see your sins, classify them,
file them away... and wait.

257
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,267
For what?

258
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,310
The right moment to act.

259
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:40,850
All the ugly things you hide,
I dig them up and lay them before you.

260
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,713
It's a means of purification.

261
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,718
Or blackmail.

262
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,317
That's an ugly word,
and not really even Castilian.

263
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,496
- But the meaning is clear.
- If you say so.

264
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,758
- And what do you want?
- Not much.

265
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,459
First, stop taking me
for such a fool.

266
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,899
Granted.

267
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,540
Second, don't try to see my cards.

268
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,802
If you want to see my hand,
you'll have to pay.

269
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,641
I suppose there's no other way.
Very well.

270
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,749
Anything else?

271
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,284
In fairy tales, the evil fairy
always asks for three things.

272
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,479
What's your third wish?

273
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,692
You.

274
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,994
I'll have to tell my husband.

275
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,095
Just what I intend to do.

276
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:34,163
<i>... fidelity of wife to husband
in body and soul,</i>

277
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:39,001
<i>in things small and large,
in joy and in sorrow.</i>

278
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,374
Fidelity purifies love,

279
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,811
enlarges it,
elevates it, ennobles it,

280
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,450
and raises it up
to the kingdom of God,

281
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,985
giving it its true reason
and deepest meaning.

282
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,562
Lovely words,
aren't they, Miguel?

283
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,136
- His usual.
- Of course. What else could he say?

284
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,276
Something different.
He said the same thing at our wedding.

285
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,174
Oh? I didn't notice.
I was very preoccupied.

286
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,748
- About the future?
- My veil was pulling a bit.

287
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,984
- Bored?
- Quite.

288
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,592
I've heard you two
are going away. When?

289
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,665
No point in me setting a date,
since she'll have the final word.

290
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,326
How are things?
- Good. I'm working on something exciting.

291
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,064
Have you taken up business now?

292
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,334
Not exactly business.

293
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,945
More like a game.

294
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,571
A forbidden game?

295
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,341
A dangerous one.

296
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,784
- Aren't you listening?
- Of course.

297
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,480
This canasta tournament
will be great fun.

298
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:06,631
It's for poor children, or stupid children,
or something - but it'll be fun.

299
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,163
I'm organizing it myself.

300
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,459
Come along, kids!
Time to eat!

301
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,039
<i>You looking for someone?</i>

302
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,540
- The porter.
- Take that walkway and come up.

303
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,875
Hey, listen!

304
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,545
Tell Mrs. Antonia
someone's looking for her.

305
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,685
Mrs. Antonia.

306
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,292
- What is it?
- There's a man looking for you.

307
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,456
Excuse me. Where does
Aurelia Gómez Tejedor live?

308
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,930
Upstairs, in number 11.

309
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,638
No one's home.

310
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,946
- I'm looking for Mrs. Tejedor.
- She's not in.

311
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,944
- Doesn't she live here?
- Yes, but she's not home.

312
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,414
She went to Madrid about the insurance.
What do you want?

313
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,747
- To speak to her.
- Are you with the insurance company?

314
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,258
I'm a reporter.

315
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,057
My goodness!
Will she be in the papers?

316
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:58,201
Something like that.
It's for a story.

317
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,928
Her husband had an accident,
didn't he?

318
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,404
Yes. That's why I took you
for an insurance man.

319
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,677
It's too bad.
I can't come back another day.

320
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,974
What did you want to know?

321
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,016
I just wanted to see her,
ask a few questions.

322
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,384
How big the family is,
how she lives,

323
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,059
what she does -
that sort of thing.

324
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,387
I can tell you.
Come in.

325
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,190
There's not much
to see anyway.

326
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,663
All these apartments
are the same.

327
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,795
Well, she has a sewing machine.

328
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,373
She's a good woman.
Very... you know.

329
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:42,774
Our husbands worked together
at the metal factory.

330
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,916
Same thing could have
happened to my husband.

331
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,108
- What happened?
- Don't you know?

332
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,818
Yes, but I mean the details.

333
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,684
- A car hit him.
- And the car?

334
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,883
I suppose the car is fine.

335
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,426
I mean do they know
anything about it?

336
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,996
- It didn't stick around!
- Aren't they looking?

337
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:05,602
That's what I asked the policeman
who came to talk to Aurelia.

338
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,136
- Policeman?
- Yes, the secret police.

339
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,240
He said looking for the car
was out of the question.

340
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,637
They don't even have
a description.

341
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,179
May I have a little water?

342
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,851
Not until my daughter gets back.
She's in line.

343
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,146
- Never mind then.
- I won't hear of it.

344
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,416
Merche!

345
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,753
- What about family?
- Just Merche and a younger girl.

346
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,293
No, I mean her.

347
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,433
This one's hers,
and an older boy down there.

348
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,966
Tonio!

349
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,466
That's him.

350
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,758
- What did he say?
- The priest?

351
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,159
- No, Rafa.
- Just small talk. Why?

352
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,027
I can't stand that creep.

353
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,328
He's just a poor devil, a poet.

354
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,404
- He's always criticizing.
- Isn't that his job?

355
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,404
He's always gossiping.

356
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:22,376
We all talk about what we see,
imagine, suspect.

357
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,707
You talk about others,
and they talk about you.

358
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,352
- What do they say?
- It was just an example.

359
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,177
You know people talk about us.

360
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,387
The way you behave.
The things I do.

361
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,652
Social chatter. It's not important.
- It could be.

362
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,988
Never.

363
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:43,463
In my book, it's not what you say,
it's what you do.

364
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,229
I wish I could get away
from all this.

365
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,566
I can't take it.
When are we going away?

366
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,835
Little María José is bored.
She wants to fly off.

367
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,537
Odd how weddings make
married couples sentimental.

368
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,843
One remembers
the good old times.

369
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:04,317
Don't use that word "old."

370
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,547
Come.
I have some juicy gossip.

371
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,091
- Can't we hear?
- Gossip is for one person at a time.

372
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,763
Group sessions are so tiresome.

373
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:17,060
Now comes the scene between
the wicked count and the virtuous lady.

374
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,736
- You know it?
- It's an easy one.

375
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,599
Then you start.

376
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,173
How odd.
He hasn't come.

377
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,443
- Who?
- Juan Fernández Soler.

378
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,376
Was he supposed to come?

379
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,574
Of course.
He's a distant relation of the bride.

380
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,310
You miss him?

381
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:40,252
Me? Not exactly me.

382
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,916
Your husband tells me
you're leaving Madrid very soon.

383
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,720
That's my plan. Why?

384
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,397
Just curious.

385
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,125
I'd rather you didn't run off.
I thought I might -

386
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,964
- What?
- Surprise you.

387
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,833
You're going to die.

388
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,066
Mrs. Castro,
phone call for you.

389
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,040
Will you excuse me?

390
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,413
- Send my regards.
- To whom?

391
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,984
Whoever it is.

392
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,422
Is that you?
I can hardly hear you.

393
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,031
There's a crowd here.

394
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,325
To put you at ease.
Can you hear me?

395
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,093
Yes. Go on.

396
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:30,604
Nobody knows a thing.
That's right.

397
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,743
You hear me?
Nobody knows a thing.

398
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,472
But he does!
It's awful, Juan.

399
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,083
That man knows something,
but I don't know what.

400
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:46,188
No, I couldn't get anything out of him.
He wants to use it against me.

401
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,258
I see him talking to Miguel
and I tremble.

402
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,153
Help me, Juan.
We have so much to lose.

403
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,595
Yes, I'll stay calm.
We have to meet.

404
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,668
No, I'll call you.
Thank you, Juan.

405
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,034
You're all I have.
I love you.

406
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,430
<i>- His skull was shattered.
- Poor thing!</i>

407
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,829
And they left him
lying there like a dog.

408
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,267
The brutes.
Maybe if you'd found him in time -

409
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,839
- Who knows.
- Who could it have been?

410
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,636
- With that traffic -
- A truck.

411
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,507
Or one of those illicit affairs
that Encarna hides, eh?

412
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,840
I'm sure it was a truck.

413
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,314
He's obsessed with trucks,
so whoever it was can relax.

414
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,987
They all speed
like madmen out there.

415
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,453
- We have to go.
- Encarna, phone for you.

416
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:28,852
An illicit affair!

417
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,454
- Want some?
- No. Give me a light.

418
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,974
- What's wrong with you, Juan?
- Me? You mean both of us.

419
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:32,013
What are you thinking about?
Tell me.

420
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,946
About us.

421
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,120
That's right.
What is this?

422
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,326
Love? Passion? A pastime?

423
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,726
Do you love me?

424
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,329
Yes.

425
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,228
I think so.

426
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,872
I'd never asked myself
the question.

427
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,875
You've been so many things to me
over so many years.

428
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,013
- Sweetheart, lover -
- But never my wife.

429
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,207
But I almost was, wasn't I?

430
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,349
The war...
- That's right. The war.

431
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,249
The war is very convenient.
You can blame everything on it.

432
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,427
All the death and destruction,

433
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,995
all the guys like me
left hollow inside

434
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,065
who never believe
in anything ever again.

435
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:21,830
Not even the sweetheart
who doesn't wait and marries a rich man.

436
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:27,475
Now I'm talking nonsense.
I sound like some dime store novel.

437
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:32,342
That was wrong,
but I had to do it.

438
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,314
- For your own sake?
- Don't be cruel.

439
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,788
You know it's you I love.

440
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,718
But why? Mrs. Castro
yawns her way through cocktail parties,

441
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,827
is bored silly
at canasta tournaments,

442
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,827
falls asleep at gala concerts.

443
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:52,901
The old teenage affair
becomes a romantic adventure,

444
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,871
nice and exciting...
as long as there are no complications.

445
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,839
Now there are,
and everything falls apart.

446
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,870
What do you mean?

447
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,911
We can't even kiss now.

448
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,813
You can't stand
to let me caress you.

449
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,618
I don't dare touch you.

450
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,650
Maybe I don't even want to.

451
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,456
There's something more important
than you or me: fear.

452
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,063
Of what?

453
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,732
Everything.

454
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,369
People watching.
A phone ringing.

455
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,265
Rafa.

456
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,669
I can't take it.
What could happen to us?

457
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,776
If they find out?

458
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,173
If they find out we killed a man.

459
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,143
We'll lose everything.

460
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,343
What does "everything" mean?

461
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,542
To you? I don't know.

462
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,449
Your world, your home,
your husband,

463
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,319
your position in society,
your wonderful life -

464
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,051
And you.

465
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:55,028
Thanks.
I'm in there somewhere too.

466
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,167
- Don't talk like that.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,228
Don't mind me.
Everything will be fine.

468
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,740
Though sometimes I wish
it would all come out.

469
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,210
That we killed one man
while deceiving another,

470
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,474
that we think only of ourselves.
It would be a relief.

471
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,914
- What can we do?
- Nothing.

472
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,315
We have to wait a short while,

473
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,320
like when you mourn
some distant relative.

474
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,289
- I couldn't bear it.
- We must.

475
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,430
Everything will work out.
No one will lose anything.

476
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,100
Everything will go on as before.

477
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,360
We'll come back here
one day and kiss

478
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:38,839
without fear getting in our way
or people driving us apart.

479
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,843
<i>There!</i>

480
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,715
Better every time.

481
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,149
- What do you do when I'm not here?
- I wear a scarf.

482
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,483
Can you be ready
in a few hours?

483
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,525
Dinner is tonight.
- Don't be a pain.

484
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,628
You know
I don't like being late.

485
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,231
- Who's this dinner for?
- Those Americans I mentioned.

486
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,265
- Will Jorge help you?
- Of course.

487
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:09,803
He'll pressure them to give me
the contract. Quite a deal.

488
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:14,273
- Including for Jorge.
- Sure. He's a good fellow. Very sharp.

489
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,003
It's his wife who's a bore.
- Carmina?

490
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,911
- She takes after her mother.
- She comes from a family of heroes.

491
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,052
Juan too?

492
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,387
No. He's just a poor devil.

493
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,557
You were sweethearts once, right?

494
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,522
Nothing too serious.
We grew up together.

495
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,755
By the end of the war he was
a provisional lieutenant or something.

496
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:38,025
We went out a few times.
- To celebrate the victory.

497
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,998
You're talking nonsense.

498
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,032
- Is he still in love with you?
- Juan? What a thing to say!

499
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,802
Why not?
You're prettier by the day.

500
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,179
Very kind of you.

501
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:54,408
I'm in love with you too,
and I'm a proud man.

502
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,417
Lots of people envy you.
- Me? Why?

503
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,591
Because you're pretty,
with a good family name.

504
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,284
- And because I'm your wife?
- The wife of an important man.

505
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,260
What do they envy most?
The name or the money?

506
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,195
What do you think?

507
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:16,304
A name can be tarnished
by some unseemly act.

508
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,338
Unseemly? Like what?

509
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,409
I don't know.
How about murder?

510
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,637
Is that all murder is?

511
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,682
- This is all hypothetical.
- Go on.

512
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:33,447
An unseemly act tarnishes a name,
but the name still remains,

513
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,058
whereas money is more fragile.

514
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,752
- I don't understand.
- Sure you do. Listen.

515
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,058
The other day someone told me
an interesting story

516
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,168
about a prominent couple
who lost everything.

517
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,564
Why?

518
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,131
- The woman cheated on her husband.
- How original!

519
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,004
Let me continue.

520
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,338
The woman cheated
on her husband.

521
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,779
They were upper-class - especially her.
He had a lot of money.

522
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,421
- Did he kill her?
- No, better than that.

523
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,647
He left her without a penny.

524
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:11,021
She was suddenly left
without her accustomed life.

525
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,163
No one would help her.

526
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,801
You like it?
- Your story? Not bad.

527
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,867
Who told it to you?

528
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,766
Rafa.

529
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,346
Yes, of course.

530
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,685
Of course.
You give the orders.

531
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,484
And you're not shy about it.

532
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,472
Juan.

533
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,812
Juan worries me,
though he's the smartest in the family.

534
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,176
And the least successful.
I'm not worth a penny.

535
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,011
Don't be silly.
I'm sure Juan's a genius.

536
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:13,315
Any day now he'll do something
stupendous. He's writing a novel.

537
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,958
- Is that true?
- Pay her no mind.

538
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,152
Carmina's annoyed
that I'm not a person of note.

539
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,388
She wants me to do
something unique.

540
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,625
- Why don't you work?
- What a thing to say!

541
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,265
Will you excuse me?

542
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,805
Rafa spoke to Miguel.

543
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,937
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

544
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:36,442
Miguel has been
asking questions about us.

545
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,877
- Like what?
- Like were we sweethearts.

546
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,380
Didn't he know?

547
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:44,076
Of course. That's what's strange.
Why bring it up now?

548
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,650
I'm very frightened.

549
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,417
He mentioned murder.

550
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,222
He related a story similar to our own.
- The cyclist?

551
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:58,026
No. It feels like everyone knows,
like they're watching us.

552
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:02,968
Try to relax and smile.

553
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,771
Talk about anything,
but smile.

554
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,707
- But Juan -
- Let's talk to Rafa.

555
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,082
We must confront him
and find out what he knows.

556
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,148
Juan, you haven't
been around much.

557
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,981
- "Blackmail" again?
- This tune?

558
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,092
No, this one's in honor

559
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,728
of the USA.

560
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,091
What's in store for them later?

561
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,757
Something "typically Spanish,"
I'm sure.

562
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,835
<i>Olé, olé, toreador.</i>

563
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,530
- Did you speak to Miguel?
- About what?

564
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,733
What you mentioned
at the art exhibit.

565
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,311
- Not much. There's still time.
- May I join you?

566
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,210
You mind?

567
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,311
Still time for what?
- I'll do the talking.

568
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,219
We have a little business matter.
- You and María José?

569
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,120
And Juan.

570
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,088
A business matter?
I'm intrigued. What kind?

571
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,955
Buying and selling.

572
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,060
Is it a secret?

573
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,202
- Is it?
- No. Tell him.

574
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,128
- You agree?
- I agree.

575
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:13,739
- He may not like it.
- I play a role in this little drama?

576
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,640
I should say!
The worst one.

577
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,110
- What's my role?
- You pay.

578
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,946
What's your part?

579
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,182
I have the best role: I collect.

580
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,621
Tell me more.

581
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:35,325
He's dying to know.
Sorry, I can't tell you yet.

582
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:39,462
There's one small detail
missing, isn't there?

583
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,829
The answer will be revealed
in the next act.

584
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,788
What are you looking at?

585
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,360
Did María José send you?

586
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,091
- Are you sick?
- I'm fine!

587
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,760
- I'll take you home.
- The good Samaritan!

588
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:26,135
You know what?
You're afraid of me.

589
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,868
You're all afraid of me!
- Why?

590
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,571
I know things.
Despicable things about you.

591
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:37,220
You want to cover them up
so no one sees.

592
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,218
Don't touch me!

593
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,024
I'm tired of always being
your guest.

594
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,458
The intelligent and witty guest.

595
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,689
Good old Rafa.
Nice Rafa.

596
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,597
I have the upper hand here!
You're all filthy scum,

597
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,965
a bunch of selfish pigs.

598
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:01,110
And I know
all your dirty secrets.

599
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,646
You'll have to pay me
to keep quiet.

600
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:05,940
Shut up!

601
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,481
So you can go on being
the virtuous lady,

602
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,744
the brilliant professor,
the great businessman.

603
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:11,886
Shut up!

604
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:17,322
To hide the scum you are!
Them, and you, and María José!

605
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,501
Bad move.

606
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,369
Now the fun starts.

607
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,573
Come on.

608
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,735
Aren't you Juan Fernández Soler?

609
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,376
They're asking for you
downstairs.

610
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,374
- Who is it?
- The police.

611
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,768
What is it, Juan?

612
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,570
The police are looking for me.

613
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,069
Bad news?

614
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,734
Stop it!

615
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,505
It's nothing.
Rafa's just a little drunk.

616
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,441
Right?

617
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,314
Drop the bottle.

618
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,055
Come on.
Some fresh air will do you good.

619
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,287
You come too.

620
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,376
Feeling better?

621
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:04,076
You talked a lot of nonsense back there.
Were you just drunk?

622
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,254
Yeah, a little.

623
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,015
- What did he say?
- You be quiet.

624
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,318
Think about
what you have to say.

625
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,188
Let me talk.

626
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:15,296
Take your time.
Calm down and think.

627
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,898
You don't believe me?

628
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,762
Good old Rafa.
What an imagination!

629
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,564
- Don't you believe me?
- You're lucky I don't.

630
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:26,936
This is my wife.
You couldn't have seen her anywhere.

631
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,339
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

632
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,707
Just one of Rafa's jokes.

633
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,441
What did you tell him?

634
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,084
You know perfectly well.

635
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,846
I saw you in your car

636
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:42,388
with that man on the highway.
With Juan!

637
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,423
What else?

638
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,058
What else?

639
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:57,366
See why I can't believe you?
She's not deceiving me.

640
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,168
She's mine alone
and always will be.

641
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,538
She's my wife.
You understand?

642
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,048
Come on.

643
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:14,150
When you've calmed down,
come to the house and we'll talk.

644
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:18,321
But consider seriously
what you have to say.

645
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:39,309
Fire Soler!
Kick him out!

646
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,496
Get back!

647
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,530
Fire him!

648
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:29,821
See that?

649
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,558
All this
could have been avoided,

650
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,738
but we had to look
all over for you.

651
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,204
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too, but I can't have this.

652
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,310
I don't know or care
whether they're right.

653
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,276
My job is to maintain order.
What shall we do?

654
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,416
Let's not lose our heads.

655
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:51,917
Those boys feel a grave injustice
has been done

656
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,784
to one of the coeds -
What's her name?

657
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,221
Matilde Luque Carrajal.

658
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,826
Matilde Luque.

659
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:02,829
They say the culprit
is Mr. Juan Fernández Soler,

660
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,501
adjunct professor
of analytical geometry.

661
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,932
And they demand -
- Violently.

662
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,935
It's just a lot of noise.

663
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,438
They demand
that this gentleman be dismissed.

664
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,269
It's quite simple.

665
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:19,244
We promise to give
thorough attention to their demand,

666
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:23,010
according to prescribed rules,
of course. Agreed?

667
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,653
Fine. This is in your hands.

668
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,380
Let's go.
This won't be difficult.

669
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,082
You'd better stay here.

670
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:35,464
And you might want to speak
to your brother-in-law.

671
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,481
May I?

672
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,657
Come in, please.

673
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:44,195
- The dean asked me to speak to you.
- Why?

674
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,599
I don't know exactly.
I'm so sorry about all this.

675
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,365
Sorry? Really?

676
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:55,376
Can't you see it's wonderful?
- What is?

677
00:56:55,578 --> 00:57:00,709
This selflessness,
this unity, this solidarity.

678
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,011
- You're too -
- Na. ive?

679
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,347
Don't believe it. Look.

680
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,158
Many are just
along for the ride.

681
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:18,062
It could be "Promote him!"
or "Fire him!" - they don't care.

682
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,896
They just want to shout.

683
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,436
But the others
are really in your camp.

684
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,203
Your problem - my unfairness -
has become their own.

685
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,044
Why do you laugh?

686
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,276
I don't understand.

687
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:40,047
If you only knew, Matilde.
May I call you that?

688
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:44,818
This morning I got quite a scare.
The police came looking for me.

689
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:48,555
That's always frightening,
even with a clean conscience.

690
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:54,101
Word was out that this "insurrection"
would take place today,

691
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,068
and the dean wanted
to take precautions.

692
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:01,801
Until I heard your classmates shouting,
I only thought of my problem.

693
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,444
But now -

694
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,042
What?

695
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,445
Look out the window.

696
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:12,111
They've made me feel young
and noble and selfless again,

697
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,723
like when I used to break windows
and run from the police.

698
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:20,794
I feel like one of them.
I too shout, "Fire him!"

699
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,931
That's a good one.

700
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,232
What?

701
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:28,431
I mean...

702
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,968
you're a good man.

703
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:34,466
You mustn't lose anything
on my account.

704
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,008
Lose?

705
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,271
I've done nothing
this morning but win back

706
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,110
so many things that I'd lost.

707
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,548
Don't worry for my sake, Matilde.

708
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,819
Look. It's all settled.

709
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:53,293
- You should go join them.
- What will happen to you?

710
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,857
Nothing.

711
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:57,957
Don't worry.

712
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,031
Everything will be fine.

713
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,033
Go join them.

714
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,636
I'd like to ask a favor of you.

715
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:10,139
One day I'd like to talk to you -

716
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,440
or rather, listen to you
talk about everything,

717
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,982
how you see everything.

718
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,253
I don't understand.

719
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,082
It may seem strange,

720
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:25,819
but for so long now
I've been cut off -

721
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,063
how should I say? -

722
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:32,530
from anything real,
anything I could believe in.

723
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:36,528
Will you do that for me?
- Of course.

724
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,340
Thank you.

725
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,737
Thank you very much.

726
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,705
And good luck.

727
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:49,796
- Why are we meeting here?
- Juan, I'm so happy. We're saved.

728
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:53,305
- What about Rafa?
- Miguel took away all his ammunition.

729
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,443
Rafa knew nothing.

730
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:59,843
His every word sounded like a threat.
- But he knew something!

731
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:03,382
Yes, maybe he knew
or suspected something.

732
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:07,147
- About the cyclist?
- No, about us.

733
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:10,052
He's a dirty rat,
but I'm no longer afraid of him.

734
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,956
He can't hurt us now.
That's all in the past.

735
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:16,825
- What about the other thing?
- What other thing?

736
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,968
The accident?
Nobody saw it.

737
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,797
Juan, I'm so happy.

738
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:26,304
It feels good not to be afraid,
to feel safe.

739
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,205
It's all been so horrible.

740
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:33,210
What happened
with the students?

741
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,781
Nothing.

742
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:41,882
Listen, we should do something
for that poor man now that we're safe.

743
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:48,187
We should send
some money to his widow.

744
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,061
An anonymous gift.
Take care of it, would you?

745
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,170
Are you leaving?

746
01:02:55,404 --> 01:03:00,171
Yes. Let's let a few days go by.
We have to be careful.

747
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,104
But I need to speak to you.
It's crazy meeting here!

748
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:08,909
Yes, we'll meet and talk
just like we used to. You remember?

749
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:12,315
Just wait a few days.

750
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:15,320
I'll call you.

751
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,583
Did you want something?

752
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:19,249
No, it's late.

753
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,465
- The one in yellow isn't doing badly.
- No, he isn't.

754
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,227
He ran the 100 in 12.3.

755
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,572
You'd have settled for that
in our day.

756
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,937
Don't be so negative.
We didn't do too badly ourselves,

757
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:18,477
especially since we carried
our rifles on our backs.

758
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,809
Someone called it
"the ideal training device."

759
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:25,183
But he didn't say
for what purpose, did he?

760
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,583
How did all that turn out?

761
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,125
All what?

762
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:33,984
Don't pretend.
The trouble with the students.

763
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,732
Who was at fault?

764
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:39,965
I was.

765
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,968
What do you intend to do?

766
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,799
Set things straight.

767
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:47,000
Finally...

768
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,578
everything will be set straight.

769
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,358
Excuse me. I have to go.

770
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,686
Don't be a stranger.
You know we're fond of you.

771
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,455
I know.
Kisses to Magda and the girls.

772
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,359
Will do.

773
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,430
Hi there!

774
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,037
I'm not too late, am I?
I just got your message.

775
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,237
What's the matter?
- Nothing important.

776
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,941
I have a favor to ask,
if it's no trouble.

777
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:29,516
I'd like you to be the one
to hand this in.

778
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,323
- What is it?
- My resignation.

779
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,587
I think it's the right thing to do.

780
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,062
I came by this position easily.

781
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,759
My family has influence,
as you know.

782
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,269
It will be just as easy
to leave it.

783
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:54,170
Have you thought
this over carefully?

784
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:58,746
For the last few days -
since that very day, in fact -

785
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:01,848
I think everything over
very carefully.

786
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:07,988
Besides, I couldn't keep the job now.
I'm going away.

787
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,351
On a trip?

788
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:13,589
Something like that.

789
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,762
A journey back to myself,

790
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:20,265
though that sounds
like the title of a novel.

791
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,570
Will you be away long?

792
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,763
I'm afraid so.

793
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,672
You'll no longer be
in school when I return.

794
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,781
Perhaps you'll have
a large family by then.

795
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:39,344
- What should I do with the letter?
- Just turn it in to the administration.

796
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:45,890
It's probably a foolish bit
of symbolism on my part.

797
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:49,724
In my day
there were too many symbols.

798
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,400
Will you do me
that favor, Matilde?

799
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:59,235
And one other:
Stay just as you are - always.

800
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,002
Will you do that for me too?

801
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,375
All that's left is
to say thank you.

802
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:11,679
- For what?
- Everything.

803
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:15,482
For being who you are.
For the chance to know you.

804
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,621
Good-bye, Matilde.

805
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,456
But where are you going?

806
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,188
Where?

807
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,299
The place isn't important.

808
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:29,028
Why are you doing all this?
Why go away?

809
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:33,164
Because of something bad
that I did.

810
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,763
Bring down my large purse,
and leave that suitcase there.

811
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:03,998
Hello?

812
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,572
I said I'd call you!
You're being reckless!

813
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,606
But you didn't call.

814
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,811
I have to see you.

815
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,505
Yes, it's very important.
For both of us.

816
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:19,385
No, don't be afraid.
No one knows anything.

817
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:24,150
Darling, we can't meet.
He's insisting I go with him.

818
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,353
A trip abroad.
Today.

819
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,590
I don't know for how long.

820
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,964
You can't leave now!

821
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,332
Juan, listen!

822
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,334
Yes, he's home.
We could lose everything.

823
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,706
<i>We've already lost everything.</i>

824
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,849
<i>From now on
we only stand to gain.</i>

825
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,516
<i>I want you to come with me...</i>

826
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,953
to the police.

827
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,953
Let's turn ourselves in.

828
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,160
Yes, I understand.

829
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,460
Very well. I'll go with you.

830
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,466
<i>As always.</i>

831
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:14,364
I'll be there within an hour.

832
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:32,679
I've never understood you, Juan.

833
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,326
You're too complicated
for a woman like me.

834
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:43,331
Everything was given to me
sorted out and measured.

835
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,363
But you always
managed to escape,

836
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:50,527
and I've never known
where your true place lies.

837
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,335
Forgive me.

838
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,076
I've never known
how to help you.

839
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,269
I couldn't.

840
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:03,310
I must have been
a great disappointment to you, Mother.

841
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,483
Always searching for a way out...

842
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:10,090
like bumblebees...

843
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:13,919
flying into windowpanes.

844
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:20,830
You know,
the other day at school,

845
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,436
someone broke
the windowpane.

846
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,871
Today is a great day, Mother.

847
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,869
I found the way out,
the solution.

848
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,775
Solution to what?

849
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,539
Everything.

850
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:39,653
They won't be giving me any awards,
but I'll be a sort of hero.

851
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,493
- Are you going out?
- Yes. We'll stop by later.

852
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:53,134
- We? Who's the other person?
- The same as always, Mother.

853
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,232
<i>Rafa? Forget about him.</i>

854
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,635
<i>The important thing
is what you might say now.</i>

855
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,245
What you might do.

856
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,150
I wish I could believe in you.

857
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,252
- Miguel, you're what matters most.
- No!

858
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,451
It's not me.

859
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,584
It's your selfishness.
- My selfishness?

860
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:22,730
It's the only thing
I can use to my advantage.

861
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,496
Your selfishness,
your greed,

862
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:28,864
your lust for life,
your unquenchable desires.

863
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,834
I love you, Miguel.

864
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:34,405
No, you don't.
You love what I represent.

865
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:38,746
All this.
Everything I can give you.

866
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,843
Everything I can take away.

867
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,850
I know. It's despicable.

868
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,293
But your selfishness
is all I've got.

869
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,327
I'll go with you.
I'll always be at your side.

870
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:59,558
You'd do anything
not to lose me, wouldn't you?

871
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:00,826
Anything.

872
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:04,369
You'd throw away everything
to save your life.

873
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:05,835
Yes.

874
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,435
Very well.

875
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,811
Our plane leaves at 9:15.

876
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:19,886
We'll be going far away,
and for a long time.

877
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:24,186
You must choose.
I'll be waiting.

878
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,202
- It's late.
- Is it?

879
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:13,703
It's been so long
since we could relax.

880
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:18,005
Remember?
Last time we couldn't even kiss.

881
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,840
That was fear.

882
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,414
And shame.

883
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:25,382
Now we'll step forward
and tell them,

884
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,452
"We killed a man.

885
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,422
We left him to die
out of pure selfishness."

886
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:35,222
Tomorrow the whole world will know.
How horrible!

887
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,057
We have to do it.

888
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:40,565
How long will we be apart?

889
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,405
I don't know.
A few years.

890
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,106
Will you still love me?

891
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:57,851
You know, for the first time
in a long time,

892
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,611
I have something to believe in.

893
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:03,382
- Yourself?
- Us.

894
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,894
Our dignity.

895
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:10,359
I'm happy now,
and you should be too.

896
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,391
We'll be masters
of our own destiny.

897
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:17,003
We'll say no to so much filth,
including this affair.

898
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,868
We won't lie and sneak around
to see each other.

899
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,442
We have to make a clean start.

900
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:27,976
What?

901
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:31,243
- What if it was all a lie?
- All what?

902
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,913
Everything.

903
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,417
What if I didn't love you?

904
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:43,030
What if I refused to go
to the police?

905
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,665
- I'd still go.
- Without me.

906
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,792
But I'd still go.

907
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,062
So I could still save myself.

908
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,933
No, you couldn't.

909
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,005
And you wouldn't save me?

910
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,939
No, there's nothing I can do.
They would know.

911
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,670
And I'd lose everything, right?

912
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:03,683
- What do you think you still have?
- I have you.

913
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:07,114
No, not if you didn't love me.

914
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,414
- Then I could keep -
- Your world?

915
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,186
If you left me now,

916
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:18,492
I'd drag you down with me
without even meaning to.

917
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,293
I feel so alone.

918
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:32,412
You're with me now.

919
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,481
You should have been
with me all along.

920
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:39,313
I love you so much!
I've loved you for so long!

921
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:45,223
We have to purify ourselves,
become clean and good again,

922
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:48,624
and pay for a crime we committed.
I love you!

923
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,158
I love you!

924
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:03,233
His resignation?
How strange.

925
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,342
I knew nothing of this.

926
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:06,980
Why?

927
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,650
- He mentioned a trip.
- A trip?

928
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,718
I don't wish to alarm you, but -
I don't know...

929
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:16,049
- Do you fear for him?
- Yes. Something he said struck me.

930
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:20,957
- About what?
- The reason for his trip, and that letter.

931
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,496
I remember perfectly.

932
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,827
"Because of something bad
that I did."

933
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,538
Something bad.

934
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,238
That's odd.

935
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:44,010
I can't imagine Juan
ever doing anything bad.

936
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,686
Is he that good?

937
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,879
Yes, I've always believed he was.

938
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,820
But perhaps I was mistaken.

939
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,726
But you must know him so well.

940
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,056
I love him very much,
but that's not enough.

941
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:03,368
Perhaps I should know him,
but how?

942
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,406
I often look at this photo album.

943
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:09,975
The pictures seem so strange.

944
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:12,408
I see my children grow up.

945
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,275
Their first communion...

946
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,451
school...

947
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,085
military service...

948
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,621
politics...

949
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,919
the war...

950
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,525
death.

951
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:32,863
The trenches
were right over there.

952
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,263
I thought of you,

953
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:38,030
all the moments
we'd spent together,

954
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,435
our last vacation together.

955
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:43,372
I still had faith
in so many things.

956
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:45,170
I loved you.

957
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,913
I had great plans for the future.

958
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,184
It's strange.

959
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:54,685
This is the most important place
in the world for you and me.

960
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:58,554
There's always been
some part of us here.

961
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:03,191
Memories during the war,
and then later -

962
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,425
It was right here, wasn't it?

963
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,606
We killed a man
in this very spot.

964
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,941
We left him to die
because he was a nuisance.

965
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,479
Are you cold?

966
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,629
I like this hour of the day.
Twilight.

967
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,322
There's a moment
when everything falls silent.

968
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:53,237
I want so much to live,
like never before.

969
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:56,483
It's hard to start over...

970
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,616
but it's good.

971
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:02,446
You see?

972
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:04,885
The whole earth is in order.

973
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,461
There's only silence...

974
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,023
and peace.
