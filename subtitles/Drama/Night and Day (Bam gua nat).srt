16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,635
During the summer of 2007,

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,107
Kim Sung-nam smoked marijuana
with exchange students from the US.

18
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:16,545
One of the students got arrested
and revealed Kim Sung-nam's name.

19
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,520
Sung-nam's friend, Mr. Baek,
told him about this.

20
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:31,476
Sung-nam became terrified
and took the next flight to Paris.

21
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,924
August 8

22
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,348
Do you have a light?

23
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:54,016
A lighter!

24
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,568
August 9

25
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,079
I stayed at the first floor
of the guesthouse.

26
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:10,319
Over ten people sleep in one room
and it reeks so bad.

27
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:37,346
I'm here in Paris.

28
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:42,017
I'm going to clean myself up
and make a new start.

29
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:44,086
I will.

30
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:05,541
The air's very fresh for a city.

31
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:07,810
It has no humidity.

32
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:27,763
August 11

33
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:42,845
I finally found an open
cigarette store after four tries.

34
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,325
5 euros and 20 centimes.

35
00:05:58,527 --> 00:05:59,528
5 euros and 20 centimes.

36
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:04,333
Hardly any cigarettes here
because it's the only place open.

37
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:12,041
Look, there are hardly
any cigarettes here.

38
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:14,543
They must be sold out.

39
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:17,012
That's because it's the only store
that's open.

40
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:49,011
She has a very nice figure.

41
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,258
I don't think I could
fall in love again like them.

42
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,102
August 12

43
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:15,137
Good morning.

44
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:16,872
Have a good night's sleep?

45
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:18,707
Got over the jet lag?

46
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,743
I got some good sleep last night.

47
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,545
- Doing laundry?
- Just folding them up.

48
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,315
It keeps raining.

49
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:27,983
Yes, it sure is.

50
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:30,185
See you later.

51
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,795
Do you know how to use the internet?

52
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:44,967
No, I'm not good at computers.

53
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:47,035
The wireless doesn't work.

54
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:49,404
But it's brand new.

55
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:53,842
Sorry, I don't know much
about computers.

56
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,544
I see.

57
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:11,860
Do you go to church?

58
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,163
No, I don't.

59
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:17,366
But you're reading the bible.

60
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,069
Oh, this?
It was just lying around.

61
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:25,007
It's like a history book to me.
It's fun so I read it sometimes.

62
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,542
Oh, I see.

63
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:30,546
That book has completely
changed my life.

64
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,748
Oh, really.

65
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,553
Will you be here this afternoon?

66
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:41,557
We're having a small party.

67
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:42,324
Really?

68
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:46,528
Yes, have a drink with us
if you have time.

69
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:49,031
Sure, I think I'll be here.

70
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:49,932
How about you?

71
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:53,402
Sorry, I'm afraid I'll be late.

72
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:54,803
Okay.

73
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:02,711
It's the evening and the guy
hosting the party isn't here.

74
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:05,380
It's inconvenient
smoking out here, isn't it?

75
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:09,318
No, I'm fine.
It helps me smoke less anyway.

76
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,320
Would you like a cigarette?

77
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,667
So what brought you here this time?

78
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:27,469
Nothing special.

79
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,771
Although I'm a bit old now,

80
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:32,875
I thought I should come here
at least once since I'm a painter.

81
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:34,743
Lots of things to see here.

82
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:39,047
Nowhere else in the world
like this city.

83
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,483
That's right.

84
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:47,789
Anyway, you look good.

85
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:52,361
You would've been a general
if you were born long ago.

86
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,163
You have a nice impression, too.

87
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,399
A very nice impression.

88
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:00,002
Do you mind if we shake hands?

89
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:01,570
Of course not.

90
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:08,076
I have a friend and she's young.

91
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:10,212
I'll introduce her to you.

92
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:15,484
She calls me daddy
and she'll be good to you.

93
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:17,586
She also studies painting.

94
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:23,725
She can help you out with things
and show you around.

95
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,661
Thank you for your help.

96
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,163
It's the least I can do for you.

97
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:30,966
I only do the things I like to do.

98
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,801
I see.

99
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:36,138
Would you like to shake hands again?

100
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:37,339
Of course.

101
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,248
That was fun!

102
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,952
By the way,
why does the sun set so late here?

103
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:55,023
It gets dark around ten.

104
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,694
We can't easily tell night from day
during summers here.

105
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,362
Is that so?

106
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,369
August 13

107
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:16,345
Do you know how I'm living here,
Sung-in?

108
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:27,222
I miss you.

109
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,661
Me too.

110
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:36,164
I miss you so much, too.

111
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:41,803
Honey!

112
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,275
This is so terrible.

113
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:56,551
Tell me what should I do?

114
00:11:57,753 --> 00:12:00,389
She got no phone call yet
from the police.

115
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:03,892
I told her to wait a few more days.

116
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:08,497
We decided that I'd call her
at one every night.

117
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:14,603
Sung-nam.

118
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:22,782
I don't have the strength.

119
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:30,303
I took a nap in the church
at the rotary.

120
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:07,489
Excuse me.

121
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,158
Excuse me for just a moment.

122
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,526
What?

123
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,262
You're Korean, right?
Do you know me?

124
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:17,966
You must be kidding me.

125
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:20,535
Do you know me?

126
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,943
Hey, what did you say?

127
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:30,812
What's wrong with you?

128
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,250
You're really pathetic.

129
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,018
What?

130
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:39,988
Can't recognize me?

131
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,891
It's me.

132
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,695
You really don't know me?

133
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,233
No, I don't. Who are you?

134
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,572
Wait!
Tell me who you are first!

135
00:13:58,406 --> 00:14:00,108
Stop treating me like this.

136
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:02,644
All the way here in Paris!

137
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:06,248
What the hell are you thinking?

138
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:13,021
Hey!

139
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:16,525
Wait! Wait!

140
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:19,961
I'm sorry.

141
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:22,297
You're Min-sun, right?

142
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:25,467
What a coincidence!

143
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,103
You're really crazy, you know!

144
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:33,942
We dated ten years ago
but she seems to be angry with me.

145
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,311
Oh, you remember me now.

146
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:40,482
You're quick to forget.
What the hell's in your brain?

147
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:44,252
Sorry, I've been losing
my memory lately.

148
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:46,321
It's inherited.

149
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:50,258
You haven't changed at all.

150
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:57,632
Fortunately, she let up soon
and we went to a cafe.

151
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,704
I'm sorry.
I really couldn't remember you.

152
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,874
August 15

153
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:07,542
Wow, you're really strong.

154
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,444
Again?

155
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,281
One, two, three!

156
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,586
You're really strong!

157
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,187
You're stronger than you look.

158
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:20,822
He's too worn out now.

159
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:22,290
You better not.

160
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,793
I don't think he'll win.

161
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:26,361
Hold it tight.

162
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:27,562
One, two, three!

163
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:32,033
Wow! You're so strong!

164
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:36,404
When I was young,
I met a cook at a Chinese restaurant.

165
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:40,041
I arm wrestled him
and his arm was this big.

166
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,345
But I can't beat young guys lately.
They're too strong.

167
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:46,548
But you beat them all.

168
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:50,318
To paint,
I need a strong arm and power.

169
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:52,921
August 16

170
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,969
Now I can start forgiving you.

171
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:46,908
Remember what you said
while we were in love?

172
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,778
I'm embarrassed that I don't.

173
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:55,116
Know how many times
I had an abortion because of you?

174
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,254
Six times.

175
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:01,723
Really?

176
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:03,591
Six times!

177
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,294
Are you serious?

178
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:09,831
Why didn't you tell me?

179
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,766
What for?

180
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:17,739
I must've felt intimidated by you.
I couldn't even tell you about it.

181
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:22,377
Well, you did try to be
polite around me.

182
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:26,381
Stop talking about the past.
I'm sick of it.

183
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,051
Dummy.

184
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,153
Sorry.

185
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,522
Give me your hand.

186
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,099
What brings you here?

187
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,268
Do you live around here?

188
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,071
Yeah, I live just over there.

189
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,709
So what are you doing here?

190
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,446
Oh, I have an urgent thing to do.

191
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,248
What is it?

192
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,585
I told you something came up.

193
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:08,056
It's been a long time.
The rib stew you made was delicious.

194
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,658
Yes, it was.

195
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,429
- Okay, then I'll see you later.
- Bye.

196
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,710
It upsets me to even see her.

197
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,211
Why?

198
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:34,149
She's too realistic and stingy.

199
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:40,321
She doesn't care what others say
and keeps talking about herself.

200
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:44,125
Do you know how cheap
her conversation is?

201
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,962
She shows no reaction
if others say something funny or sad.

202
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,064
She only cares about herself.

203
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:55,003
And she goes to Beaux-Arts
to be a painter.

204
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,174
She always shows it off
even though it's no big deal.

205
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:00,809
She really sucks.

206
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,144
I don't like women
who are realistic.

207
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:05,513
Women don't need to be realistic.

208
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:07,849
What?

209
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,185
Women don't need to be realistic.

210
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:12,587
She's stingy.

211
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,989
Do you know her well?

212
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,191
No, I don't.

213
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:21,062
Can't help knowing her
since few Koreans live around here.

214
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:24,732
You know how much
she chases after men?

215
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,068
She has no shame.

216
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:33,274
You know, girls like her
just can't live a second without men.

217
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:34,843
That's what she is.

218
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,611
Now I see.

219
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:44,185
That girl made Min-sun feel guilty
about being a married woman.

220
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:49,190
Oh yeah, the day I met you...

221
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,393
Was it a mistake?

222
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:53,862
What?

223
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:56,598
I told my husband about you.

224
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:02,604
He kept pressing me, so I told him
that I'd meet you today.

225
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:05,006
Really?

226
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,509
Your husband's French, right?

227
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:13,348
Yeah, he's a nice man
but he didn't understand me.

228
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:17,986
He was mad at me even though
I did nothing wrong.

229
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:20,822
So I just told him the truth.

230
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,857
So, you did.

231
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,027
Doesn't he worry about you?

232
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:29,797
He knows I'm meeting you anyway.

233
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:33,568
He'll be okay.

234
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:36,271
I'll just explain everything later.

235
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:39,641
Okay, I guess that'll do.

236
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:56,925
I'm going home later.

237
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:58,693
I'm a little drunk anyway.

238
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:01,763
You're too drunk. Go home.

239
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:13,274
Sounds like you're chasing me away.
How sad.

240
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:15,710
Don't say that.

241
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:18,980
I didn't mean that.
You're late so hurry home.

242
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,420
I'm too drunk.
I'll stay out longer.

243
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:30,091
What's wrong with you?
I have to go now and so should you!

244
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,528
Are you sure you have to go now?

245
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:36,030
Are you?

246
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:43,304
Sorry, I have to go. Bye.

247
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:51,779
I felt like Min-sun's husband
was watching us from somewhere.

248
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:54,115
My feet were sweating.

249
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:03,091
August 19

250
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:06,494
Yes, I'll write you.

251
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:09,564
I'll write everything
I want to say to you.

252
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:11,532
That's good.

253
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,570
You can barely talk on the phone
since someone might hear.

254
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:19,540
How have you been?
What did you do today?

255
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,810
Nothing really.

256
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:27,015
I bumped into a school friend
by chance a few days ago.

257
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:31,085
She's married to a French man
and he's a folklorist.

258
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,588
She even has an atelier
in her home.

259
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,724
A woman?

260
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,526
Yes, a woman.

261
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:40,395
She seemed to be happily married.

262
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:43,931
And she hasn't given up painting.

263
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:47,235
If she could help you, ask her to.

264
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,605
You know nobody there,
so ask her about this and that.

265
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:54,842
It's hard since I haven't
seen her for so long.

266
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,811
People here are different.

267
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:02,183
They're all too busy to help others.

268
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:03,885
Really?

269
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,157
I've been talking to your mother.

270
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:11,793
I persuaded her a little more.

271
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:15,963
If she helps us out,
we could get a room there in Paris.

272
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:19,967
Then I could go there to be with you.

273
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,103
She's going to help us out?

274
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,405
It looks likely.

275
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:29,243
She told the police I'm traveling,
and they hung up the phone.

276
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:34,782
If it all ends up bad,
I could never return to Korea.

277
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:38,720
Wait for me. I'll go to you.

278
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:42,290
Okay, try your best.

279
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,427
I'm so sorry.

280
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,864
August 21

281
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:58,005
You don't look very good.

282
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,675
No, I'm fine.

283
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:03,211
You're always saying that.

284
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:06,047
Get going.

285
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,548
Okay.

286
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:08,883
Have fun.

287
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,385
- See you later.
- Have a good trip.

288
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:12,653
Okay, thank you.

289
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,188
Bye.

290
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:18,493
I went to the Orsay Museum with
the girl Mr. Jang introduced me to.

291
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,630
I decided to be nice to her
since she could help me.

292
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:26,667
Here it is. It's all Courbet's.

293
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,571
You're right.

294
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:33,508
Do you like it?

295
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,076
Yes, I do.

296
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,478
I didn't see this here before.

297
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:39,213
It's a really famous painting.

298
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,315
This is my first time seeing it.

299
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:43,885
Really? That's great.

300
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:48,523
Don't you feel embarrassed
while looking at it?

301
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:49,524
Why?

302
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:52,260
What's strange about a painting
expressing the origin of humans?

303
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:53,995
It's the origin of the world.

304
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:57,298
Oh, sorry.

305
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:05,406
But shouldn't we feel
some respect for art work?

306
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,844
Well, I care for the painting
not the title.

307
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:13,614
- What do you think?
- Maybe you're right.

308
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,870
I like the clouds here.

309
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:38,239
They hang low here.

310
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,075
I paint clouds, you know.

311
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,643
Oh, you do?

312
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:44,846
Mr. Jang must like you a lot.

313
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:48,082
Usually, he doesn't ask me a favor
like this since I'm busy.

314
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,251
Yes, he is very nice.

315
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm sorry for bothering you.

316
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:55,623
That's okay.
I also enjoyed the paintings.

317
00:25:56,691 --> 00:26:00,561
So are you studying theory
to be a professor in Seoul later?

318
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:03,164
I hope so!

319
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:05,933
Where do you live?

320
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,470
Not far from where you're staying.
About five minutes away?

321
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,538
In an apartment?

322
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:14,175
No, I live in a one-room flat
with my roommate.

323
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,811
Roommate? A school friend?

324
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:19,480
No, I just met her as a roommate.

325
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:22,350
She paints and goes to Beaux-Arts.

326
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,354
By the way,
how much do you pay rent here?

327
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:32,093
560 euros, excluding the subsidy.

328
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:36,664
- You got a subsidy, too?
- Yes, about 180 euros.

329
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:39,033
What subsidizes you?

330
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,134
The government.

331
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,670
As long as the place
isn't so expensive.

332
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:44,639
Everybody gets it if they apply.

333
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:48,309
Why does the government subsidize?
Foreign students get it, too?

334
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:50,645
Anyone who applies gets it.

335
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,648
What a strange country.

336
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,182
Yes, it's great.

337
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:59,654
From the government?

338
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:02,456
August 23

339
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:10,398
Min-sun came over to the guesthouse.

340
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:13,534
It was my mistake to tell her
I'm staying at the Blue House.

341
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:21,008
She surprisingly showed up
while I was reading the Bible.

342
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:11,192
You're so beautiful.

343
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,661
Sit down here.

344
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,365
I've gained a lot of weight, huh?

345
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,667
I'm ashamed of it.

346
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:22,703
I'm the one who's ashamed.

347
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,206
I'm sorry for bringing you here.

348
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,774
No, it's okay.

349
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:36,217
Do you want to see this?

350
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,786
I'll read it to you, so listen.

351
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:46,761
"If your hand commits a sin,
cut it off. "

352
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:51,465
"You'd rather enter life
without the hand

353
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:56,604
than enter the flame of hell
with it. "

354
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:57,638
What is it?

355
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:04,445
"If your eye does a lewd thing,
fork it out. "

356
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:09,817
"You'd rather enter God's land
with one eye

357
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:13,921
than be thrown to the flame of hell
with two eyes. "

358
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:20,461
We really have to think about this.

359
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:23,931
We have to overcome temptation.

360
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:27,935
not to be merely moralistic,
but that it's more practical.

361
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,905
We can gain much more
if we overcome our sins.

362
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:34,175
We can maintain
peace in our minds forever.

363
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:35,876
I know.

364
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:40,915
What it says is how I truly feel.

365
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:45,686
You're so beautiful.

366
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:49,090
And you drive me crazy.

367
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:53,394
Hey, let's get out of here.

368
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:54,628
I feel that we should go.

369
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,131
It's more 'practical' for us!

370
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:59,266
Let's not lose 'peace in our minds'!

371
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:02,770
Not for that damn
one moment of desire!

372
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:11,112
No.

373
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,081
I'm okay, really.

374
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:22,423
You don't know.

375
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,962
Nobody knows
what I'm putting up with.

376
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:36,170
Just once, okay?

377
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,308
Do it once, please.

378
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,084
I know what you're going through.

379
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:52,620
I feel the same as you.

380
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:58,792
But why don't we just think
beyond how we see things?

381
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:03,531
We better fork out these eyes!

382
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,333
They why did you bring me here?

383
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:09,770
You shouldn't treat me like this.

384
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:15,643
Why can't you understand
what I'm trying to say to you?

385
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:29,657
I was amazed about
how that phrase had come to me.

386
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:58,085
August 24

387
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,588
She's too inconsiderate.

388
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,256
I can't understand her.

389
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,825
How could she do this to her son?

390
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,894
Are you really her son?

391
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:11,665
If I were her, I'd give my son
all that I have and more.

392
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,867
How could she be like this?

393
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,570
I can't understand her.

394
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:20,307
She's different from you.
Just forget about it.

395
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:22,376
Don't let it stress you more.

396
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:26,580
She's just different from you.

397
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:30,117
What are you going to do?

398
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,819
You must've run out of money.

399
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,291
I guess I'll find a way somehow.

400
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:41,428
Shall I go to a restaurant?

401
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,431
Restaurant? Why?

402
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,700
To work there?

403
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:47,935
I don't like it.

404
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,837
Why do you want to do
that kind of work?

405
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,673
I'm just looking into it.

406
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:54,341
No, don't do it.

407
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:56,710
Don't say that to me again!

408
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,912
Okay, don't get upset.

409
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,384
Then what else can I do here
to make money?

410
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:07,521
No, I don't want to hear it.
Stop it.

411
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:18,666
Sung-in, I saw a plane
in the afternoon.

412
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:23,370
This might be funny to you,
but I hated that plane.

413
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:27,408
I hated it
for dropping me alone here.

414
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:32,646
I called Mr. Baek today.

415
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,850
He said it could be better
if you give yourself in.

416
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,054
That's bullshit!

417
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:43,123
He can say that
since he's not in my position!

418
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:46,026
He calls that advice, damn it?

419
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,131
He's just concerned about you,
so don't be upset.

420
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,736
Anyway, I don't trust anyone.

421
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:58,839
I trust no one but you.

422
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:04,278
I'll find a way to live.

423
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,414
I'll find a way for real
starting tomorrow.

424
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:11,161
August 26

425
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:32,373
I'm sorry I'm late.

426
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:34,007
That's all right.

427
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,676
Hello.

428
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:37,644
This is my roommate.

429
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:38,812
Nice to meet you.

430
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,547
Thank you for coming out.

431
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:43,183
Anyhow, the school is closed.

432
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,818
Nobody can go in during break.

433
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:46,086
I'm sorry.

434
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:47,454
We can go to the gallery.

435
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,990
It completely shuts down
during the break?

436
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:51,458
That's strange.

437
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:54,061
Every other school does the same.

438
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:55,696
So nobody can go in?

439
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:57,765
Yes, it's closed.

440
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,566
The school is completely empty.

441
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,101
I see.

442
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:10,377
- It's great.
- Yeah, it is.

443
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:15,482
Her roommate goes to Beaux-Arts,
so she came out to show me around.

444
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:18,118
I think I have to buy them dinner.

445
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:21,755
Her roommate is the girl
I saw before with Min-sun.

446
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:24,224
I've seen this name before.

447
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:26,794
Yes, it's a famous gallery.

448
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:31,165
But it seems closed.

449
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:35,602
It's closed until August 28th.
They're probably on vacation.

450
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:37,471
They're pretty diligent about it.

451
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:41,308
By the way, don't you think
this memo is cute?

452
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:44,945
It looks like it's written as,
"I'm right next door. "

453
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,381
Yes, I like how they're casual
about things.

454
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,017
Whether the gallery is famous or not.

455
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:54,521
Sir, maybe one day you'll exhibit
your paintings in there, too.

456
00:35:54,855 --> 00:35:55,656
What? Me?

457
00:35:58,225 --> 00:35:59,693
I wish I could.

458
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,464
All the best galleries like this
come see the graduates' exhibition.

459
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:06,533
If they're selected,
they sign contracts on the spot.

460
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,535
That would be so great.

461
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:11,104
Now I see why so many galleries
are by your school.

462
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:12,906
Yes, I have to do my best!

463
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:14,007
Your best!

464
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:18,779
That's good to hear, but I'd like
for you to not call me 'sir. '

465
00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:21,148
Then how do you want me
to address you?

466
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:24,985
I just thought
you were quite older than me.

467
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:29,523
I don't care, actually,
but "sir" doesn't sound appropriate.

468
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,859
It doesn't suit me anyway.

469
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:33,260
Okay, I understand.

470
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:34,595
Let's go.

471
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,551
- Please come in.
- Okay.

472
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:08,562
Promise me you won't use
any of this elsewhere.

473
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:09,696
Of course.

474
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:12,366
Here.

475
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:17,337
I realized while studying here
that painting is basically an idea.

476
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,873
It all starts with an idea.

477
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:23,176
So can you promise
that you won't use this?

478
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:26,213
Yes, don't worry.

479
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:29,149
Be careful.

480
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,717
It's the only one I have.

481
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:32,052
She cares for it so much.

482
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,122
I'll be careful.

483
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:39,259
Aren't these clothes?

484
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:42,062
Yes, they're shirts somebody hung out,

485
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:45,532
and I loved
the sun's reflection on them.

486
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,469
Those are about figure skating.

487
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:52,773
The woman is heavy
so the man is suffering.

488
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,377
This is the moment of dependence.

489
00:37:57,477 --> 00:38:00,347
And this is the moment
of connection.

490
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:04,217
This one looks like a sinner.

491
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:08,922
Well, everybody commits a sin.

492
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:11,191
Don't you?

493
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:12,225
No.

494
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,564
There's no one.
Only the clothes are left.

495
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:20,767
They're for the artist book.

496
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:32,245
I wanted to paint the "House of Sand. "
They'll be the characters in it.

497
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:33,647
How about this one?

498
00:38:34,114 --> 00:38:35,015
That one, too.

499
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,351
A calf with two heads.

500
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:43,323
Go ahead.

501
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,057
Okay.

502
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,558
Why'd you pretend
that you didn't know me?

503
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,826
Have you seen him before?

504
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,162
We've seen each other, haven't we?

505
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,933
Yes, we did.

506
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:31,304
I was going to tell you that.

507
00:39:41,615 --> 00:39:45,318
I saw your pictures today, right?

508
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,423
Do you want me to tell you
what I think about your pictures?

509
00:39:50,957 --> 00:39:52,926
I'm curious, too.

510
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,937
No, I'm too drunk now.

511
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:10,310
It would be better to talk
about others' works when I'm sober.

512
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,447
After taking a shower.

513
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:18,785
Actually, I'm not too curious
about what you think.

514
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:26,326
I've never met anyone
who knows more about my work than me.

515
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:30,397
But you like them, right?

516
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:36,803
Yes, very much.

517
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:40,574
Thank you.

518
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,711
Let's toast.

519
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:45,679
Let me pour you one.

520
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:46,947
I'm okay.

521
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:49,583
The food here is terrible.

522
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:53,620
I think it'll cost
at least 150 euros.

523
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:08,135
Do you still dream
of becoming a great painter?

524
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:10,570
Pardon?

525
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:24,417
You must not want to answer.

526
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:26,086
I'm sorry.

527
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:31,291
No, you don't have to be sorry.

528
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:34,594
I have something
I'd like to hear from you.

529
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:36,263
Answer me in two answers.

530
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,531
What are they?

531
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:38,832
What is a painting?

532
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,334
And what is painting to you?

533
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,237
Painting?

534
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,139
Yes, two answers.

535
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,442
Two answers?

536
00:41:57,651 --> 00:42:00,120
August 27

537
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:31,551
The old hill of golden grass
where I and Maggie were playing

538
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:46,199
I hear the water mill, Maggie,
with the old dim memory

539
00:42:46,633 --> 00:43:02,048
The hill is covered with the bushes
and the roses are all in full bloom

540
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:17,397
I hear the water mill, Maggie
Oh, my love Maggie

541
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:19,866
August 28

542
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,535
Isabelle, ever since Hugo was little,

543
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:26,539
we've had a lot of important
family events at this restaurant.

544
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:28,041
I'm so glad to be here with you.

545
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:28,975
Yes.

546
00:43:29,142 --> 00:43:31,278
I'm happy to be here, too.

547
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:35,048
You two met at the Lille?
I believe that's what Hugo said.

548
00:43:35,148 --> 00:43:37,651
Yes, we met during the festival
a few months ago.

549
00:43:37,884 --> 00:43:41,321
We're members of the same association.

550
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:46,393
It's cold today, isn't it?

551
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:48,662
Especially outside.

552
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:52,299
Where are you going?

553
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:53,867
Home.

554
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,904
It's good to see you.

555
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,806
Me, too.

556
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,743
Do you need anything?

557
00:44:05,445 --> 00:44:07,981
Something warm.

558
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:16,990
And something to eat.
Ham or cheese.

559
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,693
Okay, wait a moment.

560
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:49,656
Thank you.

561
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:07,607
See you later, bye.

562
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:13,213
Did you treat him?

563
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:15,281
Yes, to a sandwich.

564
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,351
Going home?

565
00:45:18,685 --> 00:45:19,519
Yes.

566
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,121
How are you doing?

567
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:22,288
Fine.

568
00:45:22,455 --> 00:45:23,790
And you?

569
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,191
Good.

570
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:28,795
It's nothing but a miracle.

571
00:45:28,928 --> 00:45:31,031
She's a very beautiful person.

572
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,568
What a miracle
from our ordinary lives.

573
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:38,405
Doesn't this give people
a reason to live?

574
00:45:56,556 --> 00:45:58,458
What's so funny?

575
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:01,795
Do you like oysters?

576
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:04,130
People here seem to eat it
very often.

577
00:46:04,397 --> 00:46:05,331
Is it expensive?

578
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:07,801
They eat it a lot.
It's not so expensive.

579
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:10,336
It tastes better
if you squeeze lemon on it.

580
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,671
Can I buy some for you?

581
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:14,808
Oh, thank you.
I also appreciate the dinner before.

582
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:17,710
But not today, I'm so tired now.

583
00:46:17,977 --> 00:46:21,514
Oh, I just wanted to treat you.

584
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:24,451
I'm tired from my part-time job.

585
00:46:24,684 --> 00:46:25,618
Part-time job?

586
00:46:25,852 --> 00:46:27,921
I'm working at a restaurant.

587
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:31,024
It must be very tough for you.

588
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:40,033
One of the co-workers mocked me
because of my clumsy French.

589
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:42,202
I had made a small mistake.

590
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:48,007
No one there but her
laughed at me loudly.

591
00:46:48,174 --> 00:46:49,576
She is so jealous.

592
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:53,880
You know those girls who always want
to be the prettiest around.

593
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:56,316
She's so ugly and pathetic.

594
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:59,018
Yeah, I know those kinds of girls.

595
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:01,821
So can I leave now?

596
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:06,559
Yes, of course.
Glad to see you again.

597
00:47:06,893 --> 00:47:08,061
I need some sleep.

598
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:10,363
Yes, have a good rest.

599
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,765
Buy me oysters later.

600
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,901
Sure.

601
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,062
September 1

602
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:46,099
Oh, it's you.

603
00:47:49,936 --> 00:47:51,204
It's an old one.

604
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:53,239
Oh, it's a pine tree.

605
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:57,977
They're from my exhibition.

606
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:00,480
Very nice.

607
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:02,982
You also put clouds
in the pine tree paintings.

608
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:05,251
You seem to like clouds a lot.

609
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,687
Yes, I like the wind too.

610
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:08,955
I see.

611
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:12,792
Very nice.

612
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:18,665
Since I kept talking about oysters,

613
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:21,901
Hyun-ju suggested that we buy some
at a seafood store.

614
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:25,104
I've thought about oysters
for several days.

615
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:31,778
Yu-jeong, wake up.

616
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:33,279
Yu-jeong.

617
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:35,615
She sleeps like a log.

618
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:36,916
Yes, she really does.

619
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,853
She even slept
during a big party here.

620
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:43,089
- Really?
- Yes.

621
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:46,159
Yu-jeong, wake up.

622
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:50,730
She couldn't sleep in high school
because she studied so much.

623
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,633
So she's been addicted to sleep
every since she came here.

624
00:48:54,534 --> 00:48:58,504
She didn't wake up even when
we splashed water on her.

625
00:48:58,671 --> 00:48:59,706
Are you serious?

626
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,444
Do you want some more?

627
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:05,745
Yes, thank you.
Yes, thank you.

628
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:08,281
Just a little.
Need to save some for Yu-jeong.

629
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:10,383
She doesn't like oysters.

630
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:13,553
I see.

631
00:49:31,738 --> 00:49:33,706
Her feet are so pretty!

632
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:38,411
- Please don't see me out.
- No, it's okay.

633
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:40,980
I drank a lot, didn't I?

634
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:42,015
Get some rest.

635
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:43,216
I'm okay.

636
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:46,953
A lot of people are out here.

637
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:52,058
You were great in helping me
break the boredom in Paris.

638
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:53,459
Thank you.

639
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:55,895
You look pretty when you blush.

640
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:57,630
Really?

641
00:49:58,431 --> 00:49:59,632
Thank you.

642
00:50:21,554 --> 00:50:23,589
Yu-jeong didn't wake up till I left.

643
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:25,158
She sleeps too much.

644
00:50:26,392 --> 00:50:28,661
I think I truly love her.

645
00:50:29,262 --> 00:50:31,264
She is such a beautiful woman.

646
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:37,537
September 3

647
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:05,431
I read a Korean newspaper.

648
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:17,577
Then I learned about the South-North
Korean summit in Pyongyang.

649
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,986
I got frustrated with being alone.

650
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:30,656
So I went by the guesthouse
by foot, not by subway.

651
00:51:34,694 --> 00:51:36,863
I got lost like an idiot.

652
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:40,133
I used the black building
to find my way.

653
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:06,259
I was so glad to find
the Alesia Church.

654
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:08,928
I'm finally home.

655
00:52:19,605 --> 00:52:22,074
September 4

656
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:24,911
Sung-in, what are you doing?

657
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:28,114
I was just writing in my diary
in our room.

658
00:52:28,714 --> 00:52:29,515
I see.

659
00:52:32,952 --> 00:52:35,922
I feel so frustrated today.

660
00:52:37,223 --> 00:52:43,329
Anyway, can you do it for me?

661
00:52:43,696 --> 00:52:45,798
What? Do what?

662
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,534
Well, you know...

663
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:54,474
Can you masturbate for me?

664
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:55,241
What?

665
00:52:55,274 --> 00:52:57,910
I'm sorry, but please do it.

666
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:03,649
I'm having a hard time
and I miss your voice so much.

667
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:06,752
Can you do it on the bed?

668
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,422
Can you do it for me?

669
00:53:14,994 --> 00:53:16,963
Are you serious?

670
00:53:18,664 --> 00:53:20,333
Where are you now?

671
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:23,436
This is so embarrassing.

672
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:28,007
I'm sitting alone in the living room.

673
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:31,010
So I can't do it myself.

674
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,682
I really miss your sound.

675
00:53:38,317 --> 00:53:40,319
It'll be great, really.

676
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:45,725
Okay.

677
00:53:47,193 --> 00:53:48,895
Wait a second.

678
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:50,997
I'll go wash my hands.

679
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:53,666
Okay.

680
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,779
September 6

681
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:12,718
- Good morning.
- Hello.

682
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:17,319
Take this medicine.

683
00:54:22,528 --> 00:54:23,396
Thank you.

684
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:25,164
It'll work well.

685
00:54:30,336 --> 00:54:32,638
- Your forehead.
- Sure.

686
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,975
It's okay. No fever.

687
00:54:36,108 --> 00:54:38,678
- Thank you.
- Sure.

688
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,835
I have to go home.

689
00:55:04,604 --> 00:55:06,372
I will go home.

690
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:21,854
Oh, hi.

691
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:24,724
I'm on my way to see something fun.
Do you want to come?

692
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,162
No, I better get some rest.

693
00:56:28,387 --> 00:56:31,123
Why are you so sneaky?

694
00:56:31,657 --> 00:56:35,227
Be a man and act like one.

695
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:42,268
I'm going to tell your wife
when she comes later.

696
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:45,438
I swear I will.

697
00:56:48,007 --> 00:56:51,110
I'm sorry. I really am.

698
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:55,548
Be a man and do it.

699
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:08,094
I dreamed of her all day long.

700
00:57:11,864 --> 00:57:14,400
September 7

701
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:15,361
He has a house and a car.
I envy him.

702
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:21,834
Good morning.

703
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:25,304
How'd you know where I live?

704
00:58:26,872 --> 00:58:28,741
I came here with you before.

705
00:58:29,475 --> 00:58:31,510
Oh, that's right.

706
00:58:31,644 --> 00:58:34,180
Sorry, I forgot.

707
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,981
I'm sorry.

708
00:58:36,248 --> 00:58:37,216
Where are you going?

709
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:39,552
I have something urgent to do.

710
00:58:39,718 --> 00:58:41,053
Where are you headed?

711
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:45,291
Well, just somewhere...

712
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:49,061
I'm sorry to bother you.

713
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:51,697
Are you here to see Hyun-ju?
She's not here.

714
00:58:51,797 --> 00:58:52,765
Why don't you come by later?

715
00:58:52,832 --> 00:58:57,603
I thought I could see you any time.

716
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:03,142
Oh, so you did.

717
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:07,847
It took me a lot of courage
to come here.

718
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:12,117
We are very busy people.

719
00:59:12,451 --> 00:59:14,286
I know.

720
00:59:15,454 --> 00:59:18,090
I'm not good
at expressing myself, but...

721
00:59:18,557 --> 00:59:22,761
I'm sorry for telling you this.

722
00:59:23,395 --> 00:59:29,034
I'd rather meet a woman
than a married man.

723
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:32,404
Sure, I know.

724
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,775
But why do you
have to emphasize that?

725
00:59:36,942 --> 00:59:39,111
When did I ever emphasize it?

726
00:59:40,846 --> 00:59:42,781
Come with Hyun-ju later.

727
01:00:37,036 --> 01:00:39,505
I'm lonely, but it's better
not to meet anybody.

728
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:42,374
The people here don't know
what circumstances they're in.

729
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:45,311
Their lives are full of hypocrisy.

730
01:00:45,477 --> 01:00:49,915
They switch to French and Korean
as they please.

731
01:00:50,215 --> 01:00:53,252
They have no shame
in talking bullshit.

732
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:56,522
They degenerate,
becoming more and more useless.

733
01:00:56,689 --> 01:00:59,158
I'm sure they sometimes feel
uneasy about themselves.

734
01:00:59,591 --> 01:01:02,494
They cry out things like
"Koreans are so prejudiced!"

735
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:06,865
But they are not logical
and don't know what's really good.

736
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:10,836
I can tell what they're imitating
with everything they say.

737
01:01:11,337 --> 01:01:14,506
Anyway, all I can do is stay away
from them as far as possible.

738
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:18,043
Since I'm not sure
what they would do to me.

739
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:21,947
There are a lot of people like them
here in Paris.

740
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:26,218
September 8

741
01:01:27,553 --> 01:01:30,356
We visited the studios
where many Korean artists work.

742
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:33,325
Mr. Jang said that he knows
a famous Korean painting there.

743
01:01:33,692 --> 01:01:34,326
Hello.

744
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,295
The atelier is here.

745
01:01:36,495 --> 01:01:37,896
The hallway is narrow.

746
01:01:38,063 --> 01:01:40,599
First, we met the painter
Hyun-ju knows.

747
01:01:46,071 --> 01:01:49,808
I recently read a book called,
"The Glory of Van Gogh. "

748
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:55,547
According to the book,
Van Gogh was already known by some.

749
01:01:55,714 --> 01:01:58,584
He also had several exhibitions.

750
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:05,057
So we can say he was regarded
as a promising painter back then.

751
01:02:05,224 --> 01:02:09,061
But he still cut his ear off.

752
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:10,562
He died in a mental hospital, right?

753
01:02:10,596 --> 01:02:12,164
Yes, in a mental hospital.

754
01:02:12,765 --> 01:02:16,335
Well, I think that it
actually could've been distorted.

755
01:02:16,435 --> 01:02:19,838
The fact that he had a mental problem

756
01:02:19,938 --> 01:02:22,841
doesn't mean that he became insane
to be an artist, right?

757
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:28,914
I mean, not everyone needs
to be insane to be a great artist.

758
01:02:29,314 --> 01:02:30,849
Who knows.

759
01:02:31,016 --> 01:02:37,856
It's hard to tell whether insanity
brings about great art,

760
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:41,960
or if great art
brings about insanity.

761
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:45,798
Gogh seems like a good person.

762
01:02:46,031 --> 01:02:47,232
He is.

763
01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:50,202
And great, too.

764
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:52,971
Indeed, he is.

765
01:02:53,038 --> 01:02:57,876
But those images could've been
made up to serve the present's needs.

766
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,579
I think it's time we should

767
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:08,487
embrace these fabrications
and make use of them.

768
01:03:09,288 --> 01:03:12,591
Who paints better
between you and your husband?

769
01:03:14,393 --> 01:03:18,063
My husband is better.

770
01:03:18,997 --> 01:03:20,566
I can agree to that.

771
01:03:21,733 --> 01:03:23,702
The tea is very nice.

772
01:03:24,503 --> 01:03:25,838
Can I hold your baby?

773
01:03:26,004 --> 01:03:27,406
A friend brought the tea from China.

774
01:03:27,473 --> 01:03:28,740
Oh, really?

775
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:35,547
He's so cute!

776
01:03:38,383 --> 01:03:39,818
What's his name?

777
01:03:39,985 --> 01:03:42,054
Alexandre.

778
01:03:44,256 --> 01:03:45,891
He's beautiful.

779
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:49,962
You're the most beautiful thing
in the world.

780
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:51,930
Thank you.

781
01:03:56,401 --> 01:04:03,408
Korean people here certainly put in
more effort than Europeans.

782
01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:10,582
But we Koreans tend to step
on others to get ahead of them.

783
01:04:12,918 --> 01:04:17,890
I think the natives here
are different in that regards.

784
01:04:18,056 --> 01:04:22,694
They seem to be
more innocent than us.

785
01:04:23,061 --> 01:04:27,332
Considering the difference
in cultures or personalities.

786
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:30,602
Do you really think
they are that different from us?

787
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:35,941
Well, since I'm not an expert,
I can't tell you exactly.

788
01:04:36,074 --> 01:04:41,613
But I think the education here
brings about those differences.

789
01:04:42,047 --> 01:04:45,350
But your children
speak Korean perfectly, don't they?

790
01:04:45,684 --> 01:04:49,555
Actually, I beat them if they don't.

791
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:52,524
That's good.

792
01:04:58,163 --> 01:04:59,097
See you later.

793
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:00,299
See you soon.

794
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:01,800
Thank you for inviting us.

795
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:04,336
It was good meeting you.

796
01:05:04,903 --> 01:05:06,171
Thank you.

797
01:05:06,505 --> 01:05:07,773
Take care.

798
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,974
Shall we go?

799
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:10,676
Bye.

800
01:05:15,113 --> 01:05:17,282
Do you know how expensive
his paintings are?

801
01:05:17,683 --> 01:05:18,584
No, I don't.

802
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:20,352
His works are in such high demand.

803
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:23,088
He is the most popular
Korean painter here.

804
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:25,290
- Really?
- Yes.

805
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:28,894
What am I doing here?

806
01:05:29,161 --> 01:05:32,397
He's working so hard
at his paintings every day.

807
01:05:34,366 --> 01:05:36,802
September 10

808
01:05:42,307 --> 01:05:44,776
We are going to Deauville for a day.

809
01:05:48,513 --> 01:05:50,015
Did you find it, Yu-jeong?

810
01:05:50,382 --> 01:05:52,251
Not yet.

811
01:05:56,922 --> 01:05:58,924
Are you looking at the map or not?

812
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:02,160
I can't look at it,
so you have to at least!

813
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:03,996
You're driving me crazy!

814
01:06:04,229 --> 01:06:06,398
I'm looking at it.

815
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:08,900
You can't even do that?

816
01:06:09,968 --> 01:06:12,938
I'm driving, so you're the one
who has to find it.

817
01:06:13,405 --> 01:06:15,073
Can you help me?

818
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,843
You're really unbelievable.

819
01:06:19,978 --> 01:06:21,179
Are we that lost?

820
01:06:21,313 --> 01:06:23,081
Yes, we are.

821
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:26,918
This is really bad.
I don't know where we are.

822
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:30,922
I'm so sorry
that I'm no help to you.

823
01:06:31,089 --> 01:06:32,758
That's okay.

824
01:06:34,593 --> 01:06:36,862
Now look at the map and find it!

825
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:03,855
Hyun-ju rented a car, but Yu-jeong
didn't even want to pay for the gas.

826
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:11,029
I told Hyun-ju that I'd pay for it
but she didn't take it.

827
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:29,614
What's wrong?

828
01:07:31,817 --> 01:07:33,452
She's so stingy!

829
01:07:56,074 --> 01:07:57,609
Have you ever been here?

830
01:07:57,776 --> 01:08:00,912
Yes, very often,
when I feel to refresh myself.

831
01:08:01,313 --> 01:08:02,647
So what did you do here?

832
01:08:02,814 --> 01:08:06,251
I just walked around
and ate some oysters.

833
01:08:07,586 --> 01:08:10,389
- I want to eat oysters.
- So do I.

834
01:08:12,124 --> 01:08:14,159
- Do you want to go eat oysters?
- Yes.

835
01:08:15,594 --> 01:08:18,463
Yu-jeong's gone too far.
What shall we do?

836
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:21,566
I have no idea what to do with her.

837
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,069
She's so selfish
that I can't forgive her.

838
01:08:24,202 --> 01:08:25,570
She's cheap!

839
01:08:27,639 --> 01:08:29,107
It's because you're on a trip.

840
01:08:29,174 --> 01:08:32,244
People traveling tend to be
more sensitive about their own needs.

841
01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:34,446
So they sometimes argue
and fight more.

842
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:36,415
She's so stingy, though.

843
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:38,483
I know.

844
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:43,054
Don't take it too hard.
You're both roommates anyway.

845
01:08:43,755 --> 01:08:45,991
She's too different from us.

846
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:48,493
Yes, people are all different.

847
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:53,732
Don't mind her,
and just stay with me.

848
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:55,834
Yes, okay.

849
01:08:56,568 --> 01:09:00,005
But I'll be back in a minute.
She went out too far.

850
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:07,779
Yu-jeong!

851
01:09:08,914 --> 01:09:10,415
What are you doing here?

852
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:12,350
Nothing.

853
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:18,023
Don't you think that she
was so rude to me today?

854
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:21,593
She treated me like I'm some beggar.

855
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,064
She's such a nuthead.
I don't know what's in that head of hers.

856
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:29,367
Take it easy.
It's because you're on a trip.

857
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:31,303
People usually argue during trips.

858
01:09:31,403 --> 01:09:33,572
Why do people argue when they travel?

859
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:37,542
Well, people get caught up
in their own feelings.

860
01:09:37,642 --> 01:09:39,611
That's what I call a nuthead.

861
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:43,582
I bet she's one of the top ten
nutheads in Europe.

862
01:09:43,615 --> 01:09:45,817
I'm very sure of it.

863
01:09:47,085 --> 01:09:48,553
Okay, right.

864
01:09:49,754 --> 01:09:51,723
Don't mind her,
and just stay with me.

865
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:54,726
How could I not mind?
This is all because of that nuthead.

866
01:09:55,594 --> 01:09:58,964
I have to go to the restroom.
Can you wait for me here?

867
01:09:59,798 --> 01:10:02,501
Sure, I'll just watch the sea.

868
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:04,803
Or shall I stay with Hyun-ju?

869
01:10:05,804 --> 01:10:09,140
I'll be back in ten minutes,
so just stay here.

870
01:10:09,741 --> 01:10:11,142
Okay.

871
01:10:20,352 --> 01:10:22,654
I have to find my own way to survive.

872
01:10:23,188 --> 01:10:26,258
I can't let these women depress me.

873
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,437
I wanted to gamble, but we couldn't
get in without a passport.

874
01:10:39,538 --> 01:10:41,006
It's tough driving, isn't it?

875
01:10:41,206 --> 01:10:44,543
No, apart from not knowing the roads,
I enjoy driving.

876
01:10:44,776 --> 01:10:46,378
I'm a good driver, so don't worry.

877
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:47,445
Sure.

878
01:10:47,946 --> 01:10:51,449
Hey, how about we eat oysters here?

879
01:10:52,117 --> 01:10:53,952
You must love oysters.

880
01:10:54,085 --> 01:10:57,422
Yes, I just thought
it would be good for us.

881
01:10:57,589 --> 01:11:00,091
Next time.
She doesn't like oysters.

882
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:01,092
So I found...

883
01:11:01,192 --> 01:11:02,360
Why don't I like oysters?

884
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,195
You like oysters?

885
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:05,664
You said you only like meat.

886
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,600
I said I liked meat.
I never said I didn't like oysters.

887
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,203
No, you don't like oysters.
I know for a fact.

888
01:11:12,404 --> 01:11:15,840
You're so ridiculous.

889
01:11:16,474 --> 01:11:17,442
Ridiculous?

890
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:19,077
Speak for yourself!

891
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:20,946
What's with you today?

892
01:11:21,546 --> 01:11:22,480
Think about it.

893
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:23,882
What?

894
01:11:24,716 --> 01:11:26,351
Not finding the way on the map?

895
01:11:26,985 --> 01:11:30,255
Then tell me what I did wrong!

896
01:11:30,622 --> 01:11:32,324
Forget about it.

897
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:34,059
Please stop.

898
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:35,527
You're both educated people.

899
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,363
Plus, we're on a trip, okay?

900
01:11:40,665 --> 01:11:42,434
Okay, let's stop here.

901
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:43,602
Let's go.

902
01:11:43,702 --> 01:11:45,303
Yes, let's go.

903
01:11:57,716 --> 01:11:59,317
What are you doing?

904
01:12:09,894 --> 01:12:12,397
September 12

905
01:12:15,467 --> 01:12:19,037
Sorry, you can't pass this way.
We're shooting.

906
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:23,575
Mind turning back that way?
Otherwise, you'll have to wait here.

907
01:12:23,742 --> 01:12:25,076
It's only for a moment.

908
01:12:25,644 --> 01:12:26,745
Thank you.

909
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:28,980
How much is left?

910
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,751
Five minutes.

911
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:24,492
It feel from above.

912
01:13:49,794 --> 01:13:52,297
September 21

913
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,535
Drinking coke?

914
01:15:37,702 --> 01:15:38,803
Yes.

915
01:15:39,804 --> 01:15:42,407
You're so pretty.
You look very pretty today.

916
01:15:42,774 --> 01:15:44,142
Thank you.

917
01:15:44,642 --> 01:15:47,278
Why didn't you shave?

918
01:15:47,378 --> 01:15:50,081
Are you trying to be stylish?

919
01:15:50,348 --> 01:15:52,851
Well, no need to worry about that.

920
01:15:53,518 --> 01:15:55,987
I don't have to speak
formally to you, right?

921
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,222
What?

922
01:15:57,922 --> 01:16:00,258
What do you mean?

923
01:16:00,358 --> 01:16:01,826
Did I do anything wrong to you?

924
01:16:01,926 --> 01:16:03,561
No, it's not that.

925
01:16:03,728 --> 01:16:07,754
I'm older than you,
so talking formally makes it awkward.

926
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:10,088
Me talking casually to you
isn't going to hurt, you know.

927
01:16:10,123 --> 01:16:12,103
Why are you being so rude?

928
01:16:12,537 --> 01:16:15,940
Because I want to, you little brat.

929
01:16:16,908 --> 01:16:18,610
This is absurd.

930
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:20,044
What?

931
01:16:20,211 --> 01:16:21,813
I can sit, right?

932
01:16:23,147 --> 01:16:27,218
Yes, you can,
but don't talk to me like that.

933
01:16:27,385 --> 01:16:29,954
Will you be nice to me
if I talk formally?

934
01:16:30,955 --> 01:16:32,223
Don't kid me around.

935
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,259
Are you crazy?

936
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:36,361
Yes, I am.

937
01:16:36,928 --> 01:16:39,864
Want a drink, little girl?

938
01:16:41,266 --> 01:16:43,268
I don't drink during the daytime.

939
01:16:44,802 --> 01:16:45,570
I see.

940
01:16:45,803 --> 01:16:48,106
I don't drink much anyway.

941
01:16:48,406 --> 01:16:50,108
How about a drink anyway?

942
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,812
What's wrong with you?

943
01:16:55,747 --> 01:16:57,782
No, well...

944
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:02,487
I want to sleep with you.

945
01:17:05,223 --> 01:17:06,958
You want to sleep with me?

946
01:17:07,926 --> 01:17:11,963
Well, I see you in my dreams
every night.

947
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:14,265
I can't believe this.

948
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:17,535
No one has ever talk to me
like this before.

949
01:17:18,236 --> 01:17:20,772
Don't act like a kid, you little brat.

950
01:17:21,406 --> 01:17:24,242
You better watch your mouth.

951
01:17:25,743 --> 01:17:30,415
No, what I said was wrong.
I was wrong.

952
01:17:30,715 --> 01:17:32,150
Please sit down.

953
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:35,286
Yes, what you said was wrong.

954
01:17:36,688 --> 01:17:39,157
I don't want to toy with you.

955
01:17:39,991 --> 01:17:42,527
Just that you're so attractive.

956
01:17:44,095 --> 01:17:48,299
Can't you try to understand me?
Are you that busy?

957
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:55,506
Do you want to drink?

958
01:17:55,673 --> 01:17:57,275
I talk rudely, don't I?

959
01:17:57,942 --> 01:17:59,711
Yeah.

960
01:18:00,378 --> 01:18:03,348
But slightly fun.

961
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:05,016
Oh, yeah?

962
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:08,686
Now I can see who you truly are.

963
01:18:08,987 --> 01:18:10,588
Really?

964
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:21,099
So do you still want to drink?

965
01:18:21,632 --> 01:18:23,101
Of course.

966
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:24,869
I'll treat. Go ahead.

967
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:28,006
You should since you're much older.

968
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:32,243
You're such a little brat.

969
01:18:49,127 --> 01:18:52,563
The clouds here hang very low.

970
01:18:56,401 --> 01:18:58,536
Where did they get all these stones?

971
01:18:58,603 --> 01:19:00,705
Is there a quarry near here?

972
01:19:00,838 --> 01:19:02,240
I don't know.

973
01:19:05,576 --> 01:19:09,480
I think we've walked for miles.

974
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:11,949
My legs are swelling up.

975
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:17,855
I think I like legs like yours
more than thin ones.

976
01:19:18,122 --> 01:19:21,993
They're very pretty
and so are your feet.

977
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,165
Thank you, but can you let go now?

978
01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:29,967
Why? Worried people will see?

979
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:33,838
Yes, there are too many Koreans here.

980
01:19:37,108 --> 01:19:38,776
I feel awkward about us.

981
01:19:43,147 --> 01:19:46,384
Hey, I've been there.
Isn't that the Orsay Museum?

982
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:50,254
Yes, the sandwiches sold
on the roof cafe is so delicious.

983
01:19:50,388 --> 01:19:51,355
Is that right?

984
01:19:52,757 --> 01:19:54,358
Who did you go with?

985
01:19:55,226 --> 01:19:58,763
Hyun-ju took me there
when I first saw her.

986
01:19:58,896 --> 01:20:00,331
Oh, with Hyun-ju.

987
01:20:00,465 --> 01:20:03,334
The day Mr. Jang from the guesthouse
introduced me to her.

988
01:20:03,401 --> 01:20:04,769
We saw only Courbet's works.

989
01:20:04,902 --> 01:20:06,204
Which one?

990
01:20:07,772 --> 01:20:10,875
I like "The Stone-Breakers,"
but it wasn't there.

991
01:20:11,008 --> 01:20:14,579
I know that painting.
But I haven't actually seen it.

992
01:20:17,548 --> 01:20:23,921
They must've been rich for ages
having brought all these stones here.

993
01:20:26,124 --> 01:20:32,029
Do you want to hear
what Hyun-ju told me?

994
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,866
What's so funny?

995
01:20:34,966 --> 01:20:40,238
We were drinking
and she suddenly said,

996
01:20:41,506 --> 01:20:49,247
"I want to date him
while he's staying in Paris. "

997
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,615
She did?

998
01:20:50,781 --> 01:20:51,682
Yes!

999
01:20:53,618 --> 01:20:55,052
That's so funny.

1000
01:20:56,821 --> 01:20:59,524
So when are you leaving for Seoul?

1001
01:20:59,724 --> 01:21:00,858
I don't know.

1002
01:21:03,561 --> 01:21:07,765
You just tell me when.

1003
01:21:08,132 --> 01:21:11,536
What are you doing?

1004
01:21:34,525 --> 01:21:37,862
I'm so drunk.

1005
01:21:38,429 --> 01:21:40,031
You must be really tired.

1006
01:21:41,432 --> 01:21:43,134
What shall we do?

1007
01:22:02,386 --> 01:22:04,555
Can I lie on your lap?

1008
01:22:07,191 --> 01:22:09,327
You're cold, aren't you?

1009
01:22:09,627 --> 01:22:11,229
I don't have anything
to cover you with.

1010
01:22:11,395 --> 01:22:12,663
That's okay.

1011
01:22:13,264 --> 01:22:14,599
Do you feel like vomiting?

1012
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:16,567
I'll be fine if I don't move.

1013
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:18,970
I feel terrible.

1014
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,305
So do I.

1015
01:22:21,806 --> 01:22:25,109
We walked and drank too much.

1016
01:22:42,927 --> 01:22:46,063
Stay here just for a minute
and go home to rest, okay?

1017
01:22:46,464 --> 01:22:48,799
I'm fine.

1018
01:22:57,241 --> 01:22:59,710
September 23

1019
01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:04,548
Oh no, is it serious?

1020
01:23:05,683 --> 01:23:07,685
No, I just walked too much.

1021
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:10,588
And I just feel cold.

1022
01:23:10,788 --> 01:23:13,057
You should take care of your body.

1023
01:23:13,157 --> 01:23:15,660
But keep going out
to those nice places.

1024
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:17,161
It'll be good for you.

1025
01:23:17,328 --> 01:23:19,463
Don't stay inside all the time.

1026
01:23:20,564 --> 01:23:21,832
I know.

1027
01:23:24,268 --> 01:23:30,408
While sitting at a park bench
a French guy on a bike passed by.

1028
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:36,881
He was riding under the sunset.
I suddenly felt so envious of him.

1029
01:23:38,349 --> 01:23:44,989
I bet he has a house
a job, friends, a car.

1030
01:23:45,823 --> 01:23:48,759
Or maybe just a bike.

1031
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:52,797
Anyway, I even envied
an ordinary guy like him.

1032
01:23:53,197 --> 01:23:55,766
He seemed to be so settled here.

1033
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:59,437
Everything here seemed
to belong to him.

1034
01:24:01,005 --> 01:24:03,441
I'm sorry, Sung-nam.

1035
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:09,246
I've been busy thinking about
other things instead of you.

1036
01:24:10,281 --> 01:24:13,584
I've been shopping alone
and watching TV.

1037
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:16,654
I'm so sorry.

1038
01:24:18,289 --> 01:24:21,425
That's okay. Don't cry.

1039
01:24:23,961 --> 01:24:26,397
September 24

1040
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,349
The line is good, as you know.

1041
01:24:45,516 --> 01:24:47,618
So I think you could do anything.

1042
01:24:47,752 --> 01:24:49,420
Your choice of subject matter
is excellent.

1043
01:24:49,487 --> 01:24:53,324
You're not imitating some art works
that moved you.

1044
01:24:53,357 --> 01:24:57,061
But you rather get ideas
from your real, everyday life.

1045
01:24:57,096 --> 01:24:59,130
You also have the strength
to finish a work.

1046
01:24:59,263 --> 01:25:01,499
I think you're truly talented.

1047
01:25:03,334 --> 01:25:06,237
But people don't know that.

1048
01:25:06,637 --> 01:25:07,905
That's the problem.

1049
01:25:08,172 --> 01:25:10,374
No, just keep going.

1050
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:13,711
A lot of people with no talent
are persistent to the end.

1051
01:25:13,778 --> 01:25:17,481
And they occupy all positions,
screwing up the world.

1052
01:25:18,382 --> 01:25:23,888
Those kinds of people
can only repeat clichs.

1053
01:25:23,988 --> 01:25:26,857
Eventually those clichs
become poisonous to people.

1054
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,929
People like you need to survive.

1055
01:25:32,363 --> 01:25:34,365
I usually don't like to say this,

1056
01:25:35,866 --> 01:25:38,068
but I think you're very talented.

1057
01:25:38,269 --> 01:25:39,904
You can trust me on that.

1058
01:25:45,009 --> 01:25:48,446
Thanks, you're very encouraging.

1059
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:50,347
Really?

1060
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:23,714
Wait.

1061
01:26:24,849 --> 01:26:27,485
Stop, you're married.

1062
01:26:28,452 --> 01:26:29,420
Right.

1063
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,522
I'm sorry.

1064
01:26:44,001 --> 01:26:47,505
I've been through this before.
It's a waste.

1065
01:26:48,339 --> 01:26:49,306
You're right.

1066
01:26:50,574 --> 01:26:51,775
I know.

1067
01:27:00,518 --> 01:27:02,586
Please stop this.

1068
01:27:06,724 --> 01:27:10,060
I know this feels good
but please let's stop.

1069
01:27:10,227 --> 01:27:12,463
I don't want to, okay?

1070
01:27:17,434 --> 01:27:19,370
I'll hold back.

1071
01:27:20,304 --> 01:27:22,106
Why don't you have a smoke?

1072
01:27:22,172 --> 01:27:23,707
You may smoke in here.

1073
01:27:24,008 --> 01:27:25,476
Okay.

1074
01:27:27,077 --> 01:27:28,946
Thanks for the kiss, anyway.

1075
01:27:29,747 --> 01:27:31,482
I won't forget it.

1076
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:35,085
It was so beautiful.

1077
01:27:37,688 --> 01:27:39,490
Tell me about the paintings.

1078
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:41,091
I like to hear those things.

1079
01:27:41,225 --> 01:27:42,159
About my painting?

1080
01:27:42,526 --> 01:27:44,528
Yours? Mine?

1081
01:27:45,229 --> 01:27:46,730
About yours.

1082
01:27:47,197 --> 01:27:53,270
I've painted for a long time,
but people don't seem to like them.

1083
01:27:55,639 --> 01:27:56,774
Really?

1084
01:27:58,309 --> 01:28:00,144
I'm holding back well, aren't I?

1085
01:28:02,913 --> 01:28:04,648
Of course, you have no choice.

1086
01:28:04,848 --> 01:28:06,584
Since I don't want to.

1087
01:28:09,186 --> 01:28:10,721
You little brat.

1088
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:21,799
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy...

1089
01:28:24,768 --> 01:28:27,171
September 26

1090
01:28:40,184 --> 01:28:42,686
Oh, you've done a lot as an artist.

1091
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:46,023
Do you have a working permit?

1092
01:28:46,991 --> 01:28:48,258
No, I don't.

1093
01:28:48,425 --> 01:28:51,462
You can't work if you don't have one.

1094
01:28:51,862 --> 01:28:57,201
Immigration laws got stricter,
so we can't hire non-permit holders.

1095
01:28:57,368 --> 01:29:02,640
But I heard that people work nights
since they don't inspect at night.

1096
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:06,143
I'm not going to take any risks.

1097
01:29:06,577 --> 01:29:09,680
Sir, I'm desperate for money.

1098
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:15,586
I understand
the hard circumstance you're in.

1099
01:29:15,753 --> 01:29:20,658
Then how about working for movers
or being a janitor?

1100
01:29:20,824 --> 01:29:25,362
I can introduce you to some people
I know if you want.

1101
01:29:25,663 --> 01:29:26,830
Oh, thank you.

1102
01:29:26,964 --> 01:29:30,801
Then leave your resume with me
and I'll call you.

1103
01:29:30,968 --> 01:29:32,569
Thank you so much.

1104
01:30:25,456 --> 01:30:27,991
I returned to the restaurant
and took my resume back.

1105
01:30:28,325 --> 01:30:31,261
I hated that my resume was
in his hands.

1106
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:35,899
October 1

1107
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:47,544
Mr. Jang invited me to join
a party his friend is having.

1108
01:31:13,604 --> 01:31:16,740
Excuse me, whose painting is that?

1109
01:31:16,907 --> 01:31:20,010
Oh, it's my cousin's.

1110
01:31:20,377 --> 01:31:21,311
Really?

1111
01:31:21,478 --> 01:31:23,046
Yes, why are you surprised?

1112
01:31:23,147 --> 01:31:25,048
Oh, I'm not surprised.

1113
01:31:25,282 --> 01:31:26,984
Who is your cousin?

1114
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:29,787
That girl from Seoul
you saw just a minute ago.

1115
01:31:30,053 --> 01:31:32,422
Oh, the student who just arrived?

1116
01:31:33,323 --> 01:31:35,192
Is this her work?

1117
01:31:35,325 --> 01:31:37,161
Yes, it is.

1118
01:31:37,761 --> 01:31:39,930
Oh, so she's a painter.

1119
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:43,767
Yes, she just entered
the Beaux-Arts school.

1120
01:31:44,601 --> 01:31:46,804
Ah, the Beaux-Arts.

1121
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,040
It's a very good school.

1122
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:52,309
Yes, they say it is.

1123
01:31:56,947 --> 01:31:57,948
Hello.

1124
01:31:59,683 --> 01:32:01,285
I heard you go to Beaux-Arts.

1125
01:32:01,385 --> 01:32:03,020
Yes, how did you know that?

1126
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,521
Your cousin told me.

1127
01:32:06,323 --> 01:32:08,258
You're a painter, right?

1128
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,829
I saw the picture on the wall.

1129
01:32:11,929 --> 01:32:13,463
What's it about?

1130
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:17,000
It's nothing special.

1131
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,402
It looks like some character.

1132
01:32:18,602 --> 01:32:20,370
Yes, you're right.

1133
01:32:20,537 --> 01:32:23,740
I've been preparing now
for some time.

1134
01:32:23,841 --> 01:32:28,212
It's for a large picture
called "The House on the Sand. "

1135
01:32:28,478 --> 01:32:30,047
Oh, "The House on the Sand. "

1136
01:32:30,147 --> 01:32:33,250
Yes, there will be
many characters in it.

1137
01:32:34,117 --> 01:32:35,185
I see.

1138
01:32:35,519 --> 01:32:39,523
Do you know Yu-jeong?

1139
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:41,191
Yu-jeong?

1140
01:32:41,859 --> 01:32:43,026
Lee Yu-jeong?

1141
01:32:43,126 --> 01:32:44,595
Yes, that's right.

1142
01:32:45,262 --> 01:32:46,363
I know her.

1143
01:32:46,463 --> 01:32:49,366
How do you know her?
We went to the same school in Korea.

1144
01:32:49,433 --> 01:32:52,736
I heard that she goes
to Beaux-Arts, too.

1145
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:59,843
Yes, but she just quit school
because of some trouble.

1146
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:01,144
When?

1147
01:33:01,378 --> 01:33:04,882
The beginning of last semester,
I think.

1148
01:33:05,682 --> 01:33:07,117
I see.

1149
01:33:14,224 --> 01:33:17,060
I don't like to say stuff like this,

1150
01:33:17,928 --> 01:33:21,265
but she plagiarized my paintings
onto her portfolio.

1151
01:33:21,531 --> 01:33:22,699
Really?

1152
01:33:23,033 --> 01:33:28,171
After I got into Beaux-Arts,
I got called into the dean's office.

1153
01:33:28,505 --> 01:33:32,809
Then I saw her portfolio there
which looked identical to mine.

1154
01:33:34,144 --> 01:33:35,479
I see.

1155
01:33:36,647 --> 01:33:38,282
You must've been surprised.

1156
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:43,620
No, I was angry with her.

1157
01:33:46,757 --> 01:33:52,396
We knew she wasn't a good painter
back in Korea.

1158
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:56,066
Actually, we all ignored her.

1159
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,770
One day I called her
to talk about what happened.

1160
01:34:00,203 --> 01:34:04,207
She begged me to keep it a secret.
She looked so pathetic.

1161
01:34:05,676 --> 01:34:06,610
I see.

1162
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:12,482
The school became suspicious
of all Korean students because of her.

1163
01:34:16,887 --> 01:34:18,488
I understand.

1164
01:34:29,299 --> 01:34:32,069
I didn't by anything.
They're going to get mad at me.

1165
01:34:32,202 --> 01:34:33,971
It's okay. I bought two bottles.

1166
01:34:34,104 --> 01:34:35,806
They're going to get upset.

1167
01:34:39,609 --> 01:34:41,311
Ji-hye,
you're not asking a question?

1168
01:34:41,345 --> 01:34:42,879
Then I'll do it.

1169
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:44,114
Come on.

1170
01:34:45,816 --> 01:34:49,086
Who do you think
is the manliest here?

1171
01:34:49,186 --> 01:34:50,921
Okay! Scan!

1172
01:34:51,488 --> 01:34:52,422
Isn't it too easy?

1173
01:34:52,556 --> 01:34:54,024
Why?

1174
01:34:54,291 --> 01:34:56,159
You're too handsome.

1175
01:34:57,027 --> 01:34:59,463
She's so funny.

1176
01:35:00,263 --> 01:35:01,865
Let me give you a drink.

1177
01:35:01,965 --> 01:35:03,166
What's so funny?

1178
01:35:03,266 --> 01:35:06,169
It sounds much better than ugly.

1179
01:35:06,937 --> 01:35:10,140
Excuse me, but are you from Yanbian?

1180
01:35:10,741 --> 01:35:17,180
No, I'm Yoon Gyoung-su,
a student from North Korea.

1181
01:35:17,814 --> 01:35:20,183
You're from North Korea?

1182
01:35:20,417 --> 01:35:24,121
Yes, I'm from Pyongyang.

1183
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:27,958
Then you should've told me
that before.

1184
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:30,660
Well, I'm telling you now.

1185
01:35:31,762 --> 01:35:33,663
I was wondering about your accent.

1186
01:35:33,797 --> 01:35:36,199
Now can we continue the game?

1187
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:38,502
Who do you think is the manliest?

1188
01:35:38,602 --> 01:35:39,503
Scan...

1189
01:35:39,603 --> 01:35:42,439
Sorry, I have one more question.

1190
01:35:42,672 --> 01:35:44,708
To me?

1191
01:35:45,242 --> 01:35:47,911
What do you think of Kim Il-sung?

1192
01:35:48,378 --> 01:35:49,546
Pardon?

1193
01:35:51,148 --> 01:35:55,619
You should speak more politely.

1194
01:35:55,819 --> 01:36:01,124
Do you call out
your grandfather's name like that?

1195
01:36:01,358 --> 01:36:02,859
Then how should I call him?

1196
01:36:02,959 --> 01:36:05,695
Should I call him
by General or something?

1197
01:36:05,762 --> 01:36:09,399
Hey, he is our great father,

1198
01:36:09,599 --> 01:36:12,636
so you should at least be respectful.

1199
01:36:12,936 --> 01:36:16,506
Is Kim Il-sung that great? Is he?

1200
01:36:16,773 --> 01:36:18,442
This is absurd.

1201
01:36:18,542 --> 01:36:22,813
Okay, we better stop here.

1202
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:25,882
Mr. Jang, I have to leave.

1203
01:36:26,917 --> 01:36:28,585
I will see you later.

1204
01:36:30,454 --> 01:36:33,123
He's such a bourgeois.

1205
01:36:33,256 --> 01:36:36,059
Why don't you have a drink?

1206
01:36:36,426 --> 01:36:37,894
Don't get mad.

1207
01:36:38,061 --> 01:36:39,996
Where were we?

1208
01:36:47,771 --> 01:36:50,073
I met a North Korean.
What should I do?

1209
01:36:50,874 --> 01:36:52,542
Do I have to give myself in?

1210
01:36:52,776 --> 01:36:55,145
Or call the embassy?

1211
01:36:56,279 --> 01:36:58,715
October 3

1212
01:37:05,122 --> 01:37:06,923
I don't believe this.

1213
01:37:07,357 --> 01:37:09,960
Min-sun seems to have
committed suicide.

1214
01:37:13,663 --> 01:37:16,199
The paper says
that it was a 'Mrs. Jang. '

1215
01:37:16,366 --> 01:37:19,803
It says she has a French husband
who is a folklorist.

1216
01:37:20,003 --> 01:37:21,938
The dead woman is a painter.

1217
01:37:33,783 --> 01:37:35,585
It's definitely Min-sun.

1218
01:37:36,052 --> 01:37:41,057
Painter Mrs. Jang Commits Suicide

1219
01:37:58,775 --> 01:38:00,243
I'm sorry, sir.

1220
01:38:02,345 --> 01:38:04,414
I'm so sorry.

1221
01:38:05,048 --> 01:38:07,184
Don't be sorry to me.

1222
01:38:07,484 --> 01:38:09,085
We all understand you.

1223
01:38:09,419 --> 01:38:12,556
Is there any problem at home?

1224
01:38:15,058 --> 01:38:18,261
Sir, I've done wrong.

1225
01:38:19,062 --> 01:38:21,097
I've looked down on people so much.

1226
01:38:21,231 --> 01:38:24,100
Everybody does in their lifetime.

1227
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:29,206
Nothing good can come from it, right?

1228
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:31,374
Sir, I've been so bad.

1229
01:38:34,878 --> 01:38:39,382
I pretended to be strong
since I was afraid.

1230
01:38:40,317 --> 01:38:43,620
And I treated everyone in contempt.

1231
01:38:44,854 --> 01:38:47,357
Anyway, I'm glad that you're crying.

1232
01:38:47,824 --> 01:38:51,127
It means that you're getting better.

1233
01:38:51,795 --> 01:38:53,830
I'm so sorry.

1234
01:38:58,268 --> 01:39:01,004
I'll be nice to people.

1235
01:39:01,137 --> 01:39:06,076
Yes, we are all the same.

1236
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:12,082
Try to cheer yourself up.

1237
01:39:38,174 --> 01:39:39,676
Hyun-ju is inside.

1238
01:39:41,544 --> 01:39:42,779
Why are you here?

1239
01:39:43,013 --> 01:39:44,714
I just came by to see you.

1240
01:39:44,914 --> 01:39:46,316
I'm on my way out.

1241
01:39:46,549 --> 01:39:47,484
You are?

1242
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:49,386
Let's go out together.

1243
01:39:49,586 --> 01:39:51,154
A cup of coffee on the way?

1244
01:39:51,321 --> 01:39:52,088
Sure.

1245
01:39:52,222 --> 01:39:53,123
Let's go.

1246
01:40:07,337 --> 01:40:09,205
Did you cry today?

1247
01:40:09,639 --> 01:40:10,807
No.

1248
01:40:12,242 --> 01:40:17,681
I want to lie with you in my arms.

1249
01:40:19,616 --> 01:40:23,853
You need to be slapped on the cheek.

1250
01:40:25,121 --> 01:40:26,323
Go ahead.

1251
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,925
Are you sure?

1252
01:40:30,026 --> 01:40:31,795
Yeah, go ahead.

1253
01:40:32,662 --> 01:40:34,364
Okay, then.

1254
01:40:39,002 --> 01:40:41,638
Don't be like this.

1255
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,443
You don't have to pretend with me.

1256
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,682
Slap me.

1257
01:40:55,518 --> 01:40:57,520
This isn't working.

1258
01:40:59,956 --> 01:41:05,362
I really want to lie with you today.

1259
01:41:10,133 --> 01:41:11,301
Why?

1260
01:41:12,802 --> 01:41:15,405
I love you.

1261
01:41:17,474 --> 01:41:18,742
Really?

1262
01:41:19,342 --> 01:41:21,978
I love you.

1263
01:41:28,918 --> 01:41:30,220
Yu-jeong.

1264
01:41:31,388 --> 01:41:32,722
What?

1265
01:41:34,824 --> 01:41:36,826
Want to go to Deauville with me?

1266
01:41:39,496 --> 01:41:40,964
Yeah, I do.

1267
01:41:43,099 --> 01:41:44,768
When?

1268
01:41:46,503 --> 01:41:48,138
What about today?

1269
01:41:48,338 --> 01:41:49,839
I can't today.

1270
01:41:51,107 --> 01:41:52,175
Really?

1271
01:41:52,942 --> 01:41:54,477
The day after tomorrow.

1272
01:41:55,945 --> 01:41:57,247
Are you serious?

1273
01:41:59,315 --> 01:42:00,950
Look in my eyes.

1274
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,188
Okay, I got it.

1275
01:42:13,663 --> 01:42:16,166
October 5

1276
01:42:21,704 --> 01:42:23,506
- Is this it?
- Yes.

1277
01:42:33,516 --> 01:42:35,285
Hello, are you cleaning up?

1278
01:42:35,518 --> 01:42:36,986
I wish I could help you.

1279
01:42:37,086 --> 01:42:39,456
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1280
01:42:41,224 --> 01:42:43,359
Her perfume is too strong.

1281
01:42:46,529 --> 01:42:49,032
October 6

1282
01:43:11,287 --> 01:43:13,923
Doesn't that look like candy?

1283
01:43:14,457 --> 01:43:16,092
Why is it there?

1284
01:43:16,226 --> 01:43:17,627
I don't know.

1285
01:43:19,095 --> 01:43:22,565
It's hard walking on the sand.

1286
01:43:23,666 --> 01:43:25,034
Your legs hurt?

1287
01:43:26,436 --> 01:43:27,437
Shall I lift you up?

1288
01:43:27,504 --> 01:43:29,205
No, thanks.

1289
01:43:30,306 --> 01:43:31,274
I'll lift you up.

1290
01:43:31,341 --> 01:43:32,442
I'm okay.

1291
01:43:35,345 --> 01:43:36,312
Feel comfortable?

1292
01:43:38,181 --> 01:43:39,682
But you don't look comfortable.

1293
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:59,102
I'm so happy to be with you.

1294
01:44:00,503 --> 01:44:01,738
Why?

1295
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,476
What makes you so happy?

1296
01:44:07,944 --> 01:44:12,215
Because you're so pretty.
Very, very pretty.

1297
01:44:15,151 --> 01:44:17,220
You're a real man.

1298
01:44:18,087 --> 01:44:19,122
I am?

1299
01:44:24,627 --> 01:44:26,462
Take this for a second.

1300
01:44:53,256 --> 01:44:56,426
How'd we win so much money?
I can't believe this.

1301
01:44:56,526 --> 01:44:57,961
We really won a lot, didn't we?

1302
01:44:58,027 --> 01:45:01,297
Yes, I've never seen anyone
win so much money like this.

1303
01:45:01,364 --> 01:45:01,664
Really?

1304
01:45:01,764 --> 01:45:03,933
How much did we win?
About 900 euros?

1305
01:45:04,033 --> 01:45:06,436
No, not 900.
A little more than 800.

1306
01:45:06,536 --> 01:45:08,638
Wow, that's great!

1307
01:45:08,838 --> 01:45:10,440
We're rich.

1308
01:45:11,441 --> 01:45:13,343
Do you want half of this?

1309
01:45:13,509 --> 01:45:14,944
Are you sure?

1310
01:45:15,178 --> 01:45:16,679
You'll really give me half?

1311
01:45:16,813 --> 01:45:17,780
Why not?

1312
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,082
Thank you!

1313
01:45:19,182 --> 01:45:20,083
One sec.

1314
01:45:20,617 --> 01:45:22,151
Let me count it first.

1315
01:45:23,987 --> 01:45:26,656
One, two, three.

1316
01:45:29,559 --> 01:45:31,227
What should I do with this?

1317
01:45:31,427 --> 01:45:33,062
Whatever you want.

1318
01:45:37,066 --> 01:45:38,201
Thank you.

1319
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:40,303
Me, too.

1320
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:46,075
We devoured oysters
with the money we won.

1321
01:46:18,274 --> 01:46:19,742
I can't have sex today.

1322
01:46:19,876 --> 01:46:20,743
Why not?

1323
01:46:20,877 --> 01:46:22,145
Today is risky.

1324
01:46:22,278 --> 01:46:23,379
Are you sure?

1325
01:46:23,613 --> 01:46:24,947
I see.

1326
01:46:25,248 --> 01:46:26,516
But it's still okay.

1327
01:46:26,582 --> 01:46:29,886
It's not okay!
Today is really risky.

1328
01:46:30,019 --> 01:46:31,721
This is torture.

1329
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:34,657
So what do we do?

1330
01:46:35,992 --> 01:46:37,126
Don't you have any condoms?

1331
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:38,261
Condoms?

1332
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:39,595
No.

1333
01:46:39,829 --> 01:46:40,997
No?

1334
01:46:42,765 --> 01:46:44,200
Do you really need it?

1335
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:48,137
Yes, I told you that today
is really risky.

1336
01:46:48,771 --> 01:46:50,540
What shall we do?

1337
01:46:51,941 --> 01:46:54,277
Why don't you go buy condoms?

1338
01:46:56,279 --> 01:46:59,382
Let's just do it.
This is our first time together.

1339
01:46:59,515 --> 01:47:02,819
Don't talk nonsense.
Hurry and go get some condoms.

1340
01:47:02,919 --> 01:47:05,488
Where can I buy them?

1341
01:47:07,457 --> 01:47:09,325
Can't we just do it without it?

1342
01:47:09,625 --> 01:47:11,160
Can't you do that at least?

1343
01:47:11,294 --> 01:47:13,396
Put in the effort.

1344
01:47:13,796 --> 01:47:16,365
Go get some, now!

1345
01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:20,837
Go! Go! Go!

1346
01:47:23,139 --> 01:47:24,874
Do something!

1347
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:29,679
I'll be back.

1348
01:48:14,957 --> 01:48:18,161
I found a drugstore
but I couldn't buy any condoms.

1349
01:48:18,561 --> 01:48:21,397
I don't speak any French
and there were too many women.

1350
01:48:31,607 --> 01:48:33,876
Yu-jeong, are you sleeping?

1351
01:48:35,645 --> 01:48:36,913
No.

1352
01:48:55,598 --> 01:48:57,867
Can't we just hug?

1353
01:48:57,967 --> 01:49:01,037
But hugging is so nice
and comfortable.

1354
01:49:01,204 --> 01:49:02,405
I know.

1355
01:49:05,107 --> 01:49:06,976
Do you really want to just hug?

1356
01:49:12,215 --> 01:49:13,182
Yu-jeong.

1357
01:49:13,382 --> 01:49:14,317
What?

1358
01:49:14,984 --> 01:49:15,918
I love you.

1359
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,568
I want to suck your whole body.

1360
01:49:33,202 --> 01:49:36,706
I want to suck every single part.
I mean it.

1361
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:47,116
Why are you nice to me like this?

1362
01:49:47,216 --> 01:49:49,285
Why are you so nice to me?

1363
01:49:49,986 --> 01:49:52,521
It was nothing much...

1364
01:50:09,939 --> 01:50:11,007
I love you.

1365
01:50:12,675 --> 01:50:13,743
I love you.

1366
01:50:13,943 --> 01:50:15,745
I love you, too.

1367
01:50:17,713 --> 01:50:18,948
Thank you.

1368
01:50:38,701 --> 01:50:41,137
October 9

1369
01:50:46,409 --> 01:50:47,576
What are you going to do today?

1370
01:50:47,743 --> 01:50:48,678
Today?

1371
01:50:49,445 --> 01:50:50,746
I have no idea.

1372
01:50:50,913 --> 01:50:53,182
I'll just wait for you
till you come back.

1373
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:55,217
Wait.

1374
01:50:56,285 --> 01:50:59,388
I've made up my mind now.

1375
01:50:59,522 --> 01:51:00,489
For what?

1376
01:51:01,424 --> 01:51:03,659
I will love you as much as I want.

1377
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,661
Really?

1378
01:51:07,263 --> 01:51:08,364
I will too.

1379
01:51:09,465 --> 01:51:13,002
What you've been doing to me
is so touching.

1380
01:51:13,102 --> 01:51:16,772
But sometimes I can't trust you
and it's hard on me.

1381
01:51:16,973 --> 01:51:21,577
I'm tired of not being decisive
about my feelings.

1382
01:51:22,244 --> 01:51:25,948
So I really made up my mind
to love you.

1383
01:51:26,315 --> 01:51:29,986
I will love you as long as I can.

1384
01:51:30,886 --> 01:51:32,388
Feel burdened?

1385
01:51:32,488 --> 01:51:33,622
No.

1386
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:37,226
You're very, very pretty.

1387
01:51:39,061 --> 01:51:42,798
I don't know who I am.

1388
01:51:43,165 --> 01:51:44,900
Me neither.

1389
01:51:45,301 --> 01:51:49,705
But I know my feelings
have become clear.

1390
01:51:50,006 --> 01:51:52,375
And it's enough to encourage me.

1391
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:57,446
Okay, I'll be brave too.

1392
01:51:58,514 --> 01:52:00,216
I trust you.

1393
01:52:00,483 --> 01:52:03,986
And everything you said to me.

1394
01:52:07,123 --> 01:52:09,925
I don't know anything.

1395
01:52:12,595 --> 01:52:16,165
The more I see you,
the more I love you.

1396
01:52:16,832 --> 01:52:20,603
I just feel like you're on my side
and you're so pure.

1397
01:52:23,205 --> 01:52:25,741
Thank you for loving me.

1398
01:52:27,309 --> 01:52:28,711
See you after school.

1399
01:52:28,778 --> 01:52:30,079
I'll be waiting.

1400
01:52:30,246 --> 01:52:32,381
I'll be back as soon as possible.

1401
01:52:32,548 --> 01:52:33,182
Okay.

1402
01:53:54,497 --> 01:53:56,265
Hello.

1403
01:53:57,766 --> 01:54:01,003
Oh, how are you?

1404
01:54:02,738 --> 01:54:06,408
I'm sorry for what I did last time.

1405
01:54:06,842 --> 01:54:12,848
Well, we both got too emotional
to think reasonably then.

1406
01:54:13,382 --> 01:54:17,319
I thought you could be that way
since youre an artist.

1407
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,321
I'm sorry.

1408
01:54:23,058 --> 01:54:27,663
Anyway, do you really hate me?

1409
01:54:30,132 --> 01:54:31,767
Take it easy.

1410
01:54:31,901 --> 01:54:35,204
- We great up in different societies.
- I'm not talking about that.

1411
01:54:35,337 --> 01:54:39,508
Do you really hate me that much?
I was wondering.

1412
01:54:40,009 --> 01:54:42,178
I have no reason to hate you.

1413
01:54:42,378 --> 01:54:44,180
I don't know much about you.

1414
01:54:44,947 --> 01:54:47,349
It's because I wasn't brave.

1415
01:54:50,186 --> 01:54:52,254
Okay, I understand.

1416
01:54:55,925 --> 01:54:58,961
How about a cup of coffee?

1417
01:55:00,095 --> 01:55:01,797
Sure.

1418
01:55:14,777 --> 01:55:17,479
How about arm-wrestling with me?

1419
01:55:18,247 --> 01:55:19,982
- Arm wrestling?
- Yes.

1420
01:55:20,282 --> 01:55:22,418
I don't think I can beat you.

1421
01:55:22,618 --> 01:55:24,853
Let's try. It would be fun.

1422
01:55:24,954 --> 01:55:26,222
What do you mean by fun?

1423
01:55:26,322 --> 01:55:30,259
We can touch hands.
I just want to arm wrestle.

1424
01:55:32,261 --> 01:55:33,862
Okay, why not?

1425
01:55:33,963 --> 01:55:36,699
Let's give it a try.

1426
01:55:37,533 --> 01:55:41,470
This is no match of any kind.
I'm just glad to meet you.

1427
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:42,571
You trust me, right?

1428
01:55:42,638 --> 01:55:44,907
What's there to trust?
We're just playing.

1429
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,909
Playing?

1430
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:49,411
I'll count to three.

1431
01:55:49,478 --> 01:55:50,679
One, two, three!

1432
01:56:01,757 --> 01:56:04,860
Wow, you're very strong.

1433
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:07,463
You're pretty strong, too.

1434
01:56:07,596 --> 01:56:10,466
Anyway, did we have to do this?

1435
01:56:10,866 --> 01:56:13,636
It's just for fun
but did I upset you?

1436
01:56:13,736 --> 01:56:15,738
No, not at all.

1437
01:56:21,677 --> 01:56:24,280
What about the left hand?

1438
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,481
Left hand?

1439
01:56:25,681 --> 01:56:26,949
Sure.

1440
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,389
Here we go.

1441
01:56:36,525 --> 01:56:37,726
I'll count to three.

1442
01:56:37,826 --> 01:56:39,161
One, two, three.

1443
01:56:47,303 --> 01:56:48,304
Are you okay?

1444
01:57:47,529 --> 01:57:48,864
Hello.

1445
01:57:49,298 --> 01:57:51,900
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- A bug flew into it.

1446
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,371
You should wash it out with tears.

1447
01:57:55,504 --> 01:57:57,039
I've already shed lots of tears.

1448
01:57:57,139 --> 01:57:59,208
Then it will come out soon.

1449
01:57:59,341 --> 01:58:04,480
Oh, your wife called you from Seoul.
She wanted you to call her back.

1450
01:58:04,613 --> 01:58:07,249
Oh, yes.
Why did she call?

1451
01:58:07,349 --> 01:58:09,585
Okay, thank you.
It's because of the bug.

1452
01:58:09,685 --> 01:58:11,854
- It'll come out.
- Okay.

1453
01:58:24,867 --> 01:58:27,369
- Hello?
- It's me.

1454
01:58:27,469 --> 01:58:28,737
Did you call?

1455
01:58:28,904 --> 01:58:30,406
Yes, hours ago.

1456
01:58:30,506 --> 01:58:33,442
- Are you all right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1457
01:58:33,509 --> 01:58:34,943
Anything wrong?

1458
01:58:38,046 --> 01:58:39,348
Hello?

1459
01:58:40,048 --> 01:58:41,083
Sung-in!

1460
01:58:43,719 --> 01:58:48,290
Can I be pregnant?

1461
01:58:48,524 --> 01:58:51,160
What are you talking about?

1462
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:53,228
What shall I do?

1463
01:58:53,695 --> 01:58:55,731
But I can't go there now.

1464
01:58:55,798 --> 01:58:57,099
You're pregnant?

1465
01:58:57,666 --> 01:59:00,702
Yes, it's been two months already.

1466
01:59:01,003 --> 01:59:02,504
I found out yesterday.

1467
01:59:02,771 --> 01:59:04,840
The doctor told me.

1468
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,241
Is it true?

1469
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:09,745
Of course, why would I lie?

1470
01:59:09,845 --> 01:59:10,846
Hold on.

1471
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:12,181
Okay.

1472
01:59:20,689 --> 01:59:22,357
Hello?

1473
01:59:22,825 --> 01:59:24,326
Yes, I'm here.

1474
01:59:24,993 --> 01:59:28,697
Look, don't worry.

1475
01:59:28,797 --> 01:59:31,200
It's already been two months.

1476
01:59:31,667 --> 01:59:35,838
It was probably when we had sex
before you left.

1477
01:59:35,938 --> 01:59:39,141
I'll leave here tomorrow.

1478
01:59:39,308 --> 01:59:40,309
What?

1479
01:59:40,642 --> 01:59:43,545
I'll try to get the first ticket
out of here tomorrow.

1480
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,682
- Really?
- Yes, I will.

1481
01:59:47,516 --> 01:59:50,519
What about the police?
What will you do?

1482
01:59:50,552 --> 01:59:54,022
- What about airport inspection?
- Don't worry.

1483
01:59:54,323 --> 01:59:57,893
I have to go no matter what.
You're having a baby.

1484
01:59:58,126 --> 02:00:02,598
Is it going to be all right?

1485
02:00:02,698 --> 02:00:05,200
I'll do whatever it takes to go.

1486
02:00:08,036 --> 02:00:10,239
Stop crying, honey.

1487
02:00:11,507 --> 02:00:13,442
I'm not.

1488
02:00:14,109 --> 02:00:16,578
October 10

1489
02:01:00,389 --> 02:01:02,424
You're exercising?

1490
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:06,428
No, I got this pain in my waist.

1491
02:01:06,562 --> 02:01:08,697
- Your waist hurts?
- Yeah.

1492
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,799
What kind of exercise is that?

1493
02:01:11,133 --> 02:01:12,801
I made it on my own.

1494
02:01:12,901 --> 02:01:14,703
It's good for the waist and legs.

1495
02:01:14,903 --> 02:01:17,172
I see.

1496
02:01:19,508 --> 02:01:22,110
I might be pregnant.

1497
02:01:22,344 --> 02:01:23,812
Who says?

1498
02:01:24,613 --> 02:01:27,282
I saw the doctor for the pill.

1499
02:01:27,482 --> 02:01:32,120
He said that it could be
less effective after 24 hours.

1500
02:01:32,621 --> 02:01:37,859
That day was so risky
and I might've taken it too late.

1501
02:01:38,093 --> 02:01:39,962
But you took the pill, right?

1502
02:01:40,429 --> 02:01:44,800
It could be dangerous
since I took it a day late.

1503
02:01:45,934 --> 02:01:47,903
So what do we do?

1504
02:01:49,338 --> 02:01:53,241
The only thing we can do is wait.

1505
02:01:55,377 --> 02:01:57,746
Anyway, I'm relieved you're smiling.

1506
02:01:58,647 --> 02:02:00,749
You're 'relieved'?

1507
02:02:02,618 --> 02:02:05,487
What'll we do if I'm pregnant?

1508
02:02:14,162 --> 02:02:17,232
I should have
controlled myself.

1509
02:02:17,499 --> 02:02:19,101
It's not your fault.

1510
02:02:24,873 --> 02:02:26,508
I see.

1511
02:02:27,509 --> 02:02:29,511
I have to go to the washroom.

1512
02:02:54,903 --> 02:02:57,105
Fortunately, it's not cold.

1513
02:02:57,739 --> 02:03:00,108
I'm cold.
Do you have a headache?

1514
02:03:00,242 --> 02:03:01,743
Yeah, a little.

1515
02:03:01,943 --> 02:03:03,578
I have some medicine at home.

1516
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:06,381
I'm fine. Thanks.

1517
02:03:07,082 --> 02:03:09,651
You don't have to go to the airport.

1518
02:03:11,787 --> 02:03:15,390
I want to go.
Let me go there with you.

1519
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:17,526
But you have to come back.

1520
02:03:18,627 --> 02:03:20,128
Are you grateful?

1521
02:03:22,998 --> 02:03:25,467
How bad is your mother?

1522
02:03:26,234 --> 02:03:28,170
I have to go and find out.

1523
02:03:28,336 --> 02:03:31,206
I have to look into things
for her hospitalization.

1524
02:03:31,707 --> 02:03:35,677
She collapsed
so it could be serious.

1525
02:03:38,346 --> 02:03:40,382
You must be very worried.

1526
02:03:43,085 --> 02:03:44,586
Aren't you?

1527
02:03:49,558 --> 02:03:51,793
I'll remember everything.

1528
02:03:52,227 --> 02:03:53,328
What?

1529
02:03:54,129 --> 02:03:58,166
Everything we've done together.

1530
02:04:03,872 --> 02:04:06,208
I must be really unlucky.

1531
02:04:06,742 --> 02:04:09,010
What do you mean by that?

1532
02:04:09,511 --> 02:04:13,682
I think that's just who I am.

1533
02:04:13,949 --> 02:04:16,051
Please stop it.

1534
02:04:17,586 --> 02:04:19,287
What time is it?

1535
02:04:20,021 --> 02:04:23,892
I have to leave in thirty minutes.

1536
02:04:27,362 --> 02:04:31,566
I'm sorry.
You're going through more than me.

1537
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:39,107
What I did was foolish.

1538
02:04:44,846 --> 02:04:46,181
Wait a minute.

1539
02:06:09,364 --> 02:06:11,800
October 12

1540
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:21,142
Sung-in, how could you?

1541
02:06:21,409 --> 02:06:22,410
What?

1542
02:06:24,646 --> 02:06:26,815
How could you lie so well like that?

1543
02:06:27,682 --> 02:06:29,351
I can't believe this.

1544
02:06:29,584 --> 02:06:31,586
I really believed you.

1545
02:06:31,753 --> 02:06:35,357
Yeah, it was really smart of me.
I totally tricked you, didn't I?

1546
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:37,726
You absolutely did.

1547
02:06:38,393 --> 02:06:40,428
At first,
I had no intention to do that.

1548
02:06:40,562 --> 02:06:44,199
But I suddenly felt that
I had to bring you back.

1549
02:06:44,332 --> 02:06:46,868
You were too scared
to come back on your own.

1550
02:06:46,935 --> 02:06:51,406
So when I got your call
the idea just hit me.

1551
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:55,443
The strange thing was
that I was lying so easily.

1552
02:06:58,380 --> 02:07:00,515
Isn't that funny?

1553
02:07:01,583 --> 02:07:04,386
How could you lie to me
that you were pregnant?

1554
02:07:04,519 --> 02:07:07,022
You cried for real, too.

1555
02:07:07,489 --> 02:07:09,591
I was really sad.

1556
02:07:10,225 --> 02:07:14,229
I felt sad about our circumstances.

1557
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:20,402
I think you bring good luck.

1558
02:07:22,070 --> 02:07:27,042
The police treated you nice.
They were kind, weren't they?

1559
02:07:30,478 --> 02:07:33,281
Come on, don't worry.

1560
02:07:33,615 --> 02:07:38,053
All you'll get
is a short detention or fine.

1561
02:07:40,255 --> 02:07:43,925
I believe what they said, don't you?

1562
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:47,562
- Yeah, I hope it turns out okay.
- You said that's what he told you.

1563
02:07:47,729 --> 02:07:50,565
But we should wait till tomorrow.
We'll know then.

1564
02:07:51,566 --> 02:07:54,502
Get a hair cut
before you go to the police station.

1565
02:07:54,636 --> 02:07:58,273
Okay, I'll shave and clean myself up.

1566
02:07:58,373 --> 02:08:01,009
I'm going to iron your shirt,
so put it on tomorrow.

1567
02:08:01,142 --> 02:08:02,110
Okay.

1568
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:04,179
When is Mom coming?

1569
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:07,449
I don't know.
She seems to be late.

1570
02:08:07,582 --> 02:08:08,516
Okay.

1571
02:08:10,251 --> 02:08:11,286
Come here.

1572
02:08:11,386 --> 02:08:12,587
Why?

1573
02:08:12,687 --> 02:08:14,923
Let's go inside
so we can be together.

1574
02:08:16,291 --> 02:08:18,460
Okay, wait a second.

1575
02:08:18,693 --> 02:08:21,730
- After I go to the washroom.
- Okay, hurry back.

1576
02:09:13,014 --> 02:09:16,484
I wanted to make love to you so much.

1577
02:09:17,786 --> 02:09:22,323
I wanted to as well.

1578
02:09:24,759 --> 02:09:26,027
You smell good.

1579
02:09:26,461 --> 02:09:27,729
I haven't showered yet.

1580
02:09:28,263 --> 02:09:29,364
Is that okay?

1581
02:09:29,464 --> 02:09:31,132
Sure, I like it so much.

1582
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:34,002
I love you.

1583
02:09:39,774 --> 02:09:41,109
You're my angel.

1584
02:09:41,309 --> 02:09:45,547
I love everything about you.
Every single thing.

1585
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:47,615
You're so beautiful.

1586
02:09:48,149 --> 02:09:49,684
I'll be nice to you.

1587
02:09:49,984 --> 02:09:52,020
Believe me I will.

1588
02:09:56,524 --> 02:09:58,660
I love you.

1589
02:10:00,428 --> 02:10:04,165
I wish we would have a baby today.

1590
02:10:04,833 --> 02:10:06,568
I'm sorry for lying.

1591
02:10:06,701 --> 02:10:08,203
That's okay.

1592
02:10:09,871 --> 02:10:13,575
I'll do my best for us.

1593
02:10:13,775 --> 02:10:19,280
You're so precious to me,
so I promise to do my best.

1594
02:10:20,115 --> 02:10:22,383
You're a wonderful man.

1595
02:10:22,650 --> 02:10:25,687
I have nobody but you.
All I think about is you.

1596
02:10:25,887 --> 02:10:29,524
If you don't believe that,
I'll go nuts.

1597
02:10:30,492 --> 02:10:31,993
Is that right?

1598
02:10:33,027 --> 02:10:34,829
I love you, Sung-nam.

1599
02:10:34,996 --> 02:10:37,098
I love you, too.

1600
02:10:38,633 --> 02:10:40,602
I love you very, very much.

1601
02:11:19,974 --> 02:11:21,876
The kimchi soup smells so good.

1602
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:23,845
It's done, so come and eat.

1603
02:11:23,945 --> 02:11:24,946
Okay.

1604
02:11:26,447 --> 02:11:27,949
Come closer.

1605
02:11:31,819 --> 02:11:34,822
If we're understanding,
we can overcome anything.

1606
02:11:35,190 --> 02:11:37,825
It's only us and the world.

1607
02:11:55,944 --> 02:11:56,911
Aren't you eating?

1608
02:11:57,078 --> 02:12:00,315
Go ahead.
I don't feel like eating breakfast.

1609
02:12:00,448 --> 02:12:01,583
Is it good?

1610
02:12:01,883 --> 02:12:04,118
I'll tell you after I try it.

1611
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:07,088
It's good.

1612
02:12:07,222 --> 02:12:09,891
Really? I didn't even taste it.

1613
02:12:14,696 --> 02:12:16,764
Wow, it's really good.
I better eat some, too.

1614
02:12:16,931 --> 02:12:19,567
- Yeah, eat.
- No, you go ahead first.

1615
02:12:21,402 --> 02:12:23,805
By the way, I'm getting a perm.

1616
02:12:24,038 --> 02:12:26,274
My long hair feels uncomfortable.

1617
02:12:26,474 --> 02:12:27,976
Can I, huh?

1618
02:12:28,142 --> 02:12:30,745
Why do you always talk
about your hair?

1619
02:12:31,212 --> 02:12:33,081
Don't lay a hand on your hair.

1620
02:12:33,181 --> 02:12:36,017
Don't touch it until you die,
understand?

1621
02:12:36,751 --> 02:12:39,954
You never let me do my hair.

1622
02:12:40,989 --> 02:12:42,123
Just eat.

1623
02:13:04,712 --> 02:13:06,047
Ji-hye, come here.

1624
02:13:06,281 --> 02:13:07,548
Why?

1625
02:13:09,651 --> 02:13:10,952
Sit down.

1626
02:13:14,622 --> 02:13:17,091
I'm going to ask you something,
so be honest.

1627
02:13:20,428 --> 02:13:23,164
Can you go see her with me?

1628
02:13:23,498 --> 02:13:24,866
Who?

1629
02:13:27,201 --> 02:13:29,203
Sung-in, my ex-wife.

1630
02:13:29,504 --> 02:13:30,571
Why?

1631
02:13:30,905 --> 02:13:32,273
She's sick.

1632
02:13:32,607 --> 02:13:34,742
And she can't stand
living alone sick.

1633
02:13:34,909 --> 02:13:36,544
She called me.

1634
02:13:38,279 --> 02:13:39,881
Okay.

1635
02:13:40,014 --> 02:13:41,582
Are you sure?

1636
02:13:42,517 --> 02:13:45,520
Ji-hye, what's important
is how you feel.

1637
02:13:45,687 --> 02:13:48,723
Okay, I'd like to see her
for old times' sake.

1638
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:50,892
Are you going today?

1639
02:13:51,092 --> 02:13:53,594
Today? Today will be better.

1640
02:13:53,761 --> 02:13:56,030
Okay then, let's go today.

1641
02:13:56,197 --> 02:13:57,131
Where are you going?

1642
02:13:57,832 --> 02:13:59,834
To the public bath.

1643
02:14:01,436 --> 02:14:04,472
But do you really want to?

1644
02:14:05,173 --> 02:14:07,575
It's not that I want to.

1645
02:14:07,842 --> 02:14:10,144
I just feel that the time has come.

1646
02:14:11,012 --> 02:14:12,513
Okay.

1647
02:14:19,187 --> 02:14:20,288
Ji-hye.

1648
02:14:20,488 --> 02:14:21,656
Yes?

1649
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:24,859
I was thinking about giving her this.

1650
02:14:25,026 --> 02:14:26,227
That?

1651
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:30,064
Yeah, she'll like it.

1652
02:14:30,264 --> 02:14:32,934
Of course she will.
It's a good one.

1653
02:14:36,537 --> 02:14:37,972
Ji-hye.

1654
02:14:39,841 --> 02:14:41,642
I love you.

1655
02:14:44,679 --> 02:14:46,080
I know.

1656
02:16:01,823 --> 02:16:03,424
Oh no!

1657
02:16:05,159 --> 02:16:06,060
What are you doing?

1658
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:08,529
It's broken, honey.
What shall we do?

1659
02:16:08,596 --> 02:16:10,965
Damn it! Back off!

1660
02:16:11,132 --> 02:16:12,400
I'm sorry.

1661
02:16:12,934 --> 02:16:15,837
It just feel by itself.
I didn't drop it.

1662
02:16:16,003 --> 02:16:18,773
How could it fall by itself?

1663
02:16:18,873 --> 02:16:21,209
I really didn't do it.

1664
02:16:21,342 --> 02:16:25,546
- You did it on purpose, didn't you?
- I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.

1665
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:29,350
It's broken into big pieces,
so let's try to fix it.

1666
02:16:29,450 --> 02:16:31,786
Don't touch it!
Just leave it!

1667
02:16:47,668 --> 02:16:50,671
Sung-nam, but we have to go.
She's waiting for us.

1668
02:16:50,905 --> 02:16:53,708
Let's just get her
something else next time.

1669
02:16:53,808 --> 02:16:55,409
Come on, let's go.

1670
02:16:55,543 --> 02:16:58,179
Why do you keep clinging on to me?

1671
02:16:58,412 --> 02:17:02,149
Who are you to screw this up?

1672
02:17:02,350 --> 02:17:04,585
Who the hell do you think you are?

1673
02:17:04,719 --> 02:17:05,853
Sung-nam, what's wrong?

1674
02:17:05,987 --> 02:17:07,722
Shut up, damn it!

1675
02:17:07,955 --> 02:17:10,791
You crazy bitch!
I hate you!

1676
02:17:10,892 --> 02:17:12,527
Stop it, please.

1677
02:17:12,627 --> 02:17:14,829
This is all because of one porcelain?

1678
02:17:14,929 --> 02:17:16,764
What's the matter with you?

1679
02:17:18,199 --> 02:17:19,967
You're so ridiculous!
You're such a bitch!

1680
02:17:20,067 --> 02:17:21,569
A worthless bitch!

1681
02:17:21,669 --> 02:17:24,405
Get the hell away from me!

1682
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:35,483
Just leave it, damn it!

1683
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:47,628
Come back here!

1684
02:17:48,262 --> 02:17:49,664
Come back!

1685
02:17:50,531 --> 02:17:51,866
Ji-hye!

1686
02:18:18,359 --> 02:18:20,027
Wake up, Sung-nam.

1687
02:18:20,595 --> 02:18:21,729
Wake up.

1688
02:18:21,929 --> 02:18:23,064
What's wrong?

1689
02:18:23,331 --> 02:18:25,299
Come on! Wake up!

1690
02:18:25,566 --> 02:18:26,968
What's the matter?

1691
02:18:29,737 --> 02:18:31,305
Who is she?

1692
02:18:33,608 --> 02:18:34,909
What are you talking about?

1693
02:18:35,009 --> 02:18:38,045
Who are you calling out?
Who is she?

1694
02:18:38,512 --> 02:18:40,681
I can't believe what I heard.

1695
02:18:41,649 --> 02:18:43,551
What was your dream about?

1696
02:18:44,785 --> 02:18:47,388
Did I do that in my dream?

1697
02:18:48,089 --> 02:18:49,657
That's strange.

1698
02:18:50,191 --> 02:18:52,460
What are you hiding from me?

1699
02:18:53,828 --> 02:18:56,664
I wish I hadn't known.

1700
02:18:57,365 --> 02:19:01,369
I bet you had a hard time
deceiving me.

1701
02:19:02,169 --> 02:19:03,871
Who is she? Tell me!

1702
02:19:04,472 --> 02:19:07,775
How should I know?
It happened in my dream.

1703
02:19:07,875 --> 02:19:09,710
Dream or not,
it still upsets me!

1704
02:19:09,777 --> 02:19:12,146
And it wasn't just a dream!

1705
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:19,587
You're right.
It would make you upset.

1706
02:19:22,923 --> 02:19:26,961
You're not some sex-addict, are you?

1707
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:35,970
I'm sorry for having a weird dream.
But it was only a dream.

1708
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:37,905
It wasn't just a dream!

1709
02:19:39,707 --> 02:19:40,841
Was it a dream?

1710
02:19:41,042 --> 02:19:43,177
Sure, it was a dream.

1711
02:19:44,145 --> 02:19:49,183
- Are you sure it was a silly dream?
- Yes, it was. I'm sure of it.

1712
02:19:52,687 --> 02:19:54,588
Come on.

1713
02:19:58,125 --> 02:19:59,326
Get some sleep.

1714
02:19:59,527 --> 02:20:01,328
I don't feel like sleeping.

1715
02:20:01,429 --> 02:20:03,798
Then let me hug you for a minute.

1716
02:20:04,765 --> 02:20:06,033
Okay.

1717
02:20:10,304 --> 02:20:13,407
I swear that I'll be good to you.

1718
02:20:14,842 --> 02:20:16,210
I love you.

1719
02:20:17,945 --> 02:20:19,714
Never leave me alone again.

1720
02:20:19,947 --> 02:20:22,950
And don't have a silly dream again.
It upsets me a lot.

1721
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:26,554
I promise that I won't go anywhere.

1722
02:20:26,821 --> 02:20:28,789
Don't leave me alone.

1723
02:20:28,889 --> 02:20:30,891
I promise.

1724
02:20:39,133 --> 02:20:40,735
I'm sorry.

1725
02:20:41,902 --> 02:20:43,370
That's okay.
