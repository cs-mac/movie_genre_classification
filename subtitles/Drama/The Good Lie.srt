1
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,717
Step up. Please.

2
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,816
Don't forget us in America.

3
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,264
Now we can finally find out
what this means.

4
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,344
This is the story of my
brothers and sisters.

5
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,281
When we were little,
we did not know many things.

6
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,656
We did not know the world was big,
or that it was different from us.

7
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,127
We only knew our villages in Sudan...

8
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,665
which had been there
for thousands of years.

9
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,996
I should say Southern Sudan...

10
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,368
for we were soon to learn
that was an important distinction.

11
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,207
Papa? Papa! Papa!

12
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,713
Mama?

13
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:54,752
Our elders told us we would be safe
in Ethiopia, should anything happen.

14
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,684
We had to walk towards the rising sun.

15
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:02,315
We remembered their teaching
to survive the dangers of nature...

16
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,463
but also to take
advantage of its offering.

17
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,359
Kwol.
Mading.

18
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,730
Majok.
Agong.

19
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,125
Theo!

20
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,462
Gabriel!

21
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,031
Theo!

22
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,337
Theo!

23
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,687
Shh.

24
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,636
That's yours!

25
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,079
Here you go!

26
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,165
Um... There's no containers left
for you guys to put food in.

27
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,310
So you guys will have to wait.

28
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,905
Yeah. That will work.

29
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,106
Hi.

30
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,340
Hello. Can l...?

31
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,510
We need to take him to the medical tent
so he can see a doctor.

32
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,987
Uh, the medical tent?

33
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,423
Amen.

34
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,377
Breathe in.

35
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,016
Breathe out.

36
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,420
Excellent.

37
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,624
She has a respiratory infection.

38
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,359
Very good, Mamere. Moving on.

39
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,203
Doctor Monyang?

40
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,443
Be back.

41
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:44,141
Yes?
I believe she has guinea worm.

42
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,384
We're gonna make you feel better, okay?

43
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,422
Someday when you become a doctor
and someone comes along...

44
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:59,324
as smart as you,
don't be afraid to listen to them.

45
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,759
I won't.

46
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,178
Paul, where have you been?
Where is your shirt?

47
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,942
I traded it to get these.

48
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,115
Ifs called barter trade.

49
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,117
Very good.

50
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,329
The food is ready.

51
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,007
Good?
It's very good.

52
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,600
James.

53
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,817
The promise of a better life in the camp...

54
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,051
had long come and gone
since our arrival.

55
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:08,221
Weeks became months,
and months became years.

56
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,328
We found strength in sticking together.

57
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,801
But our hope of ever leaving was fading.

58
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,741
A new list is up.

59
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,643
Come on, come on!

60
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,940
Is there news?

61
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,280
Yes, there is news.

62
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,452
Our names are on that list!

63
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,051
All of us?
Yes.

64
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,091
We are going to Kansas City, Missouri!

65
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,262
Are you sure?
I am sure.

66
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:21,063
Really? We are going to America!

67
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,802
Blessing be from God
who has to take us to this Kansas City!

68
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,908
Not me. Not me.

69
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,420
It's all right.

70
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,552
It's all right.

71
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,851
So this is what winter
in America feels like.

72
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,318
This is frozen water. It's called ice.

73
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,617
As all of you know,
there are four seasons in America.

74
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,119
Yes, Jacob?

75
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,161
Where are you going again?

76
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,957
Ooh. Yes. You will have such cold.

77
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,193
Mamere?

78
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:30,329
What about education? I want to go
to college and then medical school.

79
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,500
I know education is important to all of you,
and we're gonna talk about that tomorrow.

80
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,146
But right now, we gotta focus on work.

81
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,515
You're gonna have just a few months
to find a job.

82
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,552
You're also gonna have to pay back
the government for your plane fare.

83
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,280
Your date of birth is unknown?
Yes.

84
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,951
Like a lot of the others,
you will be assigned January 1st.

85
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,223
Why on this date?

86
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,525
There will always be a party.

87
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,624
Next.
Thank you.

88
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,442
Relax.

89
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,053
Goodbye, my brothers.

90
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:01,288
Welcome to America!
We are so excited to have you with us.

91
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,925
Did you have a good flight?

92
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,287
It was okay.

93
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,360
Uh-huh. And what are your names?

94
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:07,929
My name is Mamere Deng.

95
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,292
Okay. Mamere.
This is Paul.

96
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,457
Paul.
Jeremiah.

97
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,661
Jeremiah.
My sister, Abital.

98
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,272
Abital. Okay.

99
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,534
No... Abital Deng?

100
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,680
Abital Deng.
I'm sorry. She's not on this list.

101
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,508
Please, you must look again, please.

102
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,047
No, see... Abital Deng!

103
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,118
Abital Deng?
She's here!

104
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,989
She's not on my list.
She's on mine.

105
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,385
Yes, but she belongs
on the Kansas City list.

106
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:41,055
Right, but not anymore. INS rules are that
females have to be placed with families.

107
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,994
A family in Boston wants to take her.

108
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,794
But this is her family.
You cannot take her from us.

109
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,061
Those are the rules.

110
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,897
I want to speak to another official.

111
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,572
Why can't we put her up in a YWCA
for a few weeks while we find her a family?

112
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,544
All right.

113
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,744
I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen.

114
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,681
Please, there must be something you can do.

115
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,047
Guys, we have to go.

116
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,090
I will find a way for us
to be together again.

117
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,525
Okay.
Come.

118
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,063
We'll be together again.

119
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,237
All of you, promise to go to school
and work very hard.

120
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,571
Be strong, my brother.

121
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,678
Abital!

122
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,089
How could you let that happen?

123
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,952
Whoops. Heh-heh-heh.

124
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:17,550
We are to look fora man named Mr. Pamela
Lowi from Faith Based Charities...

125
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,095
at baggage claim. He will guide us.

126
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,109
Yes? Hello, this is Carrie.

127
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,840
Pick up who?

128
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,985
I am sorry. That is not my problem.

129
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,856
I'm not the Welcome Wagon.

130
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,583
Can't they take a cab?

131
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,320
Isn't there anybody else that can do this?

132
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,697
Right now?

133
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,296
All right. What airline?

134
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,366
Okay, I'll be there.

135
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,033
I gotta go.
God, I feel so cheap.

136
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,181
Hey. I think you're forgetting something.

137
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,945
They're from Africa.
I'm sure they're not gonna care.

138
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,480
Next week?
Yeah. Next week.

139
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,882
Hi!

140
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,718
Hey.

141
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,353
You must be the guys from, uh...

142
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,427
Somalia?

143
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,023
Senegal...?

144
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,497
I'm sorry. I... Help me out here.
Sudan.

145
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,034
Sudan! Yes, exactly.

146
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,438
Hello.
My name is Mamere Deng.

147
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,836
These are my brothers,
Jeremiah and Paul.

148
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:17,172
You must be Pamela Lowi
from Faith Based Charities?

149
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,873
No. I'm from the Forrester Employment
Agency. I'm gonna help you find jobs.

150
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,177
I wasn't supposed to meet you
till tomorrow...

151
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,617
but the gal who
from your resettlement agency...

152
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:28,223
got stuck in a car... Anyway...

153
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,555
Okay, uh...

154
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,228
Did your luggage come down the chute?

155
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,559
Great.

156
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,036
Okay, let's go.

157
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,622
Where is your village?

158
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,496
My village?

159
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,595
Uh, my village is...

160
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,931
Elmwood Street close to the university,
I guess.

161
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:21,074
May I ask you, let me say,
where is your darling?

162
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,678
My darling?
Y0ur husband.

163
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,837
Oh, no, no. I'm not married.

164
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:30,178
If you do not have a husband, then it
is your children who provide for you?

165
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:34,517
No. I don't have any children.
I'm not married.

166
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,023
I provide for myself.

167
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,458
Your survival skills are very impressive.

168
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,020
Thanks.
Mm...

169
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:46,463
My brothefs going to be sick.
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

170
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,437
There's no way I can do that by Friday.

171
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,345
No. I'm just not a miracle worker, Tom.

172
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,952
I'll call him when I get
back in the office.

173
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,286
She's talking alone.
I gotta go.

174
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,057
He all right?
He has a weak stomach.

175
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,990
Excuse me. What is that?

176
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,793
Thafs McDonald's.

177
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,128
It's a place to eat.

178
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,005
When was the last time
you guys ate anything?

179
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:56,899
Okay. Here it is.

180
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,069
I'll call you tomorrow.

181
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,955
Are you guys just gonna stand there?

182
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,772
Hello?
Yeah!

183
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:40,413
Hi.
Hello! Hello! You got here.

184
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,949
Thank heavens. So sorry about the mix-up.

185
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:48,288
Well, I'm Pamela Lowi, your volunteer with Faith
Based Charities, your resettlement agency.

186
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,084
I'm gonna take it from here,
but thank you so, so much.

187
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,059
No problem. I'll see you later.
All right.

188
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,095
Excuse me?
Yeah.

189
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,668
You make our hearts throb
for your many kind assists today.

190
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:05,101
Would you be so kind to tell us your name?
Oh, sorry. Didn't I?

191
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,469
My name's Carrie Davis.

192
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,841
I'll call you tomorrow morning
and we'll start thejob hunt.

193
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:13,505
May you find a husband
to fill your empty house.

194
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,814
I'll work on that.

195
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,416
We have a lot to cover.
This is your fridge.

196
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,925
You got your cabinets up here,
your stove top.

197
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,964
And I made you this.

198
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,135
Okey-doke. Follow me.

199
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,168
This is your bedroom.

200
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,138
Cozy, huh? These bunk beds
were just donated to my church...

201
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,834
so I snagged them for you.
They should do the trick.

202
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,139
See this?

203
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,543
If you flip it up, the light comes on.

204
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,343
Isn't that great?
There's one of these in every room.

205
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:56,015
Pamela, we have a sister,
and she has been separated from us.

206
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,387
Yes, right, your sister.

207
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,496
I'm so sorry. No family here wanted her.

208
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:06,829
Switching the paperwork is near impossible,
but I'm sure she's with good people.

209
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,629
Now, this is called a living room.

210
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:13,139
And this light, you've gotta
turn on and off kind of thing.

211
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,299
See?
What I meant to say was...

212
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,470
she needs to be here with us.
Yes, we want her here.

213
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,645
It wouldn't be proper.

214
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,513
Besides, where would you put her
in this tiny place?

215
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,678
Is there someone of authority
on these matters I can speak with?

216
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,984
There's just no getting around it. Sorry.

217
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:33,028
Let's go to the bathroom next.

218
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:37,223
This is your only bathroom.
I did go ahead and get you some bathmatsm.

219
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,560
It's very comfortable, no?

220
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,642
It must be an alarm.

221
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:29,467
Maybe.

222
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,899
Mamere! Jeremiah! Open the door!

223
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,134
You are here.

224
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:00,404
Why didn't you answer the phone?
I've been calling you.

225
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:04,911
For job hunt? We waited by the window,
but we did not hear your call.

226
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:09,518
No, I called you on this.
This is a telephone.

227
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,711
Do you know what a telephone is?

228
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,349
Okay. We already missed
the 10:00 interview...

229
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:17,493
let's head straight
to the restaurant.

230
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,169
Carrie!

231
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,575
Roger, hey. How are you?

232
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:37,769
You never called me.

233
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,408
I'm sorry. I've been so busy with work.

234
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,880
Um... Guys, this is Roger.
He works with the local police force.

235
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,513
We appreciate any person
who risks their life to uphold the law.

236
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,183
May God bless you
and keep you safe from harm.

237
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,900
I'll call you. Come on, guys!

238
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,557
Nice to meet you.

239
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,239
Hey.
Hey, Matt.

240
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,137
What's up?
I know you have some openings in food prep...

241
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,405
and it just so happens that these guys
have a lot of experience.

242
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,378
Okay. I'll talk to them.

243
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,743
Thank you.

244
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,213
Hey.

245
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,978
So...

246
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,486
what brings you to the United States?

247
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:26,089
My parents were killed in the civil war in
Sudan, and my sisters were taken as slaves.

248
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,958
Do you have any restaurant experience?

249
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,660
I would like to study to become a doctor.

250
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,899
That's good.

251
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,500
Are we going to eat now?

252
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:43,968
Sure.

253
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,137
You really want me to
hire these guys, Carrie?

254
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,511
They have no experience.
They're too strange.

255
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,151
If you can't take all of them,
just take one of them.

256
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,085
We don't have any space right now.
Check back in six months.

257
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:57,317
Maybe something will open up.
You're giving me that speech?

258
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,017
.No..
I know that speech.

259
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,753
You're blowing me off.
I'm not!

260
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,956
You're seriously trying to tell me
that these rocket scientists...

261
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,158
are more qualified than those guys?
Yes!

262
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,844
You're out of your mind.
I don't think we'll get a job here.

263
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:09,997
Carrie, I'm sorry...

264
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,132
We're leaving. Get in the car.

265
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:27,684
We get job here?

266
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,721
No, were going to see Jack Forrester.

267
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,326
He owns the employment agency
where I work.

268
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,163
I'll be right back.

269
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,869
Hey, Jack.
Hi.

270
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:47,537
What's going on?

271
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,571
Welcome to the longest day of my life.

272
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,848
I need your help.

273
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,415
You need my help?
With work.

274
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:59,413
Something happen in the office or something?
Not exactly.

275
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:03,923
I have these guys from Africa, and I can't
even get them through one job interview.

276
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:07,528
So you brought them here?
Where else was I supposed to bring them?

277
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:09,923
You know how you make people smile.

278
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,940
That's it.
Potential employers want to see you smile.

279
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,214
You can stop now.

280
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,580
To smile without meaning it,
is that not insincere?

281
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,863
Oh, yeah. Ifs total bullshit.
But Americans like it...

282
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,052
and that's where you live now,
so it's what you've gotta do.

283
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,353
Now, are any of you good with your hands?

284
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,426
Great, I'll make some calls.
Now, listen, this is important.

285
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:47,032
Since you have little or no experience,
you have to impress...

286
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:51,640
upon any potential employer
how good you'd be at any given job.

287
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:53,139
But that would be a lie.

288
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,278
As long as you can back it up
with hard work, it's not lying.

289
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,142
I think Donner has some openings
for assembly line workers.

290
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,216
What about Nick at Star Grocery?
These two could stock shelves.

291
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:05,115
That's a good idea.
I'll call Frank, you call Nick.

292
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,483
Done. All right. Thanks, guys.

293
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:11,791
You have a very beautiful village.

294
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,889
Thank you. It was my father's.
Your father was a chief?

295
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,499
I guess some people
would have called him that.

296
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,431
My father was a chief too.

297
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,468
May we visit with your cow?

298
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,506
Be my guest.
Are there any dangerous animals...

299
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:28,269
of which we should be warned?
Such as?

300
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,433
Lions.

301
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:36,342
No. There's no lions here. You're safe.

302
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,647
Thank you.

303
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,862
Man, I wish they wouldn't do that.

304
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:51,932
What's their story anyway?

305
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,692
I'm not sure.
They seem pretty traumatized.

306
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:57,499
When I dropped them off
the other night I said goodbye...

307
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,505
they looked at me
like they were never gonna see me again.

308
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,806
You can't get involved in their problems.
We'll just end up in a lawsuit or something.

309
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,710
Yeah.

310
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,346
Not much has changed around here.

311
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,619
I've been meaning to paint the porch.

312
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,562
I should probably get them back.
It's getting late.

313
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,530
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

314
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:31,030
This probably seems
overwhelming at first...

315
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,869
but I promise you in no time
you'll get the hang of it.

316
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:38,513
You'll kind of have to in this section because
people can never find their cereal...

317
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,580
even when it's right in front of them.

318
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,480
So memorize the names
and where all the different boxes go.

319
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:47,350
And some of these brands
have up to 12 different flavors.

320
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,720
It's a lot, but you'll get it.
Do you guys have any questions?

321
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:56,720
You don't say a whole lot.
Okay. You're shy. That's cool.

322
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:01,729
Follow me this way.
Where are you guys from anyway?

323
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,165
Sudan.
Hmm.

324
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:08,174
So this is the dog food section,
and you have to restock it...

325
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,608
all the time,
and the bags can be really heavy.

326
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,108
Food for dogs?

327
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,444
Mike? Jerry?

328
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,084
Mike! Jerry!

329
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:21,620
Grab these couple of carts.
Push them out back with me.

330
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,562
Roll them down right here.

331
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:38,106
(0K8)'-

332
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:42,301
This is where you throw the old food so you
can restock the shelves with the new food.

333
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,911
Old food?

334
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:46,105
When the food expires, ifs not safe to eat.

335
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,308
Plus it's a big headache with the health
department. Believe me, it's better this way.

336
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:53,318
Isn't there someone
who might want or need this food?

337
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:58,721
I don't sell the food inside the store
to give it away outside. I'm a businessman.

338
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,793
Anyway, it's none of your concern.

339
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:20,074
Now today we're working on a hand
shower with multiple spray settings.

340
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,581
Just got a big order from a hotel chain.

341
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,187
All right, training table's this way.
Let's get you a little practice.

342
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:31,484
This is the faucet assembly.
Look at all the different parts, okay?

343
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,823
Go ahead. Hold it in your hand,
familiarize yourself with everything.

344
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,831
Every part here is made and assembled
in the U.S. Something we're very proud of.

345
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,267
Holy cow.

346
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,975
It work like this?

347
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,811
Yeah. You bet.

348
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,684
Let us pray.

349
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:08,186
Dear God, let us give thanks
to this miracle food, pizza...

350
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,394
but most important,
look out after our sister, Abital...

351
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:17,733
so that she's safe in this Boston, where
her brothers are not there to protect her.

352
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:19,636
Amen.
Amen.

353
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,894
I heard something at work today.
It's called a joke.

354
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,889
Tell us.

355
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,427
Why did the chicken cross the road?

356
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:49,328
Why did the chicken cross the road?

357
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,071
To get to the other side!

358
00:53:58,836 --> 00:53:59,837
Cheerios.

359
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,847
Honey Nut Cheerios.
Multi-grain Cheerios.

360
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,178
Banana Nut Cheerios.

361
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:08,623
We are forgetting one. Frozen Cheerios.

362
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,759
Not frozen, frosted.

363
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:16,221
What is so funny?
I'm thinking about that chicken.

364
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,702
Carrie?

365
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,334
Holy crap!

366
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,565
Are you crazy?
There is a reason you do not have a husband.

367
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,200
What the hell are you doing?
You can'tjust break into somebodys house!

368
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,348
I didn't. The door was unlocked.

369
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:15,541
How'd you even know where I live?

370
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,151
I used my map.

371
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:22,052
I am here to thank you. Because of
you, my brothers and I have jobs.

372
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,057
Okay. Thank you so much.
That's really nice of you.

373
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,992
But that's my job.
So once I get you a job, my job is done.

374
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,599
Okay? If you want to bring me oranges,
just call me on the telephone. Okay?

375
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:34,427
Okay. Sorry, Carrie.
Thank you.

376
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:21,936
Now, hold onto these receipts for your plane
fare and your records for at least one year.

377
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,336
You guys are lucky.

378
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,109
Since 9/11, the program that brought
you here is stopped indefinitely.

379
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,149
What about everyone waiting
in the refugee camp?

380
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:35,654
For now they're stuck there.
You're fortunate you made it.

381
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:40,386
We have a sister who's been sent to Boston,
and she needs to be here with us.

382
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,795
Right now the system is overloaded.

383
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,900
I'd wait a few months
until things have cooled down.

384
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,994
Thank you.
You're welcome.

385
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:58,806
Abital, I am now teaching Sunday school
at our church.

386
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,074
That's excellent. Just like at camp.

387
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,309
Abital?
Yes, Paul?

388
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,920
You know, Mamere is going to go to school.
Great news!

389
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:11,354
Only one of us can go at a time.
It is very expensive.

390
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:14,052
I have two jobs now to help pay for it.

391
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:15,659
Be patient, Paul.

392
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:18,663
I'm sorry. [Have to go now.
My family is waiting for me.

393
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,165
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

394
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:07,910
Hey, Paul?

395
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,219
What's up, man? Um...

396
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,753
Listen, you're always out of synch.

397
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,654
Out of synch?
Right. We're a unit, you know...

398
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:23,058
so when you're on the line,
you just gotta take it easy.

399
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,927
Take it easy?

400
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:13,014
Jerry, we need you in produce, please.

401
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,222
Hey, you! Don't go in there.

402
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,954
I'm sorry.

403
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,194
What I have in here is much fresher.

404
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,568
Thank you.

405
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,972
What the hell are you doing?

406
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,183
It is a sin not to give to those in need.

407
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,651
According to who?

408
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,154
Jeremiah.

409
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:57,753
And who's that?

410
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:04,065
Me.

411
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,366
My name is Jeremiah.

412
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,009
Jeremiah? Come to my office.

413
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,221
I miss Sudan.

414
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,792
Why?

415
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,362
Because in Sudan
we know what a lion looks like.

416
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,599
Okay. Look, Nick Costas just called me,
and he's really upset.

417
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,864
So why don'! You tell me what happened?
I'm sorry if I bring you dishonor.

418
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:48,100
But I cannot do a job
I believe in my heart is wrong.

419
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,945
You don't bring me dishonor personally...

420
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:55,048
but this company did vouch for you,
and it is a big deal.

421
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:58,812
Let me explain something to you. In
America, we have this thing called bosses.

422
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:02,923
Sometimes they're just assholes. And they
have too much power for their tiny brains.

423
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:07,550
And they get really angry when you don't follow
their orders. But you have to put up with it...

424
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:12,393
because you need money
to live and to eat and to go to school.

425
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:16,059
So I'm gonna try and get you more job
interviews. It's not gonna be easy.

426
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:18,172
I have faith, Yardit.

427
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:22,073
Yardit?
This is our special name for you.

428
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,740
For me?
Yes. It has great cultural significance.

429
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:30,146
What does it mean?
It means great white cow.

430
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,348
(0K8)'-

431
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,687
Well, ifs better than a lot of things
I've been called.

432
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,088
Hey, you're, uh...?
Jeremiah.

433
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:45,255
Jeremiah. Right. Where you going?

434
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,197
To my home.

435
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:49,200
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

436
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:55,002
You are Carrie's boss.
Heh. Nobody's Carrie's boss.

437
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,968
Oh, this is a very fine car.

438
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,546
Thank you.

439
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:10,655
May I ask, what credential
is required to drive a car'?

440
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:15,160
You need a driver's license.
You practice, and then you pass a test.

441
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,490
Oh, slow down! Slow dcz-uvn!
Left, left, okay, now just slop“ Whoa!

442
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:23,297
Hold on, put on the brakes!
Brakes! Brakes!

443
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,307
You okay?
Oh...

444
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:29,637
I think you should just stick to walking.

445
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:36,681
Having all read Huckleberry Finn, can
anyone tell me what "the good lie" means?

446
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:41,418
Huck uses lies to survive
in undesirable situations.

447
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:47,187
Exactly. But later in the book,
the lies change. How so?

448
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:52,262
They change because Huck changes.

449
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,758
Yes. Keep going-

450
01:04:55,191 --> 01:05:00,504
When he tells the slave hunters
that he has no slaves, his lie is credible.

451
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:03,542
So he lies well.
But what is more important...

452
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,011
is that it is an unselfish lie,
because it saves Jim.

453
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:11,585
Jim's freedom means more to Huck than the
money he would get for turning him in.

454
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,555
So it is a good lie.

455
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,050
Could not have said it better.

456
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:21,551
Let us tum to chapter 19, page 108.

457
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,092
"Here is the way we put in the time.

458
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:31,070
It was a monstrous big river down there,
sometimes a mile and a half wide."

459
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:21,277
Where have you been?

460
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,983
What is wrong with your eyes?

461
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,955
Nothing.

462
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,853
You could have an infection.

463
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:33,158
Let me look. Let me see.

464
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,500
Stop pretending
you're something you're not, Mamere.

465
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,368
You're not a doctor.

466
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:42,874
You're not Theo.

467
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:49,006
We are in America now,
and in America we are nothing.

468
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,708
That is not true.

469
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,852
You think you're so smart
that we want all you want.

470
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:57,820
We don't. I don't.

471
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,621
Then what do you want?
I don't want this!

472
01:07:01,284 --> 01:07:03,730
I don't want to work so I can be, whatm?

473
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:06,367
Be alone? Be nobody?

474
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,562
Paul!

475
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,645
Paul!

476
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:23,840
Paul.

477
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:16,064
I'm sorry, dude. I gotta ask.

478
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,903
What happened?
This?

479
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:22,272
A lion.

480
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:30,617
I'm serious, a lion.
Okay. Yeah, it was a lion. From Africa.

481
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,481
Come on.

482
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:38,992
The smell of this lion
was very sweet like rain.

483
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,318
That was a surprise to me.

484
01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:46,058
He put his mouth onto
the leg of my brother.

485
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,966
I tried to pull the lion off...

486
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:53,933
but it clawed me.

487
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:56,008
Whoa, man. You're serious.

488
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:02,076
Lions do not leave the bones
of their meals the way vultures does.

489
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:04,683
They take it with them...

490
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,783
to their family...

491
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:14,285
and share them.

492
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,692
Sometime I wonder...

493
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:25,199
where is that lion who ate my brother?

494
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,476
Would I know him if I saw him?

495
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:37,111
Would he know me?

496
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,329
He didn't punch out?

497
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,868
Wait, you're saying he's done this before?

498
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,999
Okay, no. I'm sorry.

499
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:39,544
Thank you for your understanding.
Yeah, I'm gonna get right into it.

500
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:44,114
Okay. I'll call you back. Bye.

501
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,547
Mamere?

502
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,759
Paul?

503
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,400
Jeremiah?

504
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,280
Hey.

505
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,810
You did not call first.

506
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,355
Ha-ha-ha. Busted. Welcome.

507
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,987
What are you guys doing out here?
It's freezing.

508
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,856
We miss seeing the stars.

509
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,626
I'm looking for Paul. Have you seen him?

510
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,538
May we invite you in for some tea?

511
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:17,540
You know how to play dominoes?

512
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,805
Uh, no.

513
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:22,808
I teach you.

514
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:24,610
(0K8)'-

515
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,789
Paul comes home very late or not at all.

516
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,382
Spends many days and nights
away from us.

517
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,618
Doing what?

518
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:35,387
I don't know.

519
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:37,654
Did something happen?

520
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,663
Lately Paul has not been Paul.

521
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:45,398
He's your younger brother, right?
We do not share the same mother or father.

522
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:49,737
Oh, I didn't know.
There is only me and my sister, Abital.

523
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:52,140
Oh. Ls that the girl on the fridge?

524
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:55,248
Yes.
Where is she?

525
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,509
INS sent her to Boston.

526
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,745
Because there is not one family
that wanted her here in Kansas City.

527
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:03,356
Why?

528
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,924
It's difficult for us to talk about.

529
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,722
Because there was nothing I could do.

530
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:24,203
Operator. How can Ihelp you?

531
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,075
Hello, I need to speak
to Abital Deng right away.

532
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,707
What city?
The city of Boston, please.

533
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,785
Can you spell the name?

534
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:37,550
D-E-N-G.

535
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,351
You must find her, please.

536
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,118
Calm down, sir. I need an address.

537
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:46,427
Please! You must help me!
I need to speak to Abital Deng!

538
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:47,897
Hello'?

539
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,917
Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing?

540
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,166
What do you have to say?

541
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:23,099
Nothing.
Nothing?

542
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:25,933
You bring shame upon us
and you say nothing?

543
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:29,838
You have been given a chance at life that
was taken from your brothers in Africa.

544
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:32,605
And this is what you do with it?
How could you forget?

545
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:37,513
No, it is you who forget. Who gave you
life, Mamere? Do you remember? I do.

546
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,447
Do not tell me what I remember.

547
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:42,250
I remember everything! Everything!

548
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:45,983
You did not deserve to come here!
Your brothers died so you could leave!

549
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,357
No, Theo died so you could leave.
Theo didn't want us to stop.

550
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,998
He knew it was unsafe. But you made him.
You put us in danger.

551
01:14:57,126 --> 01:15:00,664
You should have stood up on that grass
that day, not Theo. I saw everything!

552
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,208
Guys. You gotta...
This has nothing to do with you.

553
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:06,006
This is not your war. I'm still your chief.

554
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:08,876
You're not my chief. I know.
We all know. You killed Theo.

555
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:11,712
You are not my chief!
You have never been my chief!

556
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,785
Oh, my God! Get off of him!

557
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,182
Carrie! Let them be!

558
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,017
You guys, stop!
Let them be!

559
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,988
Stop it!

560
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,654
Get him off of him!

561
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,997
Paul, come on!
Paul!

562
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:28,799
You are not my chief!
You are not my chief!

563
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,031
Mamere, are you okay?

564
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,676
Don't look at me.

565
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:33,429
Who's there?

566
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,527
Hello'?

567
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,568
My God, you're half frozen.

568
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,728
I want to see my cows.

569
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,738
I cannot make it stop, Jack.

570
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,208
What can't you make stop?
I can't make it stop.

571
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,402
Sit down.

572
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:56,553
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

573
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,491
What's your fault?

574
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:09,736
I let my brother be taken away
by soldiers instead of me.

575
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,934
They took him away thinking he was me.

576
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,436
Theo told these soldiers he was all alone.

577
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:21,976
To protect us. To protect me.

578
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:28,922
It should have been me. I know this.
You don't know that, Mamere.

579
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:31,589
Look at me.

580
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,960
I was in the Army. I have been to war.

581
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:40,198
But most of us were just average guys...

582
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,630
being faced with unimaginable things...

583
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,602
being asked to make choices
no one should have to make.

584
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:53,336
Your brother made a choice
that night that was only his to make.

585
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,640
It wasn't your choice.

586
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,044
You didn't have that power.
You never did.

587
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:01,016
L still hear the sounds of guns
and the crying of children.

588
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,848
The cries...

589
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:10,295
There were so many, Jack.

590
01:18:41,684 --> 01:18:45,757
I want you to be my brother, not my chief.

591
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:48,026
No more.

592
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:30,868
You don't have an appointment.

593
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:35,778
Yeah. I know. I just stood in line
for two hours for you to tell me that?

594
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:38,214
We have an opening in three months.

595
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:40,877
Oh, no, I'm not leaving here
until I see a supervisor.

596
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:44,455
If you'll step to the side and wait
until I help everyone in line here...

597
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,287
I'm not stepping to the side
and I'm not waiting any more.

598
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:51,829
Now, who do I have to screw around here
to see a goddamn immigration supervisor?

599
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,263
Uh... Me.

600
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:55,997
Great.

601
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,603
Thanks, cupcake.

602
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:02,002
Name?
Abital Deng. D-E-N-G.

603
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:07,742
Age?
She's probably 21.

604
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,014
Probably? Where is she from?

605
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,481
Sudan.

606
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:18,084
That's gonna be a problem.
Sudan has sponsored terrorist activity.

607
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:21,685
We're not gonna be able to move her
across state lines so easily.

608
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,797
We're talking about a kid here.
She's a child refugee of war.

609
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,660
I know. It's absurd.

610
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:30,964
But she's caught in a bureaucratic
crossfire, and it's gonna take a while.

611
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,640
What can I do to make it move faster?

612
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,336
You could hire a good immigration lawyer.

613
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:39,342
But if you're telling me the reason
they were separated...

614
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:45,110
is because there was no host family here for
her, then you're going to have to find one.

615
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:48,186
Otherwise, there's no chance.

616
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,889
H6Y-.Hey-

617
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:58,997
Thanks for coming over on such short notice.
Yeah, sure.

618
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:02,226
I know you're busy on Sundays
with church and everything...

619
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:03,802
so thanks for coming.

620
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:07,202
Uh-huh.
I need your help.

621
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,365
Yeah. You do.

622
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:13,171
I'm just wondering
what you think of this room.

623
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,576
Whether I could turn it into a bedroom...

624
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:19,183
maybe fix it up,
get rid of some of this stuff.

625
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:21,716
I'm wondering if you think
it'd be good enough...

626
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,050
for the INS to approve me
hosting a refugee?

627
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:27,092
Or if your agency
would even back me up on that?

628
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:31,062
If you can get the whole house presentable,
and not just this room, yeah.

629
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,599
I think you can get approval.
What's wrong with the rest of the house?

630
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,268
Really?

631
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,098
All right. So where do we begin?

632
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,003
Why don't you make us some coffee?

633
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:46,169
I have tequila.
Praise the Lord.

634
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:47,575
Great.

635
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,239
Wow, this is amazing.
This looks really clean.

636
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:51,908
We did it!

637
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,420
Mm.

638
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:00,184
So how many kids do you have anyway?

639
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:02,727
Ugh. Too many.
Ha-ha-ha!

640
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:06,526
Um... I don't know what I was thinking
to be honest.

641
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:13,565
Hey.

642
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,971
You sure you're ready to take this on?

643
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:21,643
Yeah. Definitely.

644
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,045
Okay, just one more.

645
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:59,241
These Christmas decorations
are very elaborate, yes?

646
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,115
I go all out for Christmas.

647
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,018
I make my own baby Jesuses
out of papier-méché.

648
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,949
But Santa Claus doesn't come to Sudan.

649
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:09,595
Well, he's coming here.

650
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,357
So, what time should we be expecting him?

651
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:16,536
Ha-ha-ha.
Very late at night. And only if you're good.

652
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:18,171
He sounds like a burglar to me.

653
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:23,508
Mamere, I left some groceries on the porch.
Can you help me?

654
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,201
Yes.
Thanks.

655
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:31,049
Abital!

656
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:47,494
I like this Christmas!

657
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,376
You okay?

658
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,813
You're doing really good!

659
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,340
You look like an old bison!

660
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:59,535
Happy birthday to you.

661
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:03,734
Happy birthday, dear lost boys.

662
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:10,877
My brothers. It is wonderful to see you all
here as we celebrate the day of our birth.

663
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:17,154
We may not know the exact day we were born,
but we know about the day.

664
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,489
Our mothers told us.

665
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,322
Our mothers were very tall,
liked to tell us stories.

666
01:25:24,086 --> 01:25:28,432
We remember her words, even if we do not
remember the sound of her voice.

667
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,162
She told us to remember who we are...

668
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,301
and all who came before us.

669
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,068
Thank you.

670
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:43,416
Ab ital!

671
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,330
Mm. This reminds me
of when I was a little girl.

672
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:45,876
My sister and I used to sneak downstairs
when our parents were asleep...

673
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,742
and we'd steal all the ice cream
and eat all of it.

674
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:51,079
Is she like you, your sister?

675
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:52,718
No.

676
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,512
She was nice.

677
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,983
My mom used to say that I was born
pissed off and Kelly was born chipper.

678
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:00,824
"Chipper"?

679
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:03,861
Happy. She was always happy.

680
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:07,362
I used to tease her.
I used to call her Chipper.

681
01:27:07,756 --> 01:27:09,099
She hated it.

682
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:11,395
Where is she?

683
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,030
Oh, she got cancer two
years ago, and, uh...

684
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,602
It just ripped through
her like a firestorm.

685
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:24,043
And then, ahem, one day she was just gone.

686
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:30,448
And you wonder why it was her
and not you?

687
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:03,579
What?
My brother is doing laundry?

688
01:28:06,248 --> 01:28:08,489
You are good to marry. Ha-ha-ha!

689
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:16,634
I got a letter from Kenya yesterday,
and I'm not sure what to believe.

690
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,398
What?

691
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:23,238
A man came into the camp a month
ago looking for us.

692
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:26,974
It is possible he might have taken
our names off the list of people...

693
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:30,582
who have immigrated in order
to pretend he's someone we know.

694
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,695
It is not possible.

695
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:46,423
But what if it is?

696
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:49,993
What if ifs really him and he's alive?

697
01:28:54,963 --> 01:28:56,670
Theo.

698
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:10,347
I don't understand. He's a refugee of war.
He needs asylum.

699
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:14,619
All flights from the Kakuma Refugee Camp
have been stopped since 9/11.

700
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:18,390
They have thousands there
waiting for the same opportunity.

701
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:22,626
But he has his family here.
Faith Based Charities is ready to step in.

702
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:25,829
I'll sponsor him. I'll pay for his ticket.
He can live with me.

703
01:29:25,994 --> 01:29:28,565
We could get him a work visa.
He knows cattle.

704
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:33,007
You know, this might not even be
your brother, Mamere.

705
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:37,344
There have been people who faked their identities
just to get out of situations like this.

706
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:40,213
Which is why I need to go
and see for myself.

707
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:44,479
Cat, could you give us a second, please?

708
01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:46,319
Thank you.

709
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,892
You could try some embassy shopping.

710
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,761
Explain that.
Okay.

711
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:59,338
You go to Nairobi, you get into every
embassy you can and ask for asylum.

712
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:02,941
You tell them your brothers story.
And you see if you can get a country...

713
01:30:03,098 --> 01:30:05,908
in good standing with the U.S.
to write him a visa. Okay?

714
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,707
So he has to go halfway
around the world to do this?

715
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,076
Yes.

716
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,378
And it will all hinge on hitting
the right embassy on the right day.

717
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:17,718
Providing that happens,
then we can work on transferring...

718
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:20,621
the paperwork
through diplomatic channels.

719
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:57,892
Plane food sucks.

720
01:30:58,286 --> 01:30:59,788
Thank you, Yardit.

721
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:05,071
Call me if you need anything, okay?

722
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,970
Excuse me. I am looking for my brother.

723
01:32:13,128 --> 01:32:15,802
He may have arrived here a month ago
from Northern Sudan.

724
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:17,476
Where did you hear that?

725
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:20,236
A letter to my sister
from somebody here in the camp.

726
01:32:20,402 --> 01:32:22,143
What is his name?

727
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:24,373
Theo Deng.

728
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,377
Deng. Yes.

729
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,513
Thank you.

730
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:49,240
I'm sorry. There is no one registered here
under that name.

731
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,933
So what do I do?

732
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:55,844
You can search the camp. Talk to everyone.
But be careful what you say.

733
01:32:56,004 --> 01:32:57,449
How many are here now?

734
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,916
Almost one hundred thousand,
give or take a few.

735
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,078
Okay. Thank you.
Hmm.

736
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:25,404
Mamere? Mamere! Mamere Deng!

737
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:26,602
James!

738
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,782
Look at you! You are fat!
Heh-heh!

739
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:35,050
How are you?
Oh. So-so.

740
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:39,051
It is good you left here.
This is a darkness place.

741
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:41,892
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

742
01:33:42,484 --> 01:33:45,897
I am looking for my brother, Theo.
Have you seen him?

743
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:48,795
What does he look like?
I am not sure. Maybe like me.

744
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:52,728
Okay. I will let everyone know.
Come on. Come on.

745
01:35:31,426 --> 01:35:33,337
Mamere?
Theo!

746
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:39,344
The others?

747
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:44,245
Daniel is with God.
But the rest of us, we all made it.

748
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:45,941
My God!

749
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:47,951
My God!

750
01:36:07,195 --> 01:36:08,697
I hear something.

751
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:11,969
Along time ago, I was very sick.

752
01:36:14,402 --> 01:36:17,940
Rheumatic fever. It has hurt your heart.

753
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:20,882
No more. My heart is healed.

754
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:23,382
Remove your shirt.

755
01:36:43,598 --> 01:36:45,168
Thank you.

756
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:53,277
I am going to Nairobi
to get papers for you.

757
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:55,682
It may take several days.

758
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:59,959
Don't worry. I'll be back.

759
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:14,834
Go.

760
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:16,441
Next.

761
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:20,176
I wish I could help you.

762
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:23,282
Honestly, the world is a very confused
place right now.

763
01:37:23,438 --> 01:37:26,715
Indeed it is. No embassy would help me.

764
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:29,218
I know. I'm sorry.

765
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:35,393
Good luck.

766
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,401
Hey, Theo.

767
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:49,569
Is it done?

768
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,068
Yes. It is done.

769
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,232
James.

770
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:22,939
Bye. Bye.

771
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:30,376
Goodbye, my brothers!

772
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:33,886
Goodbye, my brothers.

773
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:00,411
Theo.

774
01:39:00,568 --> 01:39:04,311
When you get on the plane, a helpful
person will take you to your seal.

775
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:06,042
You will show me these things.

776
01:39:10,478 --> 01:39:11,889
Theo.

777
01:39:12,647 --> 01:39:14,490
From this moment on...

778
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:19,289
it is very important that you
only answer to the name Mamere.

779
01:39:19,487 --> 01:39:21,160
What are you saying?

780
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:24,832
I could not get you any papers.

781
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,303
No, Mamere. I cannot.
Yes, but you must.

782
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,144
But it is a lie.
Yes, I know. But it is a good lie.

783
01:39:38,773 --> 01:39:43,279
But you...?
L will go to Kakuma. I can work at the hospital.

784
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:46,452
Theo, you gave me life.

785
01:39:46,614 --> 01:39:50,084
That day in the elephant grass,
you gave us all life.

786
01:39:50,251 --> 01:39:52,128
I give it back to you.

787
01:39:52,954 --> 01:39:54,831
You are chief now.

788
01:40:04,532 --> 01:40:06,637
Now, go. Go. Go.

789
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,916
Today we have a very special guest speaker.

790
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:56,220
Many of you already know him.

791
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,364
I'd like to welcome Jeremiah.

792
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:10,270
This is the story of my
brothers and sisters.

793
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:14,208
When we were children, our fathers
said, "Let something of me survive."

794
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:17,182
We did not even know what does it mean.

795
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:19,885
But then we saw our family murdered...

796
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:23,511
and our villages destroyed,
and then we understood.

797
01:41:23,945 --> 01:41:28,587
We held inside ourselves the memories
of our forefathers and their teachings...

798
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,123
so that we could move
fom/ard in the world.

799
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:36,862
Like an invisible bridge their memory
connects our old life with our new.

800
01:41:41,362 --> 01:41:44,536
They say we were saved
by coming to the United States.

801
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:47,644
But we also saved each other.

802
01:41:47,802 --> 01:41:50,282
And although our differences
may divide us...

803
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:53,419
our common humanity unites us.

804
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:57,920
For we are brothers and sisters, all of us.

805
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:01,117
We try to share this wonderful world
we call home.

806
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:06,458
They call us the Lost Boys of Sudan.

807
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:09,165
I don't think we are lost.

808
01:42:09,924 --> 01:42:11,733
I think we are found.
