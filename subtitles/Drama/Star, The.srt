00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,612
Good day to you.

2
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,282
What do you want?

3
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,042
Boy, get in here now!

4
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,840
What took you so long?

5
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,259
I was cleaning the fan switches.

6
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,595
Watch the store. I've got some selling to do.

7
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,939
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

8
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,066
They seemed nice to me.

9
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,110
Clean the racks...

10
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,529
...then you can go home.

11
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,079
Are you going to pay for that?

12
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,957
It costs seven wupiupi.

13
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,179
Is this yours?

14
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,145
Careful, Sebulba.

15
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,189
He's a big time outlander.

16
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,776
I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.

17
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,947
Next time we race, boy, it will be the end of you.

18
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,033
If you weren't a slave I'd squash you now.

19
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,579
Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.

20
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:11,185
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

21
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,181
You're such a joker, Ani.

22
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:10,539
Better stop your friend's betting or I'll end up owning him too.

23
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,526
You won't walk away from this one...

24
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,779
...you slave scum.

25
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,240
Don't count on it, slime ball.

26
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,911
You're bantha fodder!

27
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:23,000
Welcome.

28
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:27,504
Begin the race!

29
02:16:08,827 --> 02:16:09,828
