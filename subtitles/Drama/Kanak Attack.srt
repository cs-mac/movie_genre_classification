1
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,557
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,684
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,895
[Droid Beeping]

4
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,280
[Grunts]
We made it.

5
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,451
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>I guess I was wrong.</i>

6
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,787
There was no danger at all.

7
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,517
Cordé.

8
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,562
Milady, I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,814
<i>I've failed you, Senator.</i>

10
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,859
No.

11
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,155
Milady, you're still
in danger here.

12
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,498
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

13
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,169
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

14
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,215
Senator Amidala,
please.

15
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:31,522
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

16
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,691
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

17
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,237
- If they do break away--
- I will not let this Republic...

18
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,907
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

19
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,244
My negotiations
will not fail.

20
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,873
<i>If they do, you must realize</i>
<i>there aren't enough Jedi</i>
<i>to protect the Republic.</i>

21
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,502
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

22
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,506
<i>Master Yoda.</i>

23
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,300
Do you think it will
really come to war?

24
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:06,098
Hmm, the dark side
clouds everything.

25
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:11,186
Impossible to see
the future is.

26
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,191
[Speaking Huttese]
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

27
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,027
- <i>Good.</i>
- [Huttese]

28
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,030
Send them in.

29
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,616
<i>We will discuss</i>
<i>this matter later.</i>

30
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,083
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform--

31
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,210
terrible.

32
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,964
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

33
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,800
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

34
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,513
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

35
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,474
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

36
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,478
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

37
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,690
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

38
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,152
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

39
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,821
<i>But for certain,</i>
<i>Senator...</i>

40
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,783
in grave danger you are.

41
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,829
Master Jedi,
may I suggest...

42
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,831
the senator
be placed...

43
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,042
under the protection
of your graces.

44
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,420
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,422
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--

46
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,342
The situation
is that serious?

47
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,427
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,889
<i>I realize all too well</i>
<i>that additional security...</i>

49
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,225
<i>might be</i>
<i>disruptive for you...</i>

50
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,479
<i>but perhaps someone</i>
<i>you're familiar with.</i>

51
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,399
An old friend,
like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,777
<i>That's possible.</i>

53
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,655
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,950
Do it for me, milady.
Please?

55
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,452
<i>The thought</i>
<i>of losing you...</i>

56
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,248
is unbearable.

57
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,167
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,587
<i>[Senator Amidala]</i>
<i>Thank you, Master Windu.</i>

59
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,516
You seem
a little on edge.

60
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,601
- Not at all.
- I haven't felt you this tense...

61
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,937
since we fell into
that nest of gundarks.

62
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,065
[Scoffs] You fell into
that nightmare, Master...

63
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,985
and I rescued you,
remember?

64
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,113
Oh... yes.

65
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,282
[Laughing]

66
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,450
[Chuckles]

67
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:34,580
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

68
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,791
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

69
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,225
Obi? Obi!

70
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,644
Mesa so smilen
to seein yousa!

71
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,064
- Good to see you again, JarJar.
- <i>Senator Padmé.</i>

72
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,776
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

73
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,862
<i>Des a Jedi arriven.</i>

74
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,203
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

75
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,788
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

76
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,293
Ani? My goodness,
you've grown.

77
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,506
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

78
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,300
Well, f-for a senator,
I mean.

79
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,805
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

80
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,852
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

81
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,396
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

82
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,607
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

83
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,817
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

84
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,695
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

85
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,490
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

86
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,825
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

87
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,746
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

88
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,249
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

89
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,460
- I promise you.
- We will not exceed our mandate...

90
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,462
my young Padawan learner.

91
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,090
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master.

92
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,717
<i>We will not go through</i>
<i>this exercise again, Anakin...</i>

93
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,637
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?

94
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,723
What?

95
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:20,561
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

96
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,939
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

97
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,900
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

98
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,279
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

99
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,784
And you will learn
your place, young one.

100
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,290
Perhaps with
merely your presence...

101
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,334
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

102
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,212
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

103
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,256
I will retire.

104
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,593
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

105
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:56,680
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor, and I'll be in
the control center downstairs.

106
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,602
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,855
<i>She hardly even</i>
<i>recognized me, JarJar.</i>

108
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,401
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

109
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,738
she's forgotten me completely.

110
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,992
Shesa happy. Happier den
mesa seein her in a longo time.

111
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:21,121
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,665
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,751
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,845
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:39,515
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,351
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

117
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,311
Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,523
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,113
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.
No assassin would try that way.

120
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,742
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

121
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,788
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

122
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,873
- [Beeping]
- What's going on?

123
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,376
Ah, she covered
the cameras.

124
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,545
I don't think
she liked me watching her.

125
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,547
What is she thinking?

126
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,675
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.

127
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,386
<i>[Obi-Wan] There are many</i>
<i>other ways to kill a senator.</i>

128
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:21,849
<i>[Anakin] I know, but we also want to</i>
<i>catch this assassin, don't we, Master?</i>

129
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,061
You're using her as bait.

130
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,272
It was her idea.

131
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,899
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,986
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

133
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,363
Trust me.

134
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,740
It's too risky.

135
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:42,369
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

136
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,496
And yours are?

137
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,584
Possibly.

138
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,517
You look tired.

139
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,603
I don't sleep well anymore.

140
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,230
Because of your mother?

141
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,197
I don't know why
I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,868
Dreams pass in time.

143
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,997
I'd much rather dream
about Padmé.

144
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,293
Just being around her again
is... intoxicating.

145
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,087
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

146
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:38,509
You've made
a commitment to the Jedi order,
a commitment not easily broken.

147
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,386
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.

148
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,056
<i>[Anakin] She's not like the others</i>
<i>in the senate, Master.</i>

149
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,099
<i>[Obi-Wan] It is my experience</i>
<i>that senators...</i>

150
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,937
<i>focus only on pleasing those</i>
<i>who fund their campaigns...</i>

151
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:53,607
<i>and they're in no means scared of</i>
<i>forgetting the niceties of democracy...</i>

152
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,901
- <i>in order to get those funds.</i>
- <i>Not another lecture.</i>

153
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,820
<i>At least not on</i>

307
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,975
Don't try to grow up too fast.

308
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,019
But I am grown up.

309
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,190
You said it yourself.

310
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,401
Please don't look
at me like that.

311
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:41,114
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.

312
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,077
Sorry, milady.

313
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,345
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

314
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:06,306
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

315
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,392
He'll be safe with me.

316
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:16,358
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.

317
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:20,195
I worry about you. What if they
realize you've left the capital?

318
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:24,658
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

319
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,660
Anakin.

320
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,872
Don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

321
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,958
Yes, Master.

322
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,586
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

323
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,629
You'll be back here
in no time.

324
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,966
I'll be most grateful for
your speed, Master Jedi.

325
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,968
- It's time to go.
- I know.

326
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,596
Anakin, may the Force
be with you.

327
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,764
May the Force
be with you, Master.

328
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,153
Suddenly I'm afraid.

329
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,823
This is my first assignment
on my own. I am too.

330
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,827
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

331
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,913
- [Laughing]
- [Beeping]

332
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,920
I do hope he doesn't
try anything foolish.

333
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,465
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.

334
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:44,363
Someone to see ya, honey!

335
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,366
<i>Jedi, by the looks of him.</i>

336
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:52,412
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.

337
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,123
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

338
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:00,504
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

339
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,553
<i>Hey, old buddy!</i>

340
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,806
[Both Laughing]

341
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,603
Ohhh.
[Coughs]

342
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:20,065
So, my friend,
what can I do for ya?

343
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,985
You can tell me
what this is.

344
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,363
Well, whattaya know!

345
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,824
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

346
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:32,160
<i>on Subterrel,</i>
<i>beyond the outer rim.</i>

347
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:34,746
[Obi-Wan] Can you tell me
where it came from? Thank you.

348
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,791
[Dex] This baby
belongs to them cloners.

349
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:42,212
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

350
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:45,299
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

351
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:48,719
It's these funny little cuts
on the side that give it away.

352
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:52,764
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols. Huh!

353
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:55,100
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

354
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,394
for the difference
between knowledge and...

355
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,355
[Laughing]
wisdom.

356
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,817
Well, if droids could think,
there'd be none of us here, would there?

357
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,571
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

358
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,656
No, no. It's beyond
the outer rim.

359
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:13,368
I'd say about,
uh, 12 parsecs...

360
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,370
outside the Rishi Maze.

361
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:18,415
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

362
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,876
[Chuckles]

363
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:25,756
These, uh, Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

364
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,717
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

365
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:33,305
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Oh, depends.

366
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,307
Depends on what, Dex?

367
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,310
On how good
your manners are...

368
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,646
and how big your, uh...

369
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,732
pocketbook is.

370
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,151
[Chuckling]

371
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,112
Hmm.

372
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,618
Did you call
for assistance?

373
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:58,372
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Are you having
a problem, Master Kenobi?

374
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,792
Yes, um, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.

375
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,169
- Kamino.
- It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

376
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:08,549
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

377
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:11,009
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

378
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,137
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

379
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,306
just south
of the Rishi Maze.

380
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,853
[Beeping]

381
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,567
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

382
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:28,569
doesn't exist.

383
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:31,947
Impossible. Perhaps the archives
are incomplete.

384
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,117
If an item does not appear
in our records...

385
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,327
it does not exist.

386
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,602
- Hey, you! No droids!
- [Beeping]

387
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,897
- Get outta here!
- [Raspberries]

388
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,403
- [Beeping]
- Thank you, R2.

389
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:16,033
- [Chirping]
- Must be difficult, having
sworn your life to the Jedi...

390
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:20,037
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

391
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,247
Or be with the people
that I love.

392
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:25,000
Are you allowed to love?

393
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,169
I thought that was
forbidden for a Jedi.

394
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,008
Attachment is forbidden.

395
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,720
Possession is forbidden.

396
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:40,390
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

397
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,935
is central
to a Jedi's life.

398
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:49,775
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

399
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,488
- You've changed so much.
- Ah, you haven't changed a bit.

400
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:57,449
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

401
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:13,841
<i>[Yoda] Reach out.</i>
<i>Sense the Force around you.</i>

402
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,635
Use your feelings
you must.

403
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:24,059
Younglings.
Younglings!

404
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,603
A visitor
we have.

405
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,606
[Together]
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

406
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,776
Hello. I'm sorry
to disturb you, Master.

407
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,572
What help can I be,
Obi-Wan? Hmm?

408
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:39,575
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

409
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:42,828
I trust him, but the systems
don't show on the archive maps.

410
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:47,249
Mmm. Lost a planet
Master Obi-Wan has.

411
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,251
- How embarrassing.
- <i>[Children Giggling]</i>

412
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,962
How embarrassing.

413
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,798
Hmm?
Liam, the shades.

414
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:58,635
Gather round
the map reader.

415
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,888
<i>Clear your minds...</i>

416
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:04,474
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

417
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,812
It ought to be... here...

418
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:10,856
but it isn't.

419
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:14,359
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

420
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:18,071
Hmm. Gravity's
silhouette remains...

421
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:21,158
but the star
and all the planets...

422
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,243
disappeared they have.

423
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:25,370
How can this be?

424
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,664
Hmm? A thought?

425
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:33,003
- <i>[Yoda] Anyone.</i>
- <i>[Boy] Master?</i>

426
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:36,006
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

427
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,218
<i>[Yoda Chuckles]</i>

428
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:43,472
Truly wonderful
the mind of a child is.

429
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,058
[Chuckling]

430
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,352
The Padawan is right.

431
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:51,522
<i>Go to the center</i>
<i>of gravity's pull...</i>

432
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:55,108
and find your planet
you will.

433
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:03,825
Hmm. The data
must have been erased.

434
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:06,703
But, Master Yoda, who could
empty information from the archives?

435
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,705
That's impossible, isn't it?

436
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:12,209
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

437
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:16,672
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

438
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:20,217
But who and why,
harder to answer.

439
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:24,847
Meditate on this I will. Hmm.

440
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,290
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

441
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:55,002
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

442
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,087
I'm not sure
I was ready.

443
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:00,382
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

444
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:04,136
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution
so you could stay in office.

445
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,930
I was relieved when
my two terms were up.

446
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:10,726
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

447
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,020
I couldn't refuse her.

448
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:16,481
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

449
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,736
I'm glad that you
chose to serve.

450
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,661
[Padmé] If the senate
votes to create an army...

451
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:33,248
- I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.
- [Man] It's unthinkable.

452
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:36,752
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

453
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:39,338
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

454
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,548
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

455
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,842
Not if they feel threatened.

456
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:47,346
My guess is they'll turn
to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

457
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:51,808
<i>It's outrageous, but after four trials</i>
<i>in the Supreme Court...</i>

458
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:55,687
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

459
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:59,816
<i>I fear the senate is powerless</i>
<i>to resolve this crisis.</i>

460
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:04,112
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

461
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,040
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

462
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,835
Let's pray that day
never comes.

463
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,629
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

464
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,715
What is your suggestion,
Master Jedi?

465
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,717
Oh, Anakin's
not a Jedi yet.

466
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,845
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking--

467
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,514
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.

468
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,058
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

469
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:35,394
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

470
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,564
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

471
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:42,317
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

472
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:46,905
<i>I think it would be wise</i>
<i>if you took advantage of</i>
<i>my knowledge in this instance.</i>

473
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,200
Sorry, milady.

474
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:55,539
[Queen Jamillia]
Perfect. It's settled, then.

475
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:14,183
There it is, R4, right where it
should be. Our missing planet Kamino.

476
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,101
[Whistling, Beeping]

477
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:47,466
<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

478
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:55,224
Master Jedi.

479
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:57,684
The prime minister
is expecting you.

480
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:01,313
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

481
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,483
He is anxious
to meet you.

482

<i>After all these years...</i>

483
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,489
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

484
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,783
Now, please, this way.

485
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:28,090
May I present Lama Su...

486
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,259
prime minister of Kamino.

487
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,179
And this is Master Jedi--

488
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,181
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

489
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:39,601
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

490
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:43,021
Please.

491
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,859
And now to business.

492
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:50,904
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

493
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,907
<i>200,000 units</i>
<i>are ready...</i>

494
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,368
with a million more
well on the way.

495
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:59,454
That's good news.

496
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:02,708
Please tell
your Master Sifo-Dyas...

497
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:06,170
that his order
will be met on time.

498
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:08,255
I'm sorry. Master--

499
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,218
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of the Jedi Council...

500
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,220
is he not?

501
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:19,141
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

502
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:23,103
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

503
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:27,482
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

504
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,236
- The army?
- Yes.

505
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:36,033
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.

506
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,118
Tell me, Prime Minister...

507
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,704
when my master
first contacted you about the army...

508
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,956
did-- did he say
who it was for?

509
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,083
Of course he did.

510
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,878
This army
is for the Republic.

511
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:52,341
<i>But you must be anxious</i>
<i>to inspect the units for yourself.</i>

512
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:55,969
That's why I'm here.

513
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,909
We used to come here
for school retreat.

514
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,788
We would swim
to that island every day.

515
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,083
I love the water.

516
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,842
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

517
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,928
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

518
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:43,475
I don't like sand.

519
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,563
It's coarse and rough
and irritating...

520
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:49,648
and it gets everywhere.

521
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:54,444
Not like here.

522
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,488
Here, everything is soft...

523
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:00,784
and smooth.

524
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,656
No.
[Gasps]

525
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,783
I shouldn't have done that.

526
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:45,495
I'm sorry.

527
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:02,971
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.

528

534
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:32,584
<i>Otherwise, a mature clone</i>
<i>would take a lifetime to grow.</i>

535

<i>Now we can do it</i>
<i>in half the time.</i>

536
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,048
<i>[Obi-Wan]</i>
<i>I see.</i>

537

<i>[Lama Su]</i>
<i>They are totally obedient...</i>

<i>taking any order</i>
<i>without question.</i>

539
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,055
<i>We modified</i>
<i>their genetic structure...</i>

540
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:48,350
<i>to make them less independent</i>
<i>than the original host.</i>

541
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:51,019
And who was
the original host?

542
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:53,230
A bounty hunter
called Jango Fett.

543
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,900
And where is
this bounty hunter now?

544
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:59,152
Oh, we keep him here.

545
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:04,658
<i>[Lama Su] Apart from his pay,</i>
<i>which is considerable...</i>

546
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:07,244
Fett demanded
only one thing:

547
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:09,955
an unaltered clone
for himself.

548
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,499
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

549
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,127
[Lama Su]
Pure genetic replication.

550
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:18,422
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

551
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:21,049
<i>and no growth acceleration.</i>

552
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:24,469
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

553
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:27,764
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

554
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:48,202
Magnificent, aren't they?

555
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:57,294
- I don't know.
- [Chuckles]

556
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:59,546
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

557
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:02,007
You gonna use one of
your Jedi mind tricks on me?

558
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:04,218
They only work
on the weak-minded.

559
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:08,805
All right.
I was 12.

560
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:12,184
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

561
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:15,312
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

562
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,814
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

563
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:20,150
All right, I get the picture.

564
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:22,194
Whatever happened to him?

565
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:25,239
I went into public service;
he went on to become an artist.

566
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:29,535
- Maybe he was the smart one.
- You really don't like politicians,
do you?

567
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,828
I like two or three...

568
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:33,997
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

569

[Both Chuckle]

570
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,295
I don't think
the system works.

571
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:43,298
How would you
have it work?

572
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:47,845
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

573
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:52,015
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.

574
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,059
That's exactly
what we do.

575
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:56,144
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

576
00:48:56,228 --> 00:48:58,146
Well, then they
should be made to.

577
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,150
- By whom? Who's gonna make them? You?
- I don't know. Someone.

578
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:04,570
- Of course not me.
- But someone.

579
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,572
Someone wise.

580
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:10,492
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.

581
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:14,204
Well, if it works.

582
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,130
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

583
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:25,799

to tease a senator.

<i>who hired you for this job?</i>

614

Never heard of him.

00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,546
Really?

616
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,800
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

617
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:16,094
Curious.

618
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:22,309
Do you like your army?

619
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:24,394
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

620
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:29,024
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

621
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:31,276
Thank you for
your time, Jango.

622
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,155
Always a pleasure
to meet a Jedi.

aggressive negotiations. Thank you.

627

"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

628
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:14,778
Uh, well, negotiations
with a lightsaber.

If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

631
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:02,826
From the moment
I met you...

632
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,496
all those years ago...

633
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,583
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

I'm with you again...

the worse it gets.

The thought of
not being with you--

638
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,436
I can't breathe.

639
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:39,279
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.

640
00:54:39,404 --> 00:54:41,698
My heart is beating...

641
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:44,743
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

642
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:49,831
You are in my very soul...

643
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:52,000
tormenting me.

644
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:57,965
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

645
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:12,521
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

646
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,275
I can't.

647
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:20,445
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

648

Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

No, you listen.

We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm-- I'm a senator.

<i>If you follow your thoughts</i>
<i>through to conclusion...</i>

653
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,674
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

654
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:44,178
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

655

I will not let you
give up your future for me.

657

You are asking me
to be rational.

658
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:55,105
That is something
I know I cannot do.

659
00:55:55,189 --> 00:56:00,110
Believe me, I wish that I could
just wish away my feelings...

660
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:02,821
but I can't.

661
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:05,657
I will not give in to this.

662
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:15,000
Well, you know, it...

663
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,920
wouldn't have to
be that way.

664
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:20,881
We could keep it a secret.

665
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,301
We'd be living a lie...

666
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:26,720
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

667
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:30,098
I couldn't do that.

668
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:33,101
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

No. You're right.

Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

672
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:56,416
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

673
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:59,670
it will take more time
to grow them.

[Beeping]

678
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,205
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

679
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:39,209
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

680
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,795
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

681
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,006
is the assassin
we are looking for.

682
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:48,260
Do you think these cloners
are involved in the plot
to assassinate Senator Amidala?

683
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:51,263
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

the real villains behind this plot.

687
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,650
Yes, Master.

688
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,778
They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army...

689
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:10,490
<i>at the request of the senate</i>
<i>almost ten years ago.</i>

690
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:16,205
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

691
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:19,833
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

692
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:24,213
No. Whoever placed that order
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

693
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:27,925
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

694
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:32,179
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

695

Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

[Sighs]

698
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,317
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

699
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:48,403
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

700

Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.
