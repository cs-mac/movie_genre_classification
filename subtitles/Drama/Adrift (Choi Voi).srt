1
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:30,299
Catch him! Stop!

2
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:36,177
Over there!  That way!

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,880
Catch him!  Stop!

4
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:44,189
Father

5
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,631
Wake up, Nam-yi!

6
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,025
Are you afraid?

7
00:01:58,957 --> 00:01:59,957
I'm asking,
are you afraid?!

8
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:01,645
Yes, father

9
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:04,757
That fearful heart,
look squarely in the eye of it

10
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:07,021
that's how you come out of it

11
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:08,929
Father!

12
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:19,980
Don't forget,
it's Kim Mu-seon in Gyeseong

13
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,487
Got it?

14
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:24,643
...I want to stay
with you, father...

15
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:38,043
You're now Ja-in's father
You must take care of your sister 'til you die

16
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:39,962
Do you understand?!

17
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,302
- Yes
- Get up

18
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:07,607
Father!

19
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,425
Get out of here, Nam-yi!

20
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,108
Capture the traitor!

21
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:16,163
Father! Father!

22
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:42,747
Father!

23
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,374
I have to
go back to father!

24
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,686
Didn't you hear father?

25
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:58,714
Father is still fighting!

26
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,992
I have to take the bow to him,
so he can win!

27
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:05,603
Stupid! Father told us to take it
Do you even know what that implies?

28
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,229
I'm gonna go!

29
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:17,457
Brother, let's go back
Let's give him the bow, please

30
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,905
We've captured the traitor!
Now, find his children!

31
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,813
Hwal ("bow")

32
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,859
Did you witness
your father's end?

33
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:35,637
Are you Ja-in?

34
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,591
So, did your father leave
any last words?

35
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,494
People ignorant of foreign affairs
support the King...

36
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,469
...so there will surely be a war.

37
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,014
The country and
the safety of people are...

38
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:59,075
...like a lamp before a storm
Aye, what can be done?

39
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:02,428
I entrust the bow to you
until the child grows up

40
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:13,421
"Push like pushing a mountain...

41
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,054
...and pull like holding a tiger's tail"

42
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:37,885
Gap-yong, please ask my wife
to get them new dresses first

43
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:39,554
Yes, sir

44
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,178
Go ahead and change

45
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,451
Don't be going outside
without caution

46
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,079
If someone asks you
who you are...

47
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,936
...don't answer until an elder
of this house answers first

48
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,809
You got that?

49
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,491
Father.. father..

50
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:35,693
father..

51
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:48,034
"You're now Ja-in's father
You must take care of your sister 'til you die"

52
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,785
Do you understand?

53
00:09:58,668 --> 00:10:00,763
[13 years later]

54
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:08,629
.. This way! This way!

55
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:18,621
.. That way! That way!

56
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:25,942
Ugh.. darn it!

57
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,966
It's hit!  It's hit!

58
00:10:58,973 --> 00:10:59,973
It's dead!

59
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:04,217
Wa.. wa.. wait!

60
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,363
Why?

61
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:06,243
What is this place?

62
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,244
This is just..

63
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:16,909
Isn't this tiger trap?

64
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,442
Let's hurry and carry it out

65
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:29,984
Wa.. wait..

66
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:35,826
Th.. that is..

67
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,527
I heard it

68
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,855
It.. tiger! Tiger! Tiger!

69
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:52,215
Tiger! Tiger!

70
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,719
? Tiger, tiger,
? my tiger at Mt. Dongak

71
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:08,321
? I'll give you a rice cake
? So fetch me a bride

72
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:15,219
There's this place in Gyeseong
where all beautiful girls are

73
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,642
I went there and
they were all just looked homely

74
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,491
Really?

75
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:23,468
So the most beautiful girl
in Songak...

76
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:26,479
..is our lady Miss Ja-in

77
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,930
If only things
had gone better for her...

78
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:31,995
...distinguished guys would be
standing in a line mile long for her

79
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:35,578
Now 'nuff with banter
and have some drink

80
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:42,473
Speaking of which, I think
Madam is so harsh...

81
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:46,724
...seriously, isn't Miss Ja-in
out of Master Seo-gun's league?

82
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,604
Can any imperfection
be found with Miss Ja-in?

83
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:51,880
And what about her womanly figure?

84
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,161
She beats an angel
from heaven any day

85
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:59,827
What has Young Master done?
Did he pass the civil service exam?

86
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:01,035
You're right

87
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,606
I said that's enough!

88
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:11,531
Brother,
did I say something wrong?

89
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:15,036
C'mon, enough already,
you know the whole story

90
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:19,298
It's because I know the story
and it suffocates me!

91
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,911
I told you to stop already!

92
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:24,256
/Idiot!/

93
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,372
Hey, jerk,
I even got on your side...

94
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:29,652
Hey! You just cuss'd
at me, didn't you?

95
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,297
You cuss'd at me, didn't you?!

96
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:34,343
You bastard,
you disrespect me...

97
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,080
...because you've played
around somewhat, eh?!

98
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,875
I'll rip your mouth wide today..

99
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,577
...and fix your bad habit for good!

100
00:13:58,868 --> 00:13:59,868
You jerk!

101
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,916
Kang-du, please stop!

102
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:17,947
I came to have some drink
but it's a big mess here

103
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,876
Master, glad to see you

104
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:25,108
Eh..

105
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,672
Does it help with digestion
if you drink like this?

106
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,939
What made you have
a fun fight like this?

107
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:39,344
What made you come out
at this time of night?

108
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:44,367
Come here
I'll pour you a drink

109
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:53,308
Brother, this is no way
to have a drink tastefully

110
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:57,863
How about if we move
to a real nice place?

111
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:03,277
A nerd like you
know of any place to drink?

112
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:06,723
Well..

113
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:08,942
...you'll find out
once you get there

114
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:41,082
Whoa, there's surely a lot
of rare beauties for a drinking bar

115
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:47,426
Yes, this place is
well known for drinks

116
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,327
The drink does
taste different here

117
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:05,491
- The sword..
- Wait!

118
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:11,534
- I'll pour one
- What's with this?

119
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,799
Nothing at all
I just want to serve one

120
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:17,398
Serve one?

121
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,376
Please, receive one

122
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:27,348
Now.. I'm treated properly
as an older brother finally!

123
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,545
So.. I have...

124
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,800
...something I'd like to tell you

125
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,207
Brother, I'd like to
marry Ja-in

126
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:47,644
What did you say?!

127
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:52,006
Please approve, Brother

128
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,104
You're her guardian, aren't you?

129
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,902
Does your mother know about this?

130
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:05,217
And your father?

131
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,747
I only need to persuade them,
and that's all

132
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,119
Brother...

133
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:13,926
...I'm really.. desperate

134
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:25,789
Brother

135
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,462
Please approve for me
downloadbox.net

136
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:29,659
You and I are...
downloadbox.net

137
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:33,394
...brothers..
closer than regular friends

138
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:35,042
Who says you and I are closer
than regular friends?

139
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,757
It's like that 'cuz I said so

140
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,937
Are you insane or something?

141
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,588
How can family members
living under the same roof..

142
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:45,844
.. no.. that isn't it..

143
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,286
.. you want to marry a traitor's
daughter who's in hiding?

144
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:54,636
Are you trying
to ruin your own life?

145
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,895
I know exactly
what you're worrying about

146
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:01,482
My parents..

147
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,973
.. I will persuade them over

148
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:08,007
Brother.. we lived together
in the same house all that time..

149
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:09,279
.. they surely wouldn't

150
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,253
They surely suffered from
a lot of anxieties

151
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,618
'cause they lived with traitor's children
in their bosoms

152
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:21,572
And you want to put that yoke
back on your parents for life?!

153
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:22,768
- Brother
- And ! ..

154
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,971
.. how do you think Ja-in would be
under such mother-in-law?

155
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,978
Whatever anyone else say
I will not be detered

156
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:30,979
And ..

157
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:35,142
.. I can do anything
and everything for Ja-in

158
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,903
You can do anything
and everything..

159
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,375
Sure

160
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:48,652
- I'll make an offer then
- ?

161
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:52,968
Brother!

162
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:54,256
- What offer ..
- Is anyone here?

163
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:00,689
If you cut me...

164
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,750
...I'll give you Ja-in

165
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:07,060
But if you can't
I will cut you...

166
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,639
...and I'll leave
this town with Ja-in today

167
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
You got that?

168
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:13,556
Brother!

169
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,033
What kind of offer ..

170
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,759
Brother!

171
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:29,160
Look at this weakling
How dare you covet my sister?!

172
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:34,472
I'm a son of a warrior too!
I'm being easy on you, Brother!!

173
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:40,246
I will never give my sister
to a dimwit nerd like you

174
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:44,955
I'd rather give her to
a butcher ..

175
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:47,875
A butcher would be
a lot better choice

176
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:12,871
This is enough

177
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,386
Sorry for my rudeness

178
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,801
Sit down!

179
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:52,334
Drinking, and even fighting!

180
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:54,958
Is life so easy for you?!

181
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:56,578
Yes, sir

182
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:02,000
My heart is at peace, and the world
seems laughable like a flea to me

183
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,618
It's been 13 years
since you came to this house

184
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:09,154
You abandoned desk study
and you stopped martial arts training...

185
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:12,592
...you wander outside all day
What are you going to do with your life?!

186
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:17,778
Can I take a civil service exam
by memorizing words? ...

187
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:21,453
Or can I plunder a country
by training in martial arts?

188
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:22,454
I'm nothing
but a traitor's child

189
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,283
I shall live through today

190
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:34,029
and I'll probably die tomorrow

191
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,142
How dare you?!?!

192
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:39,642
You really don't know
what an honest man your father was?!

193
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,542
- Yes I know
- And ?!

194
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:41,753
And ..

195
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:47,421
I did indeed see the final end
of such father! I sure did!

196
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,862
What good is a diligent life?
You stick yourself out to do...

197
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,134
..something great and you will
only get cut down by a sword

198
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:01,566
You're here like this
because you fear that too, isn't it?

199
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:02,567
Why you !@#$

200
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:12,180
If you have nothing more to say
then I'd like to go...

201
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:14,605
...and have one more cup
before I sober up

202
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:18,052
You know...

203
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:24,595
...I named Ja-in
when she was born

204
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,515
And Seo-gun was named
by your father

205
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:33,767
I approve of
his marriage to Ja-in

206
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:05,185
This way please

207
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:07,373
How have you been?

208
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:07,226
What are you doing here?

209
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:09,656
The guardian should be
sitting in his place

210
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:34,471
"Bow .. to .. groom .. first"

211
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:47,885
"Bow .. once .. in .. reply"

212
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:50,851
Master, it's your turn

213
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:52,328
What are you waiting for?

214
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,770
Are you all right?

215
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:10,067
How would you go through
the first night with such stupidity?

216
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:14,631
"Bow .. twice .. in .. reply"

217
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:17,263
.. be quiet will ya!

218
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:16,602
Get in position!

219
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,362
Close the gate! Close the gate!

220
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:22,096
Quickly, get ready!

221
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:41,457

223
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,450
Get out of here!  Run away!

224
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:38,487
Kang-du!

225
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:41,028
Kang-du!

Escort the Prince!

Ja-in!

228

No, you bastards!
She's my daughter!

229
00:33:49,724 --> 00:33:50,724
My dear wife!

230
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,550
Young Master!

231
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,912
Father ..

232
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,291
My child ..

233
00:35:53,607 --> 00:35:54,607
Father!

234
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,214
Where are they taking us?

235
00:38:13,372 --> 00:38:14,372
It's a war

236
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:16,172
Don't be sad

237
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,701
My cousin

238
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,393
Our Mangudai siege strategy...

239
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:25,955
...he broke through with a bow.

240
00:38:25,956 --> 00:38:29,808
I've never seen someone
shoot arrows like that in Joseon 'til now

241
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:33,506
It happened because
of our small number

242
00:38:34,114 --> 00:38:37,098
I thought it's only
a weak arrow from a weak bow..

243
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:40,671
Their bow comes
from the same root as ours

244
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:45,068
It's short and thin,
but great for distance and mobility

245
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:50,570
We must never underestimate

246
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:56,393
Jushinta! Wanhan!

247
00:38:56,844 --> 00:38:57,844
We now have more captives
than ourselves

248
00:38:58,476 --> 00:38:59,613
It's all because
of your works, uncles

249
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:04,100
Have a safe trip back, Prince.

250
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:05,880
They're ready for you now

251
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:19,172
Come back quickly
I have much to plan with you

252
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:25,123
For our Manchu!

253
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:28,093
For our Manchu!

254
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,893
General, we are ready to move

255
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:35,990
Keep Prince safe, Hu-man

256
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:37,562
Yes, General!

257
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:39,525
I entrust the envoys too

258
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:40,526
Yes, sir!

259
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,890
Ja-in!

260
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,968
Ja-in!

261
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:44,669
Ja-in!

262
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:57,748

Who will give the sacrificial rite
for my deceased father?

271
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:05,632
Father!

272
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:14,995
Please spare me!

273
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:21,046
There's a blue dragon
on the brown flag

274
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:22,732
Where is he now?

275
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:26,554
Please!

276
00:45:26,669 --> 00:45:28,534
I will decide
after I hear your answer

277
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:34,171
To north..
everyone's headed north..

278
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:37,126
I don't know
any thing more

279
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:12,879
He was killed immediately
after the arrow went through the neck

280
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:15,479
They all did

281
00:46:20,455 --> 00:46:21,455
We better hurry

282
00:46:22,188 --> 00:46:23,188
It looks like
enemy soldiers' work

283
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,930
Take this girl!

284
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:46,296
General, there is
something you have to see

285
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,489
It happened all too quickly

286
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:05,359
He would appear for a moment
and then disappear again

287
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:07,647
And an arrow came
at me once again

288
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:13,148
It was from a place
where he ought to have stood

289
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,947
He speaks our tongue

290
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,384
And he's pursuing
our King Flag?

291
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:25,872
He clearly asked me
about it

292
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:30,255
Did he use red arrows?

293

How did you know?

294

I don't know who this is...

295
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:40,810
...but he's clearly
pursuing the Royal guard unit

296
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,146
By the way..

297
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,796
...he said something strange

298

Why aren't you killing me?

299
00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:57,597
Killing is not
the purpose of my bow

300
00:49:01,026 --> 00:49:04,442
He said killing is
not the purpose of his bow..

301

run away just because he tells you to!

00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,559
- /Four!/

326
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,313
/This is the last count!/

327
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:37,417
What's going on?

328
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:38,337
Don't you move
It's useless

329
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:48,013
Wuri!

330
00:51:48,812 --> 00:51:49,812
Father!

331
00:51:50,018 --> 00:51:51,018
See you later!

332
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,626
Wuri, no! Don't!

333
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:01,423
/Joseon people!/

334
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,494
/You can go back home/

335
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:06,138
/However!/

336
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,865
/You can't go back alive!/

337
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,660
/Go!/

338
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:25,410
You see that?
He's just trying to tame us

339
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:47,061
Those damn savages!

340
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:04,479
Wuri!

341
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:11,988
I should step out

342
00:53:14,685 --> 00:53:16,849
If even only one can survive
and get out of here...

343
00:53:19,342 --> 00:53:21,406
...then people can keep
the hope alive, to run away alive

344
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:26,319
Master, you'll die
if you step out!

345
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:28,856
Come here
if you dare!

346
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:34,180
You have to overcome me first
before you cross here!

347
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:38,971
Anyone from our brothers...

348
00:54:38,972 --> 00:54:39,972
...is a true warrior?!

349
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:09,723
You bastard!

350
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:13,254
Come crawl towards me
like your own king!

351
00:56:13,255 --> 00:56:18,026
Else, I will pierce
through your heart!

352
00:57:03,247 --> 00:57:04,247
Kill him!

353
00:57:29,808 --> 00:57:31,305
You !@#$!

354
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:33,818
Why you..

355
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:37,322
Let's fight them together!

356
00:58:57,488 --> 00:58:58,488
Ja-in..

357
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,156
Don't be too harsh on me
for not being able to protect her...

358
00:59:25,205 --> 00:59:27,136
...didn't I give you my word before?

359
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:31,222
I said that I can do anything
and everything for Ja-in

360
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,414
Ja-in is probably
perservering well ..

361
00:59:38,204 --> 00:59:39,993
Anyway, do you think
it'd be all right?

362
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:44,205
Even though you have their map,
if you cross the river...

363
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,117
...and come back,
you become a traitor...

364
00:59:46,118 --> 00:59:47,550
...and you'll have
to answer to the king

365
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:54,363
King, who has forsaken the country
and his people, is already a great sinner

366
01:00:40,165 --> 01:00:41,861
Wash her and bring her to me

367
01:00:58,758 --> 01:01:01,313
You've brought
an interesting gal today

368
01:01:04,569 --> 01:01:05,761
Please forgive me

369
01:01:27,153 --> 01:01:28,314
Just take her clothes off

370
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:33,983
I am already married

371
01:01:35,378 --> 01:01:37,043
Please don't let me
live this way!

372
01:01:37,968 --> 01:01:38,832
Wait

373
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:47,855
When did you learn our tongue?

374
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,315
When I was a child, when my father
was based in northern territory

375
01:01:52,891 --> 01:01:56,155
Then you must have learned
of the greatness of our Great Qing

376
01:01:57,907 --> 01:02:00,438
Please, don't let me
live in shame

377
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:04,611
Even your king has submitted
and you think this is shameful?

378
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:10,715
How can a true warrior
keep persecuting the people...

379
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:14,012
...just because one achieves
a victory?

380
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:37,329
This is a tiger skin

381
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:40,928
My bravest uncle, Jushinta
has given it to me as a gift

382
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:44,200
It keeps me safe from
cold, hot, rain, and even fire

383
01:02:45,593 --> 01:02:48,528
Even this soft leather
was hard as a stone at first

384
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:56,154
The owner has to tame it well
to make it into a good leather

385
01:02:58,155 --> 01:03:00,627
Taming a leather
is very interesting

386
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:13,989
Tie her to a pole outside
until she cries for her life

387
01:03:54,256 --> 01:03:56,120
Only the strategy map that
has our movements has disappeared

388
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:23,711
We must hurry to pursue him

389
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:27,767
We'll leave the bodies of
our brothers to the oncoming unit

390
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:30,396
We shall obey

391
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,363
We have followed
the right path

392
01:04:59,846 --> 01:05:01,733
Those damned !@#$ savages!

393
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,193
Th.. that's Miss Ja-in..

394
01:05:23,001 --> 01:05:24,369
Wait until the nightfall

395
01:05:24,536 --> 01:05:27,216
What? Are we going to
have some special plan afterwards?

396
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,207
Even so, I don't think
charging like a bull is a good idea, sir

397
01:05:31,856 --> 01:05:35,600
Just take a look, there is
just too many of them

398
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:38,822
We'll capture the captain
and exchange him with Ja-in

399
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,526
There's no other way

400
01:05:40,582 --> 01:05:41,670
You think that's going to work?

401
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,174
Then.. how are we
going to get out?

402
01:05:46,867 --> 01:05:50,771
After we get Ja-in, we'll cross Aprok
and then meet at this hut

403
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:52,877
By tomorrow noon, got it?

404
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:55,021
Yes, Brother

405
01:05:54,655 --> 01:05:58,846
Nam-yi, but how are we capturing the captain?
We don't have any plan yet!

406
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:03,346
Kang-du, I have something
you two need to do

407
01:06:13,545 --> 01:06:17,256
No fun at all

408
01:06:17,257 --> 01:06:20,023
Men don't have spirit,
and women don't have constancy

409
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,359
I'm curious
What made you break down so easily?

410
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:33,128
Thirst?
Hunger?

411
01:06:33,344 --> 01:06:34,344
Or despair?

412
01:06:36,769 --> 01:06:42,769
Ka-in, my father said it's best
to rule man or beast with food

413
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:44,612
Seeing you, I think
those words weren't wrong

414
01:06:46,479 --> 01:06:49,079
My father said hunger
makes your vision blurry

415
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:52,979
So he said to eat well
before the fight

416
01:06:54,453 --> 01:06:56,052
Are you a soldier or something?

417
01:06:58,944 --> 01:07:00,792
I am a daughter
of a warrior

418
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,809
I don't live just to live
or die just to die!

419
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:19,608
You impudent !@#$!
This is fun, yes, fun indeed!

420
01:07:35,549 --> 01:07:38,301
Try it again!
C'mon, don't give up now

421
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:44,983
Who are they?!

422
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,675
Catch them!
Prisoners are escaping!

423
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,269
Prince, outside ..

424
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:55,291
Don't interfere,
you'll be executed if you disobey!

425
01:07:57,486 --> 01:07:58,510
Get out!

426
01:07:59,598 --> 01:08:01,606
That way!
Catch them!

427
01:08:04,753 --> 01:08:06,777
This way!
Come this way!

428
01:08:07,211 --> 01:08:08,787
That way!
That way!

429
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:15,575
You! Who are you?!

430
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:18,423
For our Manchu!!

431
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,967
Now I see

432
01:08:30,396 --> 01:08:33,412
How foolish and stubborn
Joseon girl is

433
01:08:44,419 --> 01:08:46,667
All you have to depend on
is a skewer

434
01:08:58,534 --> 01:08:59,814
Our plan worked!

435
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:03,357
All we have to do now
is just run away!

436
01:09:03,781 --> 01:09:05,341
Sorry, but you two
need to help me here

437
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,282
Master.. Master..
Master!

438
01:09:10,721 --> 01:09:12,329
It's them!
Catch them!

439
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,822
What are you?

440
01:09:38,228 --> 01:09:39,692
Are you all right?

441
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,159
Dear brother ..

442
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:46,105
I'm sorry ...
for getting here late

443
01:09:59,197 --> 01:10:00,373
Let the Prince go!

444
01:10:01,299 --> 01:10:02,883
Else this girl will die!

445
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,293
Dear wife!

446
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:20,084
Who the heck are you people?!

447
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:28,509
Wh.. what are you doing?!

448
01:10:49,465 --> 01:10:50,546
Make a way!

449
01:10:52,031 --> 01:10:53,591
Just shoot!

450
01:10:57,636 --> 01:10:59,220
- Get out of here
- What about you brother?

451
01:11:01,152 --> 01:11:05,432
You remember what I said?
We'll meet at noon tomorrow!

452
01:11:05,163 --> 01:11:06,411
We'll wait for you there, Brother!

453
01:11:07,323 --> 01:11:09,811
No, Brother!
We have to leave together!

454
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:11,783
You want all of us to die!
Get going now!

455
01:11:15,182 --> 01:11:18,265
If we don't leave together
then we will die together 'stead

456
01:11:18,747 --> 01:11:20,899
You want me to part
like this again ..

457
01:11:27,054 --> 01:11:30,605
Let's go, dear wife, we can't
possibly leave together right now

458
01:11:30,783 --> 01:11:33,486
Go and wait, I will live
through this and be there!

459
01:11:49,697 --> 01:11:53,233
You think you can live
after doing something like this?

460
01:11:55,252 --> 01:11:58,620
If I had thought of living through this
I wouldn't have done this

461
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:22,932
You say you came expecting death,
and yet are you afraid now?

462
01:12:23,861 --> 01:12:28,797
The wood has turned into ash,
and the fire is dying out

463
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:40,600
Thank you,
for enduring this far

464
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:48,885
Where is the Prince?

465
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:59,321
He was murdered

466
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:23,644
General, he's over that way!!
Soldiers are pursuing him!

467
01:14:58,176 --> 01:14:59,808
Nam-yi!

468
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:01,741
Glad to see you again!

469
01:15:06,117 --> 01:15:06,980
So you're still alive!

470
01:15:07,772 --> 01:15:10,435
What happened to Miss Ja-in,
and Master Seo-gun?

471
01:15:10,718 --> 01:15:12,309
They should be ahead of us now

472
01:15:12,703 --> 01:15:14,462
That's a good news indeed!

473
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:17,235
But we must hurry to follow them

474
01:15:17,236 --> 01:15:19,811
They're probably pursuing them too

475
01:15:35,601 --> 01:15:37,513
Wh.. what are those blokes?

476
01:15:37,754 --> 01:15:40,641
There is a white one
and red ones too

477
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:47,518
Half-pounders

478
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:49,481
What? Half-pounders?

479
01:15:49,551 --> 01:15:51,031
Only the arrows weigh a half-pound

480
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,666
They are more powerful than
even mechnical crossbows

481
01:15:55,058 --> 01:15:56,161
Let's go back into the woods

482
01:16:11,183 --> 01:16:12,647
Execute the Mangudai strategy!

483
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:05,783
We shouldn't go that way
Let's go this way!

484
01:17:05,934 --> 01:17:07,133
We have to go around this way!

485
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:08,667
C'mon, let's go!

486
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:12,870
I think Kang-du is right!
Let's go!

487
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,347
It's a dead end,
so I think we got 'em

488
01:17:20,866 --> 01:17:23,626
Catch 'em live
They have to die in pain

489
01:17:34,861 --> 01:17:35,795
Hurry, hurry

490
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:39,481
Kang-du!

491
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:52,470
Be careful!

492
01:17:56,389 --> 01:17:58,301
We must hurry!

493
01:18:01,783 --> 01:18:03,742
Kang-du!
.. Kang-du!

494
01:18:06,218 --> 01:18:08,729
It's already a miracle
that we made this far

495
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,074
So just leave me here now

496
01:18:16,774 --> 01:18:18,390
Hurry now

497
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:20,606
Go now!

498
01:18:23,062 --> 01:18:24,158
Leave now!

499
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:42,678
- Cut with your sword!
- I can't move my limbs!

500
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:50,071
Get moving!

501
01:19:00,895 --> 01:19:03,607
It's a tiger trap .. you fools

502
01:19:06,499 --> 01:19:08,404
It's the same way here

503
01:19:48,228 --> 01:19:50,891
I am old,
and I don't think I can go any further

504
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:53,574
Gap-yong ..

505
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,117
- Gap-yong ..
- Get going now!

506
01:20:00,935 --> 01:20:04,847
Keep Missy and Master safe!

507
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:48,749
All right, I shall depart
after I kill you

508
01:21:32,771 --> 01:21:34,091
Shoot!

509
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:48,352
It's him

510
01:21:48,353 --> 01:21:50,129
How surprising
it is to see him still alive ..

511
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:58,354
We cross over

512
01:23:17,064 --> 01:23:18,152
Hurry and cross over!

513
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,387
Adai, hurry!

514
01:24:19,168 --> 01:24:22,768
Let me go..
Go get him..

515
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:24,072
You can live..

516
01:25:12,543 --> 01:25:14,559
He's farther away
We speed up now

517
01:25:25,494 --> 01:25:26,470
I'll do it

518
01:25:26,427 --> 01:25:27,555
Let me

519
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:43,963
Your foot is all swollen

520
01:25:50,086 --> 01:25:55,302
But .. I heard that you get arrested
if you cross Aprok river again

521
01:25:57,066 --> 01:26:01,137
Surely the same Joseon people
wouldn't treat us that way

522
01:26:02,342 --> 01:26:04,054
It's just a nonsense to keep
people from running away

523
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:08,942
Dear husband ..
uh, that ..

524
01:26:11,982 --> 01:26:15,366
That shoe..
I'll hold onto it

525
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:27,459
And ..

526
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,743
.. I'll get us some drinking water

527
01:27:10,798 --> 01:27:12,022
Get back inside!

528
01:27:24,676 --> 01:27:25,708
Dear wife!

529
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,896
Dear wife ..

530
01:29:12,491 --> 01:29:13,795
Keep him cornered!

531
01:29:55,413 --> 01:29:56,493
Got him!

532
01:29:56,753 --> 01:29:57,768
Keep him cornered!

533
01:30:56,255 --> 01:30:57,519
He's going back

534
01:32:18,108 --> 01:32:19,380
I'll ask you one question

535
01:32:20,162 --> 01:32:22,363
At the cliff ..

536
01:32:22,925 --> 01:32:24,502
Why didn't you shoot me?

537
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:29,381
Was it ..

538
01:32:30,849 --> 01:32:32,505
.. out of contempt for me?!

539
01:32:35,054 --> 01:32:40,118
He must die in pain
Cut off his limbs

540
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:01,965
Dodge!

541
01:34:17,106 --> 01:34:18,241
Which direction?

542
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:22,915
I'm not sure
But there's only one path...

543
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:23,916
...so we can go after him

544
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:26,683
There is only one path?

545
01:34:27,605 --> 01:34:30,076
We're near Aprok river
We pursue him immediately

546
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:48,315
Back to your senses, Hurau!

547
01:34:51,209 --> 01:34:53,297
The mountain is haunted, General

548
01:34:57,952 --> 01:35:00,312
Is this all there is to
the spirit of Manchu?

549
01:35:00,932 --> 01:35:02,588
Hurau!

550
01:35:03,474 --> 01:35:04,738
You lead us!

551
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:46,578
One

552
01:36:54,462 --> 01:36:55,622
Two

553
01:37:10,009 --> 01:37:11,049
Three

554
01:38:29,571 --> 01:38:30,811
It's a baby arrow

555
01:38:32,062 --> 01:38:34,416
You mean that secret weapon
used to attack our brothers...

556
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:36,266
...at the Namhan fortress?

557
01:38:36,883 --> 01:38:39,411
But I've never seen one
that damaging

558
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:41,213
It's just missing a tip...

559
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,765
He merely broke one off to make it

560
01:38:45,453 --> 01:38:47,908
But a baby arrow is
only a baby arrow!

561
01:38:59,881 --> 01:39:01,921
Brother!

562
01:39:09,139 --> 01:39:10,113
Don't come near!

563
01:39:11,221 --> 01:39:12,516
Stop!!

564
01:42:46,295 --> 01:42:47,382
Ja-in..

565
01:44:04,048 --> 01:44:05,136
Dear wife!

566
01:44:09,294 --> 01:44:10,718
Brother!

567
01:46:36,368 --> 01:46:39,336
Finally.. is she the reason
why you've been so tenacious?

568
01:46:58,727 --> 01:47:00,042
Are you calculating for the wind?

569
01:47:03,586 --> 01:47:05,562
I already saw your bow
downloadbox.net

570
01:47:05,762 --> 01:47:08,048
But what good would
your consideration of wind do?!

571
01:47:39,507 --> 01:47:41,187
Were you afraid
because of your girl?!

572
01:47:43,472 --> 01:47:45,496
Even if you're good
with curving arrows...

573
01:47:47,038 --> 01:47:52,578
...your fear has killed you
and your girl

574
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:56,782
Now feel for yourself...

575
01:47:57,143 --> 01:48:00,951
...the death of a beloved

576
01:48:05,493 --> 01:48:07,109
Brother, don't!

577
01:48:07,883 --> 01:48:10,169
You'll die if you pull
that arrow out!

578
01:48:17,846 --> 01:48:19,110
You lost

579
01:48:22,038 --> 01:48:24,974
Brother .. no !!

580
01:48:40,454 --> 01:48:43,342
Are you going to
sacrifice this girl?!

581
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:05,267
Even the wind isn't helping you

582
01:49:43,855 --> 01:49:48,336
Fear is .. something you look
squarely in the eye to rid of

583
01:49:54,087 --> 01:50:00,127
Wind is.. not something you calculate
but overcome

584
01:50:06,419 --> 01:50:08,642
Why.. you..

585
01:50:34,107 --> 01:50:35,763
Brother!

586
01:50:48,108 --> 01:50:51,307
Here.. I have one too
downloadbox.net

587
01:50:52,507 --> 01:50:53,459
So you knew ..

588
01:50:54,626 --> 01:50:58,674
'course I knew ..
'cause they were too big

589
01:50:58,878 --> 01:51:03,023
How come you don't even know
your sister's shoe size?

590
01:51:03,559 --> 01:51:06,419
So they were too big.. too big..

591
01:51:07,907 --> 01:51:10,658
I thought
you're fully grown already

592
01:51:11,226 --> 01:51:12,731
You still have more to grow

593
01:51:16,681 --> 01:51:18,473
Ja-in

594
01:51:20,334 --> 01:51:21,822
Ja-in

595
01:51:23,048 --> 01:51:25,985
Let's go to our house
in Hanyang

596
01:51:27,137 --> 01:51:32,240
Let's go there and ..

597
01:51:32,708 --> 01:51:37,172
.. wear your flower shoes dandy and ..

598
01:52:27,894 --> 01:52:28,853
Look

599
01:52:38,243 --> 01:52:41,778
That's the land
we must return to

600
01:53:08,675 --> 01:53:11,067
[1637, there were no efforts to repatriate
after the invasion of Manchu]

601
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:20,900
[Only a small number of people
returned on their own efforts]
