Sometimes l see the people
going there on the water taxi.

And l'm like, "Where they going?"

01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,152
They seem so busy.

1053
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,446
Got stuff to do. Got money.

Box ain't gonna kill nobody.

Why does everybody want to go to heaven,
but nobody wants to die?

1098

Very good question.

1099

You got nothing to believe in.

and they did it.

1151

walking the straight and narrow,

picking cotton, shining shoes
and selling newspapers.

1153

And nobody wore their pants low
and their dresses high.

And there weren't no sissies around

'cause the world has changed
and passed you by.

But God hasn't.

1166
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,705
We prayed for a black president
to deliver us,

1167
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,581
and we got our wish.

1168
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:47,252
l see our young people
same as they was before,

1169
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:50,672
only now they can say,
"l, too, can be president."

1170
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,049
No.

1171
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,927
l'm done with that dream.

1172
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,556
Not much has changed,

Wake up. Your grandson needs you.

l'm giving him God. That's enough.

1180
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,580
l prayed for my Angel till my knees wore out.

1181
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:26,291
Took her to Lil' Heaven every Sunday.

1182
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,626
But the Hook got her and she died.

1183
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,629
So this time,
l ain't just praying for my Chazz.

1184
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:34,132

her teachers, her friends,

1185
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,051
her Facebook, her Twitter.

01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,220
Ain't nothing gonna slip past me.

1187
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,556
l ain't pawning off
my responsibility as a parent

1188
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,433
and saying, "She's in God's hands."

1189
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,518
She's in my two loving hands.

1190
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:48,938
And with God's help,
l will raise this one right.

1191
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:52,692
By being honest,
and telling her when l ain't sure.

1192
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,652
And listening.

1193
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:56,654
l ain't preaching, l'm teaching.

1194
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:59,324
l'm thinking that's the only way,

1195
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,284
the only way,

1196
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,370
she's gonna be safe and sound.

1197
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,915
And you, Enoch,

1198
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,751
you ought to do the same.

1199
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,669
Because Flik needs a man.

1200
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,214
Not a Bishop, not a Bible, but a man.

1201
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:17,342
And when the good man teaches,
the Bible will preach itself.

1202
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,101
The Bible worked for my father.

1203
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,977
The world is changed.

1204
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,232

about your late father many times.
