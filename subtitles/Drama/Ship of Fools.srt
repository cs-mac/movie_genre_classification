1
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:26,573
My name is Karl Glocken, and
this is a ship of fools.

2
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:30,407
l'm a fool. And you'll meet
more fools as we go along.

3
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,407
This tub is packed with them.

4
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:36,408
Emancipated ladies. Ball players.

5
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,966
Lovers. Dog lovers.

6
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:43,251
Ladies of joy. Tolerant Jews.

7
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,649
Dwarfs. All kinds.

8
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:50,166
And who knows, if you
look closely enough..

9
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:53,248
..you may even find
yourself on board.

10
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:58,489
Good morning, doctor.

11
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:00,575
Good morning.

12
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:28,768
l'm glad to get out of Veracruz.

13
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:31,416
The whole damn country
is ready to explode.

14
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:35,646
Well, did you get a look at them?
Anything interesting?

15
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:37,814
Anything interesting at all?

16
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:40,965
There's a dwarf, that high.

17
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,566
A couple of young American painters.

18
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:48,808
And a Jewish salesman with an
infectious sense of humor.

19
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,648
Women, Willie. Women.

20
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:55,251
Well, a rather attractive
middle-aged American woman.

21
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,729
But l'm afraid she's too far
from the cradle for you.

22
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,967
Those are the kind that can sometime
appreciate what they are getting.

23
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:06,967
There's a Spanish dancing troupe,
interesting, but maybe professional.

24
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,365
They've had those Spanish dance
troupes on board before.

25
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:12,334
And the usual assortment
of our countrywomen.

26
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,169
Professors' wives? Saleswomen
putting on airs?

27
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,326
- l'm afraid so. - Governesses?

28
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,567
- Maybe you shouldn't.
- That's all right.

29
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,965
You're really getting off
at Bremerhaven, huh?

30
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:27,327
lt wasn't a very long career.
Three voyages.

31
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:28,885
Long enough.

32
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,970
l don't know what the hell l'm
going to do without you.

33
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,575
You'll manage.

34
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,647
You want to know the sentimental,
disgusting truth?

35
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:44,567
l've become fonder of you than
of most people in my life.

36
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:48,807
We just got used to each
other, that's all.

37
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:54,650
Who am l to play chess with?
Who am l to talk to?

38
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,574
You've seen the kind of characters
we get on this ship.

39
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,965
l get a cold shudder every time l
have to go to the captain's table.

40
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,251
l must be in my dotage.

41
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,565
After my..

42
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,727
l was looking for something.

43
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,808
l thought l could learn something
new by being a ship's doctor.

44
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:21,726
But l've seen all this before. l've
seen all these people before.

45
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:24,408
Never on a ship, that's all.

46
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,575
Come in.

47
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:29,330
- Lunch is served, captain.
- Thank you.

48
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:33,575
Please?

49
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,646
- What should l tell them this
time? - Tell them anything you like.

50
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,966
Tell them l had to fix the toilets.

51
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:03,568
1933 will be a good year.
l am optimistic.

52
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,489
At any rate, it is starting
out most auspiciously.

53
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:10,491
Ah it is good to be on a German
boat with German people, going home.

54
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:14,489
Say what you will, there is a feeling
when German people get together.

55
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:17,409
l cannot explain it. 'Gemutliche
Kameraderie..'

56
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,407
..which exists among
no other people.

57
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:21,327
At least l have found
it nowhere else.

58
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,815
You know what they say in Mexico?

59
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,888
Mexicans loathe the Americans,
hate the Spaniards..

60
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:29,571
..distrust the English, admire
the French and love the Germans.

61
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,170
That is all very nice. l am glad
that they say those things.

62
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:36,169
But as far as l am concerned,
after a few weeks in Mexico..

63
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,894
..you can keep the Mexicans too.

64
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:41,888
How long has it been since you
have been home, Herr Freytag?

65
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,649
- Four months. - You must be
glad to be going home too.

66
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:47,573
Yes, my wife is there.

67
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,736
Why is it that every charming
man l meet is married?

68
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,569
Fraulein Spockenkieker, you
have wounded to me the quick.

69
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,726
Excepting you, Herr Rieber.
l'm sorry.

70
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:01,170
That little dog is so sweet.

71
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:04,168
He has shared so much of the
professor's life and mine..

72
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,328
..l feel sometimes
he is like our son.

73
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:10,329
Do you think it's correct to
bring a dog to the table?

74
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,485
Bebe goes with us everywhere.

75
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,571
We have taken him to some
of the best restaurants.

76
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:23,327
Nobody seems to mind.

77
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,966
You know, it's gonna be
a wonderful trip, David.

78
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,736
l still feel funny about
you picking up the tab.

79
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:37,411
Look, we weren't gonna
talk about that.

80
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:44,328
Did l ever tell you these have been
the best three months of my life?

81
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,331
Did l ever tell you that l care for
you so much it's very upsetting?

82
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,327
What? What's the matter?

83
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:01,568
Twenty-six days in separate beds.

84
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,727
lt's probably a very good thing.

85
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,648
We'll get to know each other.

86
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:12,564
We'll find out whether we have
anything going for us besides sex.

87
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,327
l give you one more time
to hang yourself.

88
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,815
l know you got more
money from the Swede.

89
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,887
- l gave you what l got. - The
barman told me different.

90
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,170
He is a liar.

91
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,895
lf you're holding out on me, l
swear l'll rip your lying tongue out.

92
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,773
Rip my guts out. l don't
have any more money.

93
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:36,728
l asked for a table alone.

94
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:39,649
l'm sorry, madame, there is
no room for a table alone.

95
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,327
Please don't bother getting up.

96
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:53,884
You're an American?

97
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:57,965
- And my name's Bill Tenny.
- Mary Treadwell.

98
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,329
Yes, madam?

99
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:06,651
l'll have the pate and the
Rheinischer Sauerbraten.

100
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,167
- You, sir? - You got a steak?

101
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,325
- Yes, sir. - Thick?

102
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,735
We will do our best.

103
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,967
l'd better stick to
the simple stuff.

104
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,575
You know l was in Veracruz trying..

105
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:21,975
..to teach them greasers
how to play the ball.

106
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,887
Man, they tried to poison me.

107
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:26,331
You know, l had the
runs for three weeks.

108
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:29,248
How interesting.

109
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,054
l'd like to hear more about it.

110
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:38,570
Herr Rieber, l hear that you
publish a national magazine..

111
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,886
..with certain intellectual
features.

112
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:45,174
A garment trade magazine,
but modern. Modern.

113
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:48,168
Good afternoon. l'm Willie
Schumann, the ship's doctor.

114
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:49,814
The captain sends his regrets.

115
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,649
He's unable to come to lunch,
because of ship's business.

116
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,772
Doctor, l am Siegfried Rieber.

117
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,653
This is Professor Hutten,
Frau Hutten.

118
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:59,330
- Please. - No, no allow me.
And their dog, Bebe.

119
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:01,965
This charming young lady is
Fraulein Spockenkieker.

120
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:05,890
Herr Freytag, Frau Schmitt, Herr
Graf and his nephew Johann.

121
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:08,171
Please don't let me interrupt
your conversations.

122
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,486
We were just discussing
Herr Rieber's magazine.

123
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,965
Yes l have invited talented writers
from all over the nation..

124
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:14,887
..to contribute on one topic:

125
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,649
How we can expunge foreign
influences..

126
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:20,330
..and restore Germany to
its national greatness.

127
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,247
What foreign influences?

128
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:35,489
lf you need any attendance,
l'll be at your disposal.

129
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:36,645
Thank you.

130
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:41,332
On my part, doctor, you need
have no concern for me.

131
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:45,171
l do not believe in
'materia medica.'

132
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,575
Really?

133
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:49,565
Have you found something
better to replace it?

134
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:53,648
- Faith. - Faith. l see. Very well.

135
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:58,725
A toast. A toast to the German
woman, the most beautiful in the world.

136
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:05,966
- Delicious. - Herr Rieber.

137
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,966
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

138
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,736
- Karl Glocken. - Julius Lowenthal.

139
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,409
The herring is very good.

140
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,974
l'll have that and a couple
of hard-boiled eggs.

141
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,655
l beg your pardon.

142
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,567
You aren't Jewish, are you?

143
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,728
No. l have my own minority group.

144
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:46,330
They usually give a Jew a table
of his own on a boat like this.

145
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,372
Why do you think they
put us together?

146
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,647
lt's their way of being friendly.

147
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,886
Perhaps they thought
we might hit it off.

148
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:03,888
You are sure you are not Jewish?

149
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,329
Reasonably sure.

150
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:10,410
You resemble a brother-in-law
of mine in Stuttgart.

151
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:12,815
That's the way it is.

152
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:15,569
People are always mistaking
me for someone else.

153
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,645
- Spot of wine? - Just a touch.

154
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,816
My God. Where are we
going to put them?

155
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:55,575
We'll have to manage.

156
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:27,336
Professor, what is it?

157
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,806
What's happening? Who
are all those people?

158
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,171
There's nothing to be concerned
about Frau Schmitt.

159
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:36,805
- l have spoken to one of the
officials. - But what is it?

160
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:40,332
lt has to do with the price
of sugar on the world market.

161
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,247
- Sugar? - Yeah. You see..

162
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:44,975
..the sugar planters have been
unable to get their price..

163
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,375
..so they burned their crops..

164
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:49,050
..in the fields rather than
let the prices go down.

165
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:52,966
Something had to be done about
the Spanish laborers..

166
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:56,726
..so the Cuban government hit upon
a humanitarian plan of action.

167
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,329
They're sending them home.

168
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:23,726
- How do you feel? - 'Bien.'

169
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,249
Good.

170
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,727
l come to see you later, yes?

171
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:31,648
Please put her there in the corner.

172
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:48,410
- Where can they wash?
-There are two spigots.

173
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:51,375
- What?! - lt is not my fault.

174
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,333
Stop talking to me in this way.

175
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,408
You just don't put 600 people..

176
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:57,646
..on a deck like this with
only two outlets to wash!

177
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:58,771
You don't know them.

178
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,972
They wouldn't wash if they could.
You don't know what pigs they are.

179
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:03,172
The deck has to be cleaned.
Bring the hoses out.

180
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,814
- The hoses? - Bring the
hoses out, l said!

181
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,329
l cannot turn hoses on them.

182
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,815
lt's better to turn
the hoses on them..

183
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,375
..than for them to
live this way, no?

184
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:14,649
- Break out the hoses.
- Turn on those hoses.

185
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,250
l take it you are not
exactly pleased..

186
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:33,770
..that we are cabin
mates on this voyage.

187
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:36,768
l have already requested a change
in the accommodations.

188
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:38,370
You may take it from me..

189
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:41,414
..that l'm not exactly overwhelmed
with the prospect either.

190
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,965
However, pending changes..

191
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,173
..since we are captives of each
other's company for 26 days..

192
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,328
..l think it is best if we
reach an understanding.

193
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:54,171
Our cosmetics, for instance..

194
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:58,408
..l will keep mine on
this side of the sink.

195
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:02,569
And you keep yours on that
side. That's right?

196
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,646
Which bunk do you prefer?
The lower or the upper?

197
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,648
l was assured the lower.

198
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:13,655
lt is yours.

199
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:16,255
What are your habits?

200
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:19,249
l, myself, rise very
early in the morning.

201
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:24,651
l take it that if this evening is
an example, you are a late bird.

202
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:28,487
lf you sleep late, l will see
that l do not disturb you.

203
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:35,492
And l hope you, in turn, will try
your best not to disturb me.

204
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,575
One other thing.

205
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:48,249
One other thing.

206
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:53,648
My wife has informed me in the most
sarcastic terms possible..

207
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,329
..l snore.

208
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,565
Good night.

209
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,974
- You a painter, huh? - Yeah.

210
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:05,173
- What was you doing in Mexico?
- l was a timekeeper in a mine.

211
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,735
l thought you said
you was a painter.

212
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,966
l am a painter, but l was
a timekeeper in a mine.

213
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:12,253
- Why? - To support
myself as a painter.

214
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,566
- What's the matter? Don't you
make any money painting? - No.

215
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:17,773
Oh now, wait a minute.
Come on. Wait a minute.

216
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:21,565
You mean to tell me you work at
something you can't make a living off..

217
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:23,567
..so you gotta take a job
to make enough money..

218
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,806
..to go on working at
work you can't live on?

219
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:27,727
But that is the heroic life.

220
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:32,253
That is the way men who trust
themselves can afford to live.

221
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,171
- A strange neck of the woods.
- What do you mean?

222
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:36,894
Strange neck of the woods.

223
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,645
Look, l run into all kinds
of people, you know, but..

224
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,406
Did l tell you what happened
to a guy in Veracruz..

225
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:43,895
..when l was coming
through immigration?

226
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,251
Well l'm standing in line see.
So l see this clerk..

227
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:48,247
..and l holler, Hey, Pancho,
get over here.

228
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:49,564
Just being friendly-like..

229
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:51,966
..like back home you call
a taxi driver Mac

230
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:53,648
..or a Pullman porter George.

231
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:55,653
Well this little Negro..
You know these coast..

232
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:57,567
..Mexicans got mostly Negro
blood in them, l'm told.

233
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,647
Well, he just looks
up and stares at me.

234
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:03,815
The next thing l know, everybody's
going ahead of me in this line.

235
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:07,646
Then l realize that this
little Negro resented it.

236
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,569
- l think l'll turn in. - Me too.

237
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:26,330
Come in.

238
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,253
- Good evening. - Good evening.

239
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:33,647
l'm the doctor. You
wanted to see me?

240
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:37,251
Yes. l need something
to help me sleep.

241
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:38,894
- Are you ill? - No, no.

242
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,887
l just want something
to help me sleep.

243
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:44,774
- Do you often have trouble
sleeping? - Yes. Always.

244
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:49,964
- Does your doctor help you to
sleep? - Yes. Occasionally.

245
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:51,655
Take off your robe.

246
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:55,969
- You're sure you're the ship's
doctor? - Oh l am the ship's doctor.

247
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,330
Lean forward, please.

248
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:12,170
- What is it? - Your hands are cold.

249
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:13,575
l'm sorry.

250
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:20,805
Breathe deeply.

251
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:28,975
When was your period?

252
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,569
- Look, is it necessary to..?
- Yes, it is necessary.

253
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:35,326
All right. Last week.

254
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,889
l'm sure you'd never have
any trouble sleeping.

255
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:41,329
No, never.

256
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:43,655
Tell me your secret.

257
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:50,250
A clear conscience, of course.

258
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,327
That's a neat trick, having
a clear conscience..

259
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,247
..when you work as
a doctor on a ship..

260
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:58,487
..which has 600 people
living on an open deck.

261
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:02,173
You know, you just can't take pills
every time you can't sleep..

262
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,726
..or anytime you want to be stimulated
or sedated. lt has its effect.

263
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,249
What are you laughing at?

264
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:15,967
My house has been burned. They've
taken everything l had.

265
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:20,972
Now l'm being taken to prison, to
an island l know nothing about.

266
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:24,332
And you're giving me a
Sunday school sermon.

267
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:29,772
- You can put your robe
back on now. - Thank you.

268
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:35,728
You've got a gentle touch.

269
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,649
Maybe you're not as stuffy
as you pretend to be.

270
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,407
No. l hope not.

271
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,644
You gonna help me?

272
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:51,772
Your doctor may have
helped you too often.

273
00:23:54,656 --> 00:23:57,329
l'm very helpless at this moment.

274
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:00,726
You can leave me without any help.

275
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,247
That's your prerogative.

276
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,974
This is for tonight only.

277
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:23,773
- How old are you? - l'm old
enough, as you can see.

278
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:25,329
Much too old.

279
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,724
- Forty-five? - Not that old.

280
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,804
- How old are you? - Forty-two.

281
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,736
- How old are you? - Forty-one.

282
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,645
- You're joking. - Thank you.

283
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:49,805
Lie back, please.

284
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:55,768
You will feel it in a moment.

285
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,168
- Yes. - Talk.

286
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:02,775
- l beg your pardon? - Talk
until the drug takes effect.

287
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:10,331
This boat smells of cabbage.

288
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:16,329
Why does every German
boat smell of cabbage?

289
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,769
Keep talking.

290
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,966
What do you want me to talk about?

291
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,966
Anything you like. Just talk.

292
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:30,375
What's your name?

293
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:33,648
- Schumann. - No. Your first name.

294
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,645
Wilhelm.

295
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:41,650
Wilhelm.

296
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,250
Wilhelm.

297
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:49,249
lt's perfect.

298
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,564
Perfect.

299
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:11,249
Stop that now!

300
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:18,329
- Have you made this trip before?
-Oh l make it at least twice a year.

301
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,568
- Are you in some sort of business?
- l'm in the jewelry business.

302
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:24,375
A special part. l sell
religious trinkets.

303
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:27,653
Any religion. You name it, l got it.

304
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:30,967
l sell neck chains, bracelets,
anklets.

305
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,250
lt sounds like good business.

306
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:33,815
lt's a very good business.

307
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:36,649
People feel better when
they wear these things.

308
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:37,885
l feel good too.

309
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:41,810
With all this stuff on me, l feel
like an African l met in Paris.

310
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:46,811
He bought from me a crucifix,
Buddha and mezuzah. All on one chain.

311
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,648
Do you know what he said?

312
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:52,969
He said, lt may not help,
but it can't hurt.

313
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,645
You seem to get along
very well with people.

314
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:56,964
Oh l like people.

315
00:26:57,056 --> 00:27:00,332
lf you look for it, you can find
something good in anybody.

316
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,247
lt must be difficult sometimes.

317
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:06,409
For instance, doesn't it bother you
that you and that little man..

318
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:09,568
..are the only two Germans who
aren't at the captain's table?

319
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:17,572
Do you think that bothers me?
Besides, l like that little man.

320
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:20,410
What kind of a salesman do
you think l would be..

321
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:22,805
..if l couldn't deal with
a situation like that?

322
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:25,966
A salesman is supposed
to deal with..

323
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:28,411
..a difficult situation
and overcome it.

324
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:31,964
Listen. lt's not a new story.

325
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:34,889
White men hate black men.
Moslems hate Buddhists.

326
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:38,332
That's the way it goes. There's
prejudice everywhere.

327
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,327
lt does no good to give it back.

328
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:43,645
You have got to use your noggin.

329
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:04,645
There now, you must not mind
not winning against me.

330
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,489
After all, l was Ping-Pong champion
of the Sportsverein in Frankfurt..

331
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:09,407
..three times over.
- Morning.

332
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:10,975
- Morning. - Morning.

333
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:14,807
Herr Freytag picks some
bizarre company.

334
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:17,171
Ja, l suspect they are
birds of a feather.

335
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:18,655
Well, shall we play again?

336
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,647
Or perhaps l might suggest
another game.

337
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:23,569
- What game? - Any game.
One which you might win.

338
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:25,806
- What game do you mean?
- You have no idea?

339
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,887
l will not let you talk
that way to me.

340
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:30,974
- l'm sorry. - How dare you!

341
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:32,375
l could not resist.

342
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:34,408
l couldn't resist either.

343
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,966
What do your parents feel
about you going to Europe?

344
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:42,490
My mother's thrilled. lt's
something she's always wanted to do.

345
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:45,728
l think my father gave me up
for lost a long time ago.

346
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:49,647
- What do your parents do?
- My father owns a store.

347
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,327
lt's a good store.
A furniture store.

348
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:56,326
My mother's never been
satisfied with it.

349
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:59,171
She taught me that a woman had..

350
00:28:59,256 --> 00:29:00,894
..to have something of her very
own outside of her husband..

351
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:04,252
..otherwise, it was bridge games
and one day a week at the hospital.

352
00:29:05,256 --> 00:29:07,565
What about that young man
you're traveling with?

353
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:10,967
David. David's an artist.
A wonderful one.

354
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,888
He's a bit caught up with social
consciousness right now..

355
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:16,329
..but he'll get over that.

356
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,169
ls it serious?

357
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:22,332
l never felt about anybody
the way l do about David.

358
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:25,772
l think that David thinks a woman..

359
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:28,814
..should follow three paces
behind with slippers.

360
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:31,329
Men usually do.

361
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:35,252
My husband certainly did. No, thank
you. l have a whiskey sour.

362
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:38,408
- What did your husband do?
-He was in the diplomatic corps.

363
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:41,888
Oh.. we put up a wonderful
front in public.

364
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:44,251
We were everybody's favorite couple.

365
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:47,724
ln private, it was something
else again.

366
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,329
He was jealous of me.

367
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:53,485
He was so jealous of
me that he hit me.

368
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:56,406
He hit me till l bled at the nose.

369
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,250
l was wondering whether
David would beat me.

370
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:03,328
We quarrel sometimes.

371
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,655
lt seems to come out of nothing..

372
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:08,569
.. and then it grows into such
ugliness and bitterness.

373
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:10,248
lt surprises both of us.

374
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,974
l guess a relationship
between a man..

375
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:16,047
..and a woman is very difficult
these days, isn't it?

376
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:19,568
Practically impossible.

377
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,171
Put on your beret, Carlos.

378
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,487
Now we can hang in The Prado.

379
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:40,171
We will hang somewhere, Carlos.
The place is uncertain.

380
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:47,253
- That's enough for today.
Thank you. - Anytime.

381
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:02,965
l just can't tell you
how much l admire you.

382
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:05,175
Why?

383
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,564
You create.

384
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,727
l'm not even sure about that.

385
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:10,966
l've never been given a
penny for any of this.

386
00:31:11,656 --> 00:31:14,966
Still, l envy you. l envy
you your struggle.

387
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:18,373
l envy you your doubts
and floundering, even.

388
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:21,649
And Fraulein Brown.
l envy you that too.

389
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,247
She's an attractive girl, isn't she?

390
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:27,327
Are you two going to be married?

391
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:37,252
l am sorry. l don't mean to pry.

392
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,731
You know, the distasteful curiosity
of the non participant.

393
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:47,488
That's all right. l don't honestly
know whether we'll get married.

394
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,250
l told you how uncertain my life is.

395
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,646
Look l need all the help l can get.

396
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:56,325
l need someone who can believe in a
man who hasn't proved himself yet.

397
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:59,329
Someone to be there. Be for me.

398
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:01,407
Couldn't Fraulein Brown be that?

399
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,326
Fraulein Brown is a modern woman.

400
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:07,567
Their needs are a lot more
complicated than our mothers' were.

401
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:12,569
l'm crazy about Jenny. l really am.

402
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:15,966
l.. l've never felt this way about
anybody, the way l feel about her.

403
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:19,649
l guess l'm afraid to find out
how apart we really might be.

404
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:21,575
l see.

405
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:27,409
l see, l suppose one of the saddest
things in the world must be..

406
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:31,571
..to see two people who feel
so much for each other..

407
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:34,774
..and who feel that they
belong together..

408
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:37,575
..and yet they really don't
belong together at all.

409
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:54,645
- Hello. - Hello.

410
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:55,885
What are you doing?

411
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,648
l'm making one of these.

412
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,728
- How many of these
do you have? - Many.

413
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:11,329
Here is a bull.

414
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:14,175
A dog.

415
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:24,726
Do you think anyone in first class
would be interested to buy them?

416
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:26,770
l would.

417
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:44,564
Good morning.

418
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,249
Good morning.

419
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:51,567
- How long have you been here?
- About a half an hour.

420
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,645
No, no, don't get up. Lie back.

421
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,575
Did you put this over me?

422
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,169
Of course.

423
00:33:58,976 --> 00:34:00,728
l'm glad to see you are on deck.

424
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:05,495
lt was a wonderful drug you
gave me, whatever it was.

425
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:08,251
What was it, incidentally?

426
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,966
You don't expect me
to tell you, do you?

427
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:15,331
Oh you can actually laugh.

428
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,328
Did l startle you very much?

429
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,568
lt's good to hear you laugh too.

430
00:34:22,256 --> 00:34:24,816
Did you ever have all
the worst possible..

431
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,330
..things that can happen
to you happen?

432
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:31,885
Well, it gives you the most
irresponsible feeling.

433
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:33,814
Nothing more can happen.

434
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:42,249
Hey!

435
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:43,770
Are you all right?

436
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:48,975
lt takes a great deal of courage
to tangle with those two.

437
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,565
l have a certain security with them.

438
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:55,330
They are the only characters on
the boat smaller than l am.

439
00:34:57,576 --> 00:35:02,650
Such a charming lady makes a
charming morning even more charming.

440
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:04,255
Thank you.

441
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:09,253
He's wonderful.

442
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:10,565
He certainly is.

443
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,406
The one thing about
these children..

444
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:17,330
..they seem to have a better
time than anyone on the boat.

445
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:19,567
lf you expect me to speak
a word in defense..

446
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:21,408
..of those two little monsters,
you're much mistaken.

447
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,806
My prescription for them is to throw
them overboard in a leaky lifeboat.

448
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:28,326
You didn't have a childhood at all?

449
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:31,329
Nothing like theirs.
At least, l hope not.

450
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:37,173
Well.. when l was 4, l persuaded my
little brother to drink lye water.

451
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:40,168
- Lye water? - Yeah, l
told him it was milk.

452
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:44,329
So he went to screaming about the
house. His mouth was scrubbed out.

453
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,726
l was beaten black-and-blue.
l meant him no harm.

454
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:51,331
l was only curious to know
whether it would kill him.

455
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:54,814
And what about your childhood?

456
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:58,647
Did nothing gay ever
happen to you at all?

457
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:00,575
No.

458
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:02,965
l was the perfect dupe.

459
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:05,650
l believed anything
anybody ever told me.

460
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:10,651
l was full of the highest hopes and
the most unbelievable innocence.

461
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,896
However it's true, at the age of 12

462
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:15,967
..l did have an experience
with the housekeeper..

463
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:18,251
..that left an indelible
impression on me..

464
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:21,248
..shocked my mother no end and
cost the poor girl her job.

465
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:24,885
Well, there is hope
for you after all.

466
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,809
Oh.. the toreros are having
a fiesta tonight.

467
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,568
- l know. - Are you coming?

468
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,374
l wasn't planning to.

469
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:36,732
l thought we might have
a dance if you did.

470
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,649
Of course, you probably don't dance.

471
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:44,570
- Exactly how dull do you
think l am? - You are dull.

472
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:47,249
You're dull..

473
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:48,564
..stolid..

474
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:50,249
..unimaginative..

475
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:51,884
..helpless..

476
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,575
..and charming.

477
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:57,330
Yes, charming.

478
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:03,489
Oh you're blushing.

479
00:37:04,336 --> 00:37:07,567
That's the most charming thing l've
ever seen in my whole life.

480
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,567
l've never seen a man blush before.

481
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,729
l'm not blushing. l must
have a temperature.

482
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:21,569
Well anyway, l'll wear my..
my only dress..

483
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:26,572
..and l'll give you the choice
of any dance you like.

484
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:30,729
And l have a feeling it's
gonna be a slow waltz.

485
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:33,774
l happen to excel in the flamenco.

486
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:37,727
l was an intellectual.

487
00:37:37,816 --> 00:37:40,569
l was a philosopher and
teacher of philosophy.

488
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:43,648
Until three years ago, l learned
l was going to die.

489
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:47,564
Then my wisdom dropped from
me like soiled rags.

490
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:50,250
l was naked as the day l was born.

491
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:51,975
l heard a voice.

492
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:55,810
The most loving voice l've ever
heard. The voice of God!

493
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:57,568
And God said to me..

494
00:37:57,656 --> 00:38:01,331
God speaks to him. He speaks
to him personally.

495
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,885
Be quiet, Gregorio! You have
to spit on everything.

496
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:07,491
l asked myself, why was l afraid?

497
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,726
What are my personal sufferings..

498
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:13,729
..but a divine grace that can
be made useful to others?

499
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,966
- The miracle is.. - Miracle?

500
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:19,173
What miracle? Can you
make us a miracle?

501
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,735
Can you get us out
of this slop and..

502
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:22,772
..into the upper decks, where
we a man can breathe?

503
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:25,734
- That is a miracle.
-You blasphemous pig!

504
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:29,650
You are the pig. We are all pigs.
Look at the way we live!

505
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,965
Listen! Listen to me!

506
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:35,490
- God's mercy is in.. - God?

507
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:38,250
There is no God down here!

508
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:41,574
Do you know what l would
do if God were here?

509
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:44,968
l would curse him to his face.
- Yeah!

510
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,251
l would spit in his face!
- Yeah!

511
00:38:47,896 --> 00:38:50,490
l would send him down into
his own hell! - Yeah!

512
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:52,248
- Get him out of here! - Yeah!

513
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,645
Wait! Wait! You can't!

514
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:32,649
The hoses. And give them more
than a bath this time.

515
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:34,249
Yes, sir. The hoses!

516
00:42:50,816 --> 00:42:54,252
- A toast to 'el capitan.'
- A toast to 'el capitan'!

517
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:59,649
'El Capitan', with the hope that
this beautiful occasion..

518
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:02,250
..may serve to bring those
two great countries..

519
00:43:02,336 --> 00:43:04,804
..Spain and Germany,
closer together.

520
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:09,253
The Spanish heritage, the German
empire in all its glory.

521
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,406
- 'El Capitan', - 'El Capitan',

522
00:43:11,816 --> 00:43:13,249
Good God.

523
00:43:24,816 --> 00:43:26,329
Looking for someone?

524
00:43:27,496 --> 00:43:28,565
What do you mean?

525
00:43:28,896 --> 00:43:31,649
Dr. Schumann is a very
charming man, isn't he?

526
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:35,489
He's in steerage.

527
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:41,808
People say there are
only three reasons..

528
00:43:41,896 --> 00:43:43,887
..why a man would
be a ship's doctor:

529
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,249
He wants to travel. Or
his health is not good.

530
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,327
Or he's escaping from the law.

531
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,815
Which is it with Dr. Schumann?

532
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:57,650
Dr. Schumann has a quite serious
case of heart trouble.

533
00:44:02,576 --> 00:44:03,804
Will you excuse me?

534
00:44:21,816 --> 00:44:24,330
- What is your name?
- My name is Johann.

535
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:27,732
Why were you staring at me, Johann?

536
00:44:30,256 --> 00:44:32,724
- How is your father?
- He's my uncle.

537
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,974
He's sleeping in the cabin.

538
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:37,406
The doctor gave him something
to quiet him down.

539
00:44:38,336 --> 00:44:40,725
- Dance with me. - l don't dance.

540
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:43,255
l will show you.

541
00:45:03,896 --> 00:45:05,329
Do you feel that?

542
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:08,565
Only Spanish women move like that.

543
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,567
lt is called the 'meneo.'

544
00:45:15,656 --> 00:45:16,805
Feel?

545
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:19,815
l am not a gypsy, you know.

546
00:45:19,896 --> 00:45:23,650
l am real Spanish, and
this is the sign.

547
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:26,336
- You're doing it on purpose.
- Oh, no.

548
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:29,894
l was born this way.

549
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,408
Do you hear what they say?

550
00:45:38,056 --> 00:45:39,774
My hip bones.

551
00:45:41,816 --> 00:45:44,967
They say, 'Meneo..'

552
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:48,568
.. 'meneo'..

553
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:51,328
..all by themselves.

554
00:45:53,976 --> 00:45:56,729
- Will you buy me a bottle
of champagne? - l can't.

555
00:45:57,656 --> 00:45:59,248
Just a small bottle.

556
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:01,896
l don't have anything.
Not a pfennig.

557
00:46:05,656 --> 00:46:06,805
Excuse me.

558
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:35,966
- Shall we sit down?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

559
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:39,575
Here we are.

560
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:42,808
- You're doing your job
very well. - My job?

561
00:46:42,896 --> 00:46:44,648
lsn't it the duty of the
ship's personnel..

562
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:47,648
..to see that unescorted women
don't get too unhappy?

563
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:52,891
- l am here because l want to be.
-Now you really are doing very well.

564
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,329
Don't you believe me?

565
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:56,727
Does it matter whether l do or not?

566
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,646
Well perhaps you would
prefer to remain alone.

567
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:04,411
Oh, no. No. Please stay
and have a drink with me.

568
00:47:06,176 --> 00:47:07,575
lt's my birthday.

569
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:09,894
ls it really your birthday?

570
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:15,968
Forty-six. Me, 46. l
can't believe it, 46.

571
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:20,373
Well we Europeans are not as
conscious of age as you are.

572
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:23,728
Besides, when one looks as you
do and arouses in people..

573
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:26,330
..the feeling you do,
does it really matter?

574
00:47:26,816 --> 00:47:28,329
You're very kind.

575
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:32,647
There's a time when hearts
grow cold and hard.

576
00:47:33,176 --> 00:47:36,168
Women lose their grace
and become shrill.

577
00:47:36,336 --> 00:47:38,770
They run to fat or
turn to beanpoles.

578
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:41,768
Take to secret drinking.

579
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,655
They marry men too young for them
and get just what they deserve.

580
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:50,564
lt's enough to scare anyone..

581
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:53,375
..waiting for fear and loneliness
to do their work.

582
00:47:55,656 --> 00:47:59,808
Mrs. Treadwell, you are a very
exciting woman, and you know it.

583
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:05,805
Tell me.

584
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:09,329
Wouldn't it unnerve you to
have an affair with me?

585
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:20,886
Good evening. Are you enjoying
yourselves? You're not dancing.

586
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:23,487
Captain, do you have a second?
- Yes.

587
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:27,569
There's a man in steerage. One of
your men took his carving knife away.

588
00:48:27,656 --> 00:48:29,647
He needs his knife for his work.

589
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:32,647
This is the kind of thing he does.

590
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,886
Very nice. Very nice indeed.

591
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:38,649
The man's an artist. He's not
gonna do anybody any harm.

592
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:43,888
- You are absolutely certain
of that? - l'm certain.

593
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:48,569
Unfortunately, l have to be answerable
not only for your safety..

594
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:50,328
..but for the safety of the ship.

595
00:48:50,656 --> 00:48:54,331
Captain, the man is an artist. He
needs his knife for his work.

596
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,644
l'm sorry.

597
00:48:56,176 --> 00:48:57,575
Enjoy the party.

598
00:49:01,816 --> 00:49:03,374
l feel sorry for him.

599
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:06,489
You feel sorry for him?

600
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:10,975
He's a nice man. He doesn't
like doing this.

601
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:13,251
But he's doing it. That's
the point, isn't it?

602
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:17,975
David, you're gonna
hate me for this..

603
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:22,971
..but l'm glad those people in
steerage don't have knives.

604
00:49:24,176 --> 00:49:26,974
What's the matter? Afraid they'll come
up over the sides and murder us..

605
00:49:27,056 --> 00:49:28,774
..in our nice, clean, white beds?

606
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:31,804
Maybe they should.

607
00:49:34,256 --> 00:49:37,168
You're so unattractive
when you get like this.

608
00:49:37,776 --> 00:49:39,892
So violent and myopic.

609
00:49:41,176 --> 00:49:44,248
lt's exactly the kind of thing
that infects your work.

610
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:49,655
What about my work?

611
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:09,171
l told you no one would
dance with me.

612
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,974
Elsa, dance with your father.

613
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:13,889
- Mama, please. - Dance
with your father.

614
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:15,250
Elsa.

615
00:50:15,576 --> 00:50:18,568
When you go to a dance, you
first dance with your escort.

616
00:50:18,976 --> 00:50:22,764
Now, l am your escort, so you
will first dance with me.

617
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:26,246
Then, when you're seen dancing,
someone else will invite you.

618
00:50:27,656 --> 00:50:31,968
Besides, you haven't danced with
your papa since your last birthday.

619
00:50:33,576 --> 00:50:37,410
Papa, please. l don't want to dance.

620
00:50:57,416 --> 00:51:00,647
l'm sorry. l didn't
know anyone was here.

621
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:03,330
Don't be ashamed. What's the matter?

622
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:04,895
Come here. Sit down.

623
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:07,646
Sit down. Come here. Come here.

624
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:13,571
Tears are good. You know
what they say in Turkey?

625
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:17,649
They say tears wash the eyes
and one can see better.

626
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:20,406
At least l think they
say it in Turkey.

627
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:22,249
Turkey.

628
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:26,813
Now tell us, what is the reason for
this great emotional outburst?

629
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:29,808
Why isn't a charming young
lady like you inside..

630
00:51:29,896 --> 00:51:32,251
..enjoying the music and dancing?

631
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:37,412
Because no one wants to dance
with me. And l'm not charming.

632
00:51:37,656 --> 00:51:40,329
You are telling me you
are not charming?

633
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:44,648
An expert who has been to lstanbul,
Hamburg and Paris?

634
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:46,249
You are telling me?

635
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:49,254
And l am telling you that anybody
with eyes in his head..

636
00:51:49,336 --> 00:51:51,247
..can see that you are charming.

637
00:51:51,336 --> 00:51:54,965
Ask anybody with any intelligence.
Ask Glocken.

638
00:51:55,056 --> 00:51:57,331
ls this young lady charming
or isn't she?

639
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:00,806
- Charming. - There.

640
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:02,575
l told you.

641
00:52:02,816 --> 00:52:04,329
And how old are you?

642
00:52:04,736 --> 00:52:05,885
Sixteen.

643
00:52:08,496 --> 00:52:09,815
Adolescence.

644
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,248
What is adolescence?

645
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:15,726
Adolescence is a time when people
worry about things..

646
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:18,569
..there's no need to worry about.

647
00:52:19,176 --> 00:52:20,575
Sixteen.

648
00:52:20,816 --> 00:52:26,254
l promise you, at 1 7, you will be
even more charming than you are now.

649
00:52:26,656 --> 00:52:29,329
At 21 , you will be gorgeous.

650
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:32,328
And at 25, devastating.

651
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,250
And l won't stand any arguments.

652
00:53:13,896 --> 00:53:16,251
'Tales from the Vienna Woods.'

653
00:53:18,816 --> 00:53:21,410
David, 'Tales from
the Vienna Woods.'

654
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:24,964
Dance with me.

655
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:30,647
You never like to dance.

656
00:53:32,816 --> 00:53:35,250
l think l've been happiest
when l was dancing.

657
00:53:37,976 --> 00:53:39,250
Sometimes l wish..

658
00:53:39,336 --> 00:53:43,170
..that l'd tied a tape measure to
my ankle when l danced all my life.

659
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:48,248
Then l could tell you how many miles
l've traveled when l was happiest.

660
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,247
David, dance with me.

661
00:54:23,736 --> 00:54:24,885
Well..

662
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:30,250
l'm gonna enjoy this party
in spite of you, David..

663
00:54:30,336 --> 00:54:33,328
..so if you'll excuse me..

664
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,976
..l'm gonna dance with the
first man who asks me.

665
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:39,409
And here he comes.

666
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,247
- May l have this dance?
- Delighted.

667
00:55:03,776 --> 00:55:05,255
Good evening.

668
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:09,171
Good evening. You seem
in good spirits.

669
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:12,487
- l am. l delivered a baby tonight.
- How wonderful.

670
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:14,726
- What was it, a boy
or a girl? - Boy.

671
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:19,649
- What about our celebration?
- What do you mean?

672
00:55:19,776 --> 00:55:24,566
- Our dance. - You intimidated
me. l really don't dance.

673
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:29,890
l thought so. Well, this is a waltz,
and even you can manage a waltz.

674
00:55:30,576 --> 00:55:32,567
- l doubt it. - l don't.

675
00:55:37,736 --> 00:55:40,728
Just follow me and then
follow the music.

676
00:55:56,976 --> 00:55:58,329
How do you feel?

677
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:02,569
l can't seem to get over this cold.

678
00:56:04,336 --> 00:56:08,170
But l guess l'll be better if l
can get another night's sleep.

679
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:13,571
- You have to help me again.
- lt's not helping you.

680
00:56:13,896 --> 00:56:16,569
Oh, Willie. Don't lecture me.

681
00:56:17,736 --> 00:56:18,964
You'll lose count.

682
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,812
l'm trying to tell you
how serious it is.

683
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:25,253
Why are you trying to tell me?

684
00:56:27,336 --> 00:56:29,566
Are you trying to tell
me l'm an addict?

685
00:57:05,176 --> 00:57:08,168
As a publisher, my aim is to direct
the minds of the readers..

686
00:57:08,256 --> 00:57:10,895
..to the vital issues
of our society.

687
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:14,412
l have lately got a doctor to begin
a series of articles advocating..

688
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:17,886
..the extermination of
all the unfit at birth.

689
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,651
That's the way it's with Herr
Rieber. He's thinking all the time.

690
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:26,255
All this will be accomplished
painlessly, of course. Painlessly.

691
00:57:26,336 --> 00:57:30,409
Not only defective or useless
children, but the old too.

692
00:57:30,496 --> 00:57:34,250
Old persons over 60 or 65, perhaps.

693
00:57:34,336 --> 00:57:36,725
The same measures will be taken
with Jews, of course..

694
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:39,728
..and any illegitimate
mixtures of race.

695
00:57:39,816 --> 00:57:44,651
White with colored of any kind,
Chinese, Negroes..

696
00:57:44,736 --> 00:57:48,172
..and for any white man convicted
of a serious crime..

697
00:57:48,336 --> 00:57:50,406
..well, as for him..

698
00:57:51,256 --> 00:57:55,169
There is only one problem with
all this. Who will be left?

699
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:59,250
That is the difficulty. No one is
ever willing to accept a new idea.

700
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,809
Shall we dance?

701
00:58:08,576 --> 00:58:10,487
l like to listen to Herr Rieber.

702
00:58:10,776 --> 00:58:13,893
Every time l listen to him,
l feel reassured.

703
00:58:14,896 --> 00:58:18,650
l know no one could ever take
him or his party seriously.

704
00:58:28,336 --> 00:58:29,655
Pardon me.

705
00:58:34,896 --> 00:58:36,329
May l?

706
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:49,329
How do you feel?

707
00:58:53,176 --> 00:58:54,370
Try a little longer.

708
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:56,367
l promise to help you
when the time comes.

709
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:01,249
l want to sit down.

710
00:59:18,256 --> 00:59:20,326
lt's a nice party. Are
you enjoying it?

711
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:25,247
Can l have a cigarette, please?

712
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:41,248
May l get you something?

713
00:59:42,656 --> 00:59:43,805
Thank you.

714
00:59:55,736 --> 00:59:57,249
Excuse me, please.

715
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:17,773
l feel like l'm gonna die.

716
01:01:20,656 --> 01:01:21,805
l know.

717
01:01:43,496 --> 01:01:45,805
- What the hell's the matter with
you? - You are selfish, boorish..

718
01:01:45,896 --> 01:01:47,329
l don't know why l can't
get you out of my system.

719
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:48,974
You're not even really pretty.
- Thank you.

720
01:01:49,056 --> 01:01:51,809
Your head is filled with such garbage!
l wish l could just empty it out.

721
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:55,730
Take your hands off me! David, stop
it. l'll call for the purser.

722
01:02:09,336 --> 01:02:12,328
- Leave me alone. - Jenny, Jenny..

723
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:16,329
What? What do you
want from me? What?

724
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,895
l wish l knew.

725
01:02:21,896 --> 01:02:25,332
Oh, Jenny. Jenny, what's the matter?

726
01:02:26,336 --> 01:02:30,409
l'm crying. That's what's
the matter, l'm crying.

727
01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:37,366
The sweetest face. The sweetest
face in the world.

728
01:02:37,456 --> 01:02:40,971
David. David, what's
gonna happen to us?

729
01:02:57,736 --> 01:02:59,567
You never were any good at that.

730
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:03,411
lt has a zipper, remember?

731
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:06,769
What a wonderful sky.

732
01:03:07,816 --> 01:03:10,649
l'm sure you and your wife
watch clouds together.

733
01:03:11,976 --> 01:03:14,649
l wish there was someone
to watch clouds with me.

734
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:21,646
You're an extremely romantic woman,
Mrs. Treadwell, aren't you?

735
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:24,171
lt's been the handicap of my life.

736
01:03:26,176 --> 01:03:30,567
l can't settle for things. Bernard
Shaw said it, didn't he?

737
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:32,488
lf you can't get what you want..

738
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,965
..you better damn well settle
for what you can get.

739
01:03:35,576 --> 01:03:37,328
What did you want, Mrs. Treadwell?

740
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:40,975
A useful life.

741
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:45,250
Someone to love me. Forever.

742
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:48,248
Ridiculous of me, wasn't it?

743
01:03:50,496 --> 01:03:51,895
And what happened?

744
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:57,247
l chose the wrong man.

745
01:03:57,816 --> 01:04:00,250
How many times have you heard
that said, l wonder.

746
01:04:01,816 --> 01:04:05,252
He was the most promising.
The most handsome.

747
01:04:05,336 --> 01:04:07,372
He had the most glorious facade.

748
01:04:08,336 --> 01:04:10,566
The facade was all there was.

749
01:04:12,576 --> 01:04:15,807
He made me the best-known wife of
the best-known skirt-chaser..

750
01:04:15,896 --> 01:04:17,170
..in the community.

751
01:04:18,256 --> 01:04:20,326
l made life hell for him.

752
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,247
lt ended in the divorce courts.

753
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:28,413
We met one day in the corridor
outside the courtroom.

754
01:04:29,656 --> 01:04:30,884
He struck me.

755
01:04:33,576 --> 01:04:35,806
l took every penny he had.

756
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:44,726
So you must forgive me if l'm not
exactly receptive to the idea..

757
01:04:44,816 --> 01:04:48,411
..of other people's happiness
in marriage. l'm envious.

758
01:04:53,816 --> 01:04:55,727
You and your wife probably
have the closest thing..

759
01:04:55,816 --> 01:04:57,647
..to a perfect life as one can get.

760
01:05:03,976 --> 01:05:05,887
Nothing is perfect, Mrs. Treadwell.

761
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:14,171
l just wanted to tell you that l
would have bought the champagne.

762
01:05:14,336 --> 01:05:16,327
l would have bought it
if l had the money.

763
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:20,564
Come in.

764
01:05:29,656 --> 01:05:32,170
- How old are you? - Nineteen.

765
01:05:32,256 --> 01:05:33,575
You're one year older than l am.

766
01:05:38,496 --> 01:05:39,975
Can you give me something?

767
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:43,168
l'm not asking for much, but
l must have something.

768
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:45,167
Pepe would beat me within
an inch of my life..

769
01:05:45,256 --> 01:05:46,894
..if l don't give him something.

770
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,726
But aren't you a dancer?

771
01:05:58,176 --> 01:05:59,575
You better go.

772
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:10,565
Good. More dollars.

773
01:06:10,976 --> 01:06:14,252
Let's see, there was the
student and the sailor..

774
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:18,331
- What about him? - He
did not have anything.

775
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:20,725
- What was he doing here?
- He wanted to see me.

776
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:25,888
Did it ever occur to you that
someone might just want to see me?

777
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:27,170
Did it ever occur to you that..

778
01:06:27,256 --> 01:06:28,814
..l might want to be with
someone my own age?

779
01:06:28,896 --> 01:06:31,649
l am a human being too Pepe,
whether you think so or not.

780
01:06:31,736 --> 01:06:34,330
Who told you? Who told you
you were a human being?

781
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,884
lf it were up to you, l would spend
the whole voyage on my back.

782
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,250
l'll tell you what you are.

783
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:39,405
What you are is something
l picked up on the street..

784
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,646
..when you were 14 with
dirty underpants.

785
01:06:41,736 --> 01:06:43,567
Trying to stop men for
a few 'centavitos'

786
01:06:43,656 --> 01:06:44,975
..for you and your dirty family.

787
01:07:26,736 --> 01:07:30,729
Lowenthal! You're snoring!

788
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:34,488
That's what my wife says.

789
01:07:37,976 --> 01:07:39,967
Why are they doing this to you?

790
01:07:45,816 --> 01:07:51,413
l lived with a man who controlled
the lives of 5000 people.

791
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:53,248
l mean controlled.

792
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:58,766
l didn't want to, but l became
entangled with those people's lives.

793
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:02,373
l came to know that every
piece of food l ate..

794
01:08:02,456 --> 01:08:04,970
..every piece of clothing l had..

795
01:08:05,056 --> 01:08:07,968
..was coming out of their lives.

796
01:08:09,816 --> 01:08:12,967
One day, l entered one
of their houses.

797
01:08:14,336 --> 01:08:15,655
l'll never forget it.

798
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,167
The woman who lived there saw..

799
01:08:19,256 --> 01:08:21,816
..the shock in my eyes
at the way they lived.

800
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:27,331
And she said, Pardon me.

801
01:08:29,816 --> 01:08:31,966
l said, Pardon you for what?

802
01:08:33,056 --> 01:08:36,571
So she said, Pardon me for my house,
pardon me for the way it looks..

803
01:08:36,656 --> 01:08:38,886
..pardon me for everything.

804
01:08:42,376 --> 01:08:46,335
And then she said, But, of course,
you must understand that..

805
01:08:46,816 --> 01:08:49,649
..most of this place
is a garbage dump..

806
01:08:49,736 --> 01:08:52,330
..and l'm just a piece of garbage.

807
01:08:55,256 --> 01:09:00,171
l began by hiding agitators
in the chapel of the house..

808
01:09:00,256 --> 01:09:04,886
..and l ended by helping
them get arms.

809
01:09:09,176 --> 01:09:10,575
You don't say anything.

810
01:09:11,976 --> 01:09:13,329
l don't know what to say.

811
01:09:14,896 --> 01:09:16,648
l haven't met many
people in my life..

812
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,250
..who have committed themselves
to anything.

813
01:09:20,816 --> 01:09:22,568
You never talk about yourself.

814
01:09:25,256 --> 01:09:26,894
There's not very much to tell.

815
01:09:27,976 --> 01:09:32,333
l came from a Hamburg worker's family,
l worked hard to become a doctor.

816
01:09:32,816 --> 01:09:36,889
- l tried to be a man, l got
this. - lt is formidable.

817
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:39,888
lt's idiotic. Marked
for life like cattle.

818
01:09:43,496 --> 01:09:44,724
Are you married?

819
01:09:47,496 --> 01:09:48,645
Children?

820
01:09:49,976 --> 01:09:51,329
Two sons.

821
01:09:52,656 --> 01:09:53,771
Are you happy?

822
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:57,645
Who is happy?

823
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:03,327
Why isn't she here with you now?

824
01:10:04,256 --> 01:10:08,408
There was no reason in dragging her
halfway across the world with me.

825
01:10:09,776 --> 01:10:11,653
What about you? Are you married?

826
01:10:13,496 --> 01:10:16,169
- Three times. - What happened?

827
01:10:17,376 --> 01:10:19,048
Never found the right one.

828
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:22,649
Maybe l was waiting for
someone like you..

829
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:24,647
..someone l could teach the waltz.

830
01:10:24,736 --> 01:10:26,249
l'm sure.

831
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:30,248
Just think. lsn't it wonderful?

832
01:10:32,176 --> 01:10:35,248
Two strangers on a ship.

833
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:39,648
We will never meet again.
And we can talk.

834
01:10:41,336 --> 01:10:45,375
We can talk like friends.
Or even lovers.

835
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:50,811
We can talk like two people who
meet on the other side of the grave.

836
01:10:51,736 --> 01:10:52,964
Keep talking.

837
01:10:56,656 --> 01:10:58,567
Do you have any feeling for me?

838
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:02,648
No, of course not.

839
01:11:05,656 --> 01:11:06,805
Of course not.

840
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,330
lt's funny.

841
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:14,326
You know what l thought
you might be?

842
01:11:15,976 --> 01:11:20,970
l thought you might be the
innocent, romantic love..

843
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:23,772
..l should have had in my girlhood.

844
01:11:28,056 --> 01:11:31,173
Of course, nobody ever
loved me innocently.

845
01:11:32,896 --> 01:11:35,490
And how l would have laughed
at him if he had.

846
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:28,327
l never could hit a curve
ball on the outside corner.

847
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:29,815
l beg your pardon?

848
01:12:32,176 --> 01:12:35,725
l never could hit a curve
ball on the outside corner.

849
01:12:37,256 --> 01:12:39,645
That's very interesting.
What does it mean?

850
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:42,568
You wouldn't know if l told you.

851
01:12:44,816 --> 01:12:46,568
All right, l'll tell you.

852
01:12:48,256 --> 01:12:51,373
You're at bat, see? At bat.

853
01:12:51,976 --> 01:12:53,329
Bat! Bat!

854
01:12:57,816 --> 01:13:01,570
Okay, now you're at bat. The
pitcher, he's out there.

855
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:05,569
Now he's winding up, and
he turns her loose and..

856
01:13:06,976 --> 01:13:11,731
Just as it gets to you,
it dips down and away.

857
01:13:21,336 --> 01:13:24,248
And that is a curve ball
on the outside corner.

858
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,806
l could never hit that
pitch with a paddle.

859
01:13:36,256 --> 01:13:40,807
- l see. - No, you don't see.
You don't see at all.

860
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:43,248
You don't know what it's
like to be out there..

861
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,974
..crowd's yelling
for you to deliver.

862
01:13:45,976 --> 01:13:49,571
And they start talking.
The pitchers, they talk.

863
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:52,967
He can't hit a curve ball
on the outside corner.

864
01:13:53,736 --> 01:13:55,966
And from then on out,
that's all you see..

865
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:58,490
..is curve balls on
the outside corner.

866
01:14:01,176 --> 01:14:03,246
So you've had your big chance.

867
01:14:04,896 --> 01:14:06,807
And you have muffed it.

868
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:22,569
l can still hear my old man yelling
at me from the stands..

869
01:14:22,656 --> 01:14:23,975
..even though he wasn't there.

870
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:30,329
Big Will. You are a bum!

871
01:14:36,496 --> 01:14:39,568
You are a bum, just like me.

872
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:53,728
l think you're being a bit harsh
on yourself, Herr Tenny.

873
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:57,329
A bum.

874
01:15:00,816 --> 01:15:02,966
You know, l travel a lot.

875
01:15:05,496 --> 01:15:08,806
My folks give me some money.
Not much, but some.

876
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:13,250
They are more comfortable
when l'm not around.

877
01:15:15,656 --> 01:15:21,572
You know what l find? l find the
most amusing things about people..

878
01:15:21,656 --> 01:15:24,807
..are their guilt's that they
drum up for themselves.

879
01:15:25,256 --> 01:15:29,408
For instance, l estimate that
there must be at least..

880
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:35,732
..873 million people in the
world who don't even know..

881
01:15:35,816 --> 01:15:38,330
..what a curve ball on
the outside corner is.

882
01:15:39,816 --> 01:15:43,729
So l think it a bit excessive for
you to think that you have..

883
01:15:43,816 --> 01:15:45,568
..muffed your whole life just..

884
01:15:45,656 --> 01:15:48,250
..because you couldn't hit it,
paddle or no paddle.

885
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,332
Do you understand what
l mean, Herr Tenny?

886
01:16:00,776 --> 01:16:02,175
No.

887
01:16:03,576 --> 01:16:04,975
You know what l think?

888
01:16:12,816 --> 01:16:15,250
- No. - l think..

889
01:16:15,776 --> 01:16:19,655
..that you are a sawed-off
intellectual.

890
01:16:41,056 --> 01:16:42,409
Bottoms up, shorty.

891
01:16:51,056 --> 01:16:54,173
The purser, from whom l learn what
little l know about this ship..

892
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:57,965
..has informed me that you were
seen leaving La Condesa's cabin..

893
01:16:58,056 --> 01:17:00,251
..at a highly unrespectable hour.

894
01:17:03,576 --> 01:17:08,650
No comment, Willie? l think that's
one of the reasons l like you.

895
01:17:08,736 --> 01:17:10,567
You don't have my vulgarity.

896
01:17:11,976 --> 01:17:15,173
l wonder if it's really true that
life is as stupid and meaningless..

897
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,735
..as it seems to be on this ship.

898
01:17:17,256 --> 01:17:19,724
The Lutzes and their daughter, the
Huttens and their blessed dog.

899
01:17:19,816 --> 01:17:21,169
And that gross little Rieber..

900
01:17:21,256 --> 01:17:23,326
..who thinks of himself as
the wave of the future.

901
01:17:24,176 --> 01:17:27,327
l suppose a great case could be
made for my own foolishness.

902
01:17:30,816 --> 01:17:33,330
Will your wife be there to
meet you at Bremerhaven?

903
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,408
She's a wonderful woman.

904
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:41,249
We've been polite to each other
for a good many years.

905
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:43,807
Well, your sons will
be glad to see you.

906
01:17:44,816 --> 01:17:46,568
We hardly know each other anymore.

907
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,964
What will you do, go back
to your practice?

908
01:17:51,176 --> 01:17:55,249
l'm the kind of doctor l hate.
The hack general practitioner.

909
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:58,407
What would you have
liked to have been?

910
01:17:58,496 --> 01:18:01,408
- A good doctor. - Don't
you think you are?

911
01:18:01,656 --> 01:18:02,975
Fair to middling.

912
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:12,646
What do you think happens to
a woman like La Condesa..

913
01:18:13,816 --> 01:18:17,570
..when she's deported under
such circumstances?

914
01:18:24,816 --> 01:18:27,171
How long are you going to
keep me a penniless beggar?

915
01:18:27,776 --> 01:18:29,971
Do l have to ask you for change
to go to the barber?

916
01:18:30,056 --> 01:18:32,650
- Remember the agreement, Johann?
- The agreement.

917
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:35,967
You are to receive everything
after my death.

918
01:18:36,656 --> 01:18:38,806
Your mother was so pleased for you.

919
01:18:38,976 --> 01:18:41,649
She was so pleased for
your opportunity.

920
01:18:41,776 --> 01:18:44,654
My mother was pleased for a
chance for money for herself.

921
01:18:46,256 --> 01:18:49,566
How can you keep me a penniless
beggar? How can you do that?

922
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:51,250
Don't you have a heart at all?

923
01:18:51,336 --> 01:18:54,248
l have a heart. That's
why l can do it.

924
01:18:55,336 --> 01:18:57,645
What would you do with
the money, Johann?

925
01:18:59,496 --> 01:19:02,886
l have seen you watch that
gypsy dancer's buttocks..

926
01:19:02,976 --> 01:19:04,887
..as she walks on the deck.

927
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:08,249
l will not nourish your lust.

928
01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:18,492
- Good morning. - Good morning.
- Good morning.

929
01:19:18,576 --> 01:19:22,251
l have been trying to persuade Mrs.
Treadwell to have some breakfast.

930
01:19:22,336 --> 01:19:24,896
There's nothing like it, you know.
Especially the morning after.

931
01:19:25,376 --> 01:19:28,334
At home, we always used
to have it English-style:

932
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:32,967
Kidneys, sausages, kippers,
things like that.

933
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,735
How elegant.

934
01:19:35,976 --> 01:19:38,729
Well, l think l'll look in
on the bar before dinner.

935
01:19:43,816 --> 01:19:46,410
What a hard-trying race they are.

936
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:49,568
English-style for breakfast,
French-style for dinner.

937
01:19:49,656 --> 01:19:52,329
And every now and again, a
comfortable lapse back..

938
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,884
..to sauerbraten, sauerkraut
and beer.

939
01:19:54,976 --> 01:19:57,649
He seems very attentive;
l'll say that for him.

940
01:19:57,816 --> 01:20:00,569
Did you ever see such
a collection of bores?

941
01:20:00,656 --> 01:20:04,888
The attentive Lt. Huebner, the
happily-married man Herr Freytag.

942
01:20:05,336 --> 01:20:06,815
And here comes the ape.

943
01:20:07,656 --> 01:20:08,805
Morning.

944
01:20:10,496 --> 01:20:12,327
'Espece de type'!

945
01:20:12,976 --> 01:20:14,250
How's the painting?

946
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,412
l haven't been able to
do much onboard, but..

947
01:20:16,496 --> 01:20:18,407
..here's something l've
been doodling with.

948
01:20:21,896 --> 01:20:23,648
You can see l'm in love.

949
01:20:23,776 --> 01:20:27,564
Of course. Everybody on
this ship is in love.

950
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:33,774
Love me whether or not l love you.
Love me whether l am fit to love.

951
01:20:33,976 --> 01:20:36,171
Love me whether l am able to love.

952
01:20:36,256 --> 01:20:38,975
Even if there is no
such thing as love.

953
01:20:39,816 --> 01:20:41,249
Love me.

954
01:20:56,176 --> 01:20:59,407
- Where've you been? - l've been
talking to that Mrs. Treadwell.

955
01:20:59,496 --> 01:21:02,329
You know, she's so bitter.
She frightens me sometimes.

956
01:21:04,576 --> 01:21:05,725
Well, what do you think?

957
01:21:06,656 --> 01:21:07,805
lt's interesting.

958
01:21:12,896 --> 01:21:14,329
l think it's good.

959
01:21:14,976 --> 01:21:16,728
Well, of course it's good.

960
01:21:16,816 --> 01:21:18,807
You couldn't do anything
that wouldn't be good.

961
01:21:19,816 --> 01:21:22,808
- lt's wonderful. - But?

962
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:28,407
Does it have to be the same
thing all the time?

963
01:21:29,656 --> 01:21:31,374
Just what do you mean?

964
01:21:31,456 --> 01:21:34,732
You know; the exploitation
of the masses.

965
01:21:34,816 --> 01:21:36,408
Well, it's true, isn't it?

966
01:21:38,056 --> 01:21:41,890
Well, it's just that.. No matter
how well these things are done..

967
01:21:41,976 --> 01:21:44,729
..they always turn out to be
posters after all, don't they?

968
01:21:48,256 --> 01:21:49,814
You hate my work, don't you, Jenny?

969
01:21:57,776 --> 01:21:59,255
l think it's good.

970
01:22:13,176 --> 01:22:15,736
- Here he comes. Now, watch.
- What is it?

971
01:22:15,816 --> 01:22:18,250
l told the steward. Just watch.

972
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:29,172
- lf you will come this way, sir.
- l'm going to have lunch.

973
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:31,326
Yes. Another table has
been arranged for you.

974
01:22:32,736 --> 01:22:35,967
- Arranged? Who arranged it?
- Right over here, sir.

975
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:48,768
Now he will see how we feel.

976
01:22:49,656 --> 01:22:53,968
Dr. Schumann, they have placed
Herr Freytag at another table.

977
01:22:57,376 --> 01:23:01,335
Herr Rieber, you are a real
anti-Semite. l don't know any Jews.

978
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:03,327
l don't know anything
about them at all.

979
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:06,567
l'm not an anti-Semite.
How can you say that?

980
01:23:06,656 --> 01:23:07,975
l'm very fond of the Arabs.

981
01:23:08,056 --> 01:23:11,571
l lived among them for a while and
found them to be very good people.

982
01:23:12,176 --> 01:23:14,565
You have not said a word, Dr.
Schumann.

983
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,408
What do you think about..?
- Excuse me.

984
01:23:20,176 --> 01:23:21,894
Doctor has heart trouble.

985
01:23:23,056 --> 01:23:26,731
Do you suppose we should send
to inquire after him?

986
01:23:30,576 --> 01:23:31,725
Schumann.

987
01:23:33,336 --> 01:23:37,807
Schumann. ls that not a Jewish name?

988
01:23:39,176 --> 01:23:40,575
My wife is Jewish.

989
01:23:42,496 --> 01:23:44,248
l told that American woman.

990
01:23:45,256 --> 01:23:47,975
- She must have told them.
- Now come, have some wine.

991
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:50,408
lt's Niersteiner Domtal.

992
01:23:51,496 --> 01:23:55,250
Why be upset? The company is
much better at this table..

993
01:23:55,336 --> 01:23:56,564
..l can assure you.

994
01:23:56,656 --> 01:24:00,649
When Glocken isn't smoking one
of his foul-smelling cigars.

995
01:24:03,376 --> 01:24:07,255
You know l don't mind not being
seated at the captain's table.

996
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:10,813
Perhaps because l was never
invited in the first place.

997
01:24:11,496 --> 01:24:14,408
Those pious hypocrites.

998
01:24:15,816 --> 01:24:19,809
- Why do you take it? - l have
been taking it for a long time.

999
01:24:19,896 --> 01:24:25,573
Oh, yes, he has. He has 2000 years
of suffering behind him.

1000
01:24:26,176 --> 01:24:27,894
Well, l'm not going to take it.

1001
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:32,250
A little patience. A
little understanding.

1002
01:24:32,376 --> 01:24:34,412
The world's getting
better all the time.

1003
01:24:34,816 --> 01:24:36,647
As my Aunt Rebecca used to say..

1004
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,250
l don't give a damn what your
Aunt Rebecca used to say.

1005
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:51,329
Do you think any of you are
any better Germans than l am?

1006
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,570
Do you?

1007
01:24:59,576 --> 01:25:02,886
Yes. Yes, l have a Jewish wife.

1008
01:25:04,816 --> 01:25:08,252
She's Jewish. Let me
tell you about her.

1009
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:13,172
She'd never hurt anyone in her life.

1010
01:25:16,176 --> 01:25:17,575
Anyone.

1011
01:25:20,056 --> 01:25:23,969
You.. You good, middling people.

1012
01:25:24,496 --> 01:25:26,726
You aren't fit to be in
the same world as her.

1013
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:32,329
l saw some of you in the chapel this
morning. You kneel there and pray.

1014
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:34,327
You pretend that you
are good people.

1015
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,769
Good people?

1016
01:25:39,256 --> 01:25:42,646
You can't even exist without
your prejudices.

1017
01:25:43,896 --> 01:25:45,887
And the worst thing about you is..

1018
01:25:47,496 --> 01:25:51,250
..that you don't even
recognize what you are.

1019
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,575
You..

1020
01:26:04,256 --> 01:26:08,169
Sometimes l think, in spite
of how much you understand..

1021
01:26:08,576 --> 01:26:10,168
..it's enough already.

1022
01:26:11,656 --> 01:26:12,805
What's going on?

1023
01:26:14,376 --> 01:26:16,571
They moved Herr Freytag from
the captain's table..

1024
01:26:16,656 --> 01:26:18,248
..because his wife is Jewish.

1025
01:26:20,816 --> 01:26:22,374
And it's my fault.

1026
01:26:23,056 --> 01:26:26,412
l had to tell that dreadful Brunhilda
to stop her from chattering on so.

1027
01:26:27,496 --> 01:26:31,569
So stupid of me. He's
such a nice man.

1028
01:26:33,736 --> 01:26:35,806
l'd no idea this was
going to happen.

1029
01:26:37,896 --> 01:26:41,650
- You're not gonna cry,
are you? - Of course not.

1030
01:26:42,976 --> 01:26:44,409
l never cry.

1031
01:26:49,816 --> 01:26:51,647
What do they got against the Jews?

1032
01:26:53,496 --> 01:26:55,805
Back home, we don't have anything
against the Jews.

1033
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,975
Hell, l never even saw
a Jew till l was 15.

1034
01:27:00,496 --> 01:27:04,250
Maybe you were too busy lynching
Negroes to take time out for the Jews.

1035
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:30,809
Why don't you ring for the steward?
He might give you something.

1036
01:27:30,896 --> 01:27:34,252
l have been ringing! Ringing!
Ringing! Ringing!

1037
01:27:34,336 --> 01:27:37,567
A fellow gave these pills
to me in Tangiers.

1038
01:27:37,656 --> 01:27:42,332
He had a theory that seasickness has
something to do with the eardrums.

1039
01:27:43,776 --> 01:27:44,891
You know, Lowenthal?

1040
01:27:44,976 --> 01:27:46,250
Yes?

1041
01:27:47,576 --> 01:27:49,726
You are really not
such a bad fellow.

1042
01:27:49,816 --> 01:27:51,249
You think so?

1043
01:27:51,336 --> 01:27:56,569
These statements that l make, you
mustn't take them personally.

1044
01:27:56,656 --> 01:27:57,884
No, of course not.

1045
01:27:57,976 --> 01:28:02,254
lt is the march of history. History
is beyond us, Lowenthal.

1046
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:06,771
Feel better?

1047
01:28:08,056 --> 01:28:09,728
- A little. - Good.

1048
01:28:10,656 --> 01:28:13,966
You know, the thing l can't understand
is why you want to go back to Germany.

1049
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:17,173
l would not want to be
where l was not wanted.

1050
01:28:17,256 --> 01:28:19,326
Why don't you go back
to your own country?

1051
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:22,249
Germany is my country. My
father was born in Germany.

1052
01:28:22,336 --> 01:28:24,566
And my grandfather was
born in Germany.

1053
01:28:24,736 --> 01:28:29,252
As a matter of fact, where are you
from? l can't place your accent.

1054
01:28:29,336 --> 01:28:31,975
You speak German like no
one l have ever heard.

1055
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:35,253
The last 20 years of my life
were spent in Germany.

1056
01:28:36,176 --> 01:28:37,575
Austria?

1057
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:40,565
Near the border.

1058
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:42,815
That's what l thought.

1059
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:44,966
Lowenthal, you know it is
a historical fact that..

1060
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,331
..the Jews are the basis
of our misfortunes.

1061
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:48,735
- Of course. - You agree?

1062
01:28:48,816 --> 01:28:52,252
Of course. The Jews and
the bicycle riders.

1063
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:56,250
Bicycle riders? Why
the bicycle riders?

1064
01:28:57,056 --> 01:28:58,330
Why the Jews?

1065
01:29:47,976 --> 01:29:50,729
- Hey, what's going on?
- Man overboard!

1066
01:29:50,896 --> 01:29:53,330
Man overboard!

1067
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:55,247
Man overboard!

1068
01:29:55,336 --> 01:29:57,167
Hey, man overboard!

1069
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:35,327
- Get her out of here! - Take
her to our cabin, please.

1070
01:30:41,336 --> 01:30:42,564
Turn him over.

1071
01:31:10,816 --> 01:31:12,374
Can you understand it?

1072
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:16,771
A man jumps from a moving ship at
night, in the middle of the ocean.

1073
01:31:16,896 --> 01:31:19,364
And is drowned to save
the life of a dog.

1074
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:21,814
Yes, l can understand.

1075
01:31:23,816 --> 01:31:24,885
Who was he?

1076
01:31:25,176 --> 01:31:29,647
He was a woodcarver. He carved
little animals with his pocketknife.

1077
01:31:41,336 --> 01:31:42,655
Come in, please.

1078
01:31:42,736 --> 01:31:44,806
Doctor, what can we do?

1079
01:31:45,656 --> 01:31:49,171
Well, you're doing all
that can be done.

1080
01:31:49,256 --> 01:31:51,770
- How did it happen? - Yeah.
How did it happen?

1081
01:31:51,856 --> 01:31:54,973
- He was thrown overboard.
-Who would do such a thing?

1082
01:31:56,336 --> 01:31:59,567
But look at him. He knows that
someone tried to drown him!

1083
01:31:59,896 --> 01:32:02,251
- His heart is broken. - Doctor!

1084
01:32:03,496 --> 01:32:04,770
You are not leaving?

1085
01:32:06,176 --> 01:32:09,327
Perhaps we could get him some
broth. Some hot broth.

1086
01:32:09,416 --> 01:32:12,647
Yes. You can give him some broth.
lt won't do any harm.

1087
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:13,805
ls that all?

1088
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:15,804
Yes, that's all.

1089
01:32:18,376 --> 01:32:19,968
The man who saved him is dead.

1090
01:32:25,056 --> 01:32:27,251
Did he say a man is dead?

1091
01:32:41,166 --> 01:32:42,645
l know how you feel.

1092
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:52,720
No. You don't. You're
like the others.

1093
01:32:53,206 --> 01:32:55,640
You thought the captain was
justified in taking his knife away.

1094
01:32:55,726 --> 01:32:57,205
That's what you thought, wasn't it?

1095
01:32:57,646 --> 01:32:59,204
You were the one who felt
sorry for the captain.

1096
01:32:59,286 --> 01:33:00,878
That was you, wasn't it?

1097
01:33:02,646 --> 01:33:04,796
Why can't we be honest
with each other?

1098
01:33:04,886 --> 01:33:06,160
l don't know.

1099
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:14,354
- Maybe we're afraid to be.
- Well, let's try.

1100
01:33:14,726 --> 01:33:16,637
Maybe we'd better try.

1101
01:33:20,646 --> 01:33:23,114
You say l hate your painting.
Well, l do.

1102
01:33:23,726 --> 01:33:26,559
Oh, God help me, but l do.
l don't know why.

1103
01:33:26,646 --> 01:33:29,797
You've said it. Maybe it's because
l'm not very good at it myself.

1104
01:33:29,886 --> 01:33:32,878
Or maybe.. just maybe it's because
it means so much to you..

1105
01:33:32,966 --> 01:33:34,797
..more than anything,
more than even me.

1106
01:33:37,806 --> 01:33:39,637
That's being honest, isn't it?

1107
01:33:43,886 --> 01:33:45,114
Yes, that's honest.

1108
01:33:50,286 --> 01:33:52,880
Well, l'll tell you something
that's even more sad.

1109
01:33:55,206 --> 01:33:57,162
l can't be what you want me to be.

1110
01:33:58,046 --> 01:34:00,879
And l know what you need. You need
someone just to be there..

1111
01:34:00,966 --> 01:34:02,638
..to deny herself for you.

1112
01:34:04,726 --> 01:34:07,365
David, l wish l could be
like that, but l can't.

1113
01:34:07,446 --> 01:34:10,358
- l just can't. - Jenny,
l know you can.

1114
01:34:13,046 --> 01:34:14,957
Well, it means leaving
me with nothing.

1115
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:18,634
You know? Nothing.

1116
01:34:18,966 --> 01:34:21,799
Jenny, do you know what l need?
l need something very simple.

1117
01:34:21,886 --> 01:34:25,117
l need a woman. But that's so
difficult for you, isn't it?

1118
01:34:25,206 --> 01:34:26,764
You're so full of competition.

1119
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:29,641
Do you know how empty it is,
how frustrating it is..

1120
01:34:29,726 --> 01:34:32,035
..to reach out for something and
then you find it isn't there?

1121
01:34:33,286 --> 01:34:35,641
To feel that someone is with you.

1122
01:34:37,286 --> 01:34:39,277
David, don't you think that l am?

1123
01:34:39,806 --> 01:34:41,762
Don't you think that l
am in spite of myself?

1124
01:34:41,846 --> 01:34:45,725
- Haven't l tried everything? - Yes,
you have tried. You've split a gut.

1125
01:34:47,046 --> 01:34:50,641
lt's so hard for you. l know.
lt's so hard for both of us.

1126
01:34:53,086 --> 01:34:54,724
All right, you say my work is..

1127
01:34:54,806 --> 01:34:56,717
..the most important thing
in my life. lt is.

1128
01:34:56,806 --> 01:34:58,956
But that's the way l am.
l can't help it.

1129
01:34:59,046 --> 01:35:01,958
And whoever shares my life is just
going to have to put up with that.

1130
01:35:02,126 --> 01:35:04,356
She's going to have to
live a life for me.

1131
01:35:05,286 --> 01:35:08,198
Jenny, l know this sounds
selfish, but it's true.

1132
01:35:17,806 --> 01:35:19,637
We're not gonna go on
together, are we?

1133
01:35:22,806 --> 01:35:24,034
Are we?

1134
01:35:32,206 --> 01:35:33,355
David?

1135
01:35:40,286 --> 01:35:41,639
Come in.

1136
01:35:55,646 --> 01:35:57,045
l would have come to you.

1137
01:35:57,286 --> 01:35:59,356
Well, they said you
weren't feeling well.

1138
01:35:59,446 --> 01:36:01,641
l'm just tired, that's all.

1139
01:36:01,806 --> 01:36:03,637
- Were you sleeping? - No.

1140
01:36:05,046 --> 01:36:08,118
Don't you know it's very unhealthy
to sleep with your clothes on?

1141
01:36:08,206 --> 01:36:09,798
- Where are they? - What?

1142
01:36:11,046 --> 01:36:13,560
- Where are they? - What are you
looking for? - Where are..

1143
01:36:13,646 --> 01:36:15,716
Stop rifling through my things.

1144
01:36:16,206 --> 01:36:18,640
Here they are. Put them on.

1145
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:20,878
Come on. Put them on.

1146
01:36:27,206 --> 01:36:29,276
And l'll read to you
until you sleep.

1147
01:36:34,286 --> 01:36:37,642
Some pretty risqu? literature
you've got here.

1148
01:36:39,446 --> 01:36:43,724
'Natural Resistance' and
'Clinical Medicine.'

1149
01:36:45,806 --> 01:36:48,115
'Researches on Rheumatism.'

1150
01:36:49,206 --> 01:36:50,798
'Diseases.. '

1151
01:37:11,046 --> 01:37:12,638
l don't know why l'm so tired.

1152
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:16,162
Why, yes, of course. Well, that's
the way it is sometimes.

1153
01:37:24,166 --> 01:37:25,645
The woodcarver died.

1154
01:37:26,566 --> 01:37:27,965
Yes, l know.

1155
01:37:28,206 --> 01:37:30,720
l have been unable to
accept death. Never.

1156
01:37:31,566 --> 01:37:33,284
No matter how many
times l've seen it.

1157
01:37:33,566 --> 01:37:35,955
l always feel as though
l'm responsible.

1158
01:37:37,446 --> 01:37:38,640
Now..

1159
01:37:39,206 --> 01:37:40,764
..let's see what we've got here.

1160
01:37:47,206 --> 01:37:51,802
The dissolute Lady Chatterley sat
waiting for the gardener to enter.

1161
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:57,640
He entered, stopping for a moment,
sensing someone in the room.

1162
01:37:57,726 --> 01:38:00,957
His muscles sinewy in the moonlight.

1163
01:38:01,766 --> 01:38:06,044
She spoke his name softly. The
gardener went over to her.

1164
01:38:06,206 --> 01:38:08,356
He kissed Lady Chatterley..

1165
01:38:08,566 --> 01:38:12,957
..with a kiss such as she had
never been given before.

1166
01:38:13,126 --> 01:38:17,722
Her arms were waiting for him,
both resisting and demanding.

1167
01:38:18,046 --> 01:38:23,166
'Jonathan, ' she said, 'Jonathan,
darling, you are violating me.'

1168
01:38:23,246 --> 01:38:24,804
Where did you get that?

1169
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:33,719
You're so strange.

1170
01:38:34,886 --> 01:38:38,959
Sometimes you're so bitter. Then
you're soft and warm, like a child.

1171
01:38:40,726 --> 01:38:42,045
l'm just a woman.

1172
01:38:43,206 --> 01:38:44,639
Lie back.

1173
01:38:48,046 --> 01:38:49,957
There's three days to Tenerife.

1174
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,281
l know.

1175
01:38:55,366 --> 01:38:57,800
What will your treatment be like
for you there? Do you know?

1176
01:38:58,566 --> 01:38:59,965
Will you be imprisoned?

1177
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:05,638
lt will be some kind of an
imprisonment, l imagine.

1178
01:39:06,646 --> 01:39:09,956
But you mustn't think of me
sleeping on a stone floor..

1179
01:39:10,046 --> 01:39:12,116
..and living on bread and water.

1180
01:39:13,046 --> 01:39:14,764
This is not my style.

1181
01:39:21,446 --> 01:39:22,720
Now..

1182
01:39:24,046 --> 01:39:25,638
Now l'm going to read to you..

1183
01:39:25,726 --> 01:39:27,717
..from this book exactly
the way it's written.

1184
01:39:27,806 --> 01:39:30,718
lf this doesn't put you to sleep,
nothing ever will.

1185
01:39:30,806 --> 01:39:33,957
The liver is a large,
glandular organ..

1186
01:39:34,046 --> 01:39:38,119
..irregularly shaped and
of reddish-brown color.

1187
01:41:02,286 --> 01:41:03,639
Come on.

1188
01:41:06,206 --> 01:41:08,720
- Please come with me to the table.
- No. l've done enough.

1189
01:41:08,806 --> 01:41:11,639
You just have to take it
from here on by yourself.

1190
01:41:11,726 --> 01:41:13,762
- Are you sure l look all right?
- You look lovely.

1191
01:41:13,846 --> 01:41:15,802
Now, go on.

1192
01:41:24,766 --> 01:41:25,960
Good evening.

1193
01:41:26,366 --> 01:41:27,719
Good evening.

1194
01:41:43,046 --> 01:41:44,161
Hello.

1195
01:41:44,286 --> 01:41:45,355
Hello.

1196
01:41:45,446 --> 01:41:46,640
Waiter.

1197
01:41:47,046 --> 01:41:50,038
l would like one bottle
of champagne, please.

1198
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:51,965
Would you like to join me?

1199
01:41:52,366 --> 01:41:55,119
Why not? What are we celebrating?

1200
01:42:02,886 --> 01:42:04,114
Quarrel?

1201
01:42:05,206 --> 01:42:06,639
lt's over.

1202
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:10,639
l'm sorry.

1203
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:25,641
Will you excuse me? l have
to go to the bridge.

1204
01:42:33,046 --> 01:42:34,365
Do you want to dance?

1205
01:42:35,886 --> 01:42:37,035
No.

1206
01:42:37,886 --> 01:42:39,285
No, not this time.

1207
01:42:39,766 --> 01:42:40,960
Thank you.

1208
01:42:43,286 --> 01:42:46,278
l think l'm going to
go to my cabin..

1209
01:42:46,366 --> 01:42:50,723
..because for me, a little
German music goes a long way.

1210
01:42:57,446 --> 01:42:59,164
Don't be embarrassed.

1211
01:42:59,646 --> 01:43:01,159
Nobody is watching.

1212
01:43:03,206 --> 01:43:04,719
Will l see you later?

1213
01:43:06,206 --> 01:43:07,639
Later.

1214
01:43:30,646 --> 01:43:31,795
Herr Freytag?

1215
01:43:32,566 --> 01:43:33,965
Herr Freytag!

1216
01:43:37,286 --> 01:43:39,959
l want to tell you how sorry l am.

1217
01:43:42,806 --> 01:43:45,718
l wanted to tell you that
with all my heart.

1218
01:43:47,566 --> 01:43:48,965
Heart?

1219
01:43:49,206 --> 01:43:51,640
You have no hearts. Any of you.

1220
01:43:53,446 --> 01:43:56,722
l'm sorry. l've no right
to be rude to you.

1221
01:43:58,046 --> 01:44:01,197
l have no right to
be rude to anybody.

1222
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:05,043
You must be very much in love..

1223
01:44:05,126 --> 01:44:08,118
..with your wife to stand
up for her that way.

1224
01:44:13,286 --> 01:44:15,356
My wife and l are separated.

1225
01:44:17,806 --> 01:44:19,034
Yes.

1226
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:20,639
Yes!

1227
01:44:24,126 --> 01:44:25,275
l..

1228
01:44:26,366 --> 01:44:30,359
l thought l could face what we had
to go through after we were married.

1229
01:44:32,166 --> 01:44:33,645
l couldn't.

1230
01:44:35,046 --> 01:44:37,196
l wasn't ready to give
up my position..

1231
01:44:37,286 --> 01:44:39,720
..because of my employer's
prejudices.

1232
01:44:40,886 --> 01:44:43,639
My family talked to me about it.

1233
01:44:44,046 --> 01:44:45,365
My friends.

1234
01:44:49,646 --> 01:44:51,364
My dear friends.

1235
01:44:52,646 --> 01:44:54,125
So l panicked.

1236
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,559
Panicked!

1237
01:44:57,966 --> 01:45:01,038
l asked my firm to transfer
me to Mexico.

1238
01:45:03,446 --> 01:45:06,358
And you'll never believe what l did.

1239
01:45:07,726 --> 01:45:09,364
l wrote a letter.

1240
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:13,364
Dear Marianne:

1241
01:45:14,446 --> 01:45:19,566
We can't go on together.

1242
01:45:23,566 --> 01:45:27,957
l've imagined her face a thousand
times when she got the letter.

1243
01:45:31,126 --> 01:45:33,959
That face has followed
me everywhere.

1244
01:45:37,766 --> 01:45:39,722
Now l'm going back.

1245
01:45:42,886 --> 01:45:44,717
l don't even know where she is.

1246
01:45:47,726 --> 01:45:49,364
But l've got to find her.

1247
01:45:51,206 --> 01:45:54,118
Plead with her to understand.

1248
01:45:58,646 --> 01:45:59,965
To forgive me.

1249
01:46:02,446 --> 01:46:06,280
lf she cares for you,
she'll understand.

1250
01:46:08,286 --> 01:46:09,639
Don't you see?

1251
01:46:10,766 --> 01:46:14,884
Even if she does, l know
l'll never forget.

1252
01:46:18,206 --> 01:46:19,878
l wrote that letter.

1253
01:46:24,126 --> 01:46:25,957
Listen to that music, Glocken.

1254
01:46:26,566 --> 01:46:29,364
Now try to tell me you don't
react to that music.

1255
01:46:29,446 --> 01:46:30,640
Schmaltz.

1256
01:46:31,206 --> 01:46:33,356
Tell me, Glocken, now honestly.

1257
01:46:33,446 --> 01:46:36,040
When you hear that music
wherever you are..

1258
01:46:36,126 --> 01:46:38,959
..don't you have a special
feeling about being a German?

1259
01:46:40,126 --> 01:46:42,356
l'll tell you now
Lowenthal honestly.

1260
01:46:42,446 --> 01:46:44,641
When l hear that music
wherever l am..

1261
01:46:44,726 --> 01:46:47,115
..l have a special feeling
about being a dwarf.

1262
01:46:49,766 --> 01:46:54,203
l remember being thousands of miles
from home in a theater in New York.

1263
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:58,723
They put on a picture of the
funeral of the Kaiserin Viktoria.

1264
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:03,643
That good woman. How much
she meant to all of us.

1265
01:47:06,046 --> 01:47:07,764
You are German, aren't you?

1266
01:47:08,646 --> 01:47:12,036
You are the most German
person l have ever met.

1267
01:47:13,966 --> 01:47:15,797
l want to show you something.

1268
01:47:16,046 --> 01:47:17,877
l take it out every
once in a while..

1269
01:47:17,966 --> 01:47:20,719
..and look at it when
l want to feel good.

1270
01:47:22,726 --> 01:47:25,638
Why, the Order of the lron Cross!

1271
01:47:26,126 --> 01:47:27,559
Second class.

1272
01:47:29,046 --> 01:47:30,957
And a war hero, besides.

1273
01:47:33,166 --> 01:47:37,045
You may be the biggest fool
on this whole boat.

1274
01:47:39,886 --> 01:47:41,160
Why do you say that?

1275
01:47:42,566 --> 01:47:44,796
Where have you been
during this voyage?

1276
01:47:46,046 --> 01:47:49,356
Do you think this boat is a cross
section of the German people?

1277
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:51,281
No!

1278
01:47:51,366 --> 01:47:54,642
You don't know the average
German the way l know him.

1279
01:47:54,726 --> 01:47:58,036
The people that produced a Goethe,
a Beethoven and a Bach..

1280
01:47:58,126 --> 01:47:59,878
..are not to be
sneezed at, you know?

1281
01:47:59,966 --> 01:48:03,276
50% of the people who produced a
Goethe, a Beethoven and a Bach..

1282
01:48:03,366 --> 01:48:06,119
..voted for Rieber's party last
week. - Forty-four percent.

1283
01:48:07,206 --> 01:48:10,118
Lowenthal, you are blind!
You're absolutely blind!

1284
01:48:10,206 --> 01:48:12,766
You can't see what's going on
in front of your own face.

1285
01:48:12,966 --> 01:48:14,365
What do you mean?

1286
01:48:15,646 --> 01:48:20,117
You mean this business about the
Jews? You don't understand us.

1287
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:23,164
The German Jew is something special.

1288
01:48:23,246 --> 01:48:26,363
We are Germans first
and Jews second.

1289
01:48:27,206 --> 01:48:31,722
We have done so much for Germany.
Germany has done so much for us.

1290
01:48:31,806 --> 01:48:35,719
A little patience. A little
goodwill. lt works itself out.

1291
01:48:35,886 --> 01:48:39,356
Listen, there are nearly a
million Jews in Germany.

1292
01:48:39,446 --> 01:48:42,722
What are they going to
do? Kill all of us?

1293
01:48:49,446 --> 01:48:55,282
Karl, if you will excuse me. l want
to dance with a most charming lady.

1294
01:49:02,366 --> 01:49:04,721
Might l have the honor
of this dance?

1295
01:49:33,206 --> 01:49:35,356
- l want you to give me some
money or l will kill you.

1296
01:49:35,446 --> 01:49:37,118
Are you out of your mind?

1297
01:49:38,046 --> 01:49:40,879
- l will kill you. - Johann!
That's God's judgment.

1298
01:49:40,966 --> 01:49:42,365
l don't want to hear that anymore.

1299
01:49:42,446 --> 01:49:44,801
Don't you think l know
how you've treated me?

1300
01:49:44,886 --> 01:49:47,116
Don't you think l know
how you've cheated me?

1301
01:49:47,966 --> 01:49:50,719
Where is it? Where's the money?

1302
01:49:50,806 --> 01:49:52,125
Top drawer.

1303
01:50:02,206 --> 01:50:03,355
Come in.

1304
01:50:07,206 --> 01:50:08,559
l have money.

1305
01:50:16,446 --> 01:50:17,720
Come here.

1306
01:50:18,366 --> 01:50:19,640
Come on.

1307
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:26,724
Put out my cigarette.

1308
01:50:44,046 --> 01:50:45,195
Tell me..

1309
01:50:46,286 --> 01:50:48,641
..am l your very first girl?

1310
01:50:50,886 --> 01:50:54,799
You are shaking. There is
nothing to be afraid of.

1311
01:51:01,806 --> 01:51:02,955
No.

1312
01:51:16,286 --> 01:51:17,639
The first time..

1313
01:51:20,806 --> 01:51:23,274
The first time is very important.

1314
01:52:09,366 --> 01:52:12,642
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1315
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:14,284
l'm just teaching the
young lady flamenco.

1316
01:52:14,366 --> 01:52:16,277
You keep your hands
off her, you pimp.

1317
01:52:23,166 --> 01:52:24,645
Big hero.

1318
01:52:51,646 --> 01:52:53,125
l'm sorry.

1319
01:53:21,126 --> 01:53:24,277
l don't believe you're quite
sober, Mrs. Treadwell.

1320
01:53:26,806 --> 01:53:30,196
What could give you that impression?

1321
01:53:42,646 --> 01:53:46,036
God. He stalks them
like a mountain lion.

1322
01:53:47,286 --> 01:53:49,720
Did you see the makeup
on those girls?

1323
01:53:50,646 --> 01:53:55,117
- Do men really find that
attractive? - Some apparently do.

1324
01:53:58,286 --> 01:54:02,199
l would think that men
would like to know..

1325
01:54:02,886 --> 01:54:04,365
..what they were kissing.

1326
01:54:12,046 --> 01:54:14,640
l would like to know what
it is like to kiss you.

1327
01:54:28,806 --> 01:54:31,559
l have been looking at you,
thinking about you for a long time.

1328
01:54:31,646 --> 01:54:33,284
You never notice me. Why not?

1329
01:54:34,126 --> 01:54:35,957
Now you will not kiss me? Why not?

1330
01:54:36,966 --> 01:54:38,638
Do you want me to say l love you?

1331
01:54:38,726 --> 01:54:40,205
l never knew what people
meant by that word.

1332
01:54:40,286 --> 01:54:42,720
Say, don't say it. l can't
bear the sound of it.

1333
01:54:42,886 --> 01:54:45,958
Then why did you lead
me on during the trip?

1334
01:54:47,766 --> 01:54:50,883
You never considered my
feelings at all, did you?

1335
01:54:52,206 --> 01:54:53,639
No.

1336
01:54:54,566 --> 01:54:55,965
And l'm sorry for that.

1337
01:54:57,286 --> 01:55:01,723
Mrs. Treadwell, l'm only a third-grade
officer on a second-rate ship.

1338
01:55:01,806 --> 01:55:04,195
But it has given me an opportunity
to observe people.

1339
01:55:04,286 --> 01:55:06,561
l've seen women like you before.

1340
01:55:06,646 --> 01:55:09,956
Forty-six-year-old women
who are still coquettes.

1341
01:55:10,046 --> 01:55:13,721
They travel on boats often. Always
searching for something.

1342
01:55:14,046 --> 01:55:16,116
Do you know where that searching
ends Mrs. Treadwell?

1343
01:55:16,206 --> 01:55:19,198
lt ends by sitting in a nightclub
with a paid escort..

1344
01:55:19,286 --> 01:55:21,356
..who tells you the
lies you must hear.

1345
01:55:24,166 --> 01:55:27,636
You are a most mundane,
ordinary man.

1346
01:55:30,766 --> 01:55:33,360
How extraordinary that
a man like you..

1347
01:55:33,646 --> 01:55:36,160
..should be saying things
like this to me.

1348
01:55:40,726 --> 01:55:41,954
Probably true.

1349
01:55:48,886 --> 01:55:52,196
l think this evening's festivities
have come to an end.

1350
01:55:54,886 --> 01:55:58,356
- l shall be happy to see you to
your door. - lt's quite unnecessary.

1351
01:56:00,126 --> 01:56:01,718
l'll find my own way.

1352
01:56:34,046 --> 01:56:36,116
- Darling? - Yeah Leiben.

1353
01:56:36,206 --> 01:56:39,198
l didn't know there
was a Frau Rieber.

1354
01:56:41,206 --> 01:56:43,356
What do you mean, a Frau Rieber?

1355
01:56:43,446 --> 01:56:46,643
The purser told me you sent
a cable to Frankfurt..

1356
01:56:46,726 --> 01:56:48,956
..addressed to a Frau Rieber.

1357
01:56:49,566 --> 01:56:52,717
l did not mention it before, because
l could not bear the humiliation.

1358
01:56:52,806 --> 01:56:56,162
lt is the tragedy of my life.
She will not let me go.

1359
01:56:56,246 --> 01:56:58,714
l must go on supporting her
and the three children.

1360
01:56:58,806 --> 01:57:00,717
There are three children?

1361
01:57:00,966 --> 01:57:02,558
Well they have no understanding
of me.

1362
01:57:02,646 --> 01:57:04,125
And l have no understanding of them.

1363
01:57:04,206 --> 01:57:08,358
They hang on. They hang on. They
suck the life's blood out of me.

1364
01:57:08,446 --> 01:57:10,641
They will not let go.
They will not let go.

1365
01:57:10,886 --> 01:57:13,639
l am a vital, passionate man.

1366
01:57:13,766 --> 01:57:17,202
l need love. l must have love.

1367
01:57:17,646 --> 01:57:21,559
Say you understand.
You must understand.

1368
01:57:21,646 --> 01:57:23,204
l understand.

1369
01:57:29,366 --> 01:57:32,164
Now, look, l bought you
a bottle of champagne, right?

1370
01:57:32,286 --> 01:57:33,958
A pack of them Sultana cigarettes..

1371
01:57:34,046 --> 01:57:35,559
..or whatever they are called
and two margaritas.

1372
01:57:35,646 --> 01:57:37,125
When are we gonna get together?

1373
01:57:37,206 --> 01:57:39,800
You have been drinking too much.
l think l will go now.

1374
01:57:40,646 --> 01:57:44,275
- Tonight. - Not tonight.
Tonight l am tired.

1375
01:57:44,366 --> 01:57:45,719
Tonight.

1376
01:57:47,766 --> 01:57:50,724
Very well. Just let go of my arm.

1377
01:57:52,806 --> 01:57:55,639
Hey. What's your cabin number?

1378
01:57:57,646 --> 01:57:59,204
Number 14.

1379
01:58:03,766 --> 01:58:06,280
l thought you weren't bothering
with that cheapskate.

1380
01:58:06,366 --> 01:58:09,563
l have planned something very
interesting for that cheapskate.

1381
01:58:09,646 --> 01:58:14,117
l gave him the cabin of that snotty
American bitch, Mrs. Treadwell.

1382
02:00:23,126 --> 02:00:24,718
l think you are mad.

1383
02:00:25,286 --> 02:00:29,199
l made some inquiries. They would
let me stay on the island.

1384
02:00:29,886 --> 02:00:31,638
l would be able to take care of her.

1385
02:00:32,046 --> 02:00:34,719
l understand your feeling about
her, her helplessness.

1386
02:00:34,806 --> 02:00:38,037
- But to give up everything.
- What would l be giving up?

1387
02:00:39,566 --> 02:00:41,716
- What would l be giving
up? - Your life!

1388
02:00:41,806 --> 02:00:44,957
My life. My life is obligations.

1389
02:00:45,646 --> 02:00:47,955
Obligation to nothing
that's real to me.

1390
02:00:48,286 --> 02:00:51,358
This woman.. this woman over there
in the cabin, she's real to me.

1391
02:00:51,446 --> 02:00:53,562
l know it sounds strange.

1392
02:00:54,206 --> 02:00:57,118
But she's the only real thing
that has happened to me.

1393
02:00:57,206 --> 02:00:59,879
Willy you have heard of shipboard
romances, haven't you?

1394
02:00:59,966 --> 02:01:02,116
She's sold you a bill of goods,
and you've fallen for it.

1395
02:01:02,206 --> 02:01:06,165
My god. l can see it if you can't.
She wants her precious needle.

1396
02:01:06,246 --> 02:01:08,555
- She doesn't want you.
- This may be true.

1397
02:01:09,566 --> 02:01:11,045
lf this is true..

1398
02:01:14,886 --> 02:01:18,117
When l had my heart attack,
there was a dream l had.

1399
02:01:19,206 --> 02:01:22,960
You can talk about death. l've
seen it many times as a doctor.

1400
02:01:23,886 --> 02:01:26,958
But you never know what it's like
until it almost happens to you.

1401
02:01:31,566 --> 02:01:33,796
l dreamed l had already died.

1402
02:01:35,366 --> 02:01:39,041
l dreamed l was in a box. The sweat
broke out all over my body.

1403
02:01:40,726 --> 02:01:45,197
l wanted to cry out, l can't
be dead, l haven't lived!

1404
02:01:47,886 --> 02:01:49,035
Who has?

1405
02:01:50,726 --> 02:01:53,115
Do you think this woman
is the answer, Willie?

1406
02:01:53,286 --> 02:01:56,278
A woman like this. All
she's been through.

1407
02:01:56,366 --> 02:01:59,358
She has seen everything. There
are no surprises left for her.

1408
02:02:01,726 --> 02:02:07,198
Even if it's love, Willie, l hope we
can deny the myth that love lasts.

1409
02:02:17,806 --> 02:02:21,355
You are not young, Mrs. Treadwell.

1410
02:02:22,566 --> 02:02:26,036
You have not been young for years.

1411
02:02:32,646 --> 02:02:37,640
Behind those old eyes, you
hide a 16-year-old heart.

1412
02:02:39,126 --> 02:02:40,639
Poor fool.

1413
02:02:45,966 --> 02:02:49,356
ls that what men really
find attractive?

1414
02:03:11,206 --> 02:03:12,559
Baby..

1415
02:03:14,286 --> 02:03:17,164
You just haven't managed to grow up.

1416
02:03:18,046 --> 02:03:23,359
Mrs. Treadwell of Murray
Hill, Virginia.

1417
02:03:25,646 --> 02:03:26,965
Now!

1418
02:03:29,286 --> 02:03:31,880
You can paint your toenails green.

1419
02:03:38,206 --> 02:03:40,720
You know how it ends, don't you?

1420
02:03:43,206 --> 02:03:44,639
Alone.

1421
02:03:47,126 --> 02:03:48,718
Sitting in a cafe..

1422
02:03:50,286 --> 02:03:52,641
..with a paid escort.

1423
02:04:13,806 --> 02:04:15,034
Let me go.

1424
02:04:16,646 --> 02:04:17,965
Let me go.

1425
02:04:29,806 --> 02:04:31,364
Mrs. Treadwell.

1426
02:04:33,806 --> 02:04:38,721
Excuse me. That greaser told
me Cabin 14. Excuse me.

1427
02:04:39,566 --> 02:04:40,965
Excuse me.

1428
02:04:41,886 --> 02:04:43,035
Get out!

1429
02:04:44,366 --> 02:04:45,640
Get out!

1430
02:04:50,126 --> 02:04:51,559
Get out!

1431
02:04:52,806 --> 02:04:55,559
You know l'm sorry, l truly am
sorry. l didn't know it l was just..

1432
02:04:55,646 --> 02:04:58,114
- Pig! - Hey, what the hell?

1433
02:04:58,206 --> 02:05:02,165
Go on. Get out. Get out. Get out!

1434
02:05:03,366 --> 02:05:04,640
Get out!

1435
02:05:06,646 --> 02:05:11,356
Get out. Get out. No! No!

1436
02:05:46,566 --> 02:05:49,364
- You were sleeping. - l know.

1437
02:05:53,646 --> 02:05:55,045
You cried out again.

1438
02:05:57,566 --> 02:05:58,965
Did l?

1439
02:06:00,446 --> 02:06:01,720
What is it?

1440
02:06:02,046 --> 02:06:03,195
lt's nothing.

1441
02:06:07,566 --> 02:06:10,558
- lt had to be something.
- lt was ridiculous.

1442
02:06:17,286 --> 02:06:18,639
Tell me.

1443
02:06:26,206 --> 02:06:27,639
Promise you won't laugh.

1444
02:06:28,966 --> 02:06:30,115
l won't laugh.

1445
02:06:32,646 --> 02:06:34,637
lt's something l saw the
time l went to Taxco.

1446
02:06:34,726 --> 02:06:36,876
lt was just a flash passing
by on the bus.

1447
02:06:37,366 --> 02:06:40,119
lt was a man and a woman. A crowd
had gathered around them.

1448
02:06:40,206 --> 02:06:43,721
They were staggering and swaying.
l thought they were dancing.

1449
02:06:45,046 --> 02:06:48,038
The man had his hand raised and
there was a long knife in it.

1450
02:06:48,206 --> 02:06:51,198
The woman's breast and
stomach were pierced.

1451
02:06:51,286 --> 02:06:53,720
The blood was so thick her skirt
was sticking to her legs.

1452
02:06:54,566 --> 02:06:56,636
She was beating him with a stone.

1453
02:06:59,886 --> 02:07:02,719
l'll never forget the
look on their faces.

1454
02:07:04,206 --> 02:07:05,958
lt wasn't all hatred.

1455
02:07:06,366 --> 02:07:11,281
lt was like there was some great
bond between them in that hatred.

1456
02:07:13,966 --> 02:07:16,116
And then they struck again.

1457
02:07:20,046 --> 02:07:24,278
l always dream about it in
some grotesque variation.

1458
02:07:25,286 --> 02:07:29,802
Tonight l was one of the watchers,
as if l were at a play.

1459
02:07:32,886 --> 02:07:34,365
Then something happened.

1460
02:07:42,646 --> 02:07:46,036
- What happened? - The
features changed.

1461
02:07:48,206 --> 02:07:49,639
Yeah?

1462
02:07:51,046 --> 02:07:53,162
David, the faces were
yours and mine.

1463
02:08:02,046 --> 02:08:03,365
Good evening, doctor.

1464
02:08:14,886 --> 02:08:16,160
Night, doctor.

1465
02:10:02,566 --> 02:10:05,638
Thank you for bringing
us home, 'capitan. '

1466
02:10:05,806 --> 02:10:09,355
The cuisine and the accommodations
were superb.

1467
02:10:11,806 --> 02:10:13,364
Yeah!

1468
02:10:35,966 --> 02:10:37,285
They've come for me?

1469
02:10:43,646 --> 02:10:45,955
For me, the voyage is over.

1470
02:10:48,566 --> 02:10:50,045
l have here an order..

1471
02:10:51,126 --> 02:10:54,118
..for something that will help
you. Any doctor will accept it.

1472
02:11:12,806 --> 02:11:16,958
Willie.. you try so hard.

1473
02:11:28,886 --> 02:11:32,196
My darling. My love.

1474
02:11:35,366 --> 02:11:39,882
For once, let's kiss
in broad daylight.

1475
02:11:58,286 --> 02:11:59,639
Bye.

1476
02:13:58,115 --> 02:14:02,108
l think we ought to be able to
reach Bremerhaven by Thursday morning.

1477
02:14:07,475 --> 02:14:10,785
Willie, you're drinking
up my best cognac.

1478
02:14:11,795 --> 02:14:15,629
Not that l mind, but that isn't the
thing you should be doing, is it?

1479
02:14:16,115 --> 02:14:17,867
You shouldn't be doing this.

1480
02:14:20,115 --> 02:14:23,994
l know you're still thinking about
her. She'll be all right.

1481
02:14:25,035 --> 02:14:28,550
By now l.. l'll guarantee she's
found someone to help her.

1482
02:14:28,635 --> 02:14:31,547
- Woman like that always
finds someone. - Shut up!

1483
02:14:49,875 --> 02:14:51,024
Willie.

1484
02:14:52,635 --> 02:14:56,105
That's a hell of a way to
waste good brandy, Willie.

1485
02:14:57,555 --> 02:15:00,547
When l think of the things
l've seen on this ship..

1486
02:15:01,035 --> 02:15:03,549
The stupid cruelties. The vanities.

1487
02:15:03,795 --> 02:15:07,185
We talk about values?
There's no values.

1488
02:15:07,715 --> 02:15:10,183
The dung we base our lives on.

1489
02:15:11,195 --> 02:15:14,790
She looked into the garbage dump.
She did something about it.

1490
02:15:15,595 --> 02:15:17,984
And we are the intelligent,
civilized people..

1491
02:15:18,075 --> 02:15:20,111
..who carry out orders we are given.

1492
02:15:20,395 --> 02:15:22,113
No matter what they may be.

1493
02:15:24,635 --> 02:15:27,547
Our biggest mission in life
is to avoid being fools.

1494
02:15:31,195 --> 02:15:33,550
And we wind up being the
biggest fools of all.

1495
02:15:34,635 --> 02:15:36,193
Why didn't l go?

1496
02:15:43,035 --> 02:15:44,468
Come in.

1497
02:15:45,795 --> 02:15:47,990
Herr doctor, Frau Lutz
wants to see you.

1498
02:15:48,075 --> 02:15:50,191
She say's her daughter Elsa
is not feeling well.

1499
02:15:51,715 --> 02:15:52,864
l'm coming.

1500
02:15:53,995 --> 02:15:56,190
To hell with them, Willie.
You rest here.

1501
02:15:56,275 --> 02:15:58,550
You don't look well. You should
see the way you look.

1502
02:16:14,115 --> 02:16:16,106
That is exactly what l mean.

1503
02:16:20,875 --> 02:16:22,388
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Good evening.

1504
02:16:22,475 --> 02:16:25,547
- You called me? - Doctor,
can you give Elsa a purge?

1505
02:16:31,195 --> 02:16:33,868
Take two of those before you retire.

1506
02:16:34,195 --> 02:16:36,868
Doctor, aren't you going
to take her temperature?

1507
02:16:45,475 --> 02:16:47,193
l think he's been drinking.

1508
02:22:02,555 --> 02:22:07,788
l can just hear you saying, What
has all this to do with us?

1509
02:22:10,275 --> 02:22:11,549
Nothing.

1510
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:24,000
