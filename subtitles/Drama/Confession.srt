ONE YEAR LATER

6
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:23,604
Everything will feel unfamiliar
since his memories aren't back.

7
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:27,774
He may experience migraines
or dizziness for a while.

8
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:32,746
Take time with
rehab and therapy.

9
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:34,693
Then his conditions
will definitely improve.

10
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:48,663
What the heck?

11
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,750
MOTHER

12
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,687
Okay, Mother.

13
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:05,646
I love you, okay?

14
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,524
I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

15
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:53,694
I'll do it myself.

16
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:56,676
Since your arm hasn't healed,
I'll help you.

17
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:03,612
I'll be preparing dinner
Wash up first, okay?

18
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:24,625
- Welcome.
- Why are we meeting here?

19
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:27,794
You want kudzu tea, right?
One kudzu tea, please!

20
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:31,632
- What's with the name Arirang?
- Hey.

21
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:34,735
This is the only place
without CCTV

22
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:37,571
Get a new cell phone.

23
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:41,575
It's hard to get in touch with
you because of your phone.

24
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,543
When I catch this culprit...

25
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:47,714
I'll get a new one
and even get you one too.

26
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:50,821
Forget it. I'm busy,
so I have to go now.

27
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,791
Are you on night duty again?

28
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:58,826
Here's your kudzu tea.

29
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:02,637
Mn Lee, who's this guy?

30
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,699
He's Lee Night Duty.

31
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,613
Wow, your name is Night Duty?

32
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:18,578
Man, you silly boy.

33
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:22,616
- Hey, is it really accurate?
- Yes.

34
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:23,721
Are you sure we can trust it?

35
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:32,537
Go on your night duty.
You silly boy.

36
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:30,525
Honey, are you okay? Honey?

37
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:52,672
Go to sleep. You must be tired.

38
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,619
It's nice to have you back.

39
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:26,686
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE
DON'T BLOCK THE SUN

40
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,634
PRODUCED BY YOO SANG-WOO

41
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:27,617
It's okay.

42
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,586
It's okay.

43
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:40,627
Most plays have an emphasis
on our psychological state.

44
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:42,733
THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT
IS LOOKING FOR A NEW TA.

45
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:45,665
Due to this aspect
of Greek plays

46
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:50,666
Psychoanalytic terms such as
the Oedipus or Electra complex

47
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:54,708
are used to explain
psychological states.

48
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,677
Don't you think the Greeks
considered the gods

49
00:11:57,678 --> 00:12:00,647
not as special
or superior beings...

50
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:02,749
but as beings similar to humans?

51
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,630
The gods in Greek mythology
are unpredictable...

52
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:16,696
What brings you here?

53
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:18,574
I wanted to have lunch with you.

54
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,652
President Yoo Sang-woo was
released from the hospital.

55
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:37,729
Already?

56
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,822
He was released
much earlier than I expected.

57
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:45,525
He must have recovered quickly.

58
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:46,630
That's fortunate.

59
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,764
But his memories
haven't come back yet.

60
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:51,766
Is that so?

61
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:59,650
That's unfortunate. I hope
his memories come back soon.

62
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,694
Are you okay?

63
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:21,569
Doctor.

64
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:26,508
When I arrived here
after the accident...

65
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:28,802
How was I?

66
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:31,613
You were in critical condition.

67
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:35,575
You had many fractures and
your face was severely damaged.

68
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:38,580
There wasn't much
information. It was barely...

69
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:43,720
It's a miracle you survived,
Mn Yoo Sang-woo!

70
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:47,654
I don't think
I'll need it anymore.

71
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:49,566
Thank you.

72
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:55,628
- Hang in there, Mn Yoo.
- Yes, Sin

73
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,609
- Make it neat.
- Okay.

74
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,644
It's already been three years
since we took that.

75
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:13,488
Do you remember then?

76
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:16,491
Do you want to see these?

77
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:26,789
This is Beach Saka.
This is where...

78
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:31,794
I remember Russian tourists
asked you to sing for them.

79
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,603
This is where the monkeys were.

80
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:39,539
I was going to feed them.

81
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,775
But the king monkey
stole the food.

82
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:44,687
I remember that.

83
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,616
You still don't remember?

84
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:10,532
Lift it up.

85
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,570
Try a little harden

86
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:22,645
Hold it there.

87
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:32,521
How was it?
I was surprised.

88
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:36,582
Goodness!

89
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,718
Keep pulling until the end.

90
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:41,487
Keep it there. That's it.

91
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:43,723
Pull it again,
and hold it at the end.

92
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:44,794
There you go.

93
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:05,553
Two, three.

94
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:12,652
Eat steamed ribs in the fridge
instead of eating ramen.

95
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:14,454
I'll be back before dinner.

96
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:15,763
Let me know
if you need anything.

97
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,569
- Okay.
- I'll be off.

98
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,532
No!

99
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,652
Honey, I'm home!

100
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:29,719
President Yoo!

101
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:38,592
President Yoo!

102
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:43,829
- What is this?
- It's your jacket.

103
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,731
I see, thank you.

104
00:21:45,732 --> 00:21:47,633
Do you know where it is?

105
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:50,581
- I'll find it.
- Do you want me to go with you?

106
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:54,707
You must have gained weight.
You used to wear it.

107
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,688
I guess the hospital
is comfortable.

108
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:59,578
I'm sorry for
asking you to do this.

109
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,747
Well, it's okay.

110
00:22:01,748 --> 00:22:03,625
I'll take this jacket back.

111
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:14,731
BUSINESS LICENSE

112
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,532
You have another phone
under your company's name.

113
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,740
Do you still want to
open up a new account?

114
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,648
Yes.

115
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,775
- Welcome.
- A strawberry smoothie, please.

116
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:32,780
One strawberry smoothie?
That's 4,900 won.

117
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,615
- Is it for here?
- Yes.

118
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:37,720
I received 10,000 won.

119
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:03,678
Darn it, what are you doing?
Call me back now.

120
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:15,588
How could you do this? Are
you settling with the deposit?

121
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:18,695
Since you saw the photos,
you need to call me back.

122
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:22,731
Let me know how much
longer I must wait.

123
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,770
I'm too angry to work today.

124
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:34,774
Don't disappear again like this.
You made a promise.

125
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:38,655
I have my ways
of finding you, got it?

126
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:38,741
President Yoo.

127
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:48,582
President Yoo.

128
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:53,752
The rehearsal's ready to go.
You can come down now.

129
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:55,824
I'll be right down.

130
00:24:58,592 --> 00:25:02,828
Excuse me, President.
Don't treat me like a stranger.

131
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:05,605
You can treat me
like you used to.

132
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,703
I'll get used to it
as time passes.

133
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,526
Sang-woo!

134
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,670
You came back to work.

135
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:38,697
You look even
healthier than before.

136
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:39,699
Mi-hyun!

137
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:44,803
What's the secret?

138
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:46,784
How do you keep his body so fit?

139
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:53,716
Professor Seo.

140
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:55,718
Hello.

141
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,684
Professor Seo,
it's time for your meeting.

142
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:00,653
Tell them to wait.

143
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:03,589
It was really difficult
to get the time slot.

144
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,659
- I had to beg them.
- I told you to wait.

145
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,540
Okay, I'll go there first
and wait for you.

146
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:16,739
Sang-woo, you should
come since you're back.

147
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:52,538
You can live as if
you've been born again.

148
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:57,539
Everyone has memories
they'd rather forget.

149
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:00,779
For example...

150
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,555
anyway-

151
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:06,593
Some memories
are better forgotten.

152
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:14,660
I could probably write
a dissertation on your case.

153
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:17,608
It's not easy to find
a case like yours.

154
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:20,670
Well, okay.

155
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:24,637
There are things
he should be careful with.

156
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:27,778
I don't want to put
too much pressure on him.

157
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:35,514
- I'm okay.
- Honey.

158
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:38,717
You promised. You can't say
you can't remember later

159
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:40,753
That's enough.

160
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:43,598
What? He said he'd do it.

161
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:51,737
Sang-woo, do you want
to go for a smoke?

162
00:27:55,769 --> 00:28:00,769
You have to give me
the goods before I can pay you!

163
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:01,809
What on earth!

164
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:06,620
What, call the police?

165
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:25,709
You really don't remember?

166
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:31,537
Really?

167
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:35,507
I'm jealous that
you can start oven

168
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:36,646
Mi-hyun.

169
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:41,592
What kind of person was I?

170
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:45,684
What kind of person were you?

171
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:48,598
What kind of person
was Yoo Sang-woo?

172
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:52,795
He's someone who forgot
what he wanted to lose.

173
00:28:56,696 --> 00:29:00,610
Do you want me to tell you
what kind of person you were?

174
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:14,713
We all pretend we don't
know what we know.

175
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:16,660
You aren't any different.

176
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,562
I'm going home.

177
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:46,612
Honey, come in and have lunch.

178
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,650
What are you doing?

179
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:10,681
Honey, are you okay?

180
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:17,554
- You're sweating so much.
- No!

181
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:23,685
I had a nightmare.

182
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:27,755
- Would you like some water?
- No.

183
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:31,569
I'll go wash my face.

184
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,527
If we analyze it further...

185
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:38,630
we fear that we're no
longer worthy of love

186
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,667
someone who's worth being loved.

187
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:44,770
The attempt to hide
or ignore the fear

188
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,842
can lead to obsession.

189
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:54,623
Obsession makes
self-growth impossible.

190
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:42,604
You must have been surprised
that I asked you to meet me.

191
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,668
No, I was going to
call you anyway.

192
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:54,675
Aren't you surprised that
I chose a place like this?

193
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:01,786
Actually, I have
something to ask you.

194
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:04,817
What is it?

195
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,756
I feel confused
about everything.

196
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:12,628
I want to know the truth.

197
00:32:13,693 --> 00:32:15,798
But I can't remember a thing.

198
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:20,699
So...

199
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,801
Do you want to ask
about Yoon-hee?

200
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:25,604
Want to ask me about Yoon-hee?

201
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:27,812
I heard I neglected my wife.

202
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:30,809
You neglect Yoon-hee?

203
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,586
Not the other way around?

204
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:40,822
You haven't heard
about another man?

205
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,667
I'm talking about Kim Hyun-min.

206
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,770
Were Yoon-hee and Hyun-min
seeing each other?

207
00:32:57,637 --> 00:33:01,779
I don't know exactly.

208
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:08,780
But everyone suspected it.

209
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:11,660
Including you.

210
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:31,604
Do you know I'm also part of
the memories you've lost?

211
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,623
You had a hard time
because of Yoon-hee.

212
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:49,621
Even when you were
lying in bed...

213
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:51,624
"or having sex with hen"

214
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:56,828
you said you didn't know
who she was anymore.

215
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:59,742
You said she didn't feel
like she was your woman.

216
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,505
Mi-hyun.

217
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:09,783
I'm not sure what you're
thinking, but please stop.

218
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:14,613
What I'm thinking?

219
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:19,614
What were you thinking
when you were with me?

220
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:25,759
Is everything over just because
your memories are gone?

221
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,519
What were you thinking
when you were with me?

222
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:03,639
Is everything over just because
your memories are gone?

223
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,526
You still don't remember?

224
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:40,567
Hold on.

225
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:42,645
Drink this.

226
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,545
Thank you.

227
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:51,710
Darn it, I finally found you.

228
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:54,749
Wow, this tracking
system is great.

229
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,688
Long time no see.

230
00:36:00,653 --> 00:36:01,688
Do you know me?

231
00:36:05,558 --> 00:36:07,595
You lost your memories?

232
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:13,740
Wow, I thought that only
happened on TV shows.

233
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:16,636
That's what I thought.

234
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:24,505
So you wanted to start anew
after losing your memories.

235
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,779
I shouldn't have sent
those photos to you.

236
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,684
I thought you were avoiding me
so you wouldn't have to pay!

237
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:36,565
This world is full of scumbags.

238
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:41,628
I'm getting more upset
the more I think about it!

239
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,611
Anyway, we met.

240
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:56,686
On top of amnesia,
you were in an explosion?

241
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:04,683
Okay, fine.

242
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:08,620
You didn't request
anything special.

243
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:13,525
You asked me to find out
what your wife's been up to.

244
00:37:13,526 --> 00:37:17,736
You wanted photos of when
she's with Kim Hyun-min.

245
00:37:19,565 --> 00:37:23,468
What's the big deal
with having an affair?

246
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:27,679
Is there anyone who's
completely honest these days?

247
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:35,521
- You also had an affair.
- Pardon me?

248
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,584
Forget about that.

249
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:42,629
I have more photos.

250
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:46,524
Wait, here.

251
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,660
They're on my phone.

252
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:51,665
Why is it always out of battery?

253
00:37:56,569 --> 00:38:01,569
Anyway, I have them.

254
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:03,553
Also, this is my business card.

255
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:06,521
I'll get going now.

256
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:08,513
And...

257
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:12,484
the remaining balance.

258
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:14,519
Pay it all at once.

259
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,560
If you avoid me again,
I'm going to get you.

260
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,748
You come here often these days.

261
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:45,750
Where did you go
after taking time off?

262
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:48,687
I had to meet someone.

263
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:51,635
- Who?
- Just a friend.

264
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:17,591
Why don't you stop?

265
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:21,564
Wait, I'm almost there.

266
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:25,591
I said stop.

267
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:32,507
- Wait, wait a minute.
- Goodness.

268
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:39,773
I said stop it!

269
00:39:45,044 --> 00:39:48,048
LEE MIN-SIK

270
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:43,635
You probably don't know
how much I love you

271
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:46,640
and how happy I am right now.

272
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,609
Honey.

273
00:42:28,774 --> 00:42:33,587
I'm sorry but I have a headache.

274
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:51,596
He was severely injured.

275
00:42:51,597 --> 00:42:54,532
He had burns and fractures.
It's a miracle he survived.

276
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,635
Why did the car explode?
Was it really his car?

277
00:42:57,636 --> 00:43:01,778
It crashed into the guardrail,
so the engine exploded!

278
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,777
But I found something strange.

279
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:10,778
You said the case got closed
as a drunk driving case.

280
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,588
But it was still very strange.

281
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:18,623
- Here you go.
- Detective agencies...

282
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:20,626
can't make money with
average cases these days.

283
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:26,598
Is it a fraud case this time?

284
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,766
It could be adultery.

285
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:30,542
An affair?

286
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:36,608
- It suits you really well.
- Hey.

287
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:40,612
Affair cases bring in
the most money.

288
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:45,613
If you hadn't helped Yoon-gu,
you'd have his position.

289
00:43:45,784 --> 00:43:50,622
That's in the past.
Yoon-gu is my friend, you brat!

290
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:52,523
But it's still unfair.

291
00:43:52,524 --> 00:43:54,626
Yoon-gu is about to get promoted.

292
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:55,760
But you're spying on lovers.

293
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,570
Be quiet!

294
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:03,601
If you care about me so much,
why do you look down on my work?

295
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:07,572
It's because I miss you at work.

296
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:11,542
Stop talking nonsense.
Just give me the information

297
00:44:11,543 --> 00:44:13,745
Goodness, I can't!

298
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:17,649
I almost got in trouble for
tracking down Sang-woo.

299
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,619
But Yoon-gu helped me
while swearing at me.

300
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,723
Didn't I say he's my friend?
My friend, you brat!

301
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:26,725
My friend!

302
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:32,730
I'll get in serious
trouble this time!

303
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,711
It won't cause any trouble.

304
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:38,603
You drive me nuts.

305
00:44:38,604 --> 00:44:40,571
- Hey.
- What?

306
00:44:40,572 --> 00:44:42,607
Are you excluded from
promotion this time?

307
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:47,608
Employee without promotion.
They need people like me.

308
00:44:47,613 --> 00:44:49,781
You're talking nonsense.

309
00:44:49,782 --> 00:44:51,625
I'm leaving!

310
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:01,726
Did you meet
Sang-woo in private?

311
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:03,695
You're funny.

312
00:45:03,696 --> 00:45:05,763
You might think you
can cover up the past

313
00:45:05,764 --> 00:45:09,567
because Sang-woo
lost his memories.

314
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:12,670
- But you're mistaken.
- What you're doing...

315
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:14,639
is considered a crime.

316
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,609
You should take care of
your lover instead.

317
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,782
Where is he now?

318
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:26,584
Don't contact Sang-woo
from now on.

319
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:29,759
- Why should I listen to you?
- Really?

320
00:45:32,558 --> 00:45:35,660
Do whatever you want to, then.

321
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:37,663
But you'll regret it.

322
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:43,737
You ruined my life.

323
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:57,692
You ruined everything for me.

324
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:02,725
Only if you hadn't introduced me
to Professor Park...

325
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:14,635
I can't wait to find out
what you'll do.

326
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,685
Follow me.

327
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:42,660
Come in, come in.

328
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:44,800
Goodness,
it's a little messy in here.

329
00:46:47,566 --> 00:46:48,601
Sit down, sit down.

330
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:52,773
Wow.

331
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:57,708
What would you like to drink?
Coffee or green tea?

332
00:46:57,709 --> 00:46:59,586
No, I'm okay.

333
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:04,816
That book doesn't reveal
the character's name.

334
00:47:04,817 --> 00:47:09,687
It just goes on and
on about the girl...

335
00:47:09,688 --> 00:47:13,624
Who's the one
writing the letters?

336
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,627
The main character of
the novel, I mean.

337
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:17,732
Werther.

338
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:22,712
- What?
- That's the main character.

339
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,670
Werther! The main character!
I didn't catch that.

340
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:31,586
Right, it's Werther.

341
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,716
Wait, you're here
for the photos.

342
00:47:39,785 --> 00:47:41,526
Here you go.

343
00:47:57,803 --> 00:47:58,804
Take a look at them.

344
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:01,717
Yes, Mother.

345
00:48:03,709 --> 00:48:06,644
I will get it this month.

346
00:48:06,645 --> 00:48:11,482
Who's going to make a loan
out to me? I'll get it soon.

347
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:13,718
Yes, yes. I already ate.

348
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:16,687
I won't cause trouble.

349
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:20,625
I'm working right now, so I'll
call you later. Don't worry.

350
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,660
Mom, I love...

351
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:25,496
Hello?

352
00:48:25,497 --> 00:48:28,535
Why does she always
hang up on me?

353
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:37,542
Here you go.

354
00:48:41,513 --> 00:48:44,722
Shouldn't you know
everything to remember?

355
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:04,795
Where have you been?
I was so worried!

356
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:07,572
I was just getting
some fresh air.

357
00:50:23,782 --> 00:50:26,751
- I'll look for it.
- The target is on the move.

358
00:50:26,752 --> 00:50:28,753
- B3, A2 regions are clean
- Clean

359
00:50:28,754 --> 00:50:31,789
B2 and B3, be on the lookout.

360
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,600
- Yes, Sin
- We're moving now

361
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:38,796
- It's clean
- It's clean

362
00:50:38,797 --> 00:50:42,733
- It's clear here.
- There's nothing here.

363
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:44,736
- Okay.
- It's clean

364
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:49,840
It's clean There's nothing here.

365
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:52,843
Move now! Move! Hurry!

366
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:54,585
- Yes, Sin
- Hurry!

367
00:51:02,788 --> 00:51:07,788
- Hey, what is that?
- I'm a bean

368
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:13,564
- What did you find out?
- I'm not your assistant.

369
00:51:13,565 --> 00:51:15,533
What did you say?

370
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:18,803
We met up yesterday, too.

371
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:22,773
You need a warrant to view
someone's phone records.

372
00:51:22,774 --> 00:51:25,576
You read the newspaper,
don't you?

373
00:51:25,577 --> 00:51:28,612
The law regarding
personal information...

374
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:29,814
You idiot!

375
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:32,694
- Wait, wait!
- Why you!

376
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:38,633
Darn it! You silly brat!

377
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:45,696
That's why I'm asking
you, Detective Lee!

378
00:51:45,697 --> 00:51:48,769
- But...
- I'm asking you a favor!

379
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:52,803
Kim Hyun-min has been
reported missing.

380
00:51:52,804 --> 00:51:56,774
I don't care about that.
I need his phone records.

381
00:51:56,775 --> 00:52:01,775
Adultery cases are
all about evidence.

382
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,849
Follow the target around
and get some evidence.

383
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,620
Take some pictures and
you'll get paid, right?

384
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:12,623
This is a detective agency
run by a former detective.

385
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:14,758
Don't you know how
important differentiation is?

386
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:17,728
You should have worked
that hard as a detective.

387
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:21,665
If you do that for affair cases,
you won't last long!

388
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:25,769
Wait, wait. Yes, Sir?
I got it, I'll be right there.

389
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,607
- Wait a minute!
- You aren't going anywhere!

390
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:32,610
- Give me that!
- Wait just a little.

391
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,613
- What are you doing?
- Go!

392
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:38,649
- Run!
- Detective Lee!

393
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,721
- Good luck!
- Yes, Sir!

394
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:47,637
He's such a cute brat.

395
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,710
SPEEDING TICKET
KIM HYUN-MIN

396
00:53:37,576 --> 00:53:38,646
Excuse me, Sin

397
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:40,789
Yes?

398
00:53:42,547 --> 00:53:45,653
- Which apartment do you live in?
- Apartment 208.

399
00:53:47,652 --> 00:53:49,654
Excuse me.

400
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,559
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

401
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,663
Do you know anything about
the man living next door?

402
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:01,799
No, I don't know
anything in particular.

403
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,703
Have you ever had
a conversation with him?

404
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:10,474
We just say hello
when we see each other.

405
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:14,787
When was the last time
you saw him?

406
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:21,548
Well, maybe two days ago.

407
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:26,523
Three days ago?

408
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:28,595
Maybe a week ago?

409
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:34,632
- How was he then?
- He looked sick.

410
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:38,736
He had lost a lot of weight,
and he seemed tired.

411
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:42,606
I thought maybe he had
come back from a trip.

412
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:47,607
But why did he look so down?

413
00:54:47,646 --> 00:54:50,547
Are you sure it was him?

414
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:54,818
I heard something while
I was taking out the trash.

415
00:54:54,819 --> 00:54:59,819
- So, did you see him?
- Well...

416
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:01,792
you don't always
have to see to know.

417
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:07,607
- We're close neighbors...
- You didn't see him! Darn it.

418
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,743
Should you make a face?
You scared me!

419
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:22,684
What on earth? Goodness.

420
00:55:25,684 --> 00:55:29,598
Why do you ask
about the guy next door?

421
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:32,700
Did he do something wrong?

422
00:55:33,692 --> 00:55:35,638
Good bye!

423
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,799
Yes, Professor.
I gave you everything.

424
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,601
I told you there were
additional expenses...

425
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:47,674
Of course I trust you.

426
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,514
Excuse me!

427
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:55,813
A while ago,
an old lady came to visit.

428
00:55:55,814 --> 00:56:00,584
I can't do it for you
if you don't pay in advance.

429
00:56:00,585 --> 00:56:03,620
- Yes.
- Then she left right away.

430
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:08,621
- Okay?
- Why did you ask me?

431
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,730
I want to know the reason!

432
00:56:10,695 --> 00:56:15,695
My tears are falling
My heart yearns for you

433
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:23,670
There's no one else
in my life but you

434
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:34,620
I will love only you

435
00:56:41,793 --> 00:56:45,729
Let's not lose hope.

436
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:50,567
Even if tomorrow is
my last day...

437
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:55,568
Even if my spear pierces
my mother's heart...

438
00:56:55,607 --> 00:56:58,542
let's not fight.

439
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:02,582
This is the revenge
I take against my mother.

440
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:08,619
- Honey!
- What brings you here?

441
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,489
I came to say hello to
your colleagues on my way home.

442
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,630
Is that so?
The audition isn't over yet.

443
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:18,504
Mrs. Lee?

444
00:57:20,632 --> 00:57:23,600
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- Hello.

445
00:57:23,601 --> 00:57:26,570
You get prettier
every time I see you.

446
00:57:26,571 --> 00:57:27,638
Thank you.

447
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:30,707
- Is the audition over?
- We're taking a break.

448
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:34,511
Mr Producer,
they're looking for you.

449
00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:37,516
That's great. There's a place
I want to take you.

450
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:56,773

ON MARCH 3

457
00:59:56,588 --> 00:59:59,660
Honey, where are you?

458
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:42,568
What are you doing?
You scared me!

459
01:00:56,748 --> 01:01:01,748
I feel fine for a while,
but then my chest hurts.

460
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:05,567
It's like my heart is
being torn out by a knife.

461
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:22,502
Scene, fate cannot
ever be changed.

462
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:29,788
Fate refers to the tragic
reality we cannot change.

463
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:55,743
Come in.

464
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:02,553
Hello.

465
01:02:03,648 --> 01:02:04,752
Who are you?

466
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,517
I'm from Gangnam Police.

467
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:09,686
I have a few questions
to ask you.

468
01:02:09,687 --> 01:02:13,690
You know Kim Hyun-min, right?
He was a student here.

469
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:18,691
Yes, he was an assistant at
this department but not anymore.

470
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:23,696
When did he quit, exactly?

471
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:27,804
I think it was about
three months ago.

472
01:02:27,805 --> 01:02:31,608
He didn't exactly quit.
He just stopped coming.

473
01:02:31,609 --> 01:02:34,544
Could you find out
the exact date?

474
01:02:34,545 --> 01:02:35,580
Wait one moment.

475
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:45,622
It was December 5th,
the day before the final exam.

476
01:02:45,623 --> 01:02:47,758
How was he as a student?

477
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:52,562
He was a good student.
He was smart and hard-working.

478
01:02:52,563 --> 01:02:54,839
He was working hard
on his dissertation.

479
01:02:56,734 --> 01:03:01,671
Has Hyun-min ever
contacted you after he left?

480
01:03:01,672 --> 01:03:02,810
No, he hasn't.

481
01:03:04,575 --> 01:03:09,575
Do you know any of his
friends or acquaintances?

482
01:03:09,647 --> 01:03:13,789
Well, I'm not sure.
Which police station...

483
01:03:32,703 --> 01:03:34,614
Okay, I got it.

484
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:50,683
This is Lee Sang-wook from
the violent crimes department.

485
01:03:50,755 --> 01:03:54,524
Who's on night duty for traffic?

486
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:56,801
Okay, thank you.

487
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:06,799
Hello, Kang-seok?
Are you on night duty?

488
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:11,641
I'm on night duty, too.

489
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:12,642
Yes.

490
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:14,589
How is your baby?

491
01:04:16,647 --> 01:04:18,627
Of course.

492
01:04:20,518 --> 01:04:25,518
It's about December 3rd
of last year, on Tuesday.

493
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:32,574
Kim Hyun-min. Could you
send me the original photo?

494
01:04:33,598 --> 01:04:37,740
Okay, thank you.

495
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:45,577
Who knew affair cases
were so complicated?

496
01:05:15,506 --> 01:05:17,674
Aren't you working
too hard these days?

497
01:05:17,675 --> 01:05:20,554
You should extend your break.

498
01:05:21,712 --> 01:05:23,783
You haven't fully recovered yet.

499
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:30,650
I wish you wouldn't
be so impatient.

500
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:33,662
You can take your time at home.

501
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:42,568
Do you want me to...

502
01:05:44,535 --> 01:05:46,811
stay like this without
remembering anything?

503
01:05:50,574 --> 01:05:52,676
Never mind.

504
01:05:52,677 --> 01:05:55,783
It's just a thought
I've been having.

505
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:05,685
If my memories come back,
I might get more confused.

506
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:12,625
I wish you wouldn't
struggle so hard.

507
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:17,567
Whether you want to
remember or forget

508
01:06:17,568 --> 01:06:21,607
just let it happen naturally.

509
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:33,653
No.

510
01:06:42,693 --> 01:06:43,671
No.

511
01:07:32,543 --> 01:07:37,543
As I told you before,
Hyun-min went missing.

512
01:07:37,648 --> 01:07:42,648
But your wife continues
to visit his apartment.

513
01:07:42,686 --> 01:07:43,596
Okay.

514
01:07:46,524 --> 01:07:47,662
I don't understand.

515
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,732
I thought I gave her a hard time.

516
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,809
You of all people
shouldn't say that.

517
01:08:01,605 --> 01:08:05,747
It's nothing. My business is
only to get paid.

518
01:08:09,647 --> 01:08:12,649
- Are you married?
- No.

519
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:17,650
No woman wants to marry a guy
who has a single mother.

520
01:08:18,556 --> 01:08:23,528
Also, this job makes
me scared of marriage.

521
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:41,611
Loss of memory and an explosion.

522
01:08:41,612 --> 01:08:45,548
Kim Hyun-min disappeared.

523
01:08:45,549 --> 01:08:48,518
But Yoon-hee keeps visiting
Hyun-min's apartment...

524
01:08:48,519 --> 01:08:51,521
despite his disappearance.

525
01:08:51,522 --> 01:08:55,595
What if the guy is
in the apartment?

526
01:08:57,695 --> 01:09:02,610
Sang-woo, Mi-hyun
and Professor Park.

527
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:08,648
The ones who are highly educated
are dirtier than most!

528
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:15,641
Something definitely
smells fishy here.

529
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:21,580
Let's see, Hyun-min,
Sang-woo and Professor Park.

530
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:25,692
Hyun-min, Professor Park
and Sang-woo.

531
01:10:02,593 --> 01:10:05,767
- You can't stay here.
- Wait...

532
01:10:08,566 --> 01:10:11,601
- Just for a few minutes.
- Do what you need to do.

533
01:10:11,602 --> 01:10:12,706
Thank you.

534
01:10:15,673 --> 01:10:17,550
Goodness.

535
01:10:18,742 --> 01:10:23,580
Sang-woo,
I'm telling you as a man.

536
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:26,549
We don't know what will happen.

537
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:30,726
We should choose a location
to get definite proof, okay?

538
01:10:31,655 --> 01:10:35,592
Wow, you're quite big.

539
01:10:35,593 --> 01:10:36,697
Do you work out?

540
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,716
When a bowl cracks, blocking
the crack won't stop the flow.

541
01:10:50,574 --> 01:10:54,644
If you want,
you can end it here.

542
01:10:54,645 --> 01:10:58,648
What's the point of
revealing the dirty truth?

543
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:03,586
If you can't decide,
let's just go back.

544
01:11:03,587 --> 01:11:06,589
I need to talk to her about it.

545
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:09,525
If it's a misunderstanding...

546
01:11:09,526 --> 01:11:14,526
Even if it isn't, I want
to save my marriage.

547
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:18,568
I should confront hen

548
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:23,609
That's a good idea.
I also have something to check.

549
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,744
Why are you
so interested in this case?

550
01:11:27,745 --> 01:11:29,622
Isn't that...

551
01:11:39,623 --> 01:11:41,796
Darn it, I told him to wait.

552
01:12:11,655 --> 01:12:13,690
Please leave a message
after the beep...

553
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:15,762
after the beep...

554
01:12:29,673 --> 01:12:33,543
- Honey, why are you...
- What is this?

555
01:12:33,544 --> 01:12:35,785
- Let's go outside and talk.
- Move aside!

556
01:12:52,763 --> 01:12:54,764
Where is he?

557
01:12:54,765 --> 01:12:57,609
Where's that scum, Hyun-min?

558
01:13:07,611 --> 01:13:10,558
How long did you think
you'd be able to hide it?

559
01:13:12,616 --> 01:13:14,751
Were you afraid
I would remember?

560
01:13:14,752 --> 01:13:18,588
Is that why you kept
coming back to his house?

561
01:13:18,589 --> 01:13:20,623
Where is he?

562
01:13:20,624 --> 01:13:23,693
Where is Kim Hyun-min?

563
01:13:23,694 --> 01:13:27,797
I was hoping
you wouldn't find out.

564
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:30,733
Wouldn't find out what?

565
01:13:30,734 --> 01:13:31,804
What?

566
01:13:34,772 --> 01:13:37,807
He isn't here.

567
01:13:37,808 --> 01:13:40,652
Hyun-min isn't here anymore.

568
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:43,783
You...

569
01:13:45,783 --> 01:13:47,785
You killed him.

570
01:13:53,657 --> 01:13:57,605
That night,
with your bare hands...

571
01:14:01,632 --> 01:14:07,583
That night, Hyun-min got drunk
and came to our house.

572
01:14:10,574 --> 01:14:13,609
Hyun-min, why are you here?

573
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:15,678
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

574
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,481
I kept calling you!

575
01:14:18,482 --> 01:14:21,691
Hyun-min, stop it.
I told you it's oven

576
01:14:25,556 --> 01:14:26,756
Who says?

577
01:14:26,757 --> 01:14:30,728
I'm still in love with you!

578
01:14:32,629 --> 01:14:35,665
You're very drunk.
Go home.

579
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:36,736
Let me go!

580
01:14:38,535 --> 01:14:40,636
Where's your husband?

581
01:14:40,637 --> 01:14:42,638
Where's your husband, Sang-woo?

582
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:45,620
Hyun-min, please leave.

583
01:14:47,578 --> 01:14:48,811
- Move!
- Hyun-min, please!

584
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:51,581
- Come out now!
- Don't do this.

585
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:56,582
- Come out!
- Hyun-min, please leave.

586
01:14:56,587 --> 01:14:57,531
Please.

587
01:15:00,691 --> 01:15:03,759
Hyun-min!

588
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,639
Hyun-min, please don't do this.

589
01:15:24,515 --> 01:15:25,619
No.

590
01:15:44,768 --> 01:15:46,645
Honey...

591
01:16:14,631 --> 01:16:16,736
He's dead...

592
01:16:33,517 --> 01:16:35,758
Then, I got a call that
you were in an accident.

593
01:16:41,758 --> 01:16:42,793
This can't be.

594
01:16:44,761 --> 01:16:49,761
To protect you,
I planned everything perfectly.

595
01:16:50,701 --> 01:16:52,735
This can't be!

596
01:16:52,736 --> 01:16:59,779
I pretended Hyun-min is
still alive for your alibi.

597
01:17:02,613 --> 01:17:03,614
I...

598
01:17:08,585 --> 01:17:10,587
I killed Hyun-min?

599
01:17:30,507 --> 01:17:31,107
Why? Why?

600
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:38,718
Why didn't you tell me before?

601
01:17:42,519 --> 01:17:47,798
You might not remember,
but I'm still your wife.

602
01:17:54,665 --> 01:17:58,807
I thought your loss of memory
was our only chance.

603
01:18:00,737 --> 01:18:07,621
If I sacrifice myself,
you wouldn't know a thing.

604
01:18:22,492 --> 01:18:23,527
Darn it.

605
01:18:58,662 --> 01:19:02,508
It ran out of battery again!

606
01:19:09,506 --> 01:19:10,610
Hey.

607
01:19:12,642 --> 01:19:14,644
Sang-woo is acting strange.

608
01:19:16,646 --> 01:19:19,559
I didn't know who to call.

609
01:19:21,685 --> 01:19:23,665
Can you come over here?

610
01:19:25,756 --> 01:19:27,497
Yes.

611
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:30,627
Yes.

612
01:19:45,509 --> 01:19:47,511
Please pick up, you brat.

613
01:19:48,612 --> 01:19:51,593
Please leave a message
after the beep.

614
01:20:00,624 --> 01:20:02,797
Kang Yoon-gu.

615
01:20:10,634 --> 01:20:12,545
It's their loss!

616
01:20:14,504 --> 01:20:18,646
Fine, let's see
how far it will go.

617
01:20:21,645 --> 01:20:22,778
CONVERSATION OF DREAMS

618
01:20:22,779 --> 01:20:27,592
Please leave a message
after the beep...

619
01:21:28,812 --> 01:21:31,691
THE WORST SCUM

620
01:23:59,629 --> 01:24:00,699
Who are you?

621
01:24:03,633 --> 01:24:07,547
Where did you put the dead body?

622
01:24:08,738 --> 01:24:11,719
- The dead body?
- Where did you put it?

623
01:24:42,705 --> 01:24:49,782
Then, are you...

624
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:15,583
I said it's going to be okay.

625
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:23,545
I told you things will be okay.

626
01:25:23,546 --> 01:25:26,652
I told you I'd help you
fill in the lost memories.

627
01:25:28,585 --> 01:25:30,724
Why are you so curious?

628
01:25:32,722 --> 01:25:37,722
You should have left
everything up to me.

629
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:40,734
I was going to
make it all pretty.

630
01:25:43,533 --> 01:25:44,705
Who am I?

631
01:25:46,603 --> 01:25:47,809
Who am I?

632
01:25:52,809 --> 01:25:56,621
Who you are is not important.

633
01:25:59,582 --> 01:26:02,586
You just need
to be Yoo Sang-woo.

634
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:05,761
You still don't know?

635
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,585
No.

636
01:26:42,592 --> 01:26:43,593
Honey!

637
01:27:10,687 --> 01:27:11,688
No!

638
01:27:15,558 --> 01:27:16,559
No.

639
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,677
What have you done?

640
01:29:48,711 --> 01:29:51,780
You ruined everything.

641
01:29:51,781 --> 01:29:54,523
This is so upsetting.

642
01:29:59,789 --> 01:30:03,558
No, it's okay.

643
01:30:03,559 --> 01:30:08,559
It's okay. I can start over.

644
01:30:08,765 --> 01:30:13,578
It's okay. It's okay.

645
01:30:15,772 --> 01:30:17,718
It's okay.

646
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:44,700
Honey!

647
01:31:26,742 --> 01:31:31,742
Doctor Kim, you have an eye
transplant surgery at Room 7.

648
01:31:32,582 --> 01:31:34,823
Please come
to the operation room.

649
01:32:23,733 --> 01:32:28,733
Dear Sang-woo,
I heard you're in the hospital.

650
01:32:32,642 --> 01:32:37,642
I'm sorry for not
being able to protect you.

651
01:32:39,582 --> 01:32:43,655
Thank you for still being alive.

652
01:33:03,706 --> 01:33:06,687
YOO SANG-WOO

653
01:33:22,558 --> 01:33:25,630
Ae-kyung, it's time to eat!

654
01:33:26,696 --> 01:33:29,802
Honey,
does that CCTV still work?

655
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:35,538
Don't do that.
You could hurt the baby.

656
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:39,543
Min-soo, good boy.

657
01:33:58,628 --> 01:33:59,295
CONFESSION
