1
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,480
Every day there's more to tell

2
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
Dreaming, I'm little now

3
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,080
Fading away every passing day

4
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,160
And I just have
one thing to tell you

5
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,240
You're further
and further away...

6
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,320
I need more vocals,
I can't hear myself.

7
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,320
Guys, I have 8 more bands
to balance,

8
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,960
the competition starts in 3 hours.
Clear the stage.

9
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,920
Welcome to the Young Bands
Competition, here's the first band.

10
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,880
I can't leave now,
we haven't even performed yet.

11
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,560
So I'll do the song
and I'll come home,

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
I won't even wait for the results.
So take them with you!

13
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,440
But it's not my fault
they called you in.

14
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,680
Mom, I'm not coming.
You heard me.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,240
Let them fire you.
You heard me, I'm not coming.

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
Maya.
-Yoram, let me go.

17
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,320
There'll be other gigs.

18
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,920
Come on, Bahr,
come out already.

19
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,720
You know I have to go,
right?

20
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,120
But you'll take me
to kindergarten tomorrow?

21
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,560
I promised, didn't I?

22
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,000
Promise-promise?

23
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,640
Promise-promise-promise-promise.

24
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
Maya, I'm sorry.

25
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,920
I begged them
to find someone else.

26
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Do you want me
to get fired? Maya!

27
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,840
I hate you.

28
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Serves you right.

29
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,760
I love these
mother-daughter talks,

30
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,200
we should do it more often.
-Maya, I'm sorry.

31
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,120
Go to work, Mom,
lots of kids need you there.

32
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Bahri, what's the matter?

33
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
You couldn't fall asleep?

34
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,560
Come on, let's go to sleep.

35
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
Good evening, everybody.

36
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,600
This song was written by a girl
who's kind of strange,

37
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,480
she couldn't come to sing it tonight,
so I'll sing it instead of her.

38
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,840
Her name is Maya and the song
is called "Animated Movies".

39
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,360
She wrote it for her father.

40
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,840
Still have so much to say to you

41
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,520
Every day there's more to tell

42
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,080
Dreaming, I'm little now

43
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,800
Fading away every passing day...

44
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,920
Hey, Skeleton.
-Don't call me Skeleton, dummy.

45
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,680
Yair, you promised
you'd go back to schooI today.

46
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
Maya, don't touch the blinds.

47
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,760
Murderer. You just destroyed
millions of planets,

48
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,720
there must be life
on one of them.

49
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,320
You destroyed
entire civilizations.

50
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,280
Take your bones and get lost.

51
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,480
Life is here, Darwin,
on this planet.

52
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Yair, get up!

53
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,800
Leave me alone, Maya,
stop it! Fuck!

54
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,880
Get your frozen feet away
from me, I want to sleep.

55
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,360
Answer one little question
and I'm out of here.

56
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,800
There is no God,
there is no truth,

57
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,760
and there is no meaning to
your bony existence. -Great.

58
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,280
You little shit, why do I
always have to do everything?

59
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Cause you're older.

60
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,400
I had a gig last night,
my first gig.

61
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,280
WonderfuI.
How was it?

62
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,240
I don't know,
I wasn't there.

63
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,480
Mom was called to work,
you disappeared, as usual.

64
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
Remember we used
to read each other's thoughts?

65
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,200
You know what I'm
thinking right now?

66
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,520
I'm fuckin sick of you,
Yair, totally.

67
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,840
How could I have wet my bed
if I pee like an elephant?

68
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,240
You're the peeing champion,
you should be in the "Olympees".

69
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,880
Could be worse, right?
-Yes, it could be worse, really.

70
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm not washing my hair.
-OK.

71
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,480
And I'm not getting dressed till
Mommy comes.

72
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,640
You are too!

73
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,920
But I'm not going to kindergarten
till Mommy gets back, period.

74
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,440
Lie on your side.

75
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,880
Don't breathe in,
exhale slowly.

76
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,640
Breathe slowly.
Good, good.

77
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm not going till she gets back,
I'm not going till she gets back...

78
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,400
Get lost.

79
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,480
I'm not going
till she gets back...

80
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,200
You're such a pain.

81
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
Sisi, hi, it's Maya.

82
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,040
Fine, hanging in there.
Did Mom leave?

83
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,040
Yours is with mayo and avocado.
I have to talk to her.

84
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,120
Sisi, Mom didn't come
to take me!

85
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,600
Hello, Maya?
-Where are you?

86
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm late. What's going on?
-Nothing.

87
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,520
Bahr won't go till you get back,
Darwin went back to sleep,

88
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,920
Ido switched sheets with Bahr again,

89
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,680
and I'm late for school,
but it could be worse, right?

90
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,120
Right. Make sure they dress
warmly and make them sandwiches.

91
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,720
I already did.

92
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,640
Pick her up at four and fix dinner,
I'm on the night shift.

93
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,680
She won't go without you. -Let me
talk to her. Wait, Maya. -What?

94
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,400
Are you OK?

95
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,600
Do you hate me for yesterday?
You know I had no choice.

96
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
So you're OK?
-Everything's OK, Mom.

97
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,040
Did you eat something?
-Bahr...

98
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,000
Where's Bahr?
-In my pocket.

99
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,440
Bahr!

100
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,160
Bahr, open up!
-No!

101
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,400
Bahr, Mom wants to talk to you.
-Then she should come home.

102
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,440
Bahr! Open up right now!

103
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,680
Mom, she locked herself in.
She won't come out.

104
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,800
Mom, I'm late for schooI,
when can you come?

105
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
Maya, why are you yelling?

106
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,480
Maya, what happened?
-Why are you doing this?

107
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,760
Doing what?
-Idiot.

108
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,160
What do you want?
-Don't sound like Dad.

109
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,640
Make Bahr come out
and wait for me outside...

110
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,720
You won't make it. -I will,
and then I'm taking you to schooI.

111
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm going to work.

112
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
But Yair, you promised me.

113
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,600
I tried, it didn't work.
-What do you mean, you tried?

114
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,320
School only starts today.

115
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,520
Yair, I don't have time
to argue with you.

116
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
Let me talk to Ido.

117
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,240
Ido! -Dafna, why isn't anyone
in number five? -Five?

118
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
I'll go to five, she's mine.
-Thanks.

119
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
What do you want?

120
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,400
Are you OK, sweetie?
-I have a tummy ache.

121
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,320
You're just nervous,
it'll go away.

122
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,560
I told you
he wouldn't go back.

123
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,160
Ido, I promise
he'll go back to school today.

124
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,080
"Bahl", sweetheart,
is that you out there?

125
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,240
I'm locked inside
and can't get out.

126
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,160
I need help "despelately".

127
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
I love you. Bye

128
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,920
Do you know why I call you "Bahl"?

129
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,400
Because I can't say "R".

130
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,280
I'm locked inside
and I'm "leally despelate".

131
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,680
I'm so afraid.
So "vely, vely aflaid".

132
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,880
You said "afraid", with an R.
-Did not, did not.

133
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,920
Having fun out there?

134
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,920
Doesn't basketball
practice start today?

135
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
You said it, you said it!

136
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,640
Hey, Ido!

137
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,400
Gimme my hat!

138
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,560
Leave him alone!

139
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,120
Ouch, he bit me!

140
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,800
Ido, you little fucker,
we're gonna kill you.

141
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,240
Today?
I forgot all about it.

142
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
But we made an appointment,
didn't we?

143
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,680
How can I go like this?
Look at me, Sisi.

144
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,160
Sorry.
-Watch where you're going.

145
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,480
Sorry, I got off
at the wrong station.

146
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,280
Station? You mean floor.

147
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,920
What floor is this?
-The third!

148
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Mom said she'd come,
didn't she?

149
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,120
Yes, but we're
not talking to her.

150
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,280
Could be worse
than wetting my bed, right?

151
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,960
What do you mean?
It's great.

152
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,880
I try to wet my bed every night
but I can't do it. -Nonsense.

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,480
Bahr, don't you think I should
start getting serious?

154
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,440
I'm almost five and a half
and I don't have a degree.

155
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,160
You're totally screwed up.
I have drawings.

156
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,120
Abstract.

157
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
We'll have three tests,
two quizzes...

158
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,520
Good morning, Maya Ulman!
-Good morning.

159
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,520
If you know that it's morning,
then everything's fine.

160
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,160
Come on in,
summer vacation is over.

161
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,920
What a great way
to start the year.

162
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,760
Tell me about it.

163
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,760
What's up? -Gaga,
it's too early for questions.

164
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
Come on...

165
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,240
Shit!

166
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,400
What happened? Are you OK?
Are you hurt?

167
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,400
Show me where it hurts.
-I'm OK, I'm OK.

168
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,360
Why do you drive like that?
Can't you see it's dangerous?

169
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,720
Dangerous...

170
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,840
Aren't you a bit old for a scooter?
-It's not a scooter, it's a moped!

171
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,000
It's you again...

172
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,840
You're trying to kill me today.
-I'm sorry.

173
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,360
What? Don't worry, I'm OK.

174
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,000
It's my daughter's
first day at kindergarten,

175
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,000
I have to be there in 10 minutes
and I'll never make it.

176
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Do you have another helmet?

177
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,400
This scooter is nice, after all.

178
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,480
Are you new at the hospital?
-What?

179
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,320
How long have you been working
at the hospital?

180
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,960
I got back from California
a couple months ago.

181
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,960
Why did you leave there?
Did you murder somebody?

182
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,320
What?

183
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,120
Never mind.
Make a right.

184
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,680
Did we make it on time?
-Perfect.

185
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,600
Thank you very much.
Bye.

186
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,400
Excuse me...

187
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,000
Dafna.
-The coat.

188
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,720
Oh, your coat. Sorry.

189
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,800
Good night.

190
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,160
You're so smart,
you can learn so much.

191
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
Mom, I'm working.
Want to get me fired?

192
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
Look at yourself
in that stupid outfit.

193
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Do you want to grow up
to be a mouse?

194
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,280
What's wrong with being a mouse?

195
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm sick of your mice philosophy.

196
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,840
What's wrong with being
an ordinary person?

197
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,360
You're meeting the school counselor
in 20 minutes.

198
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
Dafna, relax.

199
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Don't call me Dafna,
I'm your mother!

200
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,120
Be nice to the counselor,
don't scare her.

201
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,600
Is that new lipstick?

202
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,720
Yair, I told you,
he just gave me a ride.

203
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,800
Mom, I know you,
you're going somewhere.

204
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I'm not going anywhere.
Don't be such a wise guy, OK?

205
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,160
I just wanted you to know that
it's totally OK if you are,

206
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,400
as far as I'm concerned.

207
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,800
Give me a kiss.
-Cool it, Mom.

208
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,360
Bye.

209
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,280
I won't ever do it again,
I promise, OK?

210
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
Iris...

211
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,440
What are you doing here?

212
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm not talking to you.

213
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,080
Yair Ulman?
Come on in.

214
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,680
Come on in.

215
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,840
Have a seat.

216
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,760
OK, I'm Flora, the new counselor.
I understand that

217
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,960
you were allowed
just to take exams last year

218
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,880
and now Pnina wants you to come back
to school on a regular basis, right?

219
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,560
I understand that you stopped
studying on a regular basis

220
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,960
nine months ago
following a crisis.

221
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,560
Do you want to talk
about it?

222
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Pnina also told me that you're
a great basketball player

223
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,120
and that you left
the school team as well.

224
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,680
Want some coffee?

225
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,640
You probably know that she thinks
you're not using your full potential.

226
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,280
What do you think about that?
-I don't.

227
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,400
But if you passed the exams
without going to school,

228
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,680
she must be right.

229
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,960
But if I get Bs without
going to school,

230
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,200
I must be using
my potential, right?

231
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,360
How can one not use
their full potential?

232
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,040
Look, why don't you tell
Pnina that everything's fine

233
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,720
and that my potential is being used.
-It won't work, Yair.

234
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,040
It creates a precedent.

235
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,880
They took into consideration
what happened...

236
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,920
But in any case, it's over.

237
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
Let's play a game, OK?

238
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,600
I'll throw the ball to you
and say a word,

239
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,280
you throw it back and tell me
the first word that comes to mind.

240
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,840
In this room there are no parents,
no teachers, no school,

241
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,800
just you and me, OK?

242
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,640
As you guys say: Give and throw.
-Give and go.

243
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,920
Give and go, what did I say?

244
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,600
Good.

245
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,200
Morning.

246
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I.
-Mouse.

247
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,440
Boy.

248
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,280
Glasses.

249
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,920
Mom.

250
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,560
Sister.

251
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,240
Dad.

252
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,920
Fear.

253
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,880
Anger.

254
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
Dad.

255
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,560
Are you mad at me?

256
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,040
How can I be mad at you?
You don't even exist.

257
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
Excuse me?

258
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
Do you know what your Nemesis is?

259
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,760
What? -It's waiting
outside your room,

260
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,880
where there are no parents,
no teachers and no counselor.

261
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,360
We can play ball forever
but your words are meaningless.

262
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,880
You're a particle of dust
floating in the universe,

263
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
you and your socks.

264
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,440
This conversation doesn't exist
and you don't exist,

265
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,680
so how can I be mad at you?
You're dead.

266
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,240
Why did you come here? -So my
mom will be able to get some sleep.

267
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,760
However, those who disapprove
of the ecomomic system

268
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,120
see purple children floating
in the sky, picking balloons.

269
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Maya and Gaga, good morning.

270
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,760
I see you're
still on vacation,

271
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,120
or perhaps you're having
deep thoughts on the subject.

272
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,760
Stand up and share
your thoughts with us.

273
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,560
Stand up.

274
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,640
Do you have to use the bathroom?
-My foot fell asleep.

275
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,400
What do you have to say?

276
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,320
The free economy?

277
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,120
Fantastic. Anything else?

278
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,840
If after 20 years on the job
my mom can't afford a babysitter,

279
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,360
free economy isn't
really working, is it?

280
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,280
Quiet.

281
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,000
That's an excellent example.

282
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
Listen carefully to what
Maya is saying.

283
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,240
Her mother has been in the
same line of work for many years

284
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,600
and still hasn't
made it financially.

285
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Maya, what sector does
your mom work in? -Sector?

286
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,040
My mom practices the
oldest profession in the world.

287
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,600
Maya... -She's a midwife.
What did you think I meant?

288
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,240
Maya.

289
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,960
Wait up.

290
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,200
What's with you? Do you want
to get expelled? -Yes.

291
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,120
Hold on, Maya.
-What?

292
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,280
Did you get a call
from Helicon Records?

293
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,200
No, Gaga.
Why should I?

294
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,680
Cause one of them
was there yesterday

295
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,640
and said we have
an awesome song,

296
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,880
that we should have won.
He even asked for your number.

297
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,320
So he didn't call...
-No.

298
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,000
Good dog, Alex.
Yoram! Call Alex!

299
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
Quiet.

300
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,240
Hi.

301
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,200
OK, bye.

302
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,880
I just came to apologize
for yesterday,

303
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm really sorry, it won't
happen again, I promise.

304
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,000
Maya.

305
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
It's over.

306
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,920
I'm leaving,
I'm moving to Tel Aviv.

307
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,600
But it won't happen again.
-It's not just the gig.

308
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,680
I don't want to be stuck
here all my life.

309
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,240
We have a gig in two weeks.
-At a school.

310
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,680
Lots of bands perform at
schools, you said so yourself.

311
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,120
Yeah, but they get paid.

312
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,240
Have you been thinking
about this long?

313
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,520
Maya, you're a kid,

314
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,960
you're still in high school.
I'm 24 years old,

315
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,280
I should be dead from an overdose
or something. Maya!

316
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,400
Dafna Ulman?

317
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,080
Get up, come on.

318
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,320
Smile.

319
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,640
You're going to pay for this.

320
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,480
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

321
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,440
I just finished a night shift.

322
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,440
It'll be fine, don't worry,
we'll have a little rehearsal,

323
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,280
then we'll shoot it.

324
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,720
Tell me something about yourself.

325
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,040
My name is Dafna,
Im 43,

326
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,120
I have four kids.
-Say that youre 39, not 43.

327
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,960
But I wrote 43 on the form.

328
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,160
It doesn't matter.
It's the video that counts.

329
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,120
Try again.

330
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,400
My name is Dafna, I work
at Rothschild Hospital,

331
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,920
I'm a midwife,

332
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,720
I have 39 kids.

333
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,800
Sorry, sorry,
I got mixed up.

334
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,920
That smile, that's it.
OK, let's start.

335
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,800
Hello, Dafna.
How are you? -Fine.

336
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,840
Dafna, without knowing you,

337
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,560
I'd say you're a very friendly
and curious person, am I right?

338
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,960
If I were to give you a ticket
to go anywhere,

339
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,120
where would you go?
How does Europe grab you?

340
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,240
Yes, but I'd feeI strange
moving to a new place...

341
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,080
No, just for vacation.
-Oh, vacation.

342
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,840
Of course. I've never been
to America either. -Great.

343
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,920
If I were to send you to America
with the man of your dreams,

344
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,280
what would he look like?

345
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,720
What would he do?
What would you do together?

346
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,520
We'd go for walks together.

347
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,200
I think we'd go to
the movies sometimes...

348
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,760
Go to the beach
on Saturdays...

349
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,320
Look, this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

350
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,440
I'll come some other time.

351
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,760
No, I'm sleeping!

352
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,240
Close the door.
You scared me. Lock it.

353
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,680
This stuff is amazing.
Want some?

354
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,560
What's up?
-Nothing.

355
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,200
Are you OK?

356
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
Do you love me?
-What?

357
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,320
Do you love me?

358
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,520
You know I do.

359
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,240
Since when?

360
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,160
What's with you?

361
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,720
When did you start loving me?

362
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,280
In third or fourth grade.

363
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,200
What would you do for me?

364
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't know,
I haven't thought about it.

365
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,600
So why do you love me?

366
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,000
Dunno.

367
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,560
Idiot.

368
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,800
Close your eyes.
-What?

369
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,920
Close your eyes.
-Why?

370
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,280
Cause I said so.

371
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,920
What's going on?

372
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,240
I want to see.

373
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,240
Maya, what are you doing?

374
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,320
What's wrong?
-I can't do it.

375
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,800
Why not?

376
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,480
I don't know,
I just can't.

377
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,640
What? -Ido, Maya didn't
come to pick me up.

378
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,280
Then spend the night there.
-Come on, Ido.

379
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,320
Then you're coming
to the pool to film me.

380
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
But Maya doesn't
let us go there.

381
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,040
Then walk home alone.

382
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,200
I'll come with you.
-I'm on my way.

383
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,960
It's OK, my brother's coming
to get me. -Are you sure?

384
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,640
Bye, sweetie.
-Bye.

385
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,640
Cut it out, you're not a baby,
you don't have to hold my hand,

386
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,840
otherwise you'll never
learn to walk home alone.

387
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,360
But Maya always let's me.

388
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,440
But Maya isn't here and today
you're learning to walk home alone.

389
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,440
Look left and right,
left again and then cross.

390
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,920
If you're not coming,
I'm leaving.

391
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,440
But Maya always let's me.

392
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,400
Bye, I'm leaving.
-Then I'm not coming to the pool

393
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,400
and I won't film you
jumping in.

394
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,840
Can you see me?
-Yes.

395
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,800
Press the red button.

396
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,680
Hello? -Hello,
may I speak to Dafna?

397
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,560
Speaking. -Hello, it's Flora,
the counselor at Yair's school.

398
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,960
Did I wake you? -It's OK,
I was on the night shift.

399
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,960
I met with Yair today

400
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,520
and we're having trouble accepting
him back at schooI. -Why?

401
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,400
The boy can't come back to school
without getting psychological treatment.

402
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,720
Why do you always
make things difficult?

403
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,000
If it's a financiaI problem,
there are ways we can help.

404
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,280
That's not it.

405
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,040
He finally wants to go back to
schooI, why can't you help him?

406
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,400
Flora, I have another call,
can you hold on?

407
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,440
Hello, this is Ehud from Helicon,
I'm looking for Maya.

408
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,480
Hello? Hello?

409
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,200
This is Ehud.

410
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,600
Excuse me, do you know
what time it is? -What?

411
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,440
The time.
Do you have a watch?

412
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,960
Where to?

413
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,720
I screwed up, I was supposed
to pick up my kid sister.

414
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,280
My mom's gonna kill me.
What time is it?

415
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
I'm such a screw-up.

416
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
Ido, please.

417
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,440
Ido, please!

418
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,040
Get up, please, Ido, get up.

419
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
"Hello, you've reached
the Ulman family.

420
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,920
If it's not the wrong number,
leave a message."

421
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,120
Where were you?

422
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,400
Bahr!

423
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,000
Are you OK, sweetie?

424
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,640
Ido fell.
-Where?

425
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,000
I couldn't wake him.
-Bahr, where's Ido?

426
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,880
He jumped into the pool,
I think he's dead.

427
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,160
Help me with this damn door.

428
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,880
Ido, wake up, this is Mommy
talking to you. Ido, wake up.

429
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,200
Yair, it's Maya.

430
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,520
Something happened to Ido, call
Mom when you hear this message.

431
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
Mom.
-Maya, leave me alone.

432
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,960
An 11 year-old, unconscious,
head injury,

433
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,320
following a three-meter fall.
-Ido wake up.

434
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,240
Ido, open your eyes.

435
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,280
Ido, wake up.

436
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
Widening of the pupils,

437
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,880
slow reaction,
no reaction to pain...

438
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,840
Take her home,
I don't want her to be here.

439
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,200
I want to stay.

440
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,360
For once, do as you're told.

441
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,000
The CT looks OK,
no swelling,

442
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,600
it'll take time for
the boy to recover.

443
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,920
Dafna, do you need anything?

444
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,120
What are you doing here?

445
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,040
Is this private property?

446
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
I thought you weren't
talking to me.

447
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,280
I'm not, I came to practice
my hook-shot.

448
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,560
Do you sleep here?
I like your pajamas.

449
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,320
When did you get back?

450
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,800
Two months ago.

451
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,080
Why?
-We missed you.

452
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,760
Just kidding, my mom had
an affair with Clinton.

453
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,920
She had an affair
with all of Baltimore,

454
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,480
Max eventually dumped her.

455
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,840
I'll never make this shot.
-Of course not, you're a girl.

456
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,640
Is that so?

457
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,280
Watch this,
with my eyes closed.

458
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,080
You retard.

459
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,960
You could have split
your head open. -But I didn't.

460
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,120
What are you doing here anyway?
-What are you doing here?

461
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,360
OK, let's go.
-Where to?

462
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,640
Inside, I forgot my keys.

463
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,640
I'm not allowed in
without psychologicaI treatment.

464
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,240
She said that to you too?

465
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,720
Come on, I'll treat you.
I'll do your homework for you.

466
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,240
Fishbaum!

467
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,160
It's so weird here at night.
-It's much weirder in the morning.

468
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,440
Why?

469
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,240
Isn't it weird coming to this
lousy place for 12 years

470
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,920
to get a piece of paper
with grades?

471
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,080
Is handing out flyers
any better?

472
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,280
Flyers, diplomas,
it's all paper.

473
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,000
Nothing you do
really has any meaning.

474
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,240
Why not?
-Think about it.

475
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,960
You're a speck of dust in a
expanding crazy universe.

476
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,040
Your life is such a tiny dot
in time that it doesn't even exist.

477
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,600
It's like a three-pointer.

478
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,680
The ball leaves your hand,
it's in the air,

479
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,360
and that's it, you're dead.

480
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,040
Iris?

481
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,840
Iris, come on!

482
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,560
Iris!

483
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,760
Sorry for calling so late,
it's Ehud from Helicon.

484
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,240
I've been looking for Maya all day.

485
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,120
Please tell her to call me about
the recording session tomorrow.

486
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,400
What recording session?

487
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,360
Just tell her to come to Helicon
with her band, she'll know. OK?

488
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,920
She won't be able to make it.
-Why not?

489
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm sorry, she won't
be able to make it.

490
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,440
"Hi, you've reached Yoram. Leave a
message and I'll call you back, or not"

491
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,960
Yair?
-It's me.

492
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,880
Yair didn't get back?

493
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,320
No. Is there any change?

494
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,840
No, nothing.

495
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,840
Mom... -Tell Yair to call me
when he gets back.

496
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,320
Ido, don't you want
to talk to me?

497
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,200
You know...

498
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,680
I promise you...

499
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,960
I'll try to find a job
without shifts,

500
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,200
maybe we can move
to another city.

501
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,120
Iris, for fucks sake,
I've got to work tomorrow!

502
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,080
Iris!

503
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,520
Iris, what are you doing?

504
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,280
Do you think I can shoot myself
into the basket?

505
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,760
What are you waiting for?

506
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,120
Let's dive into your
never-ending universe,

507
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,680
we're specks of dust,
aren't we?

508
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,880
Let's shoot a three-pointer,
let's get it over with.

509
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,160
I didn't mean that you're
a speck of dust.

510
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,480
I am.

511
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,680
So you're a speck of dust.
I actually like specks of dust.

512
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,360
My best friends are
specks of dust, I swear.

513
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,640
Then why didn't you write to me?

514
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,480
You know,
mice don't write very well.

515
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Stop it, Yair,
say something real.

516
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,080
Dafna and David Ulman
and Maya, Yair, Ido and Bahr

517
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,400
Hi.
-What are you doing here?

518
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,560
Did they call you?
-Yes, sorry, Yoram,

519
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,680
I can't come.
Something happened.

520
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,840
I just knew you'd
fuck this up, Maya.

521
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,360
Something happened with my brother.
-You always have some excuse.

522
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,520
You don't understand.
-What's there to understand?

523
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,040
Then leave. -No, I want
an explanation, Maya.

524
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,400
But you don't want to listen.

525
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,280
Why do you always have
to be such a martyr?

526
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,800
That's what you think of me?
-What else can I think?

527
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,720
Look at the way you're behaving.

528
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,080
What do you want to hear?

529
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,040
That she was 3 months in bed?

530
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,200
That I had to drag her
into the shower?

531
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,280
That she didn't change sheets
for 3 months,

532
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,760
because she thought
his smell was still there.

533
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,520
Is that what you want to hear?

534
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,080
All I want is to hear you sing.

535
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,680
Dr. Goldman.
-Valentin.

536
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,120
Sorry to disturb you.
It's just that I saw you

537
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,880
walk by the window earlier
and I remembered...

538
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,880
I wanted to offer you
a cup of coffee.

539
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,080
No, no, it's OK.

540
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,920
You just got back
from California, right? -Yes.

541
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,480
Do you know Abby?
-Who? -Abby.

542
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,240
She works here.
-I told you, I'm new.

543
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,960
But she came back from California
and she's a nurse,

544
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,440
a registered nurse.
-She worked there?

545
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,800
You know, it seems
so complicated,

546
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,480
moving to a new place,
starting all over again.

547
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,120
Never mind, I...

548
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,680
Maybe I should
talk to Abby about that.

549
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,400
My father died,
that's why I stopped writing.

550
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,680
I know. You were
in the middle of a game,

551
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,880
and he and Maya were at the beach.

552
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,720
On their way back
Maya had to pee.

553
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,360
How do you know?
-Maya told me.

554
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,560
What's this?

555
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,280
Nothing.

556
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,560
Is that why you went
to see Flora?

557
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,160
Let's get down.

558
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,440
From which side?

559
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,920
Your side.

560
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,800
What's wrong?
You're shaking.

561
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,320
Yeah, it's weird.
-What's weird?

562
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,440
That I'm scared.

563
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,440
Why are you scared?
-Because I'm happy.

564
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,560
Give me your glasses.

565
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,280
Wow, that's why you didn't
recognize me on the subway,

566
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,640
you've turned into a mole.

567
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,920
Wanna hear something
amazing about moles?

568
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,320
No.

569
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,560
OK, bye.
-Bye.

570
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:47,280
Hey, Iris, you took my thingy.
Bye. -Bye.

571
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,600
Where's Bahr?

572
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,160
Outside.

573
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,920
Did she get any sleep?
-A little.

574
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,800
Did Yair call?

575
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,240
I want to go to sleep
for a couple hours.

576
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,000
I want you to take over for me.

577
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,720
Mom.

578
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,200
Go on, say it.

579
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,520
Maya, I have nothing
to say to you.

580
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,960
You have nothing
to say to me?

581
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,960
OK, go to sleep,
we'll talk on the phone.

582
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,120
Maya, I'm sorry, I don't have
the strength to fight with you.

583
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,240
Just once, I said I'd pick her up
and I didn't,

584
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,280
and you don't ask yourself
what happened? -What happened?

585
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,200
This is what happened.
Don't you get it?

586
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,120
Too bad you didn't die instead
of him. -What?

587
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,680
What? what was that?

588
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,120
Too bad you didn't die
instead of Dad.

589
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,840
Mom, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it.

590
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,800
Mom.

591
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,440
I want you to take your things
and get out.

592
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
Ever since Dad died...
-Maya, be quiet.

593
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,400
All you want to do is sleep.

594
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,960
How do you expect
anything to be all right?

595
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,040
What happened to your hair,
Skeleton?

596
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,840
What are you doing, sis?
-I don't know you anymore.

597
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,920
Maya, where are you going?
-Away from all of you.

598
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,680
Hold on, Maya.

599
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,080
Go to the hospital, try talking
to your brother like Dad,

600
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,480
maybe it'll work on him.

601
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,360
Hospital? What are you talking about?
-Leave me alone, OK?

602
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,320
Hello, this is Maya,
Dafna Ulmans daughter.

603
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,520
Maya, sweetie, how are you?
Do you want to talk to your mom?

604
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,360
No, that's OK,
I just wanted to know

605
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,920
if there was any change
in my brother's condition.

606
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,280
No, no change.

607
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,440
Don't you want me to go get your mom?
-No, that's OK. Thanks.

608
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,920
You started smoking again?

609
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,640
Don't worry, Mom,
she'll calm down and come back.

610
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,320
You think so?
-She's a big girl.

611
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,080
She's not a big girl,
she's a baby.

612
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,000
Why don't you go to sleep?
-You think I can sleep now?

613
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,360
Go home, you'll feeI better.

614
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,000
You also think that all
I want to do is sleep?

615
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,880
I'm worried about you.

616
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,600
I'll take over for you,
we'll do it in shifts.

617
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,160
Come on, Yair,

618
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,880
I want you to take Bahr home
and fix her something to eat.

619
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,080
It'll be OK.
I'll talk to you later.

620
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,440
He seems so calm.

621
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,600
Usually he's angry.

622
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,920
Angry with whom?

623
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,360
I don't know.
Me, everybody.

624
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,440
He doesn't really talk to me.

625
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,240
I understand.
-What do you understand?

626
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,200
You don't understand anything.

627
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,040
Do you have kids?
-One daughter.

628
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,800
Where is she?

629
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,560
In California.

630
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,240
And your wife?

631
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,720
She's there too.

632
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,960
Why are you here
and they're there?

633
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,240
It's OK, what's the problem?
They're both married.

634
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,400
Happily.

635
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,680
You're staying
with him tonight, yes?

636
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,880
I'm on duty, so...
If you need me, I'm...

637
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,400
Thanks.
-Bye.

638
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,640
Excuse me, sorry.
-It's OK. -Good night.

639
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,480
Excuse me?
-Yes.

640
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,760
Is Ehud here?
-He's in a recording session.

641
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,640
When can I see him?
-Do you have an appointment?

642
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,320
Kind of.
He told me to come today.

643
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,400
He's in a session,
come back in two hours.

644
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,440
Call before, just in case.
Hello. Take bus no. 18...

645
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,720
Can't you ask him?
I came all the way from Haifa.

646
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,520
Sorry, he's in a session.

647
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,720
Is there somewhere I can wait?

648
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,760
Then come by bus...
-If you see him, tell him

649
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,000
that I'm waiting for him
over there, OK? Thanks.

650
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,840
Sima, one with avocado.
-Excuse me, darling.

651
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,240
Put it on "The Widows" tab.

652
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,800
One beer.
-One mint tea.

653
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,600
What are you doing here?

654
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,040
I don't know.

655
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,680
Did you do this yourself?

656
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,120
Looks nice.
You've got talent.

657
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,480
Did anyone ever tell you
you've got talent?

658
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,880
Yes, you.

659
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,760
What else can you do?

660
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,600
Nothing.

661
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,200
Then what are you doing here?

662
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,560
You wanted to hear me sing.

663
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,520
Come here.

664
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,240
Would you have recorded
the song without me?

665
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,520
Maya, how much longer
can I wait for you?

666
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,360
As long as it takes.

667
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,520
Dr. Goldman? -Are you
going to sleep for awhile?

668
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,160
No, I have to go look
for my daughter.

669
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,360
Would you mind
taking over for me,

670
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,640
I'll be back in a few hours?
-Sure.

671
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,760
I'll give you my number, call me
if something's wrong.

672
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,200
No problem.

673
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,080
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

674
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,840
Mikush, it's the middle of the
night, why aren't you asleep?

675
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,280
I can't finish work if you keep
calling me every five minutes.

676
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,600
For Gods sake, Mikush, put on
your pajamas, a CD and go to sleep.

677
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,600
I love you.

678
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,800
Really?
Then I love you millions.

679
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,640
Then I love you billions,
all the stars and the sky

680
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,680
and the moon and
all eternity too.

681
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,800
OK, darling.

682
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,320
OK, bye.

683
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,720
These nights do me in. Want some?
-No thanks.

684
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,560
The lyrics are yours,
aren't they?

685
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,400
And the music?
-Both of ours.

686
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,040
He's good.
Is he your boyfriend?

687
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,640
Kind of.

688
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,840
Did you write it about him?
-No, I wrote it about my dad.

689
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,320
Really? Lucky him.

690
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,800
He's dead.
-What?

691
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,800
He was stung by a bee and died.
Funny, isn't it?

692
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,520
No. Didn't he know he was allergic?

693
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,880
He knew.

694
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,840
Then what happened?

695
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,080
On our way back from the beach

696
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,840
I had to pee, so we stopped
on the way.

697
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,720
That's when he got stung.

698
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,080
Didn't he have an injection
with him? -He did.

699
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,720
Then how?

700
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,360
I went really far

701
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,960
because I was afraid people
could see me from the road and...

702
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,480
when I came back...

703
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,680
Did this happen
a long time ago?

704
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,040
I don't know.
Is nine months a long time?

705
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,440
Still have so much to say to you

706
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,760
Every day there's more to tell

707
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,200
Dreaming, I'm little now

708
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,960
Fading away every passing day

709
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,440
And I just have
one thing to tell you

710
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,040
That you are further
and further away

711
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,240
Further and further away

712
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,360
Now that you are

713
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,400
A blurred memory

714
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,640
Everything here

715
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,720
Looks like an animated film

716
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:48,240
Still have so much to say to you

717
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,840
There's another crisis every day

718
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,240
I have no strength left in me

719
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,160
But you can't hear anymore

720
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,320
Can't hear anymore...

721
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,360
I know you don't do anything
for the first 24 hours,

722
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,880
but she's 17.

723
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,320
Do you know what can happen to
a 17 year-old girl in 24 hours?

724
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,880
Can't you announce her name
on your walkie-talkie,

725
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,280
that she's missing?

726
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,360
Fine, don't do anything, OK?

727
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,080
Ido.
Ido, I'm asking you to wake up.

728
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,320
Ido, I'm talking to you,
I'm asking you to wake up,

729
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,800
I know you can hear me.
Ido, I'm asking you to wake up!

730
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,600
Dafna, what are you doing?
-I have to wake him up.

731
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,200
He's not asleep, he's in a coma.
It's dangerous, stop it.

732
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,880
Don't tell me what's dangerous,
he's my son.

733
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,200
Do you have something
that could wake him up?

734
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,480
Maybe some...

735
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,960
Trick you learned
in California?

736
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,720
Dr. Goldman?

737
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,760
Valentin?

738
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,960
Do you see me?

739
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,720
Press the red button.

740
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,640
You are going to get
a dunk on your face.

741
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,680
Who taught Jordan
everything he knows?

742
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,080
Who taught Jordan basketball?

743
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,520
Dad! Let me!

744
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,920
There you go!

745
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,720
Give it, Dad.
-Here.

746
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,680
Hello?

747
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,040
Hello?
-Hey, Skeleton, where are you?

748
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,800
Don't call me Skeleton, dummy.

749
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,720
Are you OK?

750
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,920
No.

751
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,320
Did something happen to you?

752
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,120
No.

753
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,840
Then what's wrong?
-Nothing.

754
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,760
If nothing is wrong
then something must be right.

755
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,520
Don't be so smart, Yair.
I don't know you anymore.

756
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,160
Where are you?

757
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,400
Alone.

758
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,240
Tell me where you are
and I'll come, OK? -No.

759
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,240
Why?

760
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,120
Because Mom doesn't
want to see me.

761
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,720
Mom's here waiting,
she looked all over for you.

762
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,760
Maya, tell me where you are
and I'll come, OK?

763
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,120
But Yair,
it could be worse, right?

764
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,800
What could be worse?

765
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,360
This shitty life,
it could be worse?

766
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,200
It could be worse.

767
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,240
And about Dad too,
it could be worse, right?

768
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,600
Yes, it could be worse.

769
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,040
It really could be worse.

770
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,760
It really could be worse.

771
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,520
Right?

772
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,760
Where are you, sis?

773
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,680
Tell me where you are
and I'll come.

774
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,040
I want Mom.

775
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,760
You want to talk to Mom?

776
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,280
Not to talk,
I want her to come.

777
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,080
Bahri.

778
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,600
Bhari.
Bahri.

779
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,760
What?
-Come on, get up.

780
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Come on, get up.

781
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,920
What happened?
-Lets go wake up Ido.

782
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,040
I didn't wet my bed. -It's OK,
you'll wet it tomorrow.

783
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,960
My foot fell asleep.

784
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,680
Sleep, baby.

785
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,560
The fans are going wild!

786
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,360
Yair Ulman has the ball,
he passes, it's in!

787
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,760
Yes!

788
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,600
Twelve seconds to go,
Ulman has the ball.

789
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,120
He turns around, yes!

790
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,400
40,000 spectators
are going wild!

791
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,200
He goes in. Yes!

792
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,760
Who was that?
-Valentin.

793
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,840
What happened?
-Ido woke up.

794
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,800
Everything's OK.

795
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,880
I'm a terrible mother, Maya.
-No, you're not.

796
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,680
I'm a terrible mother.

797
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,120
I turned the engine off.

798
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,480
I'm sick of this crappy car,
I'm so sick of it.

799
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,080
Let's call a tow truck.
-It costs as much as the car.

800
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,280
Come on, push.
-I'm pushing.

801
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,080
Gimme five.

802
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,240
High-five.

803
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,680
Not a chance...

804
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,480
I'm fed up with this car.
