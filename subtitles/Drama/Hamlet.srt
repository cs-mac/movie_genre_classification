1
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,983
I have of late, but wherefore I know not,

2
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,063
lost all my mirth.

3
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,174
What a piece of work is a man?

4
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,676
How noble in reason?

5
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:54,646
How infinite in faculties
and form and moving?

6
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,750
How express and admirable in action?

7
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:00,719
How like an angel in
apprehension? How like a god?

8
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,766
<i>The beauty of the world,</i>

9
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,671
<i>the paragon of animals,</i>

10
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,277
<i>and yet, to me...</i>

11
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:31,183
<i>What is this quintessence of dust?</i>

12
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,168
<i>Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death</i>

13
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,370
<i>our memory be green,</i>

14
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,840
<i>and that it us befitted
to bear our heart in grief</i>

15
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,276
<i>and our whole kingdom to be contracted</i>

16
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,678
<i>in one brow of woe.</i>

17
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,681
Yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature

18
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,417
that we with wisest sorrow think on him,

19
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,387
<i>together with remembrance of ourselves.</i>

20
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,558
Therefore our sometime sister,

21
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,526
now our queen,

22
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,563
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state,

23
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:21,300
<i>have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy...</i>

24
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:25,237
<i>With an auspicious and dropping eye,</i>

25
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,839
<i>with mirth in funeral</i>

26
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,341
<i>and with dirge in marriage,</i>

27
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:33,579
<i>in equal scale weighing
delight and dole...</i>

28
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:38,484
taken to wife.

29
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,164
Nor have we herein barred
your better wisdoms,

30
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,867
which have freely gone
with this affair along.

31
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:58,704
- For all...
- Our thanks.

32
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,510
Now follows, that you know

33
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,278
young Fortinbras,

34
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,848
holding a weak supposal of our worth.

35
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,850
<i>Or thinking by our late
dear brother's death</i>

36
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,887
<i>our state to be disjoint
and out of frame,</i>

37
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,457
<i>colleagued with the dream
of his advantage,</i>

38
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,894
he hath not failed to pester
us with message,

39
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,897
<i>importing the surrender of those lands</i>

40
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,732
<i>lost by his father.</i>

41
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:30,702
<i>With all bond of law,
to our most valiant brother.</i>

42
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,940
So much for him.

43
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,522
And now, Laertes, what's
the news with you?

44
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,457
The head is not more native to the heart,

45
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,226
the hand more instrumental to the mouth,

46
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,328
than is the throne of
Denmark to thy father.

47
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,463
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

48
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,500
My dread lord, your leave and
favor to return to France;

49
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,937
From whence though willingly I come
to show my duty in your coronation,

50
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,838
now, I must confess, that duty done,

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,241
my thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France.

52
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,544
<i>- Have you your father's leave?
- What says Polonius?</i>

53
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,848
He has, my lord, wrung
from me my slow leave

54
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,985
by laboursome petition, and at last

55
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,722
upon his will I sealed my hard consent.

56
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,725
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

57
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,261
Take thy fair hour,
Laertes; Time be thine,

58
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:33,232
and thy best grace spend it at thy will!

59
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,436
<i>My cousin Hamlet,</i>

60
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,972
<i>and my son...</i>

61
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:42,975
<i>How is it that the clouds
still hang on you?</i>

62
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:45,277
Hamlet...

63
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,346
cast thy nighted color off,

64
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:50,882
and let thine eye look
like a friend on Denmark.

65
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,818
Do not forever with thy vailed lids

66
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,954
seek for thy noble father in the dust.

67
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,923
<i>Thou know'st 'tis common;</i>

68
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:01,994
All that lives must die, passing
through nature to eternity.

69
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:03,829
Ay, madam, it is common.

70
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:08,767
If it be, why seems it
so particular with thee?

71
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,370
Seems, Madam.

72
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:17,709
Nay, it is.
I know not "seems."

73
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,945
<i>'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good Mother,</i>

74
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,949
nor customary suits of solemn black,

75
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,985
nor windy suspiration of forced breath.

76
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,756
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,

77
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,724
that can denote me truly.

78
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,460
These indeed seem,

79
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,764
for they are actions
that a man might play.

80
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,999
But I have that within
which passeth show,

81
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,069
these but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

82
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,076
'Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,

83
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,046
to give these mourning
duties to your father.

84
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:56,848
But that father lost, lost his,

85
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,052
and the survivor bound in
filial obligation for some term

86
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,920
to do obsequious sorrow.

87
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,389
But to persevere in obdurate condolement

88
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,891
is a course of impious stubbornness;

89
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,393
'Tis an unmanly grief.

90
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,097
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven.

91
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,666
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient.

92
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,035
For your intent on going back
to school in Wittenberg,

93
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,471
it is most retrograde to our desire,

94
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,341
and we beseech you, bend you

95
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:26,411
to remain here in the
care and comfort of our eye.

96
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:30,449
Let not thy mother lose
her prayers, Hamlet.

97
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,117
Stay with us,

98
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,953
go not to Wittenberg.

99
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,489
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

100
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,983
<i>That this too, too solid
flesh would melt,</i>

101
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,987
<i>thaw, and resolve itself into a dew.</i>

102
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,692
<i>Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
his canon 'gainst self-slaughter.</i>

103
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,694
<i>God.</i>

104
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,530
<i>God. How weary, stale, flat,
and unprofitable</i>

105
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,632
<i>seem to me all the uses of this world.</i>

106
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,771
<i>'Tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed.</i>

107
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,874
<i>Things rank and gross
in nature possess it merely.</i>

108
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,911
<i>That it should come to this!</i>

109
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,547
<i>But two months dead,
nay, not so much, not two.</i>

110
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,183
<i>So excellent a king that was, to this,</i>

111
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,753
<i>Hyperion to a satyr.</i>

112
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,491
<i>So loving to my mother that he might
not beteem the winds of heaven</i>

113
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,861
<i>visit her face too roughly.</i>

114
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,597
<i>Why, she would hang on him,
as if increase of appetite</i>

115
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,466
<i>had grown by what it fed on.</i>

116
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,102
<i>And yet, within a month...</i>

117
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:00,005
<i>I may not think on it.</i>

118
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,973
<i>Frailty, thy name is woman.</i>

119
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,077
<i>A little month</i>

120
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,449
<i>or ere these shoes were old with which
she followed my poor father's body</i>

121
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:13,885
<i>like Niobe, all tears...
Why she, even she...</i>

122
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,121
<i>God!</i>

123
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,925
<i>A beast that wants discourse of
reason would have mourned longer.</i>

124
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,027
<i>Married with my uncle,
my father's brothe, r</i>

125
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,130
<i>but no more like my father
than I to Hercules.</i>

126
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,098
<i>Within a month.</i>

127
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,835
<i>Ere yet the salt of
most unrighteous tears</i>

128
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:33,738
<i>had left the flushing in her
galled eyes... she married.</i>

129
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,475
<i>Most wicked speed,</i>

130
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:40,245
<i>to post with such
dexterity to incestuous sheets!</i>

131
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,850
<i>It is not nor it cannot come to good.</i>

132
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,720
<i>But break, my heart,
for I must hold my tongue.</i>

133
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:30,128
What make you from Wittenberg, Marcellus?

134
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,030
- My good lord.
- I'm very glad to see you.

135
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,765
Good even, sir.

136
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,269
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?

137
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:41,172
A truant disposition, good my lord.

138
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,875
What is your affair in Elsinore?

139
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,777
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

140
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,746
I pray thee, do not
mock me, fellow student,

141
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,648
I think it was to see
my mother's wedding.

142
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,083
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

143
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,019
Thrift, thrift, Horatio.

144
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:58,323
The funeral baked meats did coldly
furnish forth the marriage tables.

145
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,159
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

146
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,795
or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.

147
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,932
<i>My father...</i>

148
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,200
<i>methinks I see my father.</i>

149
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,803
Where, my lord?

150
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,172
In my mind's eye.

151
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,010
I saw him once, he was a goodly king.

152
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,914
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.

153
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:27,152
<i>I think I saw him...</i>

154
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,054
<i>yester-night.</i>

155
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,656
Saw? Who?

156
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,326
My lord, the king. Your father.

157
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:36,695
The king my father.

158
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,632
Season your admiration for a while

159
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,300
<i>with an attent ear, till I may deliver</i>

160
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,135
upon the witness of these gentlemen

161
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,237
this marvel to you.

162
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,340
In the dead waste in middle of the night,

163
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,108
the apparition comes.

164
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,886
<i>Where was this?</i>

165
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,155
<i>My lord, upon the platform
where we watched.</i>

166
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,024
'Tis here.

167
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,169
Did you not speak to it?

168
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,404
<i>My lord, I did.</i>

169
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,773
But answer made it none.

170
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:25,243
Yet once methought it lifted up its
head and did address itself to motion

171
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,278
like as it would speak.

172
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,883
<i>Stay, illusion.</i>

173
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,387
If thou hast any sound or use of voice,

174
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,122
speak to me.

175
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,326
It is offended.

176
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,128
If there be any good thing to be done,

177
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,098
that may to thee do ease and grace to me,

178
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,000
speak to me.

179
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,304
Speak, speak!

180
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,974
<i>I charge thee, speak.</i>

181
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,749
'Tis very strange.

182
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,951
As I do live, my lord, 'tis true.

183
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,720
And we did think it writ down in our duty

184
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,088
to let you know of it.

185
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,823
<i>Indeed, indeed.</i>

186
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:15,727
But this troubles me.

187
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,897
- Hold you the watch again tonight?
- I do, my lord.

188
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,902
What looked he...

189
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,236
frowningly?

190
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,872
A countenance more
in sorrow than in anger.

191
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,709
- And fixed his eyes upon you?
<i>- Most constantly.</i>

192
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,210
I would I had been there.

193
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,845
It would have much amazed you.

194
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,381
I will watch tonight.

195
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,318
I'll speak to it, though Hell itself
should gape and bid me hold my peace.

196
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,855
And I pray you all, if you have
hitherto concealed this sight,

197
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,824
let it be tenable in your silence still.

198
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,859
And whatsoever else shall
hap tonight, give it an...

199
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,862
understanding, but no tongue.

200
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,097
I will require your loves.

201
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,099
So, fare you well.

202
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,474
Upon the platform, 'twixt
11 and 12, I'll visit you.

203
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:04,476
Our duty to your honor.

204
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,746
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

205
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,086
<i>Would the night were come.</i>

206
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:19,157
<i>Till then sit still, my soul.</i>

207
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,327
<i>Foul deeds will rise,</i>

208
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:26,164
<i>though all the earth
o'erwhelm them to men's eyes.</i>

209
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,971
<i>Perhaps he loves you now, and now no</i>

210
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,307
soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtue of his will.

211
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,411
But you must fear,

212
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:46,050
his virtue weighed,
his will is not his own.

213
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,487
For he himself is subject to his birth.

214
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,330
He may not, as unvalued persons do,

215
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,167
carve for himself,

216
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,504
for on his choice depends the health
and safety of this whole state

217
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,406
and therefore must his
choice be circumscribed

218
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,074
unto the voice and yielding of that body

219
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,443
whereof he is the head.

220
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,380
<i>Then if he says he loves you, it fits
your wisdom so far to believe it</i>

221
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,284
<i>as he in his particular act and
place may give his saying deed,</i>

222
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,487
<i>which is no further than the main
voice of Denmark goes withal.</i>

223
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,497
Then weigh what loss your honor
may sustain if with too...

224
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:36,367
credent ear you list his songs, or...

225
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,436
lose your heart,

226
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,411
or your chaste treasure

227
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:51,082
open to his unmastered importunity.

228
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,489
Fear it, Ophelia.

229
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,628
Fear it, my dear sister.

230
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,396
And keep you in the
rear of your affection

231
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,299
out of the shot and danger of desire.

232
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,639
Best safety lies in fear.

233
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,646
Youth to itself rebels,

234
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,148
though none else near.

235
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,054
I shall the effect
of this good lesson keep

236
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,357
as watchman to my heart.

237
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:38,129
But, good my brother, do not,
as some ungracious pastors do,

238
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,665
show me the steep
and thorny way to heaven

239
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,034
while like a puffed
and reckless libertine himself

240
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:47,005
the primrose path of dalliance treads

241
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,973
and wrecks not his own creed.

242
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,245
Fear me not.

243
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,449
I stay too long.

244
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,520
A double blessing is a double grace.

245
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,024
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

246
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,631
Yet here, Laertes?

247
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,234
Aboard, aboard, for shame.

248
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,670
The wind sits in the
shoulder of your sail

249
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,672
and you are stayed for?

250
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:23,308
My blessing with thee.

251
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,079
And these few precepts

252
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,581
in thy memory look thou character.

253
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,653
Give thy thoughts no tongue,

254
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,290
nor any unproportioned thought his act.

255
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,260
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

256
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,298
Those friends thou hast
and their adoption tried,

257
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,669
grapple them to thy soul
with hoops of steel.

258
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,707
But do not dull thy
palm with entertainment

259
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:59,344
of each new-hatched,
unfledged comrade.

260
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,417
Beware of entrance to a quarrel,

261
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:12,223
but being in, bear't that the
opposed may beware of thee.

262
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:16,527
Give every man thy ear,
but few thy voice.

263
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,698
Take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.

264
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,036
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

265
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,739
but not expressed in fancy.

266
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:31,576
Rich, not gaudy.

267
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,379
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.

268
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,184
Neither a borrower nor a lender be.

269
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:45,056
For loan oft loses
both itself and friend.

270
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,395
This above all...

271
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,764
To thine own self be true.

272
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,767
And it must follow, as the night the day.

273
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,470
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

274
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,146
I humbly take my leave, my lord.

275
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,681
The time invites you.
Go!

276
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,623
Farewell, Ophelia.

277
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,602
And remember well
what I have said to you.

278
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,571
<i>Angels and ministers of grace defend us.</i>

279
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,741
<i>Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damned?</i>

280
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:20,578
<i>Bring with thee airs of
heaven or blasts from hell?</i>

281
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,448
<i>Thou comest in such a questionable
shape that I'll speak to thee.</i>

282
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,458
Mark me.

283
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,862
I will.

284
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:01,252
My hour is almost come.

285
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:06,958
When I to sulfurous and tormenting
flames must render up myself.

286
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,527
- Alas, poor ghost.
- Pity me not.

287
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,797
But lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.

288
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,434
Speak.
I am bound to hear.

289
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:19,971
I am thy father's spirit.

290
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,640
Doomed for a certain term
to walk the night

291
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,976
and for the day confined
to fast in fires,

292
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:27,311
till the foul crimes done
in my days of nature

293
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,313
are burnt and purged away.

294
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,987
But that I am forbid to tell the
secrets of my prison house,

295
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:40,024
I could a tale unfold whose lightest
word would harrow up thy soul.

296
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,760
Freeze thy young blood,

297
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:47,698
make thy two eyes, like stars,
start from their spheres,

298
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,769
thy knotted and combined locks to part

299
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,604
and each particular hair to stand on end

300
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,407
like quills upon the fretful porpentine.

301
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,583
But this eternal blazon must not
be to ears of flesh and blood.

302
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,518
List.

303
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,521
List, list! If thou didst
ever thy dear father love...

304
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,858
- God.
- Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

305
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,627
- Murder!
- Murder most foul as in the best it is.

306
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,731
But this most foul,
strange and unnatural.

307
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,344
Now, Hamlet, hear.

308
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:42,520
'Tis given out that, sleeping in
my orchard, a serpent stung me.

309
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,825
So, the whole ear of Denmark is
by a forged process of my death

310
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,094
rankly abused.

311
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,930
But know, thou noble youth, the serpent
that did sting thy father's life

312
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,732
- now wears his crown.
- My uncle.

313
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:57,802
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast

314
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,571
with witchcraft of his wit
with traitorous gifts.

315
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:04,508
Wicked wit and gifts that
have the power so to seduce.

316
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:09,080
Won to his shameful lust the will
of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

317
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,919
Hamlet, what a falling
off was there from me,

318
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,088
whose love was of that dignity

319
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,358
that it went hand in hand even with
the vow I made to her in marriage,

320
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,993
and to decline upon a wretch

321
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,830
whose natural gifts
were poor to those of mine!

322
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,105
But soft,

323
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:36,407
methinks I scent the morning air.

324
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,075
Brief let me be.

325
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,081
Sleeping within my orchard, my
custom always of the afternoon,

326
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,485
<i>upon my secure hour thy uncle stole</i>

327
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,121
<i>with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial.</i>

328
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:53,157
And in the porches of my ears did
pour the leperous distilment

329
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,959
whose effect holds such an enmity

330
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,561
with blood of man
that swift as quicksilver

331
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,631
it courses through the natural
gates and alleys of the body.

332
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,501
And with a sudden vigor
doth posset and curd,

333
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,835
like eager droppings into milk,

334
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,837
the thin and wholesome blood.

335
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,910
So did it mine.

336
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:16,013
Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's hand.

337
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:22,052
Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled. No
reckoning made, but sent to my account

338
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,955
with all my imperfections on my head.

339
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:28,859
Horrible. Horrible! Most horrible!

340
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:40,504
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.

341
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:45,576
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be a
couch for luxury and damned incest.

342
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,617
But howsoever thou pursuest this
act, taint not thy mind.

343
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:58,923
Nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught.

344
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,461
Leave her to heaven

345
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:10,000
and to those thorns that in her
bosom lodge to prick and sting her.

346
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,506
Fare thee well at once.

347
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,079
Remember me.

348
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:36,026
<i>The time is out of joint.</i>

349
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,662
<i>Cursed spite</i>

350
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:41,732
<i>that ever I was born to set it right.</i>

351
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,210
<i>My lord.</i>

352
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,678
What news, my lord?

353
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,088
Day and night

354
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,893
but this is wondrous strange.

355
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:11,195
<i>And therefore as a stranger
give it welcome.</i>

356
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,266
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio,

357
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:18,269
than are dreamt of in our philosophy.

358
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,942
<i>My fate...</i>

359
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,244
<i>cries out.</i>

360
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,247
<i>Hello and welcome to Moviefone.</i>

361
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,217
<i>Brought to you by "The New York
Times" and American Express.</i>

362
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:37,221
<i>If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one now.</i>

363
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:41,225
What is it, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

364
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:44,862
So please you, something
touching the Lord Hamlet.

365
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,997
Marry, well bethought.

366
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,266
What is between you?

367
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,335
Give me up the truth.

368
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:57,007
My lord, he hath of late made many
tenders of his affection to me.

369
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,945
Affection.

370
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,187
Think yourself a baby

371
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,357
that you have taken
these tenders for true pay,

372
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,626
which are not sterling.

373
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:18,162
Tender yourself more dearly.

374
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:22,232
My lord, he hath importuned me
with love in honorable fashion.

375
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,002
When the blood burns,

376
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:29,039
how prodigal the soul
doth lend the tongue vows.

377
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,177
These blazes, daughter,
giving more light than heat.

378
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,613
Extinct in both.

379
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,916
Even in their promise
as it is a-making

380
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:42,186
you must not take for fire.

381
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,289
I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.

382
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,861
From this time

383
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:55,165
be something scanter of
your maiden presence.

384
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:58,669
Set your entreatments at a higher rate

385
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,972
than a command to parley.

386
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:05,976
<i>For Lord Hamlet, believe in
him so much that he is</i> young,

387
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:09,747
<i>and with a larger tether may
he walk than maybe given you.</i>

388
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:15,252
Do not believe his vows.

389
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:19,189
I would not, in plain terms,

390
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,825
from this time forth

391
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:26,363
have you so slander any moment leisure

392
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:30,100
as to give words
or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

393
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,972
<i>Look to it,</i>

394
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,975
I charge you.

395
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,853
We have the word
"to be."

396
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:54,124
But what I propose is that
a word to "in to be."

397
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,793
In to be.

398
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,295
Because it's not possible to be alone,

399
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,331
to be by yourself.

400
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,200
You need other people

401
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,035
in order to be.

402
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,938
<i>You need other beings in order to be.</i>

403
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,874
<i>Not only you need father, mother,</i>

404
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:13,777
<i>but also uncle or...</i>

405
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,380
<i>brother, sister...
society.</i>

406
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:19,283
<i>But you also need sunshine,</i>

407
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,285
river,

408
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:24,855
air, trees, birds,

409
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:28,058
elephants, and so on.

410
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,361
<i>So it is impossible to be by yourself.</i>

411
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,996
<i>Alone.</i>

412
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,799
<i>You have to "in to be" with everyone</i>

413
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,301
<i>and everything else.</i>

414
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,871
<i>Therefore, "to be,"
means to "in to be."</i>

415
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:58,455
<i>To the celestial and my soul's idol.</i>

416
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:14,838
<i>The most beautified.</i>

417
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,306
<i>Ophelia.</i>

418
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,211
<i>Doubt that the stars are fire.</i>

419
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,547
<i>Doubt that the sun doth move.</i>

420
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:29,486
<i>Doubt truth to be a liar.</i>

421
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:33,190
<i>But never doubt I love.</i>

422
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,642
To be, or not to be?

423
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,418
To be, or not to be?

424
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,659
To be...

425
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,532
<i>So oft it chances in particular men</i>

426
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,435
<i>that for some vicious mole
of nature in them</i>

427
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:01,171
<i>or by some habit
that too much o'er leavens</i>

428
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:05,342
the form of plausive manners,

429
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,977
that these men

430
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:11,014
carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,

431
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,352
<i>their virtues else
be they as pure as grace,</i>

432
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:18,188
<i>shall in the general censure
take corruption.</i>

433
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,690
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

434
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:21,425
Well, God-a-mercy.

435
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,327
Do you know me, my lord?

436
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:26,263
Excellent well.
You are a fishmonger.

437
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:29,199
- Not I, my lord.
- Then I would you were so honest a man.

438
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,735
- Honest, my lord?
- Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes,

439
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,105
is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.

440
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,740
That is very true, my lord.

441
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,609
Have you a daughter?

442
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,579
I have, my lord.

443
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,382
Let her not walk in the sun.

444
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,351
Conception is a blessing,

445
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:51,555
but as your daughter
may conceive, friend,

446
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,423
look to it.

447
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,496
How say you by that?

448
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:02,199
Still harping on my daughter.

449
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,334
He is far gone.

450
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:07,137
And truly in my youth

451
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,172
I suffered much for love.

452
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,743
Will you go out in the air, my lord?

453
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:14,678
Into my grave.

454
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:20,050
My honorable lord, I will most
humbly take my leave of you.

455
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:23,353
You cannot take from me anything that
I will more willingly part withal.

456
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,091
Except my life.

457
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,163
<i>Except my life.</i>

458
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,265
<i>Except my life.</i>

459
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,570
<i>Except my life.</i>

460
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,288
My liege.

461
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,589
My liege,

462
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,224
and madam.

463
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,196
To expostulate

464
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,532
what majesty should be,

465
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,434
what duty is,

466
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:13,503
why day is day, night night,

467
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,305
and time is time

468
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:19,576
were nothing but to waste
night, day and time.

469
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:24,247
Therefore, since
brevity is the soul of wit

470
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:29,152
and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes,

471
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:32,689
I will be brief.

472
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,592
Your noble son is mad.

473
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:39,296
Mad call I it, for,
to define true madness,

474
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,530
what is it but...

475
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,733
<i>to be nothing else but mad?</i>

476
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,135
<i>But let that go.</i>

477
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,304
More matter, less art.

478
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:50,640
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

479
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:53,310
That he is mad, 'tis true.

480
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,278
'Tis true, 'tis pity.

481
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,214
And pity 'tis 'tis true.

482
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,617
A foolish figure, but farewell
it, for I will use no art.

483
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,487
<i>Mad let us grant him, then.</i>

484
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:07,324
And now remains for us to find out

485
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,192
the cause of this effect.

486
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,795
Or, rather say, the cause of this<i> defect,</i>

487
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:15,465
<i>for this effect defective comes by cause.</i>

488
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:19,436
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.

489
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,373
Perpend.

490
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,843
I have a daughter,
have while she is mine,

491
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:31,715
who in her duty and obedience, mark,

492
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,550
hath given me this.

493
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,386
Gather now and surmise.

494
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,790
Came this from Hamlet to her?

495
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,893
"I have no art to reckon my groans"

496
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:45,328
I love thee best, most best...

497
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:50,200
Thine evermore, whilst
this machine is to him,

498
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:52,335
"Hamlet."

499
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:57,374
This in obedience hath
my daughter shown me,

500
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:02,179
and more above, hath his
solicitings, as they fell out by...

501
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:03,680
time,

502
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,248
<i>by means and place,</i>

503
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,251
<i>all given to mine ear.</i>

504
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:13,590
How hath she received his love?

505
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,401
What do you think of me?

506
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:28,972
As of a man faithful and honorable.

507
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,474
<i>I would fain prove so.</i>

508
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,911
<i>But what might you think, when I had
seen this hot love on the wing...</i>

509
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,947
<i>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</i>

510
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:38,515
<i>before my daughter told me,</i>

511
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,985
what might you, or my
dear majesty here, think

512
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,889
if I had looked upon
this love with idle sight?

513
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,525
What might you think?

514
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,894
No, I went round to work

515
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:54,864
and my young mistress thus I did bespeak,

516
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:59,869
"Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star,

517
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,606
<i>this must not be."</i>

518
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:15,885
<i>She took the fruits of my advice,</i>

519
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:20,323
<i>and he, repelled...
A short tale to make...</i>

520
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:23,893
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,

521
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:28,031
thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness,

522
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:32,269
thence to a lightness,
and, by this declension,

523
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:37,340
into the madness wherein now he raves

524
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,811
and all we mourn for.

525
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,481
Do you think 'tis this?

526
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:48,285
It may be, very like.

527
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:51,721
Take this from this if this be otherwise.

528
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,497
If circumstances lead me,

529
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,966
I will find where truth is hid,

530
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:06,803
though it were hid
indeed within the center.

531
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,982
<i>To be, or not to be?</i>

532
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:22,052
<i>That is the question.</i>

533
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:25,422
<i>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</i>

534
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:28,792
<i>the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,</i>

535
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,961
<i>or to take arms against
a sea of troubles,</i>

536
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,365
<i>and by opposing, end them?</i>

537
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,568
<i>To die.</i>

538
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,071
<i>To sleep.</i>

539
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:43,373
<i>No more.</i>

540
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,608
<i>And by sleep to say we end the heartache</i>

541
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,946
<i>and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to.</i>

542
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:54,951
<i>'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished.</i>

543
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,487
<i>To die,</i>

544
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,456
<i>to sleep,</i>

545
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,591
<i>perchance to dream.</i>

546
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,696
<i>There's the rub.</i>

547
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:09,833
For in that sleep
of death what dreams may come

548
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,435
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil

549
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,738
must give us pause.

550
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,741
There's the respect

551
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:21,878
that makes calamity of so long a life.

552
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,082
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time,

553
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,518
the proud man's contumely,

554
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,421
the insolence of office, the law's delay,

555
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:34,791
the pangs of "desprised" love,

556
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:37,727
when he himself
might his own quietus make

557
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,529
with a bare bodkin?

558
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:47,470
Who would fardels bear, to grunt
and sweat under a weary life,

559
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:51,574
or it not the dread
of something after death,

560
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:56,646
the undiscovered country to whose
bourn no traveler returns.

561
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,183
Puzzles the will

562
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,419
and makes us rather bear
those ills we have

563
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:06,122
than fly to others that we know not of?

564
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:10,560
And thus, conscience
does make cowards of us all.

565
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:17,600
And thus the native hue of resolution

566
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:21,204
is sicklied over
with the pale cast of thought,

567
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:27,777
and enterprises of great pith
and moment, in this regard

568
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,547
their currents turn awry

569
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:35,485
<i>and lose the name of action.</i>

570
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:54,704
My excellent good friends!

571
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:56,606
How dost thou, Guildenstern?

572
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:58,842
Rosencrantz!

573
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,610
Good lads,

574
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,079
how do ye both?

575
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,548
As the indifferent children of the earth.

576
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,051
Happy, in that we are not overhappy.

577
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,787
On fortune's cap we are
not the very button.

578
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,756
- Nor the soles of her shoes?
- Neither, my lord.

579
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,980
What news?

580
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:40,650
None, my lord, but that
the world's grown honest.

581
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:43,253
<i>Then doomsday is near.</i>

582
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:47,524
<i>But your news is not true. Let
me question more in particular.</i>

583
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:50,193
What have you, my good friends, deserved

584
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:54,030
at the hands of fortune that she
has sent you to prison hither?

585
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,665
Prison, my lord?

586
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,834
Denmark is a prison.

587
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,836
Then the world is one.

588
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,571
Goodly one, in which there
are many confines,

589
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,707
wards, and dungeons, Denmark
being one of the worst.

590
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,576
We think not...

591
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:08,611
We think not so, my lord!

592
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:11,848
Then 'tis none to you, for there
is nothing either good nor bad

593
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,318
but thinking makes it so.
To me, it is a prison.

594
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,756
Then your ambition makes it so.
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

595
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,991
God.

596
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:26,563
I could be bounded in a nutshell and
count myself a king of infinite space

597
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,934
were it not that I have bad dreams.

598
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,907
- What make you here?
- Visit you, my lord.

599
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,009
No other occasion.

600
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,618
<i>And can you by no drift of conference</i>

601
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,853
<i>get from him why
he puts on this confusion,</i>

602
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,922
<i>grating so harshly all his days of quiet</i>

603
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:56,326
<i>with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</i>

604
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:58,094
<i>He does confess he feels
himself distracted.</i>

605
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:00,997
<i>But from what cause
he will by no means speak.</i>

606
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,333
<i>Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</i>

607
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:05,735
<i>but with a crafty madness keeps aloof</i>

608
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:09,906
<i>when we would bring him on to some
confession of his true state.</i>

609
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,808
Did he receive you well?

610
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,843
<i>Most like a gentleman.</i>

611
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,812
<i>But with much forcing of his disposition.</i>

612
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,280
<i>Niggard of question</i>

613
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:19,916
<i>but of our demands
most free in his reply.</i>

614
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:26,089
Thank you, Rosencrantz
and gentle Guildenstern.

615
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:30,193
Thank you, Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz.

616
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:34,330
<i>We lay our service freely at your feet.</i>

617
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:44,674
<i>What a rogue and peasant slave am I.</i>

618
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:48,177
<i>Is it not monstrous
that this player here,</i>

619
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:52,048
<i>but in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</i>

620
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,384
<i>could force his soul
so to his own conceit</i>

621
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:57,387
<i>that from her working
all his visage wanned,</i>

622
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:01,924
<i>his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit?</i>

623
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,028
<i>And all for nothing!</i>

624
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:10,099
<i>What would he do, had he the motive
and cue for passion that I have?</i>

625
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:30,153
<i>I have heard that guilty
creatures sitting at a play</i>

626
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:32,388
<i>have by the very cunning of the scene</i>

627
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,324
<i>been struck so to the soul that presently</i>

628
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:38,928
<i>they have proclaimed their malefactions.</i>

629
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,763
<i>For murder,</i>

630
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:43,132
<i>though it have no tongue,</i>

631
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:47,303
<i>will speak with most miraculous organ.</i>

632
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,739
<i>I know my course.</i>

633
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:52,709
<i>The spirit that I have seen
may be a devil,</i>

634
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:56,212
<i>and the devil hath power to
assume a pleasing shape, yea.</i>

635
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:59,315
<i>And perhaps out of my
weakness and my melancholy</i>

636
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,719
<i>abuses me to damn me.</i>

637
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:06,222
<i>I'll have grounds
more relative than this.</i>

638
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:09,125
<i>The play's the thing</i>

639
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:12,295
<i>wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.</i>

640
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:23,406
'Tis most true, and he beseeched me

641
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:25,742
to entreat your majesties

642
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:28,911
to hear and see the matter.

643
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:32,281
With all my heart, and it doth content
me much to hear him so inclined.

644
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:35,284
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,

645
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,120
and drive his
purpose on to these delights.

646
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,055
<i>We shall, my lord.</i>

647
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:41,758
And for your part, Ophelia,

648
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,062
<i>I do wish that your good beauties be
the happy cause of Hamlet's wildness.</i>

649
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:49,098
So shall I hope that your virtues

650
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,136
will bring him to his wonted way again.

651
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:23,099
How does your honor these many a day?

652
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,400
I humbly thank you.

653
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,335
Well.

654
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,342
My lord, I have remembrances of yours

655
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,878
I have longed long to redeliver.

656
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:40,349
I pray you receive them.

657
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,485
No, not I.

658
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,520
I never gave you aught.

659
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,924
My honored lord, you
know right well you did.

660
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:50,560
And with them, words of
so sweet breath composed

661
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:52,395
as made these things more rich.

662
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:55,364
Their perfume lost, take them again.

663
00:48:55,366 --> 00:49:00,870
For to the noble mind, rich gifts
wax poor when givers prove unkind.

664
00:49:00,872 --> 00:49:02,505
There, my lord.

665
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:07,510
Are you honest?

666
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:10,112
My lord?

667
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,515
Are you fair?

668
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:16,152
What means your lordship?

669
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,388
I did love you once.

670
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,425
Indeed, you made me believe so.

671
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,594
You should not have believed me.

672
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,463
I loved you not.

673
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:39,642
I was the more deceived.

674
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:52,555
Get thee to a nunnery.

675
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:56,292
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?

676
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:59,328
I am myself indifferent honest,

677
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,097
and yet I could accuse me of more things

678
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,633
it were better
my mother had not borne me.

679
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:06,669
I'm very proud,

680
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:10,072
revengeful, ambitious,

681
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:15,077
with more offences at my beck than
I have thoughts to put them in,

682
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,914
imagination to give them shape,

683
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,516
time to act them in.

684
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,696
What should such fellows as I do

685
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:37,633
crawling between earth and heaven?

686
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:41,938
We are arrant knaves all,
believe none of us.

687
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:09,031
Where is thy father?

688
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:12,168
Let the doors be shut upon him
that he may play the fool

689
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,304
nowhere but in his own house.

690
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:18,407
<i>Get thee to a nunnery.</i>

691
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:43,699
<i>Two messages.</i>

692
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,238
<i>- If thou dost marry,
- I give thee this plague</i>

693
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,107
<i>for thy dowry.</i>

694
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,676
<i>Be thou as chaste as ice,
as pure as snow,</i>

695
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:56,112
<i>thou shalt not escape calumny.</i>

696
00:51:56,114 --> 00:52:00,216
<i>Get thee to a nunnery.
Go. Farewell.</i>

697
00:52:03,755 --> 00:52:08,591
<i>I say, we shall have no more marriage!</i>

698
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:12,328
<i>Those that are married already,
all but one shall live!</i>

699
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,230
<i>The rest shall keep as they are!</i>

700
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:16,399
<i>To a nunnery, go!</i>

701
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,586
Give me that man that is not
passion's slave,

702
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,389
and I will wear him in my heart's core.

703
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,758
Ay, in my heart of heart as I do thee.

704
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:51,267
Tonight, one scene
comes near the circumstances

705
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,102
of which I have told thee
of my father's death.

706
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:55,371
I pray thee, when
thou seest the act afoot,

707
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,273
observe...

708
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,744
Observe my uncle.

709
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:05,114
If his occulted guilt do not
itself unkennel in one speech,

710
00:53:05,116 --> 00:53:07,583
it is a damned ghost that we have seen.

711
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:09,652
Give him heedful note.

712
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:12,154
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face

713
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:15,458
and after we will both our judgments
join in censure of his seeming.

714
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,194
Well, my lord.

715
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:20,696
Get you a place.
I must be idle.

716
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,222
Hamlet, come sit by me.

717
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,391
No, Mother, here's metal more attractive.

718
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:52,328
Ay, lady, shall I sit in your lap?

719
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,597
- No, my lord.
- I mean, my head upon your lap?

720
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,700
- Ay, my lord.
- You think I meant country matters?

721
00:53:57,702 --> 00:54:00,669
I think nothing, my lord.

722
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:03,572
Well, that's a fair thought,
to lie between a maids' legs.

723
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:07,576
- What is, my lord?
- Nothing.

724
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,911
You are merry, my lord.

725
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:12,515
God. What should a man do but be merry?

726
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:14,450
For, look you, how
cheerful my mother looks

727
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:17,253
and my father died within two hours.

728
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,388
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

729
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,590
So long?

730
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,727
Nay, then, let the devil wear black,
for I'll have a suit of sables.

731
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:28,797
Heavens! Die two months ago
and not forgotten yet?

732
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,799
Why, then there's hope
that a great man's memory

733
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,736
may outlive his life
more than half a year.

734
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:36,172
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

735
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:42,178
Excellent.

736
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:50,279
What means this, my lord?

737
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:52,781
It means mischief.

738
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:20,969
My lord.
My lord?

739
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,805
Light.

740
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:24,707
- Lights!
- Frightened with false fire?

741
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:27,109
- Away!
- My lord!

742
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,781
Good Horatio,

743
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,483
I'll take the ghost's word
for a thousand pound.

744
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,118
- Didst perceive?
- Very well, my lord.

745
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,954
- Upon the poisoning?
- I did well note him.

746
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,927
<i>Some must watch</i>

747
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:47,396
<i>while some must sleep.</i>

748
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:49,698
<i>Thus runs the world away.</i>

749
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,842
Good my lord.

750
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:02,077
<i>Hello. This is Eartha Kitt.</i>

751
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,980
<i>Cats have nine lives,</i>

752
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,783
<i>but unfortunately, you have only one.</i>

753
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:10,386
<i>So, buckle your seat belt for safety.</i>

754
00:58:10,388 --> 00:58:13,555
Good my lord, vouchsafe
me a word with you.

755
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:15,591
- The king, sir...
- Ay, sir, what of him?

756
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:18,127
Is in his retirement
marvelous distempered.

757
00:58:18,129 --> 00:58:19,962
- With drink?
- Good my lord,

758
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:22,131
try to put your discourse
into some frame.

759
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:24,566
I'm tame, pronounce.

760
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:27,803
The queen, your mother,
in most great affliction

761
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:30,038
of spirit, hath sent me to you.

762
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,107
You're welcome.

763
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:35,644
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy
is not of the right breed.

764
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:37,880
<i>If it shall please you
to make me a wholesome answer...</i>

765
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,648
I cannot.

766
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:43,419
- What?
- Make you a wholesome answer.

767
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:46,155
My wit's diseased.

768
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:03,505
<i>Now is the very witching time of night</i>

769
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:06,675
<i>when churchyards yawn
and hell itself breathes out</i>

770
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:09,111
<i>contagion to this world.</i>

771
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:12,181
<i>Now I could drink hot blood</i>

772
00:59:12,183 --> 00:59:15,984
<i>and do such bitter business as
the day would quake to look on.</i>

773
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:44,780
I like him not,
nor stands it safe with us

774
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:47,649
to let his madness range.
Therefore prepare you.

775
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,651
I your commission
will forthwith dispatch,

776
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:51,653
and he to England shall along with you.

777
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:53,789
<i>We will ourselves provide.</i>

778
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,991
<i>Most holy and religious
fear it is to keep those</i>

779
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:59,962
<i>many, many bodies safe that live
and feed upon your majesty.</i>

780
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:03,665
<i>Never alone did the king sigh,
but with a general groan.</i>

781
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,969
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage.

782
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:10,839
For we will fetters put about this
fear that now goes too free-footed.

783
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:13,275
Rosencrantz <i>We will haste us.</i>

784
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:25,153
My offence is rank, it smells to heaven.

785
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:28,790
It hath the primal eldest curse upon it.

786
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:42,004
What if this cursed hand were thicker
than itself with brother's blood?

787
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:47,276
Is there not rain enough in the sweet
heavens to wash it white as snow?

788
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:52,047
Forgive me my foul murder?

789
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:54,283
That cannot be,

790
01:00:54,285 --> 01:00:57,920
for I am still possessed of those
effects for which I did the murder...

791
01:00:57,922 --> 01:01:01,590
My crown, mine own ambition,

792
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,127
my queen.

793
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:11,166
<i>What then? What rests?</i>

794
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:15,003
<i>Try what repentance can.
What can it not?</i>

795
01:01:41,966 --> 01:01:45,934
<i>My words fly up,
my thoughts remain below.</i>

796
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:49,071
<i>Words without thoughts
never to heaven go.</i>

797
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:03,619
Look you lay home to him.

798
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:08,156
Tell him that his pranks
are too broad to bear with

799
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,926
and that your grace

800
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,629
hath screened and stood between

801
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:16,331
much heat and him.

802
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,400
Fear me not.

803
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,902
<i>Mother!</i>

804
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:23,939
I'll shroud me even here.

805
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,675
Pray you, be round with him.

806
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,928
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

807
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,699
<i>Hamlet, thou hast
thy father much offended.</i>

808
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:53,735
Mother, you have my father much offended.

809
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,437
You answer with an idle tongue!

810
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,372
You question with a wicked tongue.

811
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,374
Have you forgot me?

812
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,977
No, by the rood,
not so. You are the queen,

813
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:03,812
your husband's brother's wife.

814
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:05,574
And, would it were not so,
you are my mother.

815
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,350
I will set those to you that can speak!

816
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:10,852
Come, come, and sit you down.

817
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:14,289
You shall not budge. You go
not till I set you up a glass

818
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:18,226
- where you may see the inmost part of you.
- What will thou do?

819
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:19,828
Thou wilt not murder me?

820
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,063
Help, help!

821
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:24,332
<i>What! Help, help!</i>

822
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:29,438
What hast thou done?

823
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,041
Nay, I know not.

824
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:37,412
Is it the king?

825
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:54,996
What a rash and bloody deed is this!

826
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,998
Almost as bad, good Mother,

827
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,235
as kill a king
and marry with his brother.

828
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:02,104
Kill a king?

829
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:04,906
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

830
01:04:11,482 --> 01:04:15,016
<i>Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell.</i>

831
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,384
<i>I took thee for thy better.</i>

832
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,286
<i>Take thy fortune.</i>

833
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,757
<i>Thou find'st to be
too busy is some danger.</i>

834
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:26,762
Leave wringing of your hands.
Peace! Sit you down!

835
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:31,399
And let me wring your heart. For so I
shall if it be made of penetrable stuff.

836
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:35,103
- What have I done?
- Have you eyes?

837
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:41,209
You cannot call it love, for at your
age the hey-day in the blood is tame,

838
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,511
it's humble,

839
01:04:42,513 --> 01:04:46,948
<i>and waits upon the judgment.</i>

840
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:50,051
Shame!
Where is thy blush?

841
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,524
You live in the rank sweat
of an enseamed bed

842
01:04:55,526 --> 01:04:57,526
honeying and making love
over the nasty sty...

843
01:04:57,528 --> 01:05:02,130
- No more!
- God.

844
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:06,134
A murderer. A king of
shreds and patches...

845
01:05:12,543 --> 01:05:15,544
How would you gracious figure?

846
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:21,082
Do you not come your tardy son to chide?

847
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,285
Alas, he's mad.

848
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:28,156
Do not forget. This visitation is but
to whet thy almost blunted purpose.

849
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,327
But, look,

850
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,430
amazement on thy mother sits.

851
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:39,067
Step between her and her fighting soul.

852
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:41,536
Speak to her, Hamlet.

853
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,310
How is it with you, lady?

854
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:50,045
Whereon do you look?

855
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:54,015
On him, on him! Look
you, how pale he glares.

856
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:56,852
Do not look upon me!

857
01:05:56,854 --> 01:06:00,021
To whom do you speak this?

858
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:01,423
Do you see nothing there?

859
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:04,459
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

860
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:09,331
This is the very coinage of your brain.

861
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:12,500
My pulse, as yours,
doth temperately keep time

862
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:14,302
and makes as healthful music.

863
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,106
It is not madness that I have uttered.

864
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:21,109
Mother...

865
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:24,079
for love of grace,

866
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:27,015
confess yourself to heaven.

867
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:31,086
Repent what is past.
Avoid what is to come.

868
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:35,156
Do not spread the compost on
the weeds to make them ranker.

869
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:39,127
Hamlet.

870
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:43,098
Thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

871
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,100
Throw away the worser part of it

872
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:48,169
and live the purer with the other half.

873
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:55,644
Good night.

874
01:06:55,646 --> 01:06:58,246
For this same lord, I do repent.

875
01:07:00,651 --> 01:07:03,351
<i>But heaven hath pleased it
so to punish me with this</i>

876
01:07:05,656 --> 01:07:07,923
and this with me.

877
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:13,361
<i>I will bestow him</i>

878
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,463
<i>and will answer well
the death I gave him.</i>

879
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:54,169
- One word more, good lady.
- What shall I do?

880
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:57,038
<i>Not this, by no means, that I bid you do.</i>

881
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,241
<i>Let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed,</i>

882
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:04,145
pinch wanton on your cheek,
call you his mouse.

883
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:07,115
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,

884
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:11,186
make you to ravel all this matter out
that I essentially am not in madness

885
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,420
but made in craft.

886
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:17,092
Be thou assured

887
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:19,728
if words are made of breath

888
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:23,131
and breath of life,

889
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:27,635
I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.

890
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:32,607
I must to England, you know that?

891
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:36,678
Alack, I had forgot.

892
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,113
<i>'Tis so concluded on.</i>

893
01:08:45,022 --> 01:08:48,089
I'll lug the guts into the neighbor room.

894
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:50,525
Mother...

895
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:52,761
good night.

896
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:05,373
Indeed this counselor is now

897
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:08,109
most still,

898
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:10,378
most silent,

899
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,148
and most grave

900
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:16,751
who was in life a foolish prating knave.

901
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:24,426
Come, sir, to draw
toward an end with you.

902
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:33,401
Good night, Mother.

903
01:09:55,826 --> 01:09:58,860
What have you done, my
lord, with the dead body?

904
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:03,098
Compounded it with dust,
whereto 'tis kin.

905
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,766
Tell us where it is, that
we may take it thence

906
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:07,702
and bear it to the chapel.

907
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,105
- Do not believe it.
- Believe what?

908
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:14,843
That I can keep your
counsel and not my own.

909
01:10:14,845 --> 01:10:18,279
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge.

910
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:22,117
- Take you me for a sponge?
- Ay, sir,

911
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:27,188
one that soaks up the king's countenance,
his awards, his authorities.

912
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:36,297
My lord, you must
tell us where the body is

913
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:38,233
and go with us to the king.

914
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:40,435
The body is with the king,

915
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,604
but the king is not with the body.

916
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:45,874
- The king is a thing...
- A thing, my lord?

917
01:10:45,876 --> 01:10:48,243
Of nothing.

918
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,283
How now.

919
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:56,885
What hath befallen?

920
01:10:56,887 --> 01:11:00,421
Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord.

921
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,490
We cannot get from him.

922
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,434
Now, Hamlet.

923
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,537
Where is Polonius?

924
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:19,841
At supper.

925
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:21,509
At supper.

926
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:24,379
Where?

927
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:26,314
Not where he eats, but where he's eaten.

928
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:30,351
A certain convocation of politic
worms are eating at him.

929
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:35,256
We fat all creatures else to fat
us, we fat ourselves for maggots.

930
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:39,427
Your fat king and your lean
beggar is but variable service00

931
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,496
two dishes,

932
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:44,832
but to one table.

933
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:47,402
That's the end.

934
01:11:58,949 --> 01:12:02,250
Where is Polonius?

935
01:12:02,252 --> 01:12:03,985
In heaven.

936
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,221
Send hither to see.

937
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:08,856
If your messenger find him not there,
seek him in the other place yourself.

938
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,658
Oof.

939
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:21,402
But indeed, if you find
him not within the month,

940
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:24,639
you shall nose him as you go
up the stairs into the lobby.

941
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,643
Go seek him there.

942
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:30,778
He will stay till you come.

943
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,616
Hamlet,

944
01:12:34,618 --> 01:12:36,751
this deed

945
01:12:39,623 --> 01:12:41,990
for thine especial safety,

946
01:12:41,992 --> 01:12:46,461
which we do tender, as we dearly
grieve for that which thou hast done,

947
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:49,797
must send thee hence
with fiery quickness.

948
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:52,667
Therefore prepare thyself.

949
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:54,402
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,

950
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:56,271
the associates tend, and
everything is bent for England.

951
01:12:56,273 --> 01:12:57,939
- For England.
- Ay, Hamlet.

952
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:00,341
- Good.
- So it is.

953
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:02,810
If thou knew'st our purposes.

954
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,546
Farewell, my mother.

955
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,814
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

956
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:08,916
My mother.

957
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:13,488
Father and mother is man and wife.
Man and wife is one flesh.

958
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:14,956
And so, my mother.

959
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:54,429
<i>For everything</i>

960
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,898
<i>is sealed and done
and leans on the affair.</i>

961
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,569
The present death of Hamlet.

962
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:05,073
Do it, England.

963
01:14:05,075 --> 01:14:07,375
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,

964
01:14:07,377 --> 01:14:10,378
and thou must cure me.

965
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:47,448
Good sir,

966
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,417
whose powers are these?

967
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,621
The nephew to old Norway,

968
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:54,889
Fortinbras.

969
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:18,679
<i>How all occasions do inform against me</i>

970
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:21,682
<i>and spur my dull revenge.</i>

971
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:28,856
<i>What is a man if his chief
good and market of his time</i>

972
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,992
<i>be but to sleep and feed?</i>

973
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:35,630
<i>A beast,</i>

974
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:38,032
no more.

975
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,868
Sure, he that made us
with such large discourse,

976
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,138
looking before and after,
gave us not that

977
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:48,109
capability and godlike
reason to fust in us unused.

978
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:53,448
Now, whether it be bestial oblivion

979
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:57,718
or some craven scruple of thinking
too precisely on the event00

980
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,488
a thought which, quartered,
hath but one part wisdom

981
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,723
and ever three parts coward...

982
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:06,227
I do not know why yet I live

983
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:10,031
to say,
"This thing's to do."

984
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:14,836
Sith I have the cause
and means and strength

985
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:17,205
and will to do it.

986
01:16:17,207 --> 01:16:21,108
Examples gross as earth exort me.

987
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,965
Rightly to be great

988
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,067
is not to stir without great argument,

989
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:48,536
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw

990
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:51,772
when honor is at the stake.

991
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,744
How stand I then,

992
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:59,647
that have a father killed,

993
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:02,617
a mother stained,

994
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:07,588
excitements of my reason and my blood

995
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,857
and let all sleep.

996
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:17,598
From this time forth,

997
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,002
my thoughts be bloody

998
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:23,738
or be nothing worth.

999
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:43,758
<i>To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,</i>

1000
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,095
<i>each joy seems prologue
to some great amiss.</i>

1001
01:17:48,097 --> 01:17:51,832
<i>So full of artless jealousy is guilt,</i>

1002
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:56,871
<i>it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.</i>

1003
01:17:59,576 --> 01:18:03,177
Where is the beauteous
majesty of Denmark?

1004
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,912
How now, Ophelia?

1005
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:08,983
How should I your true love
know from another one?

1006
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:10,718
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

1007
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,954
<i>What say you?</i>

1008
01:18:12,956 --> 01:18:14,121
He is dead and gone, lady.

1009
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:16,023
Dead and gone.

1010
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,359
At his head a grass-green
turf, at his heels a stone.

1011
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:21,195
- Nay, but, Ophelia...
- Pray you, mark!

1012
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:24,699
My lord, alas, look here.

1013
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,100
How do you, pretty lady?

1014
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:28,336
Pray, let's have no more words of this,

1015
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:31,238
but when they ask you what
it means, say you this.

1016
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:39,113
Up he rose, and donned his clothes

1017
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:40,815
and dupped the chamber door.

1018
01:18:40,817 --> 01:18:43,951
Let in the maid that out a
maid never departed more.

1019
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:45,786
I hope all will be well.

1020
01:18:45,788 --> 01:18:47,788
We must be patient,

1021
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:49,624
but I cannot choose to do but to weep

1022
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:52,660
<i>to think they should lay him
in the cold ground.</i>

1023
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:55,129
My brother will know of this.

1024
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,264
And so I thank you for your good counsel.

1025
01:18:57,266 --> 01:18:59,634
Good night. Good night,
sweet ladies, good night.

1026
01:18:59,636 --> 01:19:02,770
Good night!

1027
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:07,775
How long hath she been thus?

1028
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:09,710
Calmly, calmly, good Laertes.

1029
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:12,046
That drop of blood that's
calm proclaims me bastard,

1030
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:14,682
cries "cuckold" to my father,
brands the "harlot"

1031
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:18,285
even here, between the unsmirched
brow of my true mother.

1032
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:21,956
What is the cause, Laertes, that
thy rebellion looks so giant-like?

1033
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:24,091
Let him go, Gertrude.

1034
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,826
Do not fear our person.

1035
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:28,963
There's such divinity doth hedge a king.

1036
01:19:28,965 --> 01:19:30,898
Where is my father?

1037
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,100
- Dead.
- But not by him.

1038
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,172
How came he dead?

1039
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,276
- I'll not be juggled with.
- No, Laertes.

1040
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,912
To hell, allegiance!

1041
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:48,282
Conscience and grace,
to the profoundest pit!

1042
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,785
I dare damnation.

1043
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:56,691
Let come what comes,

1044
01:19:56,693 --> 01:19:59,760
only I'll be revenged
most thoroughly for my father.

1045
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:01,929
Who shall stay you?

1046
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:04,732
My will, not all the world's.

1047
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:08,769
And for my means, I shall husband them
so well, they shall go far with little.

1048
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:10,971
Why, then now speaks

1049
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:13,774
like a good child and a true gentleman.

1050
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:17,344
That I am guiltless
of your father's death

1051
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:21,015
and most sensibly in grief for it.

1052
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:24,185
It shall to your level judgment peer

1053
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:26,987
as day doth to your eye.

1054
01:20:31,461 --> 01:20:34,228
And will he not come again?

1055
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,431
No, no, he is dead.

1056
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:41,102
Go to thy deathbed.

1057
01:20:41,104 --> 01:20:43,270
He will never come again.

1058
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,942
Rose of May.

1059
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:50,811
Dear maid,

1060
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:53,848
kind sister, sweet Ophelia.

1061
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:57,384
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade
revenge, it could not move thus.

1062
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,223
Is it possible, a young maid's wits

1063
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:05,259
should be as mortal as an old man's life?

1064
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:12,900
There's rosemary,
that's for remembrances.

1065
01:21:12,902 --> 01:21:15,336
I pray you, love, remember.

1066
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:21,375
And there's pansies.
That's for thoughts.

1067
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:26,013
There's fennel for you,

1068
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:28,182
and columbines,

1069
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:34,822
and there's rue for you.

1070
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:38,893
And some for me, too.

1071
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:42,129
We may call it herb of grace of Sundays.

1072
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,268
You must wear your rue with a difference.

1073
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:51,939
There's a daisy.

1074
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:58,879
I would give you some violets, but

1075
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:02,449
they withered all when my father died.

1076
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:05,252
They say he came to a good end.

1077
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:17,565
Where the offence is
let the great axe fall.

1078
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:36,450
Now must your conscience
my acquaintance seal,

1079
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:40,120
and you must put me
in your heart for friend.

1080
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:51,465
Sith you heard,

1081
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,168
that he which hath
your noble father slain

1082
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,637
pursued my life.

1083
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:04,612
Tell me why you proceeded
not in these feats so...

1084
01:23:04,614 --> 01:23:07,481
crimeful and capital in nature.

1085
01:23:08,885 --> 01:23:10,217
The queen his mother

1086
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:12,586
lives almost by his looks

1087
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:16,490
and for myself, my virtue or
my plague, I know not which,

1088
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,893
she's so conjunctive to my life and soul

1089
01:23:18,895 --> 01:23:21,328
that as the star moves
not but in his sphere,

1090
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,331
I could not but by her.

1091
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:30,037
So I have a noble father lost.

1092
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,973
A sister...

1093
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:36,076
driven to desperate terms whose
worth, if praises may bring back

1094
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:40,114
stood challenger on mount of all
the age for her perfections.

1095
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:47,187
But my revenge will come.

1096
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:51,325
Break not your sleeps for that.

1097
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,601
You must not think that we are
made of stuff so flat and dull

1098
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:02,569
that we can let our beard
be shook with danger

1099
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:08,275
and think it pastime.

1100
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:10,377
You shortly shall hear more.

1101
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:15,282
I loved your father,

1102
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:16,984
and we love ourself.

1103
01:24:16,986 --> 01:24:20,220
And that, I hope,
will teach you to imagine...

1104
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:30,731
From Hamlet.

1105
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:34,535
Laertes, you shall hear.

1106
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:41,442
"High and mighty, you shall know
I am set naked on your kingdom."

1107
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:45,012
Tomorrow I shall beg your
leave to your kingly eyes,

1108
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:47,982
where I shall, first asking
your pardon thereunto,

1109
01:24:47,984 --> 01:24:51,552
recount the occasion of my
sudden and more strange return.

1110
01:24:51,554 --> 01:24:53,721
"Hamlet."

1111
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:57,324
Naked?

1112
01:24:57,326 --> 01:25:00,327
And in a postscript
here, he says "alone."

1113
01:25:00,329 --> 01:25:02,429
Can you advise me?

1114
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:12,039
I'm lost in it, my lord.

1115
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:14,641
But let him come.

1116
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:17,544
It warms the very sickness in my heart.

1117
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:20,014
If he be now returned,

1118
01:25:20,016 --> 01:25:23,017
I shall work him to an
exploit, now ripe in my devise,

1119
01:25:23,019 --> 01:25:26,253
under the which he shall
not choose but fall.

1120
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:28,322
<i>And for his death</i>

1121
01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:30,491
<i>no wind of blame shall breathe</i>

1122
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:34,595
not even his mother shall uncharge
the practice and call it accident.

1123
01:25:45,775 --> 01:25:48,709
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

1124
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,415
Or are you like the painting of a
sorrow, a face without a heart?

1125
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:58,185
Why ask you this, my lord?

1126
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:02,056
There live within the very flame of love

1127
01:26:02,058 --> 01:26:05,759
a kind of wick or snuff
that will abate it.

1128
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:08,595
And nothing is as a like goodness still.

1129
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:11,065
For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,

1130
01:26:11,067 --> 01:26:14,334
dies in his own
too-much.

1131
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,771
That we would do,
we should do when we would,

1132
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:21,175
for that "would"
changes and hath abatements

1133
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:23,744
and delays as many as there are tongues,

1134
01:26:23,746 --> 01:26:26,380
are hands, are accidents.

1135
01:26:26,382 --> 01:26:28,715
And then this "should" is like a

1136
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:30,818
spendthrift sigh

1137
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:34,121
that hurts by easing.

1138
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:43,363
But to the quick of the ulcer,

1139
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:47,167
what wouldst thou undertake to
show yourself your father's son

1140
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:50,370
in deed more than in word?

1141
01:27:00,116 --> 01:27:05,853
One woe doth tread upon another's
heels so fast they follow.

1142
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:12,459
Your sister is drowned, Laertes.

1143
01:27:15,865 --> 01:27:17,865
Drowned?

1144
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:21,902
Drowned.

1145
01:27:25,141 --> 01:27:27,207
<i>Drowned.</i>

1146
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:25,259
Not to have strewed thy grave.

1147
01:29:28,831 --> 01:29:31,531
<i>And, but that great command
o'ersways the order,</i>

1148
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:35,335
she should in ground unsanctified
have lodged till the last trumpet.

1149
01:29:35,337 --> 01:29:38,605
- Must there no more be done?
- No more be done.

1150
01:29:44,847 --> 01:29:46,947
<i>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh...</i>

1151
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:48,915
Ophelia.

1152
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:51,785
<i>May violets spring.</i>

1153
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:55,922
Hold off the earth awhile till I have
caught her one more time in mine arms.

1154
01:30:08,504 --> 01:30:11,672
Now pile your dust
upon the quick and dead

1155
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:14,675
till of this flat
you have a mountain made.

1156
01:30:20,449 --> 01:30:23,817
What's he whose grief
bears such an emphasis?

1157
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:26,787
<i>Whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars</i>

1158
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:29,556
and makes them stand like
wonder-wounded hearers?

1159
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,635
The devil take thy soul.

1160
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:43,370
I loved Ophelia.

1161
01:30:43,372 --> 01:30:45,706
Forty thousand brothers with
all their quantity of love

1162
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:47,107
could not make up my sum.

1163
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:49,776
What wilt thou do for her?
Show me what thou will do.

1164
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:52,779
Wilt thou weep? Wilt
fight, wilt tear thyself,

1165
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:55,649
wilt drink up eisel?
Eat a crocodile?

1166
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:57,684
Dost thou come here to whine?

1167
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:58,952
Pluck them asunder.

1168
01:31:21,443 --> 01:31:23,810
What is the reason you use me thus?

1169
01:31:24,947 --> 01:31:28,115
I loved you ever.

1170
01:31:28,117 --> 01:31:30,617
But it does not matter.

1171
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:05,452
In my heart there was a kind of
fighting that would not let me sleep.

1172
01:32:05,454 --> 01:32:08,121
Rashly, and praised be rashness for it,

1173
01:32:08,123 --> 01:32:10,524
let us know our indiscretions do...

1174
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:15,162
Do sometimes serve us well

1175
01:32:15,164 --> 01:32:17,697
when our deep plots do pall.

1176
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,533
That should teach us

1177
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:21,001
there's a divinity that shapes our ends,

1178
01:32:21,003 --> 01:32:23,870
rough-hew them
how we will.

1179
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:27,174
<i>But wilt thou hear how I did proceed?</i>

1180
01:32:27,176 --> 01:32:28,775
I do beseech you.

1181
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,447
<i>Up from my cabin,</i>

1182
01:32:33,449 --> 01:32:34,948
<i>in the dark,</i>

1183
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:37,017
<i>groped I</i>

1184
01:32:37,019 --> 01:32:40,687
<i>to unseal their grand commission.</i>

1185
01:32:42,758 --> 01:32:46,026
<i>Where I found, Horatio...</i>

1186
01:32:46,028 --> 01:32:49,529
<i>an exact command</i>

1187
01:32:49,531 --> 01:32:52,065
<i>my head should be struck off.</i>

1188
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:56,770
Here's the commission.

1189
01:32:56,772 --> 01:32:59,806
Read it at more leisure.

1190
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:03,243
<i>Being thus benetted
round with villainies,</i>

1191
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:05,545
<i>I sat me down,</i>

1192
01:33:05,547 --> 01:33:07,247
<i>devised a new commission,</i>

1193
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:09,015
<i>wrote it fair.</i>

1194
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:11,117
<i>An earnest conjuration from the king</i>

1195
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:14,221
<i>that, on the view and knowing
of these contents,</i>

1196
01:33:14,223 --> 01:33:17,123
<i>he should these bearers
put to sudden death.</i>

1197
01:33:21,196 --> 01:33:24,998
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to it.

1198
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,234
Why, man, they did make love
to this employment.

1199
01:33:27,236 --> 01:33:29,236
They are not near my conscience.

1200
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:31,771
Their defeat does by
their own insinuation grow.

1201
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:34,040
'Tis dangerous when the
baser nature comes between the

1202
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:37,844
pass and fell incensed
points of mighty opposites.

1203
01:33:37,846 --> 01:33:40,680
Does it not, think thee,
he that hath killed my king

1204
01:33:40,682 --> 01:33:42,883
and whored my mother,
is it not perfect conscience

1205
01:33:42,885 --> 01:33:44,618
to quit him with this arm?

1206
01:33:55,264 --> 01:33:57,297
<i>It must be shortly known
to him from England</i>

1207
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,733
what is the issue of the business there.

1208
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:01,134
It will be short.

1209
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:03,270
The interim is mine.

1210
01:34:03,272 --> 01:34:06,006
A man's life is no more
than to say "one."

1211
01:34:07,776 --> 01:34:10,710
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,

1212
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,648
that to Laertes I forgot myself,

1213
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:18,218
for, by the image of my cause,
I see the portraiture of his.

1214
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:22,956
I'll court his favors.

1215
01:34:38,607 --> 01:34:40,674
The king, sir.

1216
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:43,677
The king hath wagered

1217
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,845
that in a dozen passes
between himself and Laertes

1218
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:48,949
he shall not exceed you three hits.

1219
01:34:48,951 --> 01:34:51,151
He hath laid on 12, nine.

1220
01:34:51,153 --> 01:34:52,852
It should come to immediate trial

1221
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:55,889
<i>if</i> your lordship should
vouchsafe an answer.

1222
01:34:57,993 --> 01:34:59,893
How if I answer "no"?

1223
01:35:06,768 --> 01:35:10,136
If it please his majesty, it's the
breathing time of day with me.

1224
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:12,639
You'll lose, my lord.

1225
01:35:12,641 --> 01:35:14,741
I do not think so.

1226
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:20,714
But thou wouldst not think how
ill all's here about my heart.

1227
01:35:20,716 --> 01:35:24,050
If your mind dislike anything,

1228
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,652
obey it.

1229
01:35:25,654 --> 01:35:27,954
<i>I will forestall their repair hither</i>

1230
01:35:27,956 --> 01:35:30,757
<i>say you are not fit.</i>

1231
01:35:30,759 --> 01:35:32,692
No, not a whit.

1232
01:35:32,694 --> 01:35:34,894
We defy augury.

1233
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:37,097
There's a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

1234
01:35:37,099 --> 01:35:40,734
If it be now, 'tis not to come. If
it be not to come, it will be now.

1235
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:43,336
If it be not now, yet it will come.

1236
01:35:43,338 --> 01:35:46,106
The readiness is all.

1237
01:35:46,108 --> 01:35:49,943
Since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is it to leave betimes?

1238
01:35:57,185 --> 01:35:59,419
Let be.

1239
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:05,191
<i>Hamlet, this pearl is thine.</i>

1240
01:36:08,697 --> 01:36:10,997
Here's to thy health.

1241
01:37:01,183 --> 01:37:04,217
Give me your pardon, sir.
I have done you wrong.

1242
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:06,820
But pardon it, as you are a gentleman.

1243
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:08,855
This presence knows,
and you must needs have heard,

1244
01:37:08,857 --> 01:37:11,424
how I am punished
with a sore distraction.

1245
01:37:11,426 --> 01:37:15,161
<i>What I have done that might your nature,
honor, and exception roughly awake,</i>

1246
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:18,231
<i>I here proclaim was madness.</i>

1247
01:37:18,233 --> 01:37:22,235
Let my disclaiming from a
purposed evil free me so far

1248
01:37:22,237 --> 01:37:24,304
in your most generous thoughts

1249
01:37:24,306 --> 01:37:27,340
that I have shot my arrow over the house

1250
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:29,409
and hurt my brother.

1251
01:37:34,883 --> 01:37:36,983
Give us the foils.

1252
01:37:47,028 --> 01:37:50,096
This is too heavy.
Let me see another.

1253
01:37:56,938 --> 01:37:59,105
This one likes me well.

1254
01:37:59,107 --> 01:38:01,808
- These foils are all a length?
- Ay, my good lord.

1255
01:38:09,851 --> 01:38:13,553
Your skill shall, like a star in the
darkest night, stick fiery off indeed.

1256
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:15,789
You mock me, sir.

1257
01:38:15,791 --> 01:38:18,491
No, by this hand.

1258
01:38:21,329 --> 01:38:23,196
Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?

1259
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:24,864
Very well, my lord.

1260
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:26,866
Your grace has laid
the odds on the weaker side.

1261
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:29,936
I do not fear it.
I have seen you both.

1262
01:38:29,938 --> 01:38:33,006
But since he is bettered,
we have therefore odds.

1263
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:35,475
Set me the stoups of wine upon the table.

1264
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:40,547
The king drinks to Hamlet.

1265
01:38:48,156 --> 01:38:50,190
Come, sir.

1266
01:38:50,192 --> 01:38:52,292
Come, my lord.

1267
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:29,329
<i>Point.</i>

1268
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:35,068
- Judgment.
- A hit. A palpable hit.

1269
01:39:40,342 --> 01:39:41,875
Well, again.

1270
01:39:43,078 --> 01:39:45,511
Stay.
Give me drink.

1271
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:49,482
Give him the cup.

1272
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:53,119
I'll play this bout first,
set it aside awhile.

1273
01:40:16,244 --> 01:40:18,978
Another hit.
What say you?

1274
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:21,948
A touch, a touch, I do confess it.

1275
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:25,919
Our son shall win.

1276
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:31,190
Hamlet, take my napkin.

1277
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:33,693
Rub thy brows.

1278
01:40:33,695 --> 01:40:36,930
The queen carouses
to thy fortune, Hamlet.

1279
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:51,144
I pray you, pardon me.

1280
01:40:54,182 --> 01:40:57,317
Come.

1281
01:40:57,319 --> 01:40:59,953
Let me wipe thy face.

1282
01:41:10,498 --> 01:41:12,498
Come, Laertes.

1283
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:16,035
You do but dally. I pray you,
pass with your best violence.

1284
01:41:16,037 --> 01:41:18,171
Say you so?

1285
01:41:20,508 --> 01:41:22,542
Come on.

1286
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:16,529
Thy mother's poisoned.

1287
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,633
Your king.

1288
01:42:23,138 --> 01:42:25,038
The king's to blame.

1289
01:43:05,313 --> 01:43:08,347
<i>Horatio,</i>

1290
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:11,250
I am dead.

1291
01:43:11,252 --> 01:43:13,853
Thou livest.

1292
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:17,557
Report me and my cause
aright to the unsatisfied.

1293
01:43:19,294 --> 01:43:21,794
And if thou didst ever
hold me in thy heart,

1294
01:43:23,631 --> 01:43:27,533
absent thee from felicity
awhile and in this harsh world

1295
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:32,805
draw thy breath in pain to tell my story.

1296
01:44:01,436 --> 01:44:04,137
The rest is silence.

1297
01:44:08,443 --> 01:44:12,879
Now cracks a noble heart.

1298
01:44:12,881 --> 01:44:15,681
Good night,

1299
01:44:15,683 --> 01:44:19,352
sweet prince.

1300
01:44:19,354 --> 01:44:22,155
Flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.

1301
01:44:42,243 --> 01:44:44,177
This quarry cries on havoc.

1302
01:44:44,179 --> 01:44:48,281
Proud death, what feast is
toward in thine eternal cell

1303
01:44:48,283 --> 01:44:51,617
that thou so many princes at a shot

1304
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:54,654
so bloodily hast struck?

1305
01:44:54,656 --> 01:44:59,458
The sight is dismal.

1306
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:03,629
Our wills and fates do so contrary run

1307
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:06,933
that our devices still are overthrown.

1308
01:45:06,935 --> 01:45:09,702
Our thoughts are ours,

1309
01:45:09,704 --> 01:45:12,338
their ends none of our own.
