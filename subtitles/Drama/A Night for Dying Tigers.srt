00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:19,751
and clothes that we can't wear

170
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,167
So why do we keep them?

171
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,501
For a big fire?

172
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,126
If it wasn't for Brother,

173
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:25,334
you'd be in the hands of the Japanese

174
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:28,584
And you? If you'd aimed better
with that crate...

175
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:29,584
You're one to talk

176
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,417
I said get on the passenger car

177
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,376
Not cargo

178
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,417
So what? Careful!

179
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,667
When can we do something really big?

180
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:38,834
Talk less!

181
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,251
Brother, you don't even smoke

182
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,126
Why do you always carry that pipe?

183
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,709
No reason

184
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,209
How do I draw the tiger?
I couldn't get it right

185
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:03,917
What is that?

186
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:05,792
(Japanese) Where the heck are they?!

187
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,917
The Captain wants to know where they are!

188
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,709
Let...let me ask the deities

189
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:14,084
Abracadabra!

Please appear before me!

191
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:23,251
Looks like something big will happen today

192
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,584
(Japanese) He says something big
will happen today

193
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:32,167
Hahahaha!

194
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:42,876
(Japanese) Hello?

195
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:54,667
Something major is going down!

196
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,709
Let's go see what's happening. Dahai!

197

Go eat your pancakes, brother

198
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,959
- See you at the noodle shop
- Okay

199
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,084
You don't have to see me off. Really!

200
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,542
(Japanese) Lock him up!

201
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,626
I'll let myself out! I'm not going that way!

I'm home, Mom

205
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:29,917
The pancake smells great!

Dahai, help me out!

- I'm bleeding again
- What's wrong?!

208
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,167
Come sit down!

209
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:41,959
What's wrong with the donkey?

210
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,792
It kicked me. So I drugged it,

211
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:46,917
It calms down a little

212
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:50,751
Such bad luck today!
Daytime, beaten by the Japanese

213
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,167
I was beaten by Japanese too

214
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,959
Were you kicked by a donkey at night?

215
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,084
Well, no...

216
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,542
How unlucky I am!

217
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:58,042
You are pretty unlucky

It's nothing big, Mom. Right, brother?

222

I want to join small missions too, Dad!

223

This isn't right

224
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:16,917
Dahai, you call me Brother and call her Mom

225
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,626
What if I marry her

226
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,292
Then will you call me Brother, or Dad?

227
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:22,417
Come on

228
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:23,376
Xing'er, what about you?

229
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:25,209
Will you still call me Dad or...

00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,209
What are you blabbering on about...

231
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:30,251
- Serious question!
- You always tell people to talk less,

232
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:31,709
but you talk the most

233
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,792
Maybe, I'll drug you too one day

234
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,334
Just put some in the pancakes.
The more, the better

You think I won't do it?

236

You should mark the drugged one,
so you don't eat it

Someone went over the wall!

You see, I'm a widow

249
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,959
It would create gossip if he was seen here

250
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:45,251
So he had to sneak in

Sneak in?

Fine! I just can't stand crying

334
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:50,167
I miss my mom, too

335
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,792
She was also killed by the Japanese

336
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:55,959
I didn't even get to see her one last time

337
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:59,501
Alright. Stop crying

338
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,459
I can't stop you. Just leave

339
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,001
How do I leave?

340
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:04,292
How would he leave?

341
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:06,792
By train

342
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,751
The train is here!

343
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:22,376
- Get ready!
- Shoot!

344
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:30,917
Don't be scared

345
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:34,501
Lower us!

346
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,126
Thanks. You guys can go

347
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,459
Dahai, you go first

348
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,167
Go ahead

349
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:05,084
It is going to snow...Let me send you off

350
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:11,209
It's not easy to be a soldier.
When you get home...

351
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:15,417
Brother, I was lying
when I said I was going home

352
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,792
I'm actually going back

353
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:19,792
That bridge, must be blown up

354
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:23,292
Tell me, why do you have to blow the bridge?

355
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,917
It's for the war effort.
You wouldn't understand

356
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:30,626
People like you don't do big things, right?

357
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:34,917
Fine. Your leg injury isn't that bad

358
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,584
Get off the train when it stops

359
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,751
It's stopping

360
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,459
The Japanese are inspecting the train. Run!

361
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,292
I told you to leave! Now we're both stuck!

362
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:58,042
Don't worry,
there are plenty of places to hide. Hurry!

363
00:32:58,126 --> 00:32:59,167
They're here for me

364
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,376
I'll deal with them

365
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:03,917
Leave! It's an order!

366
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:10,376
- One more favor!
- Go ahead!

367
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:11,251
(Japanese) Search thoroughly!

368
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,459
If I don't make it, find my platoon

369
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,334
Tell them that I failed

370
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:18,417
And tell them to blow the bridge in three days

371
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:22,709
Also, I'm not a deserter

372
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,834
Of course not. Where's your platoon?

373
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,417
(Japanese) Search up there!

374
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,667
Hurry. There's no time

375
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:54,251
Remember what I said

376
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,626
The bridge must be destroyed

377
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:14,792
What's up? Brother?

378
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:23,834
Come and see!

379
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,459
Off on another big mission, Brother?

380
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,876
"ERPANG - BLACKSMITH"

381
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,167
Dad, that soldier from the Eighth...

382
00:34:40,876 --> 00:34:42,876
He should be home now, right?

383
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,792
What do we do now?

384
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,126
Yeah. Tell us something

385
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:49,126
I'm skipping work today

386
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:50,709
I'm going to your mother's grave

387
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:11,709
(Japanese) Don't worry

388
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,584
(Japanese) Although we have reinforcements

389
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:18,251
(Japanese) We should remain cautious

390
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,417
(Japanese) Even the Eighth
couldn't blow up the bridge

391
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:24,334
(Japanese) So...

392
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,834
(Japanese) Who else can can do it?

393
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,542
You keep saying that I won't do anything big

394
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,376
I'll show them what I can do in a few days

395
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:41,042
Maybe, I'll finally avenge you

396
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:45,751
Really

397
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:05,709
What are you doing?

398
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,501
What are you doing?

399
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,376
We're doing whatever you're doing, Brother

400
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,626
- Shoot!
- Dad,

401
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:11,584
- I know...
- Talk less!

402
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,001
Don't tell me that
you're going to blow up that bridge

403
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:18,542
You're right. I am going to blow it up

404
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:20,917
See? I told you so

405
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:21,917
We're going to do something big!

406
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:23,334
Let's do it then!

407
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,626
An entire Eighth Route Army couldn't do it

408
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,042
Can people like us do it?

409
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:29,834
Him? Him? And Me? How can we?!

410
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,584
Did I say that you're doing it with me?

411
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,334
We're a team!

412
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:35,959
We do everything as one!

413
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,834
- We eat together, we...
- Quiet!

414
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:39,876
I was going to ask you guys

415
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,417
I can't get to the Eighth

416
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,876
So we have to do this for him

417
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,959
That's great! Let's do it!

418
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:49,584
Hold on! Know how much explosives do we need?

419
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,834
I know where we can find some

420
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,834
In the armory at Shagou Station

421
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:56,876
Station Master Huang mumbled
while I was fitting him

422
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,917
He said there's a load of explosive packs

423
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,084
We'll do it tomorrow!

424
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:01,209
Shoot!

425
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:03,584
How do we blow a bridge with explosives?

426
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:07,042
Easy. We just throw them at the bridge

427
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:09,667
Duang! Duang! It explodes!

428
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:12,001
Duang?

429
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:17,959
"GETTING EXPLOSIVES"

430
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:18,876
Fan Chuan

431
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,709
Here. Noodles up!

432
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,792
I asked for an large bowl with extra meat

433
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:22,959
Can you afford it?

434
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,709
I got it from the Japanese

435
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:27,959
Fan Chuan

436
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,001
What's up?

437
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:30,626
You've fought in the war right?

438
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,459
How'd you detonate a Japanese explosive pack?

439
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,209
- Just throw it
- Throw it!

440
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,584
- Throw it
- Throw it!

441
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:48,292
That will never work

442
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:50,334
Oh. Then...

443
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,001
Figure it out yourself

444
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:59,834
Listen. We can't beat the Japanese

445
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,792
I fought for a warlord.
That's pretty awesome, right?

446
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:04,417
And we still lost

447
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,834
With so few of you,

448
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:09,792
don't even bother

449
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:17,042
Count me in, Brother. I'm not a coward

450
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:25,501
Dahai, I want to join your next big mission

451
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,209
Something's bothering you inside

452
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:35,751
You can't even hide it

453
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:39,667
About us...

454
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:41,959
when are we going to get hitched?

455
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,126
Later. A little longer

456
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,834
Hey, get out of here

457
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,209
Hurry up

458
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,334
He beats me

459
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:51,376
Here!

460
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:07,792
Go!

461
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,334
Hey, there's a ladder here

462
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,417
That's mine. I'm sending the ducks to you sir!

463
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:57,792
(Japanese) Hey, what are you doing?

464
00:43:40,376 --> 00:43:41,542
What do we do?

465
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:43,084
Go up

466
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:44,626
How?

467
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:46,751
Drop two packs

468
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,042
Why do you drop so many?

469
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:53,251
How are you going to go up if not?
There's one left

470
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:54,209
Take it

471
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,542
All that work, and you stole one pack?!

472
00:45:15,084 --> 00:45:15,834
You try it then!

473
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:17,084
If I was there...

474
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,042
- Forget it. You can't even climb up to the roof
- Talk less!

475
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:21,584
(Japanese) Assembly! Go chase the train

476
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,292
(Japanese) You, over there!

477
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:26,751
(Japanese) You, over there!

478
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,542
Go check it out

479
00:45:58,001 --> 00:45:59,001
So many Japanese!

480
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:00,167
Don't worry. We're safe here

481
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:03,834
Not safe

482
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:05,251
Are they here for us?

483
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:10,626
You take the pack. You three to the front

484
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:11,917
Let's go

485
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,834
I'll go first. You guys follow me

486
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:38,459
Okay

487
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:44,959
You. You go first!

488
00:46:50,376 --> 00:46:51,459
What do we do now?!

489
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,876
How would I know?!

490
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:15,751
The explosive!

491
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:22,376
(Japanese) Hurry!

492
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:31,084
Hey, there's flour here!

493
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:45,834
Shoot!

494
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:50,876
(Japanese) You idiot!

495
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:06,209
Okay, we're done

496
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:34,042
See how many you've left

497
00:48:57,876 --> 00:48:58,876
Be careful!

498
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:00,542
- Thank you
- You are welcome

499
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:04,167
Where are you going?

500
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,459
Hey!

501
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:37,834
How do you use the explosives?

502
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:39,417
Just light it up

503
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:45,167
Go, go, go!

504
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:46,959
Hide, Dakui!

505
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:50,417
Nice flour. I can make Brother
some buns tonight

506
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:09,209
Put that down!

507
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:32,792
Where is he?

508
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:35,251
That's a really big explosion!

509
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:37,292
That was close

510
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:43,126
Soon, we'll be the rulers of this place

511
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:44,167
What do you mean?

512
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,501
The battle in China is growing

513
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:50,501
In a few days, we'll, have an unending chain...

514
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:55,042
of supplies to the front line

515
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:01,126
(Japanese) Did something unusual happen today?

516
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:05,334
(Japanese) Did anyone miss work today?

517
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:06,959
Did anyone miss work?

518
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,417
No cargo truck today,

519
00:51:08,501 --> 00:51:10,084
- so there's not many people...
- (Japanese) Why are You smiling?

520
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:15,459
(Japanese) I'm sorry

521
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:20,167
(Japanese) Kameda, you're responsible
for the lost explosives

522
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:26,209
(Japanese) What the heck is this?

523
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,792
(Japanese) This is the only thing I could find

524
00:51:41,126 --> 00:51:42,126
(Japanese) Let's start

525
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:44,459
(Japanese) This is going to hurt

526
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:45,542
(Japanese) Don't be a coward!

527
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:00,751
(Japanese) My hand!

528
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:03,584
(Japanese) It hurts!

529
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:04,709
(Japanese) Imbecile!

530
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:08,709
We can't blow up the bridge!

531
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,167
Why not?

532
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,417
It's rare we get to do something so big

533
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,001
Don't you want revenge?

534
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:15,459
Of course I want revenge

535
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:17,376
But blowing up the bridge isn't revenge

536
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:20,084
- Yes it is revenge!
- Stop!

537
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:22,917
First, they know their explosives
have been stolen

538
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:25,126
They're out for blood, so we must be careful

539
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:27,667
Second, if they know...

540
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:29,542
the explosives were for blowing the bridge

541
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:32,084
It'll make it more difficult. Third...

542
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,334
So what?

543
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,792
We just let Daguo
and the soldiers die in vain?!

544
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:37,126
In vain?!

545
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:41,667
What's the third thing?

546
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:42,417
What?

547
00:52:42,584 --> 00:52:43,334
The third thing!

548
00:52:43,959 --> 00:52:44,876
Forgot

549
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:46,376
Come here!

550
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:47,626
What's going on?

551
00:52:58,126 --> 00:53:00,501
Erpang's butcher knife!

552
00:53:02,376 --> 00:53:05,751
Knives, rods, chains. All solid

553
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,167
Come take a look at this!

554
00:53:10,376 --> 00:53:11,542
I'll kick! Go!

555
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:19,167
Come on!

556
00:53:20,209 --> 00:53:21,209
Go Away!

557
00:53:26,084 --> 00:53:27,376
- It's okay
- Get off me!

558
00:53:28,626 --> 00:53:31,334
They are not local!

559
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,251
Are you okay?

560
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:37,417
I'll kill you with spice!

561
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:41,084
Go!

562
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:46,334
So many Japanese soldiers

563
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:53,501
Brother, run!

564
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,292
Stop. Don't move!

565
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:19,042
(Japanese) Keep searching!

566
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:47,667
- (Japanese) We've found him!
- (Japanese) That's him!

567
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:49,167
(Japanese) Arrest them

568
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,959
That looks painful. What'll we do?

569
00:54:58,459 --> 00:54:59,959
Can we get through this without any pain?

570
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:01,334
I wish

571
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:03,001
Let's give it try

572
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:08,709
(Japanese) You two look alike

573
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:10,959
He says you two look quite alike

574
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:13,126
Alike?!

575
00:55:13,584 --> 00:55:16,542
- (Japanese) What I want to know is...
- Alike? I'm much more handsome

576
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:18,084
You're more handsome?

577
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:20,709
I was more handsome than you
when I was your age

578
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:22,292
Did you see me when I was young?

579
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:23,959
Of course not

580
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:26,417
- How is that possible?
- Wasn't that decades ago?

581
00:55:26,417 --> 00:55:27,709
I wiped your butt when you were little!

582
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:28,626
What do you think?

583
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:30,001
Look at his nose!

584
00:55:30,084 --> 00:55:31,834
- What's wrong with my nose?
- It's too big!

585
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:34,167
What's wrong with a big nose?
Your's is too small!

586
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:35,542
A big nostril collects dirt easily

587
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:37,876
- Tiny nose can hardly breathe
- Shut up!

588
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:38,751
(Japanese) What'd they say?

589
00:55:40,251 --> 00:55:41,459
(Japanese) Noses...

590
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:42,792
(Japanese) Noses?!

591
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,751
Stop rambling!

592
00:55:48,709 --> 00:55:49,542
I don't understand

593
00:55:49,751 --> 00:55:51,751
Get a Chinese, Captain

594
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:52,792
We don't understand him

595
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:55,001
We...Don't...Understand...

596
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:57,459
(Japanese) What are they saying?

597
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:59,001
They got themselves in trouble

598
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:02,001
My dad says you're an amazing sharpshooter

599
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:03,459
Please help him

600
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:06,501
I'm not a sharpshooter

601
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:09,709
Look at these!

602
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,292
Do they look like they can shoot?

603
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:13,126
They do

604
00:56:15,376 --> 00:56:17,876
If I was a sharpshooter, then why am I here?

605
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,501
I'd be doing big things

606
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,459
The Tigers are doing big things!

607
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:25,292
Well, I have my little business to take care of

608
00:56:25,584 --> 00:56:26,709
Get someone else

609
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:28,459
Go! Go!

610
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:32,959
What if they won't talk?

611
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:38,417
Chinese?

612
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:39,459
Hi...

613
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:40,584
Speak Chinese

614
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:43,209
We have a saying...

615
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:44,667
A wise man doesn't join a hopeless fight

616
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:47,667
Exactly! Since you know what I mean...

617
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:48,417
Talk less!

618
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:50,751
You don't want to get beaten, right?

619
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:52,667
- Of course not
- Good to know. So...

620
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:55,959
Hey, tell them...

621
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:00,209
That's all I can do to help you

622
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:08,626
Well...they've revealed everything

623
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:10,667
(Japanese) They admit that...

624
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:13,667
they stole the explosives

625
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:15,584
(Japanese) They admit to
stealing the explosives

626
00:57:18,626 --> 00:57:19,417
(Japanese) Why?

627
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:20,251
Why

628
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:23,917
To fry fish! Frying fish with explosives!

629
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:26,167
(Japanese) They fry fish with explosives

630
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:27,042
(Japanese) Why?

631
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:27,876
Why

632
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:31,084
To make them more crispy and delicious

633
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:35,126
There's a saying...
every movement needs a pioneer

634
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:37,334
Different lands have different customs

635
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:40,001
You'd be lost everywhere
if you didn't go anywhere

636
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,417
(Japanese) Translate!

637
00:57:45,334 --> 00:57:47,251
(Japanese) I'm sorry

638
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:51,126
(Japanese) I'm so sorry

639
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,792
It's not my fault that you don't get it.
Why hit me?

640
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:57,334
Shoot!

641
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:58,417
You keep saying "shoot" all day

642
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:00,292
but why didn't you do any reconnaissance?

643
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,834
Stop arguing!

644
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:05,876
Arguing doesn't solve a thing!

645
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:08,834
I'll ask Auntie Qin for a solution

646
00:58:10,501 --> 00:58:16,084
(Japanese) They're lying.
Let's have some fun with them

647
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:18,001
(Japanese) What do you mean?

648
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:21,834
(Japanese) These hicks all have simple minds

649
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:25,084
(Japanese) They will definitely
attempt a rescue

650
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:27,792
(Japanese) We have our soldiers everywhere!

651
00:58:28,292 --> 00:58:29,709
(Japanese) They wouldn't dare to

652
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:34,042
(Japanese) I'll bring a few soldiers with me,

653
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:37,792
(Japanese) and wipe them all out tomorrow

654
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:40,876
(Japanese) Don't underestimate them

655
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:45,167
(Japanese) No one can defeat me

656
00:58:46,584 --> 00:58:47,751
(Japanese) Certainly not hicks

657
00:58:47,917 --> 00:58:50,376
"THE GREAT RESCUE"

658
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:58,584
Listen up

659
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:02,542
These two stole from the Imperial Army

660
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:06,292
In two hours, they'll be taken away by train...

661
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,251
to face judgment at the next station!

662
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:12,084
These two stole from the Imperial Army...

663
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:13,126
What're they doing?

664
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:14,251
In two hours,

665
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:17,167
They want to see if anyone will rescue us,

666
00:59:17,584 --> 00:59:19,959
I hope our guys won't see us

667
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:25,126
How do we stop them, Brother?

668
00:59:26,084 --> 00:59:27,917
We can't stop them

669
00:59:28,626 --> 00:59:29,917
Kite!

670
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:31,334
Kite!

671
00:59:36,126 --> 00:59:36,917
What happened?

672
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:40,834
You Tigers...

673
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:43,751
You aren't going to give up
until you go too far

674
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,542
Excuse me

675
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,376
Wait!

676
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:53,084
Sir! Captain!

677
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:55,792
Please let me through.
I'm giving them some food!

678
00:59:57,084 --> 00:59:58,501
(Japanese) What did they say?

679
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:02,834
(Japanese) They just want to give them food

680
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:06,626
- (Japanese) Let her through
- (Japanese) Let her through!

681
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:11,209
It's you. Sneaking around again?

682
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:13,126
What is this?

683
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,126
Pancakes

684
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:21,876
How dare you put our flag on them!

685
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,709
What flag? It's just a red dot

686
01:00:24,876 --> 01:00:26,084
That's our national flag!

687
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:28,251
It's just a red dot. It's auspicious!

688
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:29,667
The dot on your flag is bigger

689
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,709
(Japanese) What did she say?

690
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:33,876
(Japanese) She says it's an auspicious pattern

691
01:00:40,334 --> 01:00:41,251
That's scallion

692
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:43,126
I love your pancakes

693
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:44,334
(Japanese) What did he say?

694
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:47,001
(Japanese) He says he wants to eat badly

695
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:48,501
Please let them have it

696
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:51,292
Don't eat that. Give it to him!

697
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:54,209
I made it for him

698
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:55,292
(Japanese) Tell them to leave

699
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:56,209
Get out of here!

700
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:01,709
(Japanese) If your friends
come to rescue you...

701
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:03,626
If your friends come to rescue you...

702
01:01:03,709 --> 01:01:05,542
(Japanese) They'll all be captured

703
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:07,126
they'll all be captured

704
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:10,292
(Japanese) If they don't,

705
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:11,334
If they don't,

706
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,126
(Japanese) then they're not really your friends

707
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:14,667
then they're not really your friends

708
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:22,251
The Captain says that woman treats you well

709
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:25,292
Auntie Qin is truly a great woman

710
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:26,251
Talk less!

711
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:34,709
How much of the drug did you use?

712
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:35,876
Enough?

713
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,834
It ought to be

714
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:42,542
I gave him a bigger dose than the donkey!

715
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,042
You're so greedy!

716
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:52,126
There are two pancakes.
You should give him one

717
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:54,667
(Japanese) What did he say?

718
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:56,292
(Japanese) Nothing

719
01:01:57,292 --> 01:01:59,167
(Japanese) Tell him that it's delicious

720
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:01,334
He really is a bit greedy

721
01:02:16,334 --> 01:02:17,167
Go!

722
01:03:26,376 --> 01:03:27,334
(Japanese) Attention!

723
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:28,751
(Japanese) You are all excellent marksmen

724
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:30,459
(Japanese) When the enemy approaches,

725
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:32,084
(Japanese) fire on my order

726
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:33,126
(Japanese) Wait for the order

727
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,042
(Japanese) Don't fire until you hear it.
Understand?

728
01:03:35,126 --> 01:03:35,917
(Japanese) Yes, sir!

729
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:37,501
(Japanese) They're all Japanese

730
01:03:37,959 --> 01:03:38,584
(Japanese) I'm sorry

731
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:41,584
(Japanese) Load up and stand by!

732
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:42,667
(Japanese) Yes, sir!

733
01:04:29,001 --> 01:04:30,876
(Japanese) Captain, they're here

734
01:04:37,209 --> 01:04:38,459
How many Japanese inside?

735
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:39,667
(Japanese) Sir! What do we do?

736
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:40,667
(Japanese) Captain!

737
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:43,417
(Japanese) Captain!

738
01:04:44,292 --> 01:04:46,626
(Japanese) Captain! Captain!

739
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:48,626
Don't move!

740
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:54,376
(Japanese) Please give the order to fire! Sir!

741
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:02,667
(Japanese) Fire!

742
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:16,709
Dakui!

743
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:18,084
Talk less!

744
01:06:37,876 --> 01:06:38,917
Thank you all

745
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:40,542
Good work, Fan Chuan

746
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:42,584
Are you one of us now?

747
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:43,501
Shoot!

748
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,751
Your little band doesn't look proper

749
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:49,126
How are we not proper?

750
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:50,751
- We have hats like you do!
- Talk less!

751
01:06:52,501 --> 01:06:53,251
I'll consider it

752
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:09,751
No one knows this place. We'll hide here

753
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:17,376
I didn't badmouth you.
They were talking that...

754
01:07:17,459 --> 01:07:18,542
the prisoner train was ambushed

755
01:07:18,626 --> 01:07:20,292
I know you have nothing to do with it

756
01:07:20,376 --> 01:07:22,417
I was just blending in with the crowd

757
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:25,667
I didn't say you're one of them, I swear

758
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,959
Enough. Take this money

759
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:29,876
What is this?

760
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:30,834
Auntie Qin will know

761
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:33,584
Go buy two pancakes, with this money

762
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:37,501
No, no, no. I can't take your money...

763
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:39,292
Why're you standing there?!

764
01:07:39,376 --> 01:07:40,209
I'm sorry!

765
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:41,584
Get out of here!

766
01:07:42,876 --> 01:07:43,959
Thief

767
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,001
(Japanese) Arrest him!

768
01:07:55,084 --> 01:07:59,501
What's the point of hiding these worn clothes?

769
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:04,251
Fan Chuan. You in or out?

770
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:05,042
I'm in!

771
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:07,959
I'm with you all the way

772
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,959
- That's more like it! Do it together!
- Shoot!

773
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,167
But I have one condition

774
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,459
Condition? A businessman!

775
01:08:14,459 --> 01:08:16,251
Fan Chuan, we have no money

776
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:17,501
Say it!

777
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:21,084
Don't treat me like an outsider

778
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,751
I didn't mean it like that

779
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:33,917
You ruthless shrew!

780
01:08:35,126 --> 01:08:38,209
I really don't know anything...so painful

781
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:39,584
(Japanese) Yuko!

782
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:53,542
I didn't see anything

783
01:09:02,876 --> 01:09:05,709
Stop! I'll talk! They're at Weishan Lake!

784
01:09:14,209 --> 01:09:19,959
"The evening sun is setting in the west"

785
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:26,417
"Weishan Lake is peaceful and still"

786
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:28,709
"I will go..."

787
01:09:28,792 --> 01:09:30,376
Brother, your key is too low

788
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,084
I'm not too low. He was high!

789
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:36,917
He was too low.
I think Brother is singing it good

790
01:09:37,459 --> 01:09:38,917
You're clearly singing too low

791
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:39,917
I'm too low?

792
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:41,084
Or you're too high

793
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:44,251
I choose the key so I'm right. He sang too low

794
01:09:44,334 --> 01:09:47,084
My key's correct. Peaceful and still

795
01:09:47,376 --> 01:09:48,667
- Brother's correct
- But I set the key

796
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:49,667
Then you set the wrong key!

797
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:51,042
Start it again

798
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:52,376
"The evening..."

799
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:54,626
See? Too high!

800
01:09:54,876 --> 01:09:57,459
Peaceful and still

801
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,751
Brother! It's the Japanese!

802
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:22,459
How many bullets do we have left?

803
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:25,459
I can kill one with each...

804
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:31,876
Get down!

805
01:10:36,959 --> 01:10:39,001
(Japanese) Give me the gun

806
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:40,834
You want to fight your way out?

807
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:43,334
We can't do that now

808
01:10:43,709 --> 01:10:45,167
There's only one way out. Move

809
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,334
They're gone...

810
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:55,251
(Japanese) Found them?

811
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:57,626
Hai!

812
01:11:57,792 --> 01:11:59,167
- (Japanese) Where are they?
- Hai!

813
01:12:01,709 --> 01:12:02,792
(Japanese) Where are your guns?

814
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:04,584
(Japanese) Banzai!

815
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,501
(Japanese) Banzai!

816
01:12:07,792 --> 01:12:10,209
(Japanese) Banzai!

817
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:14,084
(Japanese) Banzai!

818
01:12:15,876 --> 01:12:16,459
Hurry!

819
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:18,834
(Japanese) Banzai!

820
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:44,167
(Japanese) Where are they?!

821
01:12:51,751 --> 01:12:53,167
(Japanese) You idiot!!

822
01:12:54,084 --> 01:12:57,251
Hanzhuang Bridge is a major route

823
01:12:57,542 --> 01:13:01,376
The Japanese need it to send supplies
to the front line

824
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:05,167
I think that's why the Eighth
wants to blow it up

825
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:06,834
They want to cut their supplies

826
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:07,542
Be careful

827
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:12,459
Fan Chuan. In the, 36 stratagems.
What's this called?

828
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:13,209
"Taking the fuel"

829
01:13:14,334 --> 01:13:15,417
It doesn't matter now

830
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:18,459
The Eighth says the bridge must be
destroyed by tomorrow

831
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:21,667
You haven't told us why you decided to join us

832
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:25,084
Would you let people call you a coward?

833
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:37,542
Auntie Qin told me to bring him

834
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:42,959
Huang gave it to me before he was arrested

835
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:45,709
What's that traitor up to?

836
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:48,709
He asked me to buy pancakes from Auntie Qin

837
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:49,501
I can't see it

838
01:13:52,251 --> 01:13:53,542
What does it say?

839
01:13:54,209 --> 01:13:57,709
A supply train is
crossing Hanzhuang Bridge tomorrow

840
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:58,876
What does that mean?

841
01:13:58,959 --> 01:14:01,626
Supply train...we have our explosives!

842
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:03,667
Can we trust that traitor's words?

843
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:05,959
That traitor sent the Japanese
to the island for us

844
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,209
And now he let us go!

845
01:14:07,459 --> 01:14:08,334
What is he up to?

846
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:10,792
Means he changes sides whenever it suits him

847
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:12,042
I've seen people like him

848
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:13,126
I believe him this time

849
01:14:13,209 --> 01:14:16,126
Either way, this is our only chance

850
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:22,667
Ask your spirits! Where are they hiding?

851
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:26,459
There'll be many Japanese
on that train tomorrow

852
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:27,376
We're outnumbered

853
01:14:27,459 --> 01:14:28,792
We need more men

854
01:14:29,459 --> 01:14:31,042
I'll go!

855
01:14:31,126 --> 01:14:32,001
Me, too!

856
01:14:32,084 --> 01:14:33,876
Not you

857
01:14:33,959 --> 01:14:39,001
Abracadabra...something big is happening soon

858
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:40,959
Ow, that hurts!

859
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:42,167
My leg!

860
01:14:43,834 --> 01:14:46,126
Abracadabra...

861
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:49,709
Great!

862
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,709
I've waited for this too long!

863
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,042
So we'll leave it to you?

864
01:14:54,126 --> 01:14:55,709
Sure. Don't worry

865
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,584
Listen, everyone

866
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:04,376
If we really are blowing up the bridge

867
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,334
We won't make it back

868
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,459
Do you understand me?

869
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:12,959
If anyone wants to back out,

870
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,667
say it now

871
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:22,459
Well?

872
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:25,292
Yes! Let's do it!

873
01:15:25,376 --> 01:15:26,542
The Tigers aren't cowards!

874
01:15:26,626 --> 01:15:28,584
We'd rather die than be slaves

875
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:30,917
For our country!

876
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:31,959
We all have a duty!

877
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,876
Silence! Let Brother speak!

878
01:15:35,751 --> 01:15:37,876
Brother, what'd you say?

879
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:40,667
Right! Brother

880
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:42,959
You should say something wise!

881
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:52,001
Talk less!

882
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:09,542
Eat up before fighting the Japanese

883
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:11,209
Make it home alive...

884
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:13,751
and you can eat pancakes all you want. Okay?

885
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:15,709
You hear me?

886
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:23,251
Say, Brother. Why do you carry that
pipe with you?

887
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:26,834
He used to smoke, but not anymore

888
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,626
He misses the taste

889
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,417
The truth is,

890
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:35,667
years ago, my father was smoking this...

891
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:37,667
when the Japanese shot him

892
01:16:38,751 --> 01:16:42,501
Later, my wife was killed by the Japanese,

893
01:16:43,126 --> 01:16:44,709
while loading the tobacco for me

894
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:47,001
I don't smoke now

895
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:50,542
But, I'll remember my grudge

896
01:16:56,626 --> 01:16:59,126
Sing a song, Dahai

897
01:16:59,334 --> 01:17:03,542
No way. They keep saying that I'm off-key

898
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:04,751
You do go off-key...

899
01:17:04,834 --> 01:17:05,709
I don't!

900
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:06,667
Never mind

901
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:08,834
What's the plan tomorrow?

902
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:11,876
Well

903
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,709
Tomorrow when the train leaves Shagou Station

904
01:17:15,792 --> 01:17:17,167
We hop aboard

905
01:17:17,251 --> 01:17:18,542
First, find the explosives

906
01:17:19,126 --> 01:17:21,501
They should be in a closed cargo hold

907
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:25,001
The Japanese will inspect the train
at Zaozhuang Station

908
01:17:25,084 --> 01:17:27,959
We'll hide, making our move
as the train leaves!

909
01:17:29,126 --> 01:17:32,209
The train mustn't stop under any circumstance

910
01:17:33,251 --> 01:17:34,542
We'll stop the train
in the middle of the bridge

911
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:37,626
Wrap the explosives around the bridge pillars

912
01:17:37,834 --> 01:17:40,542
When they explode. The bridge will collapse

913
01:17:41,792 --> 01:17:42,792
You understand?

914
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,584
But what will happen to you?

915
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:51,667
Duang! Into the air. Mission accomplished

916
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:44,292
Dad!

917
01:18:44,876 --> 01:18:45,542
Why're you here?

918
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:46,917
I have to be with you all!

919
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:50,667
Get off the train before we blow the bridge

920
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:52,376
Fine

921
01:19:01,542 --> 01:19:02,667
Give me that

922
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:03,792
Blow it!

923
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:10,084
Let's go

924
01:19:37,084 --> 01:19:39,251
- Go away!
- Sir! I can't move them

925
01:19:47,126 --> 01:19:48,876
I'm sorry, sir!

926
01:20:11,501 --> 01:20:13,042
Cargo holds, front and back

927
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:14,501
Who's going to check them?

928
01:20:14,584 --> 01:20:16,792
I'll check the back

929
01:20:16,876 --> 01:20:19,542
I'll bet that they're in the front. I'll go

930
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:20,792
Go to the back,

931
01:20:20,876 --> 01:20:23,084
You're clumsy. I'll check the front

932
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:25,126
Zhu, you stand guard

933
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:25,792
I'll take the cab

934
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:28,501
The rest of you, hide.
Wail till we leave the station

935
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:29,876
Shoot!

936
01:21:01,542 --> 01:21:06,459
"BLOW UP THE BRIDGE"

937
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:18,084
(Japanese) Attention!

938
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:24,709
(Japanese) Sir! Your orders?

939
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:29,292
Who said the explosives would be here?

940
01:21:34,876 --> 01:21:35,792
(Japanese) Sit down!

941
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:37,042
(Japanese) Go ahead, sir!

942
01:21:44,126 --> 01:21:45,626
(Japanese) Rock, paper, scissors!

943
01:21:49,251 --> 01:21:51,417
(Japanese) Again! Rock, paper, scissors!

944
01:21:55,709 --> 01:21:56,501
(Japanese) Sit down!

945
01:21:56,584 --> 01:21:57,459
(Japanese) Be seated!

946
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,667
(Japanese) Rock, paper, scissors!

947
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:47,792
(Japanese) Why are you crying?

948
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:58,042
(Japanese) I'm so moved,
but bad things happen when I smile

949
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:21,167
(Japanese) Everything good?

950
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:22,917
(Japanese) Everything's fine, sir

951
01:23:23,542 --> 01:23:24,667
(Japanese) Are you sure?

952
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:29,251
(Japanese) Of course.
I'll commit seppuku otherwise

953
01:23:30,917 --> 01:23:32,209
(Japanese) That's gonna hurt

954
01:23:34,501 --> 01:23:35,751
(Japanese) This is no time for jokes!

955
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:46,792
(Japanese) Open the door

956
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,292
(Japanese) Stand up!

957
01:24:11,376 --> 01:24:13,042
(Japanese) What are you wearing underneath?

958
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,376
(Japanese) Same as you

959
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:22,459
(Japanese) I'm serious

960
01:24:23,209 --> 01:24:24,251
(Japanese) Close the door

961
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:26,501
(Japanese) Close the door!

962
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:30,459
(Japanese) Raise your hands!

963
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,626
(Japanese) What's going on here, sir?

964
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:44,167
(Japanese) She was being rude

965
01:24:55,501 --> 01:24:57,376
(Japanese) He's a fraud

966
01:24:57,584 --> 01:24:58,251
(Japanese) Fire!

967
01:24:59,376 --> 01:25:00,209
(Japanese) Fire!

968
01:25:03,459 --> 01:25:04,334
(Japanese) Where's Yuko?

969
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:05,709
(Japanese) She's still on the train

970
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:08,917
(Japanese) Give me a smile

971
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:13,001
(Japanese) Don't move!

972
01:25:16,834 --> 01:25:18,417
(Japanese) Hey!

973
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:19,501
(Japanese) Give me a smile

974
01:25:19,584 --> 01:25:20,584
(Japanese) There it is!

975
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:27,459
I told you not to move

976
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:34,626
Don't move! I'll shoot anyone that moves!

977
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:36,584
I'll shoot anyone that moves!

978
01:26:05,084 --> 01:26:07,042
(Japanese) Squad, engage!

979
01:26:29,126 --> 01:26:30,042
If you hadn't come,

980
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:32,459
I'd have shown them my shooting skills!

981
01:26:39,251 --> 01:26:40,251
Go where?

982
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:41,542
(Japanese) Fire!

983
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:45,209
Don't push!

984
01:26:53,126 --> 01:26:54,501
Got the explosives?

985
01:27:06,126 --> 01:27:08,209
Zhu. Get on top of the last carriages!

986
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:09,126
Don't let them attack

987
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:10,292
- Everyone...
- Watch out!

988
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:15,167
Everyone what?

989
01:27:16,126 --> 01:27:17,292
I've forgotten

990
01:27:25,834 --> 01:27:27,376
Block the side door, Brother.
Don't let them out

991
01:27:28,292 --> 01:27:30,084
You go help Sanlaizi

992
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:31,084
Okay

993
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:32,126
The rest of you, help me with the cannon

994
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:33,959
I don't know how to fire a cannon!

995
01:27:34,042 --> 01:27:35,376
- I do!
- Where's the ammo?

996
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,251
Over there, under that cloth. Go!

997
01:27:37,334 --> 01:27:38,751
I have bullets in my bag. Get them!

998
01:27:53,209 --> 01:27:56,834
"December moon, what flowers will you bloom!"

999
01:27:57,084 --> 01:28:00,292
"December flowers will bloom..."

1000
01:28:02,334 --> 01:28:06,292
You almost hit me!

1001
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:12,501
- Hurry!
- Dad, I'm useful!

1002
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:14,042
Talk less! Hurry!

1003
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:18,126
Come help us, Brother!

1004
01:28:19,084 --> 01:28:20,542
I'm busy too!

1005
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:35,417
Where should i put this?

1006
01:28:35,501 --> 01:28:36,834
Blow them away!

1007
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:38,209
Place it aside. Don't rush!

1008
01:28:40,334 --> 01:28:41,209
What are you doing?

1009
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:42,042
I'm aiming

1010
01:28:44,876 --> 01:28:46,126
Lift the cannon

1011
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:48,209
One, two, three! Go!

1012
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:49,917
Wait! What are you doing?

1013
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:52,001
- Push it in
- Good! One, two, three!

1014
01:28:52,084 --> 01:28:53,792
This isn't the proper way!

1015
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:55,959
We don't do things the proper way! Push!

1016
01:29:01,959 --> 01:29:02,709
Fire!

1017
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:04,167
- What?
- Fire!

1018
01:29:04,584 --> 01:29:05,792
(Japanese) Get away!

1019
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:07,667
Pull!

1020
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:12,959
- How?
- Pull it back hard!

1021
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:41,876
(Japanese) What is going on?!

1022
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,084
That was a pretty good idea, right?

1023
01:29:45,376 --> 01:29:46,959
This is definitely not proper...

1024
01:29:49,376 --> 01:29:50,251
- Again!
- Yes!

1025
01:29:53,667 --> 01:29:55,626
Fire again. I'll help the others

1026
01:29:58,709 --> 01:30:00,292
And me?

1027
01:30:01,709 --> 01:30:03,001
Keep covering your ears

1028
01:30:09,126 --> 01:30:10,084
Be careful

1029
01:30:18,584 --> 01:30:19,501
Explosives there?

1030
01:30:19,959 --> 01:30:20,792
A lot!

1031
01:30:21,084 --> 01:30:21,876
Set one off!

1032
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:22,751
Sure!

1033
01:30:31,084 --> 01:30:32,917
Fire in the hole!

1034
01:30:45,334 --> 01:30:46,251
Watch out!

1035
01:31:00,459 --> 01:31:01,042
Get away!

1036
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:43,459
(Japanese) That really hurts...

1037
01:32:15,959 --> 01:32:16,917
(Japanese) Shoot!

1038
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:36,584
(Japanese) Darn it!

1039
01:32:47,959 --> 01:32:49,251
Alright then let's play

1040
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:09,417
(Japanese) It's those hicks!

1041
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:12,042
Guys, leave it to me

1042
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:25,334
Blow him away!

1043
01:33:49,334 --> 01:33:51,292
I may have lost to you years ago...

1044
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:55,501
(Japanese) You hicks!

1045
01:33:55,709 --> 01:33:57,751
But I'll get you today

1046
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:35,459
Shoot!

1047
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:15,584
Watch out!

1048
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,709
That really hurts

1049
01:35:20,084 --> 01:35:21,084
Dakui!

1050
01:35:21,834 --> 01:35:22,626
Are you hurt?

1051
01:35:24,376 --> 01:35:25,584
How many of these do we have to tie up?

1052
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:27,501
The more the better!

1053
01:35:36,751 --> 01:35:38,292
I'll pay you back some day

1054
01:35:38,376 --> 01:35:39,167
Talk less!

1055
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:40,334
It hurts!

1056
01:36:04,001 --> 01:36:07,084
Don't let the train stop, Rui!

1057
01:36:14,417 --> 01:36:17,834
Dahai, don't you think that Xing'er likes me?

1058
01:36:23,709 --> 01:36:24,834
Where did that come from?

1059
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:31,542
The train can't stop! The train can't stop!

1060
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:47,501
This is easy and boring

1061
01:36:51,626 --> 01:36:52,709
Come on!

1062
01:37:01,042 --> 01:37:04,334
I'll show you what a proper solder...

1063
01:37:07,376 --> 01:37:08,251
can do!

1064
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:17,376
- Shoot!
- Good work!

1065
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:49,084
What's that?

1066
01:38:06,584 --> 01:38:07,709
Fan Chuan

1067
01:38:08,459 --> 01:38:10,542
Look what we found!

1068
01:38:13,334 --> 01:38:14,251
Quick! Give me!

1069
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:25,751
Brother, the boiler is leaking

1070
01:38:26,542 --> 01:38:27,292
Dakui

1071
01:38:36,542 --> 01:38:38,001
Zhuzi's fallen off the train!

1072
01:38:39,084 --> 01:38:40,334
(Japanese) Surrender!

1073
01:38:40,417 --> 01:38:41,459
What are they saying?

1074
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:42,459
They're asking us to surrender

1075
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:44,292
I'll shoot the one talking. You take the other

1076
01:38:44,917 --> 01:38:47,042
Wait, that's too risky

1077
01:38:47,126 --> 01:38:48,084
He's right behind Xing'er

1078
01:38:49,209 --> 01:38:50,376
Aren't you a sharpshooter?

1079
01:38:50,459 --> 01:38:52,042
No sharpshooter can curve a bullet

1080
01:38:53,126 --> 01:38:54,001
Come back, Dahai

1081
01:38:54,792 --> 01:38:55,459
I'm coming, Xing'er

1082
01:38:55,542 --> 01:38:56,626
- Xing'er
- Stay back!

1083
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:58,584
- Dahai
- Come back here too, Sanlaizi!

1084
01:38:59,042 --> 01:39:02,959
Just listen to me and stay over there

1085
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:16,292
A tiger? Are there wings on that?

1086
01:39:26,751 --> 01:39:27,584
What'll we do?

1087
01:39:27,709 --> 01:39:29,042
I don't have any experience with this

1088
01:39:54,501 --> 01:39:55,542
Run, Xing'er!

1089
01:40:17,292 --> 01:40:18,834
Just leave them to me!

1090
01:40:19,209 --> 01:40:20,709
Everyone back off!

1091
01:40:25,709 --> 01:40:29,084
I'm not afraid, Dad!

1092
01:40:29,167 --> 01:40:29,792
It's okay

1093
01:40:47,084 --> 01:40:50,167
Time to go. You promised

1094
01:40:51,126 --> 01:40:58,001
I want to be with you all to the end!

1095
01:40:58,209 --> 01:40:59,667
We'll be back soon

1096
01:41:05,001 --> 01:41:06,167
Dad!

1097
01:41:07,834 --> 01:41:08,542
Xing'er

1098
01:41:10,084 --> 01:41:10,959
Come

1099
01:41:13,542 --> 01:41:14,876
What are you doing?

1100
01:41:15,334 --> 01:41:16,334
Roll

1101
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:17,751
Roll!

1102
01:41:19,626 --> 01:41:20,751
Don't let her go!

1103
01:41:34,209 --> 01:41:36,667
The boiler's leaking.
We might not make it to the bridge

1104
01:41:38,126 --> 01:41:39,334
Get your weapons, boys!

1105
01:41:39,417 --> 01:41:40,292
Shoot!

1106
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,376
The train is stopping, Brother

1107
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:49,167
We've nowhere to retreat

1108
01:41:52,917 --> 01:41:54,251
We'll fight them!

1109
01:41:54,334 --> 01:41:55,251
Shoot!

1110
01:42:31,376 --> 01:42:33,042
Now!

1111
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:55,209
(Japanese) Retreat

1112
01:42:55,792 --> 01:42:57,251
This rifle is no fun

1113
01:42:57,334 --> 01:42:58,834
- How about this one?
- Great!

1114
01:43:07,709 --> 01:43:08,751
This is awesome!

1115
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:15,042
Dahai!

1116
01:43:21,542 --> 01:43:22,292
Someone's joining the party

1117
01:43:26,709 --> 01:43:29,542
(Japanese) I'm back, you hicks!

1118
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:37,376
Watch me. I'll blow him away with the tank

1119
01:43:41,209 --> 01:43:42,167
What do we do now?

1120
01:43:42,251 --> 01:43:44,042
We still have our cannon

1121
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:52,542
Now what?

1122
01:43:53,167 --> 01:43:54,542
(Japanese) You want to beat me?

1123
01:44:10,209 --> 01:44:12,709
This is bad. We're running out of ammo

1124
01:44:23,542 --> 01:44:25,667
Not blown up yet? No way

1125
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:28,667
Rui!

1126
01:44:32,042 --> 01:44:33,334
Aren't the explosives over there?

1127
01:44:33,417 --> 01:44:35,417
We'll each take one pack
and charge at them, maybe...

1128
01:44:35,501 --> 01:44:37,542
It's useless. We won't make it past them

1129
01:44:40,167 --> 01:44:42,459
We were so close!

1130
01:44:45,834 --> 01:44:47,834
Looks like our big mission is set to fail

1131
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:49,751
I started this mission,

1132
01:44:49,834 --> 01:44:50,876
so I'll see this through

1133
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:52,084
You guys still have a chance to flee

1134
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:53,667
Talk less!

1135
01:44:56,251 --> 01:44:57,792
You're not the only member of the Tigers

1136
01:44:57,876 --> 01:44:59,042
None of us are running

1137
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:00,042
We may not be proper soldiers,

1138
01:45:00,126 --> 01:45:01,459
but we do just fine against the Japanese

1139
01:45:01,542 --> 01:45:03,042
Tell us. What to do!

1140
01:45:03,459 --> 01:45:04,084
Shoot!

1141
01:45:11,042 --> 01:45:13,626
I don't think we can take them head on

1142
01:45:14,167 --> 01:45:17,167
How does the 36 Strategems go?

1143
01:45:17,626 --> 01:45:18,917
How would I know
which one you're talking about?!

1144
01:45:20,001 --> 01:45:23,376
We will hide!

1145
01:45:24,667 --> 01:45:27,667
(Japanese) You'll never beat me.
Not in a million years!

1146
01:45:33,626 --> 01:45:35,792
Switch the tracks!

1147
01:45:35,959 --> 01:45:37,459
I'll block the train

1148
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:38,167
Got it!

1149
01:45:45,792 --> 01:45:47,709
- What are you doing?
- Your dad said don't let go!

1150
01:45:47,792 --> 01:45:48,792
Let me go!

1151
01:45:59,751 --> 01:46:00,876
You got a death wish?

1152
01:46:12,959 --> 01:46:14,167
(Japanese) Search the train!

1153
01:46:23,167 --> 01:46:23,876
I speak Chinese!

1154
01:46:25,459 --> 01:46:27,542
I'll say it clearly this time

1155
01:46:28,292 --> 01:46:30,459
You have two choices

1156
01:46:30,542 --> 01:46:33,334
One, I knock you both out

1157
01:46:35,084 --> 01:46:36,292
Two...

1158
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:47,959
Zhuzi!

1159
01:46:49,709 --> 01:46:51,084
Who's on the train?

1160
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:56,417
Put your backs into it!

1161
01:47:06,001 --> 01:47:07,167
It won't budge!

1162
01:47:10,459 --> 01:47:11,459
Dakui?

1163
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:13,417
- Why are we pulling that?
- Talk less!

1164
01:47:13,876 --> 01:47:15,167
Move! Hurry

1165
01:47:23,917 --> 01:47:25,042
Why won't you go away?!

1166
01:47:43,084 --> 01:47:44,167
Can't stop it now

1167
01:47:49,251 --> 01:47:50,709
What is he doing?

1168
01:47:56,959 --> 01:47:58,001
(Japanese) We've got nothing, sir!

1169
01:47:58,167 --> 01:47:59,126
(Japanese) We've got nothing, sir!

1170
01:47:59,501 --> 01:48:00,667
(Japanese) We've got nothing, sir!

1171
01:48:01,542 --> 01:48:02,792
(Japanese) Found them?

1172
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:04,209
(Japanese) No, sir

1173
01:48:04,292 --> 01:48:05,751
(Japanese) Search again!

1174
01:48:05,834 --> 01:48:06,709
(Japanese) Yes, sir!

1175
01:48:52,459 --> 01:48:55,084
(Japanese) Back away! Back away!

1176
01:48:55,167 --> 01:48:55,792
(Japanese) Back away!

1177
01:48:57,376 --> 01:48:58,792
(Japanese) Don't move!

1178
01:49:00,542 --> 01:49:01,251
(Japanese) You hicks!

1179
01:49:10,209 --> 01:49:12,126
(Japanese) Back away!

1180
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:53,876
Shoot!

1181
01:50:55,251 --> 01:50:55,917
Xiaohu!

1182
01:51:54,167 --> 01:51:55,084
Brother

1183
01:51:56,751 --> 01:51:58,042
Who's driving that train?

1184
01:51:58,126 --> 01:51:59,209
It must be Rui

1185
01:52:04,917 --> 01:52:06,292
We're the only ones left!

1186
01:52:12,001 --> 01:52:14,792
Keep them back.
I'm going to set off the explosives

1187
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:16,959
Hurry! We can't hold them off for long

1188
01:52:17,292 --> 01:52:18,167
Brother!

1189
01:52:18,876 --> 01:52:19,876
Talk less!

1190
01:52:28,792 --> 01:52:29,417
Brother!

1191
01:53:01,001 --> 01:53:02,501
We can't hold them any longer

1192
01:53:23,834 --> 01:53:25,584
Why won't that Japanese die?!

1193
01:53:28,501 --> 01:53:29,876
I have you now

1194
01:53:33,834 --> 01:53:34,751
I have you now

1195
01:53:36,292 --> 01:53:38,501
Are you going to shoot or what?
Can you do this?

1196
01:53:38,584 --> 01:53:40,626
They're too close. I'll hit both of them

1197
01:55:21,917 --> 01:55:23,876
(Japanese) Hold your fire!

1198
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,126
(Japanese) I'll get him myself

1199
01:55:26,209 --> 01:55:30,709
Brother, looks like our mission has failed

1200
01:55:32,334 --> 01:55:34,959
I'm sorry I couldn't hold them

1201
01:55:35,834 --> 01:55:37,501
We've failed Daguo and the Eighth

1202
01:55:58,376 --> 01:55:59,751
(Japanese) We'll start with you

1203
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:06,709
(Japanese) What's going on?!

1204
01:56:17,042 --> 01:56:18,584
Charge!

1205
01:56:20,792 --> 01:56:23,084
(Japanese) Fire! Kill them all!

1206
01:56:25,667 --> 01:56:27,042
(Japanese) Go, all of you!

1207
01:56:27,126 --> 01:56:28,251
(Japanese) Kill them all!

1208
01:56:52,792 --> 01:56:53,959
(Japanese) All of you, go!

1209
01:56:54,667 --> 01:56:55,709
(Japanese) Don't worry about those guys...

1210
01:56:55,792 --> 01:56:57,126
(Japanese) I can handle them myself

1211
01:57:30,834 --> 01:57:32,334
I'll kill you!

1212
01:57:34,376 --> 01:57:37,501
(Japanese) That hurts!

1213
01:58:31,251 --> 01:58:35,709
Charge!

1214
01:59:09,334 --> 01:59:12,042
(Japanese) You hicks...

1215
02:00:26,667 --> 02:00:29,251
Tiger. Come on, time to go

1216
02:00:29,667 --> 02:00:31,626
Can this be our secret?

1217
02:00:31,709 --> 02:00:33,334
Sure, no problem

1218
02:00:33,417 --> 02:00:35,376
Did they all go to heaven?

1219
02:00:35,459 --> 02:00:36,334
Actually...

1220
02:00:36,417 --> 02:00:38,501
they all joined
the Eighth Route Army afterwards,

1221
02:00:38,584 --> 02:00:40,209
and protected our country

1222
02:00:40,292 --> 02:00:42,042
What about the injured soldier?

1223
02:00:42,959 --> 02:00:44,584
Did he go to heaven?

1224
02:00:47,251 --> 02:00:50,626
That's another story. Do you want to hear it?

1225
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:51,542
Yeah!

1226
02:00:52,417 --> 02:00:54,042
Okay, I'll tell you

1227
02:01:22,751 --> 02:01:24,501
Sorry, my hat fell off

1228
02:01:28,542 --> 02:01:30,417
Hit me? You hit me?!

1229
02:01:31,209 --> 02:01:33,376
I forgot my lines...Sorry

1230
02:01:33,459 --> 02:01:34,751
Running around...And I...I...

1231
02:01:37,084 --> 02:01:41,209
I'm Dahai, he's Daguo, and you are?

1232
02:01:41,292 --> 02:01:42,626
I'm Daguo

1233
02:01:42,709 --> 02:01:44,501
What's your character's name?

1234
02:01:44,584 --> 02:01:47,167
I'm Dahai, he's Daguo...

1235
02:01:50,126 --> 02:01:51,917
What's your name?

1236
02:01:52,001 --> 02:01:54,501
I'm Ma Yun...Ma Yuan

1237
02:02:04,292 --> 02:02:07,167
Again. I almost fell off

1238
02:02:07,417 --> 02:02:08,751
I almost...

1239
02:02:09,334 --> 02:02:10,459
You want me to do it again?

1240
02:02:10,542 --> 02:02:12,042
Sorry, sorry...

1241
02:02:14,751 --> 02:02:16,251
I don't know how to draw it

1242
02:02:26,709 --> 02:02:30,667
It's so cold that I can't speak. Again!

1243
02:02:31,626 --> 02:02:32,917
...there are no Howards

1244
02:02:33,542 --> 02:02:34,584
Cowards!

1245
02:02:38,292 --> 02:02:39,667
You said your mother killed you

1246
02:02:40,334 --> 02:02:41,917
You said your mother killed you!

1247
02:02:45,834 --> 02:02:48,084
Wait, I sang the wrong song

1248
02:02:48,334 --> 02:02:51,751
The evening...I've forgotten

1249
02:02:51,834 --> 02:02:54,251
The evening sun...

1250
02:02:54,334 --> 02:02:59,542
"The evening sun is setting in the west"

1251
02:02:59,626 --> 02:03:05,417
"The evening sun is setting in the west"

1252
02:03:09,251 --> 02:03:10,792
What lake?

1253
02:03:11,334 --> 02:03:12,834
Weishan Lake! Again

1254
02:03:12,917 --> 02:03:15,376
They're at Weishan Lake!

1255
02:03:19,002 --> 02:03:29,136
