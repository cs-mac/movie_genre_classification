1
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,229
<i></i><i>Ghosts are real.</i>

2
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,234
<i>This much I know.</i>

3
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,508
<i>The first time I saw one,</i>
<i>I was 10 years old.</i>

4
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,248
<i>It was my mother's.</i>

5
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,853
<i>Black cholera had taken her.</i>

6
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:31,523
<i>So, father ordered</i>
<i>a closed casket,</i>
<i>asked me not to look.</i>

7
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,594
<i>There were to be</i>
<i>no parting kisses.</i>

8
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,699
<i>No good-byes.</i>
And the lord said unto me,

9
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:44,203
-<i> no last words.</i>
- "Take thy place beside me."

10
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:48,607
<i>That is, until the night</i>
<i>she came back.</i>

11
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,016
My child.

12
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,186
When the time comes,

13
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,889
beware of crimson peak.

14
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,906
<i>It would be years</i>
<i>before I again</i>
<i>heard such a voice...</i>

15
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,311
<i>Or understood</i>
<i>its desperate warning.</i>

16
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,414
<i>A warning</i>
<i>from out of time...</i>

17
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,886
<i>And one that</i>
<i>I came to understand</i>

18
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,888
<i>only when it was too late.</i>

19
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,401
Barley mead and ale!

20
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,404
I got sweet and bitter!

21
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,673
Barley mead and ale!

22
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,743
Apple, sir?

23
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,847
Straight out of the oven
this morning!

24
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,301
Edith.

25
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,038
Alan.
When did you get back?
Two weeks ago.

26
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,439
I thought
eunice had told you.

27
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,241
No, I ha--
i hadn't heard.

28
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,745
Oh. She made
a conquest in London.

29
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,780
What are you
doing here?

30
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,949
I'm setting up
my practice upstairs.

31
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,550
I'm to meet Ogilvie
at 10:00

32
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,786
to see if he wants
to publish my manuscript.

33
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,889
- You do know it's only 9:00.
- I know, but I couldn't
wait any longer.

34
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,425
And I want to make
some corrections
anyway, so--

35
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,727
if you have any free time,
please come and visit.

36
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,097
We met him at the
British museum last fall
when we were visiting Alan.

37
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,900
- Mother.
- You wouldn't believe it.
He's so handsome.

38
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,437
And he has crossed
the ocean with his sister,
only to see eunice again.

39
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,239
Mother,
he's here on business.

40
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,740
It seems
he's a baronet.

41
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,810
What's a baronet?
Well, an aristocrat
of some sort.

42
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,913
A man
that feeds off land
that others work for him.

43
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,916
A parasite with a title.

44
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,754
This parasite
is perfectly charming,
and a magnificent dancer.

45
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,923
Although that
wouldn't concern you,
would it, Edith?

46
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,658
Our very own
Jane Austen.

47
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,695
- Though she died
a spinster, no?
- Mother, please.

48
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,596
That's all right.
Actually, Mrs. mcmichael,

49
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,132
I would prefer
to be Mary shelley.

50
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,001
She died a widow.

51
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,669
Alan.

52
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,156
Ah, miss cushing.

53
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,592
You're early.
Just a little.

54
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,003
A ghost story.

55
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,474
Your father
didn't tell me
it was a ghost story.

56
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,008
Oh. It's-- it's not.

57
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,379
It's more a story
with a ghost in it.
Mm-hmm.

58
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,314
The ghost
is just a metaphor.

59
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,082
A metaphor?

60
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,584
For the past.

61
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,486
Well,
lovely handwriting.

62
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,488
Nice, confident loops.

63
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,025
Miss cushing,
may I offer
a word of advice?

64
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,595
He told me
it needed a love story.

65
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,597
Can you believe that?

66
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,665
Ogilvie's old-fashioned.

67
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,001
He said that just
because I'm a woman.

68
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,071
Everyone falls in love, dear,
even women.

69
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,240
I don't want to write
a love story like that.

70
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:53,345
Well, my darling,
i was hoping to make this
a celebratory gift.

71
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,913
I'm a builder, dear.

72
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,582
If there's
one thing I know,

73
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,918
it's the importance
of the right tool
for the job.

74
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,053
It's beautiful.

75
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,690
But actually, father,
i was hoping to type it,
in your office.

76
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,092
Type it?

77
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,794
I'm submitting it to
<i> the Atlantic monthly,</i>

78
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:12,197
but I realize now
that my handwriting
is too feminine.

79
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,765
It gives me away.

80
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,134
Without a doubt.

81
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,308
But what you must appreciate
is the way that the molding

82
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,111
is incorporated into
the overall design
of the clock.

83
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,119
It'll take me all day,

84
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,421
but it does make it
look rather handsome,
don't you think?

85
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,122
Yes.

86
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,129
Good morning, miss.
Forgive the interruption.

87
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,432
I have an appointment
with Mr. Carter
Everett cushing.

88
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,635
- Goodness.
With the great man himself.
- I'm afraid so.

89
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,172
"Sir Thomas sharpe,
baronet."

90
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,209
He'll be here shortly.
Thank you.

91
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,245
You're not late,
are you?

92
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,247
He hates that.
Uh, not at all.

93
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,782
In fact,
I'm a little early.

94
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,951
Oh, I'm afraid
he hates that too.

95
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,687
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to pry,
but, uh,

96
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,989
this is a piece of fiction,
is it not?
Yes.

97
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,691
Who are you
transcribing this for?

98
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,827
It's to be sent
to New York tomorrow,
to<i> the Atlantic monthly.</i>

99
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,663
Well, whoever wrote it
it's, um,

100
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,600
rather good,
don't you think?
Really?

101
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,902
It certainly
captured my attention.

102
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,007
I wrote it.
It's mine.

103
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,711
Ghosts?

104
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,180
Well, the ghosts
are just a metaphor.
Really--

105
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,848
they've always
fascinated me.

106
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,950
You see,
where I come from,

107
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,119
ghosts are not
to be taken lightly.

108
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,821
Sir Thomas sharpe.

109
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,290
Welcome to
our fair city.

110
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,025
Sir.
It's my pleasure.

111
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,027
I see you've already met
my daughter Edith.

112
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:56,201
The sharpe Clay mines
have been royal purveyors
of the purest Scarlet Clay

113
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,136
since 1796.

114
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:03,341
In its liquid form,
it is so rich in ore
and so malleable

115
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,511
that it can produce
the strongest bricks
and tiles.

116
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,213
Excessive mining
in the last 20 years

117
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,016
has caused most
of our old deposits
to collapse.

118
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,919
This is a Clay harvester
of my own design.

119
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,722
It transports
the Clay upwards
as it digs deep.

120
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,494
I have absolutely
no doubt

121
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:26,164
this machine will
revolutionize Clay mining
as we know it.

122
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,133
Turn it off, please.

123
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,105
Have you tested it?
Full-scale?

124
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,409
Not yet, sir.
We're very close.
But we hope that with funding--

125
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,345
so actually,
what you have is a toy

126
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,080
and some fancy words.

127
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,382
Mr. cushing, i--

128
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,185
you've already tried
and failed

129
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,523
to raise capital
in London,
Edinburgh, Milan--

130
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,191
yes, that's
correct, sir.

131
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,193
And now you're here.

132
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,095
Correct again, sir.

133
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,533
The men at this table,
all of us,

134
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:05,036
came up through honest,
hard work.

135
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,872
Well, maybe not all of us.
Mr. ferguson here is a lawyer.

136
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,375
But even
he can't help that.

137
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,777
I started
as a steel worker,

138
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,380
raising buildings
before I could own them.

139
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,883
My hands, feel them.

140
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,418
Rough.

141
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,154
The reflection of who I am.

142
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:27,125
Now, you, sir,
when I shook your hand--

143
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,997
you've got
the softest hands
I've ever felt.

144
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,736
In America
we bank on effort,
not privilege.

145
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,704
That is how we built
this country.

146
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,075
I'm here with all
that I possess, sir.

147
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:48,246
A name, a patch of land
and the will to make it yield.

148
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,483
The least
that you can Grant me
is the courtesy of your time

149
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,152
and the chance to prove
to you and these fine gentlemen

150
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,356
that my will, dear sir,
is at the very least
as strong as yours.

151
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,199
I need a corset.

152
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,102
No, you don't.
You look very handsome.

153
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,605
Do I?
Yes, you do, young man.

154
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,308
I do wish
you'd change your mind
and come along tonight.

155
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,845
Mrs. mcmichael has gone
to a lot of trouble.

156
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,515
Little lord fauntleroy
will be there.

157
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,483
You mean Thomas sharpe?

158
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,986
Sir Thomas sharpe,
baronet.

159
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,122
Apparently, he's taken
an interest in young eunice.

160
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,125
I saw you spying
on us, child.

161
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,294
Was his proposal
so outrageous

162
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,064
as to merit such
a harsh answer from you?

163
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,032
It wasn't his proposal,
my love.

164
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,967
It was him.

165
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,737
There's something about him
that I don't like.

166
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,907
What, I don't know.

167
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,711
And I don't like
not knowing.

168
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,979
What I saw was
a dreamer facing defeat.

169
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:58,349
Did you see his suit?

170
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,486
It was beautifully tailored,
but at least a decade old.

171
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,824
I can see
that you observed
far more than I did.

172
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,493
And his shoes
were handmade, but worn.

173
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,994
That'll be
young Dr. mcmichael.

174
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,597
He's brought
his new motorcar
to collect me.

175
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,699
Come and see it.
Say hello to him.

176
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,935
He's just opened
his new practice.

177
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,437
And he's always been
awfully fond of you.

178
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,172
Shh.
I know that, father.

179
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,174
Good evening, Marie.

180
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,843
Good evening,
Dr. mcmichael.

181
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:28,279
Good evening,
Mr. cushing.
Alan.

182
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,683
Hello, Edith.
My, don't we
look smart, Alan.

183
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,452
Oh. It's just something
i threw together.

184
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,689
It's Edith
who should be the belle
of the ball this evening.

185
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,357
Don't you agree, Alan?

186
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,393
As I recall,
Edith takes a dim view
of social frivolity.

187
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,029
You lads
enjoy the party.

188
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,531
Don't let him drink
too much.

189
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,832
Hey.

190
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,036
So, she's not coming.

191
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,105
Stubborn
to the bone.

192
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,074
Where does
she get that from?

193
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,477
I'm not complaining.
I like it.

194
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,464
"Allerdale hall."

195
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,503
Father, did you
forget something?

196
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,053
What is it?
What do you want?

197
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,465
Beware
of crimson peak.

198
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,375
Excuse me, miss.

199
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,777
Are you
all right, miss?
Whatever is it?

200
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,279
Please help me up.

201
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,584
There's a sir Thomas sharpe
at the door.
Thomas sharpe?

202
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,419
He's dripping wet
and most insistent
on coming in.

203
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,022
Well, that's absolutely
out of the question, Annie.

204
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,090
Please, just tell him
to go away.
I tried.

205
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,526
And?
He wants to talk to you.

206
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,101
Miss cushing.
Are you all right?
You seem a little pale.

207
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,038
I'm not all too well,
sir Thomas, I'm afraid.

208
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Father isn't home.
Oh, I know.

209
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,277
I, uh-- I waited in the rain
for him to leave.

210
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,212
Oh.

211
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,249
I know he's going
to the reception
at the mcmichael house,

212
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,284
uh, which is
my destination too.

213
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,555
But that's
in bidwell parkway, sir.
This is masten park.

214
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,390
You're very, very lost.

215
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,727
That I am.
And I desperately need
your help.

216
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,295
My help with what?

217
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,564
Miss cushing, the language,
for one thing.

218
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,968
As you can plainly see,
i do not speak a word
of American.

219
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,638
Tell me, why would you
want to stay here?

220
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,407
All alone.

221
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,182
Alan, this is
sir Thomas sharpe.

222
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,418
Sir Thomas,
Dr. Alan mcmichael.

223
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,319
Best man in town
if you're
feeling poorly.

224
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,156
I've heard so much about you
from mother and my sister.

225
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:42,160
Although, I must confess,
i had a little trouble
understanding your title.

226
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,163
- Baronet?
- Edith kindly
explained it to me.

227
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,733
Edith, this is
lady Lucille sharpe.

228
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,335
My sister.
I'm delighted
to meet you, miss cushing.

229
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,405
You've managed to delay
my brother quite a bit.

230
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,407
Now's the time.

231
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,010
Poor eunice
was growing desperate.

232
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,680
She claims
no gentleman in America knows
how to dance a proper waltz.

233
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,449
Come with me.

234
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,551
Interesting development,
don't you think?

235
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,086
Indeed.

236
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,788
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make some space.

237
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,859
The baronet would like
to demonstrate for us
the waltz.

238
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,961
European style.

239
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,463
Mrs. mcmichael,
i wanted to apologize.

240
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,898
Edith,
we weren't expecting you.
I know.

241
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,600
And I'm sure there's
no place for me--

242
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,068
don't worry, my child.

243
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,204
Everybody has their place.

244
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,139
I'll make sure
you find yours.

245
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,909
The waltz.
Not a complicated dance,
really.

246
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:35,079
The lady takes her place
slightly to the left
of the leading gentleman.

247
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,882
Six basic steps,
and that's all.

248
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,885
However, it is said
that the true test
of the perfect waltz

249
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:46,224
is for it to be so swift,
so delicate and so smooth

250
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:50,328
that a candle flame
will not be extinguished
in the hand of the lead dancer.

251
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,064
Now, that requires...

252
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,199
The perfect partner.

253
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,505
Would you be mine?

254
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,308
I don't think so.
Thank you.

255
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,177
But I'm sure eunice
would be delighted.

256
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,180
I daresay.
But I have asked you.

257
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,676
Why are we doing this?

258
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,846
I've always closed
my eyes to things
that made me uncomfortable.

259
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,448
It makes
everything easier.

260
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,684
I don't want
to close my eyes.

261
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,921
I want to keep them open.

262
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,244
Mr. Holly.

263
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,046
Mr. cushing.

264
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,583
I like the club
the first thing in the morning.
I have it all to myself.

265
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:28,019
A great way
to start the day, sir.

266
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,124
There's a young gentleman
and his sister

267
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,092
I want you
to investigate for me.

268
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,560
Something not quite right
about them.

269
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,964
I want results
as soon as possible.

270
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,469
You have not been using
the drops regularly.

271
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,439
Edith, come in.

272
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,242
And I must insist
you do so.

273
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:55,479
Take this to the druggist
and ask him
to prepare it exactly.

274
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,983
And resume the dose.

275
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,486
<i>Toxicology of the eye.</i>
<i>Morphology of the optic nerve.</i>

276
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,855
<i>Principles</i>
<i>of optical refraction.</i>

277
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,592
And Arthur conan Doyle.

278
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,928
Fancy yourself
a detective?

279
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,666
Well, not really,
but he<i> is</i> an ophthalmologist
just like me.

280
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,771
Come. I think you're gonna like
what I have to show you.

281
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,941
Ghost photography
is easy to fake.

282
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:28,779
However, with glass plates,
it is, by definition,
impossible.

283
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:32,616
I got these in London.
They're genuine.

284
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:36,220
The image is captured using
a coating of silver salts,

285
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,956
invisible to the naked eye.

286
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,659
It's called a latent image.

287
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:44,695
Now, it's my belief
that houses, places,

288
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,798
be it by chemical compound
in the earth

289
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,668
or the minerals
in the stone,
can retain impressions

290
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,604
or a person
that is no longer living.

291
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,141
But not everyone
can see them.

292
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:01,011
The man that just left,
amongst other ailments,
is color-blind.

293
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:05,316
Now, that man
will never perceive
the colors red or green.

294
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,218
He only accepts
their existence

295
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,620
because the majority
around him does.

296
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,590
Perhaps we
only notice things

297
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:15,760
when the time comes
for us to see them.

298
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,334
You've never spoken to me
about these interests
of yours, Alan.

299
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:25,503
You've never given me
the chance.

300
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:31,342
Edith, I understand
your fascination
with the sharpes,

301
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:36,447
but in your own best interest,
proceed with caution
is all I ask.

302
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,183
You've been gone
a long time and, well,

303
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,519
I've managed somewhat.

304
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,190
No, Edith,

305
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,560
I think
every time I read it,
it gets better and better.

306
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,562
And I don't mind
the love story at all.

307
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,765
Just a chapter or two.
Well, I like it.

308
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,067
Let me know
what you think.

309
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,602
I'll finish it now.

310
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,947
Is it a butterfly?

311
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,549
No.

312
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,285
But it
will be soon.

313
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,153
Oh, I hadn't seen them.

314
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,558
They're dying.

315
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,293
They take their heat
from the sun,

316
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,829
and when it deserts them,
they die.

317
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,565
That's sad.

318
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,768
No, it's not sad, Edith.
It's nature.

319
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,103
It's a savage world
of things dying

320
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:36,607
or eating each other
right beneath our feet.

321
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,743
Surely there's more
to it than that.

322
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,047
Beautiful things
are fragile.

323
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,754
At home, we have
only black moths.

324
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:54,592
Formidable creatures,
to be sure,
but they lack beauty.

325
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,695
They thrive on the dark
and the cold.

326
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:00,097
What do they feed on?

327
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,832
Butterflies,
I'm afraid.

328
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,682
Are you sure
about this?

329
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,886
I don't think
she's the right choice.

330
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,355
She's too young.
She's just a child, Thomas.

331
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,724
Lucille,
I've explained all this.

332
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,360
I will need the ring.

333
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,028
The ring's mine.

334
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,863
I earned it.

335
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,033
I<i> will</i> want it back.

336
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:39,537
Then you'd better hope
I'm successful.

337
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,640
This is the last thing
we have to sell.

338
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:45,342
You're not selling it.

339
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,511
We...

340
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,914
Are buying something
with it.

341
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,522
Mr. Holly.
Is something the matter?

342
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,157
Mr. cushing.

343
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,726
It is not often
that I am the bearer
of bad news,

344
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:06,997
but when I am, I insist
upon delivering it myself.

345
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,602
Don't open it here.

346
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,008
Now is the time.

347
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,746
Edith,
may I have a word?

348
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,649
Just one moment.
Let me get my father.

349
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,625
Father.

350
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,360
Everybody's waiting.

351
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:37,928
I'll be there shortly.

352
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,967
Miss cushing.

353
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,036
Edith.
I really have no right
to ask this, but, uh--

354
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,540
sir Thomas.
May I speak with you
in my study, please?

355
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,043
You and your sister,
if you would be so kind
as to fetch her.

356
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,947
Child, please tell our guests
that we will join them
presently.

357
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,588
Now, lady Lucille.

358
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,491
Sir Thomas,
the first time we met,

359
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:11,395
I imagine it was hard
for you to realize
that I didn't like you.

360
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:12,830
You made
that clear enough, sir,

361
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,565
but I had hoped
that now with time--

362
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:17,101
your time,
sir Thomas, is up.

363
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,403
Could you speak plainly,
Mr. cushing?

364
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,472
Plain I will be, missy.

365
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,741
Plainer than you
might like to hear.

366
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,442
In the past few days,

367
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:29,146
your brother
has deemed it fine enough
to mix business with pleasure

368
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,782
by repeatedly engaging
socially with my daughter.

369
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,617
My only daughter.

370
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,588
Sir, I'm aware that I have
no position to offer,
but the fact is--

371
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,657
you are falling in love
with her.

372
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,392
Is that it?

373
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,528
You play the part well.

374
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,333
The other day,
my daughter asked me
why I didn't like you.

375
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,369
Honestly, at the time,
i had no good answer.

376
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:57,241
But now I do.
That document there
gave me my answer.

377
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,347
That's the first
honest reaction
I've seen from you.

378
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,618
- Does she know?
- No.

379
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,821
But I will tell her

380
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,457
if that's what it takes
to send you on your way.

381
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,826
Sir, I know you
will find this
hard to believe--

382
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:18,529
you love her. I know.

383
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,397
You're repeating
yourself.

384
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,068
Now, you-- you seem to be
the more collected one, dear.

385
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,036
It's overly generous,
i know.

386
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,539
But if you want
that check to clear,
there are two conditions.

387
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,208
There's a train
for New York City leaving
first thing tomorrow morning.

388
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,478
You and your brother
better be on it.

389
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,213
Do we understand
each other?

390
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,383
We do. What is
the second condition?

391
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,185
That concerns
my daughter.

392
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:43,887
Tonight you must...

393
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,291
Thoroughly break
her heart.

394
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,997
Ladies and gentlemen,

395
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,167
we have
an unexpected announcement.

396
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,736
Sir Thomas.

397
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,241
Thank you, Mr. cushing.

398
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,613
Ladies and gentlemen,

399
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:15,085
when I first came to America,
my heart was brimming
with a sense of adventure.

400
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,224
Here the future actually
seemed to mean something.

401
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:23,393
I have found
warmth and friendship
among you all.

402
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,730
But for now, farewell.

403
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,433
May we meet again.

404
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,936
Perhaps
on a different shore.

405
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,140
My sister and i
depart for england

406
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,142
just in time
for the winter.

407
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,381
- To lasting friendship.
- To lasting friendship.

408
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,483
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

409
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,556
Edith.

410
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,291
You're leaving us.

411
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,960
We must
return home immediately
and attend to our interests.

412
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,063
And with nothing
to hold us in America--
i see.

413
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,566
Your novel.

414
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,068
I read the new chapters.
I'll have them delivered
in the morning.

415
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,637
That's very good of you.
Thank you.

416
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,206
- Would you still like
to know my thoughts?
- If we must.

417
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,611
It's absurdly sentimental.

418
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:17,581
The aches
that you describe
with such earnestness.

419
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,317
The pain, the loss.
You clearly haven't
lived at all.

420
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,086
In fact, you only seem to know
what other writers tell you.
That's enough.

421
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:26,757
You insist on describing
the torments of love when you
clearly know nothing about them.

422
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,258
I'm not done yet!

423
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,528
What do you dream of?
A kind man?

424
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,864
A pure soul
to be redeemed?

425
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,333
A wounded bird
you can nourish?

426
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,968
Perfection?

427
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,671
Perfection has no place
in love, Edith.

428
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,274
I advise you to return
to your ghosts and fancies.
The sooner, the better.

429
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,710
You know precious little
of the human heart

430
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,012
or love or the pain
that comes with it.

431
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,614
You're nothing
but a spoiled child.

432
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,509
How's the water
today, Benton?

433
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:23,647
Piping hot.
Just the way you like it, sir.

434
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,249
Very well.

435
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:28,151
Be kind enough to order me
some ham and eggs.

436
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:31,021
I'll start with coffee,
if it's hot,

437
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,990
and a sip of port.

438
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,658
Right away, sir.

439
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,526
And<i> the times?</i>

440
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,528
If you'd be so kind.

441
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,573
No. No.

442
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,643
Please.

443
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:36,013
Miss?
What is it, Annie?

444
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:39,282
Your manuscript
was delivered this morning
by sir Thomas sharpe,

445
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,051
but I didn't want
to wake you early.

446
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,120
It's all the same, Annie.
Thank you.

447
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,555
Just leave it there.

448
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,391
The letter too?

449
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,595
Yes, the letter too.

450
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,516
<i>Dear Edith.</i>

451
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,851
<i>By the time you read this,</i>
<i>I will be gone.</i>

452
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:18,321
<i>Your father</i>
<i>made evident to me that in</i>
<i>my present economic condition,</i>

453
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,757
<i>I was not in a position</i>
<i>to provide for you.</i>

454
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,060
<i>And to this I agreed.</i>
Annie!

455
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:26,196
<i>He also asked me</i>
<i>to break your heart.</i>
My coat!

456
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,231
<i>To take the blame.</i>

457
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,535
<i>And to this I agreed too.</i>

458
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:35,672
<i>By this time, surely I have</i>
<i>accomplished both tasks.</i>

459
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,407
<i>But know this.</i>

460
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,910
<i>When I can prove</i>
<i>to your father</i>

461
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:43,380
<i>that all I ask of him</i>
<i>is his consent</i>
<i>and nothing more,</i>

462
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,917
<i>then, and only then,</i>
<i>will I come back for you.</i>

463
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,187
<i>Yours ever, Thomas.</i>

464
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,189
Thomas and Lucille sharpe.

465
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,191
Uh, room 107 and 108.

466
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,793
But-- but wait.
Wait!

467
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,129
Miss! Wait!

468
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,566
Thomas?

469
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,067
Thomas.

470
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,273
Uh, they, uh--
they checked out
this morning, miss,

471
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,476
in time
for the early train.

472
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,846
Are you
all right, miss?

473
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,625
Edith.

474
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,230
Lucille has gone.

475
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:37,400
Your father
bribed me to leave.

476
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,805
I cannot
leave you, Edith.

477
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,242
In fact, I find myself
thinking of you

478
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:48,078
even at the most...

479
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,746
Inopportune moments
of the day.

480
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,283
I feel as if a--

481
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,586
a link exists between
your heart and mine.

482
00:35:56,588 --> 00:36:01,825
And should that link
be broken either
by distance or by time,

483
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,596
then my heart
would cease to beat
and I would die.

484
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,599
And you--

485
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,570
you'd soon
forget about me.
Never.

486
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,506
I would never forget you.

487
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,021
I'm afraid you'll have
to identify the body, Edith.

488
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,823
There's no other way.

489
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,496
Wait!

490
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,867
I came
as soon as I heard.

491
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,203
Edith,
don't look at him.

492
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:23,039
I'll give you
a positive identification.

493
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,674
That is not possible.

494
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,576
I was his
physician, ferguson.
You know that.

495
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,845
And I am his lawyer,
Dr. mcmichael.

496
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,114
I'm sorry.
This is not
a legal formality.

497
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,916
It's obligatory,
I'm afraid.

498
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,361
How did it happen?
Apparently,
he was alone.

499
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,564
The floor was wet.
Uh, no one really knows.

500
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:48,965
May I, sir?

501
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,480
Help me turn him.

502
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,549
Don't touch him
like that.

503
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:09,219
Stop!
Don't touch him like that!
That's my father!

504
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,987
Forgive me. I was--

505
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,491
he's turning 60
next week.

506
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,961
He's afraid of looking
his age, you see.

507
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,500
That's why
he dresses so well.

508
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,670
Why he likes
taking long walks.

509
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,542
His hand feels cold.

510
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,482
Why is it so cold?

511
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,190
Shh, shh.

512
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,926
I'm here for you now.
I'm here.

513
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,688
Whoa!

514
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,591
Ah, young
master sharpe.

515
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:57,994
- Hello, Finlay.
How have you been keeping?
- Never better, sir Thomas.

516
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:01,498
Finlay,
this is my wife.
I know, my lord. I know.

517
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,733
You've been
married a while.

518
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,703
A while?
What is he talking about?

519
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,838
I'm not sure what
he was talking about.

520
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,608
- His family worked
for ours for centuries.
- Who is this?

521
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,376
You never told me
about him.

522
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:17,514
- Oh, he has a collar.
Is he a stray, you think?
- That's impossible.

523
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,015
There's no other house
for miles,

524
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,217
and the town's
half a day's walk away.

525
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,586
Oh, the poor thing.
He's famished.

526
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:27,023
- Can we keep it?
- As you wish.

527
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:30,026
Now, your ladyship,
may I have the honor?

528
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,696
Take the lady's belongings.

529
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,698
I will grab master's.

530
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,602
Take the horses
for their feed
after we finish here.

531
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,317
Goodness.
How many rooms
are there?

532
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,219
I don't know.

533
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,887
Would you like
to count them?

534
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,392
What do you think?

535
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:04,093
Does it look
the part?

536
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,895
It does.

537
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,097
Although it's even colder
inside than out.

538
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,899
I know.
It's a disgrace.

539
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,935
We try to maintain
the house
as best we can,

540
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,903
but with the cold
and the rain,

541
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:17,740
it's impossible to stop
the damp and erosion.

542
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,576
And with the mines
right below,

543
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:24,781
well, the wood is rotting
and the house is sinking.

544
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:28,017
- Take it upstairs,
young master?
- Oh, yes, please.

545
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,253
This one goes
to the dressing room.
Let me show you.

546
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:33,857
But how do you
manage this house?
Just you and Lucille?

547
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,925
It's a privilege
we were born into

548
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,827
and one we can
never relinquish.

549
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,430
But we manage somehow,
my darling.

550
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,499
My workshop's
in the attic.

551
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,101
I can't wait
to show you.

552
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,504
Please, Finlay,
would you take my bags
to the attic?

553
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,072
I'll be up shortly.

554
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,641
Lucille?

555
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,979
Look, these curtains have
been closed for too long.

556
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,814
Would you bring that
over here?

557
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,836
Hey.

558
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:59,008
Where did you get this?

559
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,047
Thomas, I saw a woman
in the elevator.

560
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,549
A woman?
You mean Lucille?
No, it wasn't Lucille.

561
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,352
Must've been a shadow.
That contraption has
a mind of its own.

562
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,854
The wires are affected
by the damp in the house.

563
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:13,756
Connects to the Clay pits,
you see.

564
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,925
And never, ever
go below this level.

565
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,561
What's this thing doing here?

566
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:19,929
Lucille.

567
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:20,997
Thomas.

568
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,040
- Welcome, Edith.
- Thank you.

569
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,611
Well, I went
to the post office.

570
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:36,713
Your machine parts
are here
from Birmingham.

571
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,048
You'll need Finlay
to fetch them.
Excellent.

572
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,718
Is something the matter
with you, Edith?

573
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,454
Something startled me,
that's all.
A shadow.

574
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,723
All that lives in
this house are shadows

575
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:49,092
and creaks and groans.

576
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:52,061
So you better
soothe that boundless
imagination of yours.

577
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:54,564
I just need a proper
welcome, that's all.

578
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:56,265
From now on,
i want this house
to contain

579
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,035
nothing but friendship
and love and warmth.

580
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,908
Warmth would be
an excellent start.

581
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,944
Thomas,
your bride is frozen.

582
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,846
Of course.
Forgive me.

583
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,748
Let's go upstairs,
start a fire at once.

584
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,282
I'll run you
a hot bath.

585
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,818
The pipes
will run red at first
because of the Clay,

586
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,987
but soon
the water will clear.

587
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,456
Oh, Lucille,
when it's convenient,

588
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,692
would you mind
getting me a copy
of the house keys, please?

589
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:24,661
You don't need one.

590
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:26,596
I'm sorry?

591
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:28,698
There are parts of the house
that are unsafe.

592
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,167
It will take you a few days
to familiarize yourself.

593
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,837
Then, should you
still feel you need them,
I'll have copies made.

594
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,677
Come on, Edith.
Come with me.
Let's take you upstairs.

595
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,938
I thought you said
the dog was dead.

596
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,675
I left it out there
on its own.

597
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:15,044
Thought it would perish
in the cold.

598
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,247
How has it survived
all this time?

599
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,717
On scraps,
i suppose.

600
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,885
As we all do.
Well, you needn't worry.

601
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,488
We won't have
to do that anymore.

602
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,225
Won't we? Her money's
not here, is it?
Not yet.

603
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,061
- You have to trust me.
- You chose her.

604
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,133
Why?

605
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:52,548
All right.

606
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,917
Okay, ready?
Fetch.

607
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,425
Come on.

608
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:05,194
To my hand.
Come on. To my hand.
Good boy.

609
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,131
Come on.

610
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,766
Fetch.

611
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:37,220
Hi. Where's your ball?

612
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:40,356
Did you
lose your ball? Hi.

613
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,793
Where'd it go?
Hey, where's the ball, eh?

614
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:45,027
Hi.

615
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,813
This will make you
feel better.

616
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:06,449
What is it?
Firethorn berries.

617
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,552
They're very good
for you.

618
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,289
You don't like it?

619
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,193
It's a little bitter.

620
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:19,929
I'm afraid nothing gentle
ever grows in this land.

621
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:22,331
You need a measure
of bitterness...

622
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,002
Not to be eaten.

623
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,775
What was that?

624
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,278
That's
the east wind.

625
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,682
When it picks up,
the chimneys
form a vacuum,

626
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:43,085
and with the windows
all shuttered up,
the house--

627
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,622
well,
the house breathes.

628
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,859
It's ghastly,
i know.

629
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,028
Now, come here.

630
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,363
I'll have a bath,
i think.

631
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,433
And if you do happen
to fall asleep,
i won't wake you.

632
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,261
"To the hills
we raise our eyes."

633
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,264
I'm sorry.
I interrupted you.

634
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:08,437
That music,
what is it?

635
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,376
An old lullaby
i used to sing to Thomas
when we were young.

636
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:16,779
I can imagine
the two of you in here
as children.

637
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:18,280
You playing music

638
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:21,150
and Thomas coming up
with wild inventions.

639
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,953
We were not allowed
in here as children.

640
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,589
We were confined
to the nursery.

641
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,125
In the attic.

642
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:31,727
Mother played
the piano sometimes.

643
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,399
We'd hear her
through the floor.

644
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,137
That's how we knew
she was back in the country.

645
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,044
Mother.

646
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,979
She looks quite--

647
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:51,580
horrible?

648
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,784
Yes.

649
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,255
It's an excellent
likeness.

650
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:03,592
I like to think
she can see us from up there.

651
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,562
I don't want her to miss
a single thing we do.

652
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,999
Are all
of these books yours?

653
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:10,733
Mother collected
most of these.

654
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,840
Have you heard
of a fore-edge
illustration?

655
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:19,408
No.

656
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,144
There are images hidden
in the book's fore edge.

657
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,515
Carefully dissimulated
until you bend the pages.

658
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,854
So... secrets
everywhere.

659
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:34,423
Well, this can't
shock you

660
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,193
now that Thomas
and you--

661
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,197
he was very respectful
of my mourning.

662
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,099
Nothing happened.

663
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,936
We traveled
in separate cabins.

664
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:49,205
How considerate.

665
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,108
In time,

666
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,844
everything
will be right.

667
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:00,883
It's a pity
to liquidate
all this so quickly.

668
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:02,785
So soon.

669
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,987
Too soon,
don't you think?

670
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,623
All a matter
of opinion,
it seems.

671
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,325
I will need
these crates
shipped.

672
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,429
And to make sure
we get our invoice,

673
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,564
you will send them
to me.

674
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,638
"Thomas sharpe,

675
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,508
baronet."

676
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,499
Come on, doggy.
Come on.

677
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:10,446
Hmm. You like
my workshop, Edith?
It's wonderful.

678
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,418
Did you make
all of these?

679
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,954
I used to carve toys
for Lucille.

680
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,858
And make little trinkets
to keep her happy.

681
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,262
Were you alone
here in the attic
all the time?

682
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,131
Father was
always traveling.

683
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,600
The family fortune
didn't lose itself.

684
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,436
Papa really had
to put his back into it.

685
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,955
It's wonderful.

686
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,226
You're so different.

687
00:54:57,228 --> 00:54:59,428
From who?

688
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,631
From-- from everyone.

689
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,529
What is it?

690
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,497
I thought
i heard a noise.

691
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,203
We were hoping
you were here.

692
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:43,505
I found him wandering
the hallway.

693
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,474
- Made us some tea.
- Oh, you're too kind.

694
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:48,610
Don't mention it.
We needed the company.

695
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,983
Thomas?

696
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:57,519
Uh, not for me,
thank you.

697
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,456
Drink your tea.

698
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,091
It'll warm you.

699
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,977
Thomas.

700
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,512
Thomas?

701
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,851
How did you get in there,
you silly doggy?

702
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:11,553
Wax cylinder recordings.

703
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,980
No, wait.

704
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,453
Enola.

705
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,698
Keep her steady, Finlay.
Yes, sir.

706
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,968
We need more coal,
Finlay.

707
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,603
Yes.

708
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,673
Thomas! Thomas.

709
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,576
Thomas, listen,
i need to talk to you.

710
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,411
Now's not a good time.
Lucille is inside.

711
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:18,780
She can show you the house--
i don't want
to talk to Lucille.

712
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:22,918
I wanna talk to you.
Very well. What is it?

713
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,921
Listen, has anyone died
in this house?

714
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:29,958
Edith, the house
is hundreds of years old.

715
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,894
I'd venture many souls
have come and gone.

716
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,230
But I mean specific deaths,
violent deaths.

717
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,799
- Master sharpe?
- Now is really not a good time.

718
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,969
Try it again, Finlay!

719
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,218
This way.

720
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,155
There.
Should feel better soon.

721
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,360
My hands are getting rough.
Your father would approve.

722
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:11,033
My machine will never work.

723
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:13,101
Never. Why do I keep
deluding myself?

724
01:01:14,772 --> 01:01:17,005
Why did i
bring you here?

725
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,509
Who did you marry?
A failure.

726
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,344
Don't say that.

727
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,179
You're all that I have.

728
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,618
The men leave at nightfall.

729
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,220
We'll be racing
against the snow.

730
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:35,123
Soon we won't be able
to make any progress.

731
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,759
That's when you'll
find out why they call
this crimson peak.

732
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,734
What did you say?

733
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:49,137
Crimson peak.
That's what they call it.

734
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,140
The ore in the red Clay
leach up from the ground
and stain the snow.

735
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:55,243
It turns bright red,
so "crimson peak."

736
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,762
So you asked
to see me.

737
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:15,564
Perhaps it all
ended for the best.

738
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:19,034
Edith seems to
have found happiness.
Don't you agree?

739
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:22,037
I wouldn't know.
I haven't heard a word.

740
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,438
I have.

741
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,441
She has asked me to transfer
all her assets to england.

742
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:30,078
Seems to be investing all of it
in that Clay machine of his,

743
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,114
and I have no recourse
but to obey.

744
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:34,349
There's something
about all this, ferguson.

745
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,918
The manner
of cushing's death,
the impact on his head.

746
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,523
The last check cushing made
was to sir Thomas sharpe.

747
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,592
If I may confide.

748
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:48,130
Before cushing died,
he hired a New York man,
a Mr.-- Mr. Holly.

749
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:51,233
Now, he digs up
these unsavory facts.

750
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:56,438
The fact that this Holly
got involved in all this
just gives me pause.

751
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:36,812
Thomas?

752
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:54,329
If you're here with me,
give me a signal.

753
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,504
Touch my hand.

754
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,538
Leave here now.

755
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,174
Thomas! Thomas!

756
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,479
Edith.

757
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:59,387
His blood will be
on your hands.

758
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,923
- Edith!
- Thomas!

759
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,892
Thomas, come quick!
Edith, what's the matter?

760
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:05,660
A woman in the corridor, there!

761
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,433
There was such a hatred
in her eyes--

762
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,101
and intelligence.

763
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:15,637
She knows who I am
and she wants me
to leave.

764
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,305
Nonsense, my dear.

765
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,407
You're not going
anywhere.

766
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:21,176
You had a bad dream.

767
01:06:21,178 --> 01:06:23,244
You were sleepwalking.
No!

768
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:25,146
I'm afraid I shall go mad
if I stay.

769
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,182
My darling,
you're imagining things.

770
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:30,518
Tomorrow,
why don't we go out?

771
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,922
Uh, to the post office.
I think some fresh air
will do you good.

772
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:36,491
No.

773
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,260
I have to leave.
I have to get away
from here.

774
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:42,163
Edith, this is
your home now.

775
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,600
You have
nowhere else to go.

776
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,677
What is she doing?
How could she know
about mother?

777
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,612
I have no idea.
I haven't told her a thing.

778
01:06:57,614 --> 01:06:59,447
What's she trying to do?

779
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,650
I don't know.
She's in quite a state.

780
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,786
Tomorrow,

781
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:08,323
I'll go to the depot,
pick up the machine parts
and take her with me.

782
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,125
Let her get some fresh air.

783
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:13,495
Yes.
Get her out of here.

784
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:17,432
Once she signs
the final papers,
i want this over with.

785
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:31,479
This is a valve controller
i had fabricated in Glasgow.

786
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:34,015
This could make
all the difference.

787
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:36,184
Think lucky thoughts,
Edith.

788
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:40,021
The sharpe mines might reopen
if this thing cooperates.
Mr. sharpe?

789
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:42,924
- Ah, excellent.
- Thank you.

790
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,492
You're lady sharpe, then?

791
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:47,996
Forgive me, mum,
but there's
a few letters for you.

792
01:07:47,998 --> 01:07:52,233
Two of them
are certified letters
from your solicitor.

793
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:57,439
Um, and another one
comes all the way
from Milan, Italy.

794
01:07:57,441 --> 01:08:00,842
I don't know anyone in Italy.
Respectfully, your ladyship,
it's apparent that you do.

795
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:09,451
Edith,
the storm's picking up.
We ought to leave soon.

796
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:11,252
Otherwise we won't
make it back to the house.

797
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:14,522
If you need to
stay the night, sir Thomas,
we've a small room downstairs.

798
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:16,291
Why not?

799
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,763
And you're sure this is
their forwarding address?

800
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:24,399
Thomas and Lucille sharpe?
Yes, in cumberland,
england, sir.

801
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:25,800
Thank you.

802
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:31,039
- Dr. mcmichael.
- Mr. Holly.

803
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:33,441
At your service, sir.

804
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,279
Did you bring the copy
of the information?

805
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:45,687
Took some time to obtain
that newspaper clipping.

806
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,757
It's damn gruesome,
if you ask me.

807
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,995
It's a shame the only
relevant information
i could pass to Mr. cushing

808
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,563
were the civil documents,

809
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:58,900
but it was enough to impede
any further relationship

810
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:01,302
between sir Thomas
and miss cushing.

811
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,371
Prevent them from marrying.

812
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,908
Why was that?

813
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,476
Because, you see,

814
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,412
sir Thomas
is already married.

815
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:20,522
This fellow cavendish--
your hero--
there's a darkness to him.

816
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:24,425
I like him.
Does he make it
all the way through?

817
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,427
It's entirely up to him.
What do you mean?

818
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:29,197
Well, characters
talk to you.
They transform.

819
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,033
They make choices.

820
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:35,336
Choices.
As to who they become.

821
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,609
Well--

822
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,345
this is rather dismal,
I'm sorry to say.

823
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,981
But at least it's warm.
Oh, I like it much better.

824
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:48,983
Better than what?

825
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:51,686
Better than the house.

826
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,122
Why don't we leave?

827
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:56,791
The house is all we have.

828
01:09:57,626 --> 01:10:01,062
I left everything I was behind.

829
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:02,730
Everything I had.

830
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,966
We could live
anywhere you want.
Anywhere?

831
01:10:04,968 --> 01:10:06,201
London.
London.

832
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:08,570
Paris.
Paris is beautiful.

833
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,539
Milan.

834
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,913
Have you ever been
to Italy?

835
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,883
Yes, I have. Once.

836
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:29,524
The past, Thomas.

837
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:31,826
You're always looking
to the past.

838
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:34,262
You won't find me there.

839
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:35,897
I'm here.

840
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,467
I'm here too.

841
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,926
Finlay, help me carry the valve
controller to my shop.

842
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,494
Lucille?

843
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,764
Lucille, we're back.

844
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,146
I was making breakfast.

845
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,948
It was burning.
I moved it.

846
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,521
Where were you?

847
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:45,126
We, uh--
we got snowed in.

848
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:46,828
You didn't come home
last night.

849
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,030
We spent the night
at the depot.

850
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,638
You slept there?

851
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,907
What's wrong
with that, Lucille?
He's my husband.

852
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,213
This is all a game to you!

853
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:07,081
I was frantic!

854
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,517
What are you talking about?

855
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:14,155
You two-- alone--

856
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:15,890
in the storm.

857
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,129
I didn't know
if you had an accident.

858
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,572
I was all alone.

859
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,911
I can't be alone.

860
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,917
Are these from America?

861
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:44,485
I don't feel well.

862
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,089
I'll make you tea.

863
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,980
That dreadful noise.

864
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,851
The more the house sinks,
the worse it gets.

865
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,824
We must do something
about it.

866
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,235
<i>My dear Edith,</i>

867
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:37,572
<i>please be advised</i>
<i>that the first transfer</i>
<i>of your father's estate</i>

868
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,106
<i>has been completed.</i>

869
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:41,742
<i>Now, the final transaction</i>
<i>for the remaining sum</i>

870
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:44,745
<i>will require your signature</i>
<i>on the document enclosed.</i>

871
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,482
<i>Yours very truly,</i>
<i>William ferguson.</i>

872
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,508
Enola.

873
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,803
It's working, Finlay.
Right, master.

874
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:00,721
A gramophone player.

875
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:11,732
Milan.

876
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,036
Edinburgh.

877
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:18,706
<i>You've already tried</i>
<i>and failed to raise capital</i>

878
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:23,210
in London, Edinburgh, Milan,

879
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,079
and now you're here.

880
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,027
Isn't it beautiful?

881
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:48,162
It's been working perfectly
for an hour.

882
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,364
Oh. We've done it.

883
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:52,700
We've done it, Lucille.

884
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,371
I can't wait
for Edith to see it.

885
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,006
Edith?

886
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,276
- I did this with you.
- Yes, of course, you did.

887
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,278
Yeah.
We did this together.
Lady sharpe?

888
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,713
No one else.

889
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:07,982
We'll need more coal
to test the steamer.

890
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:11,118
Would you mind, Lucille?
Sparing a bit more coal?

891
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,723
Uh, you just need
to give him the key.
He'll fetch it.

892
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,925
Lucille?

893
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,705
Edith?

894
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:36,410
Edith?

895
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:44,885
Edith?

896
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:06,207
I want to apologize
for my behavior
this morning.

897
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:07,942
I was concerned that--

898
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,578
you didn't drink your tea.

899
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,780
I don't feel so well.

900
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,783
Would you mind bringing me
some cold water?

901
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,757
Of course.

902
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:38,205
Have you had a chance
to read your letters?

903
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,441
Yes. Just some papers
for me to sign,

904
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:44,311
from my lawyers
to finish the transfer
of funds.

905
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:53,320
I should
let you rest.

906
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,894
You'll feel better soon.

907
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:48,275
Let's see
what we have here.

908
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,350
<i> This is Pamela upton</i>

909
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,552
<i> testing</i>
<i> the wax cylinder recording</i>

910
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:01,956
<i> bought in this most</i>
<i> jubilant year, 1887,</i>

911
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,191
<i> for my beloved</i>
<i> Thomas sharpe.</i>

912
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,229
<i>Thomas, speak into the horn.</i>
<i>Say something.</i>

913
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:10,731
<i>It's a beautiful machine,</i>
<i>Pamela,</i>

914
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:12,299
<i>but no, thank you.</i>

915
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:13,801
<i>I'd rather not.</i>

916
01:21:13,803 --> 01:21:15,369
<i> Say something, Thomas.</i>

917
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,605
<i>What do you want me</i>
<i>to say, exactly?</i>

918
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:21,542
<i> Say... that you love me.</i>

919
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:27,414
Margaret mcdermott.

920
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:29,984
<i>Ding dong, bell.</i>

921
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:33,520
<i>Kitty's in the well.</i>
<i>Who put her in?</i>

922
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,556
<i>Little Johnny thin.</i>

923
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:37,925
<i>Who pulled her out?</i>

924
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:41,595
<i>Little Johnny stout.</i>

925
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:45,633
<i>Oh, what a naughty boy</i>
<i>was that who tried</i>
<i>to drown poor pussycat.</i>

926
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:54,041
Enola sciotti. E.S.

927
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:58,379
<i> We had plans to leave,</i>
<i> but I can't.</i>

928
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:00,247
<i> All they want</i>
<i> is my money</i>

929
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:03,117
<i> to work on that</i>
<i> infernal machine of his.</i>

930
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:05,619
<i> That's all</i>
<i> they care about.</i>

931
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,424
<i> I will hide</i>
<i> these cylinders away</i>

932
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,960
<i> in the linen closet.</i>

933
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:14,561
<i> Should anyone find them,</i>

934
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:17,631
<i> let it be known</i>
<i> that they did this.</i>

935
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:28,042
<i> I must stop recording now.</i>
<i> I can hear them coming.</i>

936
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:29,977
A baby.

937
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:33,614
<i> To whoever finds this,</i>
<i> know that they</i>
<i> are killing me.</i>

938
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,582
<i> I'm dying.</i>

939
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,254
<i> The poison</i>
<i> is in the tea.</i>

940
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:46,727
<i> Find my body.</i>
<i> Take it home.</i>

941
01:22:46,729 --> 01:22:48,729
<i> I don't want to die.</i>

942
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:53,033
I have to get out of here.

943
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,243
You're awake.

944
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:40,447
We found you at the bottom
of the stairs.

945
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,717
Do you feel better?
I need to go to town.

946
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,955
See a doctor.
Yes, of course.

947
01:23:47,957 --> 01:23:51,191
But I'm afraid
we're snowed in.
No.

948
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:57,364
Then you must eat.

949
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:01,402
You must get stronger.

950
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:07,207
I tended mother in this bed.

951
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:10,911
Father

952
01:24:10,913 --> 01:24:12,713
was a brute.

953
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:16,116
He hated mother.

954
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:19,753
Broke her leg.

955
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,729
Snapped it in two
under his boot.

956
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:31,331
She never quite healed.

957
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:36,570
She was bedridden
for a long time.

958
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:41,108
But I...

959
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,244
Cared for her.

960
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,848
Fed her,

961
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,850
bathed her,

962
01:24:49,852 --> 01:24:52,186
combed her hair,

963
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:57,157
rubbed liniment on her scars.

964
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:00,627
I made her better.

965
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,532
I'll do the same with you.

966
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:10,204
I'll make you better.

967
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:16,110
May I have a moment alone
with my wife?

968
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,284
You'll be out of this bed soon.

969
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,553
I promise.

970
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,570
Don't drink that.

971
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,242
Never.

972
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:03,123
Lucille, she's very sick.
She's dying.
Of course she's dying.

973
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:05,425
She knows everything.

974
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:08,595
She stopped
drinking the tea.

975
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:13,333
Doesn't matter.
I put the poison
in the porridge.

976
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,603
Lucille, stop it!

977
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,941
Do we have to do this?
Must we?

978
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:22,576
Yes.

979
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:26,446
You have no idea
what they'd do.

980
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,883
I would be taken from here.

981
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:32,853
Locked away.

982
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:38,158
You would be hanged.

983
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,993
We stay together.

984
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:42,229
Never apart.

985
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,432
You couldn't leave me.

986
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,636
You wouldn't.
I can't.

987
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,908
I can't.

988
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,810
I know.

989
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:08,889
Whoa!

990
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,328
There's a gentleman out there
asking for directions
to allerdale hall.

991
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:15,729
At this hour?
Yeah.

992
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:18,699
Surely not.
Can't get there
on that horse.

993
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:20,100
It's exhausted.

994
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:23,937
Can I hire one from you?
We're closed
for the winter.

995
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:28,408
Can I get there on foot?
It's well over four hours
following the road.

996
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,677
Then I'd better get going.

997
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:33,614
Sir!
Meet me there
after the storm.

998
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,456
I know who you are.

999
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:20,627
Your name is enola sciotti.

1000
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,333
Tell me
what you want from me.

1001
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:24,691
Shh.

1002
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:55,889
- It's all out in the open now.
- No need to pretend.

1003
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,092
This is who I am.
This is who he is.

1004
01:29:59,094 --> 01:30:01,061
- I knew it.

1005
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:03,764
- Don't do it, Lucille!
- I knew it.

1006
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:05,565
Someone's at the door!
You're not his sister!

1007
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,334
That's delightful.

1008
01:30:07,336 --> 01:30:10,036
Aaah!

1009
01:30:10,038 --> 01:30:11,571
- I am.
- Don't do it!

1010
01:30:13,342 --> 01:30:15,842
Aaah!

1011
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:53,513
Hello, Edith.

1012
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:58,718
Try not to move
or talk just yet.
You're heavily sedated.

1013
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:02,222
I needed to sedate you
to set your leg.

1014
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:04,624
You're going
to be fine.

1015
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:10,130
Forgive me
for dropping in unannounced.

1016
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:12,232
Heaven-sent,
as it turns out.

1017
01:31:12,234 --> 01:31:14,167
I should have
sent a wire, but...

1018
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,137
I thought you'd enjoy
the surprise.

1019
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:19,239
It's a miracle.
We didn't know
what to do.

1020
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:21,608
She's so ill.
Delirious.

1021
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:25,145
Then she fell
down the stairs.
She spoke to me.

1022
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:27,414
Who spoke to you?
My mother.

1023
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:30,016
She was delivering a warning.

1024
01:31:30,018 --> 01:31:31,751
Crimson peak.

1025
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:35,489
Delirious, you see?
Poor thing.

1026
01:31:35,491 --> 01:31:37,657
Yes. I see.

1027
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:45,198
Here. Try to drink.
No, not that.

1028
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,767
Not that.

1029
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:51,771
You will stay here
with us, won't you?

1030
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:54,374
Wait for the storm
to pass.

1031
01:31:54,376 --> 01:31:56,510
If you insist.

1032
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:59,613
But now I need
a moment alone
with my patient.

1033
01:31:59,615 --> 01:32:02,015
We'll leave you then,
doctor.

1034
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:08,288
Edith, listen to me.

1035
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,557
I'm here
to take you away.

1036
01:32:10,559 --> 01:32:14,127
You hear?
I'm taking you
with me now.

1037
01:32:14,129 --> 01:32:16,563
Somebody has to stop him.

1038
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:20,166
Lucille, please.

1039
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:21,635
What are you doing?

1040
01:32:21,637 --> 01:32:24,804
I just want to know,
brother.

1041
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:26,873
Is it going to be you
this time?

1042
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,378
Show me
you can stand up.

1043
01:32:33,482 --> 01:32:35,148
All right.

1044
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:37,951
Shh.

1045
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,222
I won't let them
harm you.

1046
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,696
I'm gonna
find you a coat.

1047
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:51,698
Don't go.
I'll be right back.

1048
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,067
Things are getting
a bit emotional,
i see, doctor.

1049
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:57,837
She's exhausted.

1050
01:32:57,839 --> 01:33:00,373
She's showing signs
of anemia.

1051
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:03,310
I'm gonna take her
to a hospital.
That won't be necessary.

1052
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,918
I'm afraid it is.

1053
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:16,756
You've been
poisoning her.

1054
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,695
Edith.

1055
01:33:21,697 --> 01:33:24,631
Front page.
The<i> cumberland ledger.</i>

1056
01:33:24,633 --> 01:33:28,301
Lady Beatrice sharpe
was murdered
in the bathtub.

1057
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:33,807
One brutal blow
almost split her head
in two.

1058
01:33:33,809 --> 01:33:36,309
No suspect
was ever arrested.

1059
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:39,245
There was no one else
in the house at the time.

1060
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:40,780
Only the children.

1061
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:43,550
The truth was too horrible
to consider.

1062
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,151
- Doctor, stop it.
- You did this.

1063
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:49,055
No.
Sir Thomas, you were
only 12 at the time.

1064
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:51,057
After questioning
by the police,

1065
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:52,959
you were sent
to boarding school.

1066
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:56,229
As for Lucille, at 14,
her story is less clear.

1067
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:59,799
A convent education
in Switzerland,
the news account says,

1068
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:02,802
but I think a different kind
of institution.

1069
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:09,009
Sir Thomas
is already married.

1070
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:11,244
He married
a miss Pamela upton.

1071
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:15,915
Margaret mcdermott
and enola sciotti-- e.S.

1072
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:18,184
- Edith, you don't know.
- Edith and I are leaving.

1073
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:49,783
You stay there.

1074
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:53,853
Edith. Edith.

1075
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:58,625
- You should do this.
- Get your hands dirty.

1076
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:06,466
Come here, doggy.

1077
01:35:06,468 --> 01:35:08,868
Little shit.

1078
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:11,371
If I don't do it,
she will.

1079
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,407
But listen to me.

1080
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:17,877
You're a doctor.

1081
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,882
Show me where.

1082
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:38,998
No! Alan!

1083
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:43,169
You're monsters!

1084
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:45,338
Both of you!

1085
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:48,708
Funny.

1086
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:51,911
That's the last thing
mother said too.

1087
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:17,871
Lucille has taken Edith
to sign the papers.

1088
01:36:17,873 --> 01:36:20,106
The moment
she signs those papers,
she is dead.

1089
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:22,876
I have to go.
I'll bring her down here.

1090
01:36:22,878 --> 01:36:24,944
I'll find a way.

1091
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:27,213
The mine shaft is open,
you understand?

1092
01:36:27,215 --> 01:36:28,948
Get out up there.

1093
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,751
Can you hold on?
Go.

1094
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,837
You thought
you were a writer.

1095
01:36:54,576 --> 01:36:56,976
With your ghosts.

1096
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:01,247
What are you waiting for?
You have nothing
to live for now.

1097
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:03,149
Sign.

1098
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:06,419
All the women we found--

1099
01:37:06,421 --> 01:37:10,423
London, Edinburgh, Milan--

1100
01:37:10,425 --> 01:37:13,326
America.
Yes, America.

1101
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:18,698
All had what was necessary:
Money, broken dreams

1102
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,700
and no living relatives.

1103
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:22,769
No one ever looked
for them.

1104
01:37:22,771 --> 01:37:25,939
Mercy killings, really.

1105
01:37:25,941 --> 01:37:28,107
Is that what
I'm going to be?

1106
01:37:28,109 --> 01:37:32,011
What about
the Italian woman?
Enola.

1107
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:34,013
You killed her baby.

1108
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:37,784
I did not.

1109
01:37:37,786 --> 01:37:41,221
None of them
ever fucked Thomas.

1110
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:46,125
Don't you understand?
It was mine.

1111
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:52,031
It was born wrong.

1112
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,903
We should have let it die
at birth, but...

1113
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,073
I wanted it.

1114
01:38:00,075 --> 01:38:02,308
And she told me
she could save it.

1115
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:05,445
She was determined.

1116
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,249
She lied.

1117
01:38:09,251 --> 01:38:11,851
All this horror--
for what?

1118
01:38:11,853 --> 01:38:15,021
The money?
To keep the mansion?

1119
01:38:15,023 --> 01:38:16,990
The sharpe name, the mines?

1120
01:38:16,992 --> 01:38:19,225
The marriages were
for money, of course.

1121
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:24,564
But the horror--
the horror
was for love.

1122
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:31,070
The things we do
for a love like this
are ugly, mad,

1123
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,140
full of sweat and regret.

1124
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:39,479
This love burns you
and maims you, and...

1125
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,182
Twists you inside out.

1126
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:46,619
It is a monstrous love,

1127
01:38:48,188 --> 01:38:51,524
and it makes monsters
of us all.

1128
01:38:51,526 --> 01:38:56,496
But you should have seen him,
as a child, Thomas.

1129
01:38:59,633 --> 01:39:01,434
He was perfect.

1130
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:07,874
So from all
his small infractions,

1131
01:39:07,876 --> 01:39:10,777
from my mother's cane,
i protected him.

1132
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:13,313
I took so many beatings.

1133
01:39:14,815 --> 01:39:17,116
And when she found out
about us--

1134
01:39:17,885 --> 01:39:19,485
well,

1135
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:28,561
the only love
Thomas and I ever knew
was from one another

1136
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,664
in these rotting walls.

1137
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,068
Hiding.

1138
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:38,071
- That's not true.
- You suffocate him.

1139
01:39:38,073 --> 01:39:40,473
Sign your name!

1140
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:43,543
Sign your bloody name!

1141
01:39:55,256 --> 01:39:58,925
My father,
who killed him?

1142
01:39:58,927 --> 01:40:03,496
Such a coarse,
condescending man.

1143
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:06,933
He loved you.

1144
01:40:06,935 --> 01:40:09,102
You should have
seen his sad face

1145
01:40:09,104 --> 01:40:12,271
when I smashed it
at the sink.

1146
01:40:42,636 --> 01:40:44,804
You! Don't come near me!
Listen to me,
please, Edith.

1147
01:40:44,806 --> 01:40:47,306
You get away!
Edith, please.

1148
01:40:47,308 --> 01:40:48,841
Listen.
Mcmichael is still alive.
He's still alive.

1149
01:40:48,843 --> 01:40:50,309
You lied to me!
I did.

1150
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:51,978
You poisoned me!
I did.

1151
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:54,147
You told me you loved me!
I do.

1152
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:58,484
Edith, please.
Please trust me
one more time.

1153
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:00,853
You can leave
if you want,

1154
01:41:00,855 --> 01:41:02,688
or you can wait here
for me.

1155
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:05,224
I'm gonna get those papers back.

1156
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,260
I'm gonna finish this.

1157
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:21,407
You burnt them.

1158
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,111
Lucille.

1159
01:41:27,047 --> 01:41:28,581
You burnt them.

1160
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:31,584
Yes, she will live.
You're not to touch her.

1161
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,186
You're ordering me?

1162
01:41:33,188 --> 01:41:35,388
We can leave, Lucille,
leave allerdale hall.

1163
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:38,558
Leave?
Think about it.
We can start a new life.

1164
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,359
Where?
Anywhere.
It doesn't matter.

1165
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:42,095
Where would we go?
We can leave it behind.

1166
01:41:42,097 --> 01:41:43,596
We let the sharpe name
die with the mines.

1167
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:45,631
We let this edifice sink
in the ground.

1168
01:41:45,633 --> 01:41:47,233
All these years
holding these walls together.

1169
01:41:47,235 --> 01:41:49,135
We would be free.

1170
01:41:50,904 --> 01:41:53,039
Free, Lucille.

1171
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:54,807
We could all be together.

1172
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:01,781
All?

1173
01:42:06,053 --> 01:42:08,321
Do you love her?
This day had to come.

1174
01:42:08,323 --> 01:42:09,889
We've been dead for years.
Do you?

1175
01:42:09,891 --> 01:42:11,724
You promised.
You and i
in this rotting place.

1176
01:42:11,726 --> 01:42:13,960
Look at who we are,
what we've become!
Do you love her more than me?

1177
01:42:13,962 --> 01:42:16,229
You promised you
would not fall in love
with anyone else.

1178
01:42:16,231 --> 01:42:18,297
Yes, but it happened.

1179
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,578
Lucille.

1180
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:00,740
Lucille.

1181
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:25,531
Thomas?

1182
01:43:29,636 --> 01:43:31,237
Thomas.

1183
01:44:57,491 --> 01:45:00,493
Shh. She's coming.

1184
01:45:00,495 --> 01:45:03,062
I'm going to get us
out of here.
I will get help.

1185
01:45:03,064 --> 01:45:04,897
You have to trust me.

1186
01:45:04,899 --> 01:45:07,066
I'll come back for you.
I promise I will.

1187
01:45:07,068 --> 01:45:08,634
Shh. Hide.

1188
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:41,901
Before they put me away,

1189
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,808
I kept a little souvenir--

1190
01:45:57,384 --> 01:45:59,018
from mother.

1191
01:47:00,447 --> 01:47:03,449
Edith?

1192
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:18,624
I won't stop

1193
01:48:18,626 --> 01:48:22,194
till you kill me
or I kill you.

1194
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,701
Help me.

1195
01:48:28,703 --> 01:48:31,804
There's no one
here to help you.
Yes, there is.

1196
01:48:31,806 --> 01:48:34,673
Look at him. Turn around.

1197
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,261
Thomas.
Lucille.

1198
01:49:03,404 --> 01:49:04,970
I won't stop...

1199
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,641
Until you kill me

1200
01:49:08,643 --> 01:49:10,209
or I kill you.

1201
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:18,551
I heard you the first time.

1202
01:50:02,796 --> 01:50:04,396
<i></i><i>Ghosts are real.</i>

1203
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:09,768
<i>This much I know.</i>

1204
01:50:20,413 --> 01:50:23,215
- Lady sharpe!
- Lady sharpe!

1205
01:50:23,217 --> 01:50:28,854
<i>There are things</i>
<i>that tie them to a place,</i>
<i>very much like they do us.</i>

1206
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:35,294
<i>Some remain tethered</i>
<i>to a patch of land,</i>

1207
01:50:36,329 --> 01:50:38,063
<i>a time and date,</i>

1208
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:40,966
<i>the spilling of blood,</i>

1209
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:45,070
<i>a terrible crime.</i>

1210
01:50:48,808 --> 01:50:50,843
<i>But there are others--</i>

1211
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:54,747
<i>others that hold on</i>
<i>to an emotion,</i>

1212
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:58,684
<i>a drive,</i>

1215
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:08,827
<i>Or love.</i>

1216

<i>Those--</i>

1217
01:51:18,304 --> 01:51:20,172
