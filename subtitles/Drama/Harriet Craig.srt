1
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:33,465
Yeah. Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick

3
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:36,374
Nickelodeon.

4
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:52,256
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:55,561
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

6
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:58,033
Give it, give it

7
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,763
Yeah, yeah

8
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:26,857
Whoo, yeah, yeah

9
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,631
It's Harriet the spy

10
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,137
Spies look at the eye

11
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:33,231
Now there she go
like looking at

12
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:37,768
Say why, hi, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my

13
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:40,782
Dig it, dig it, yeah

14
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:43,479
There she,
there she go, go, go

15
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,524
There she go now

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,119
Look at the spy

17
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,653
Hey, watch her, watch her,
watch her

18
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,960
She's a spy, my, my

19
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,057
Dig it, dig it

20
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,129
Oh, yeah

21
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:34,638
She's lookin'
in your eye, eye

22
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:37,577
Why? I don't know

23
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:14,345
Whoa, yeah.

24
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,903
Boy with ringlets.

25
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,635
Man with tattoos.

26
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:40,516
Girl on...

27
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,213
a leash?

28
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:45,188
Man, if my parents ever tried

29
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:48,249
putting me in one
of those things,

30
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:50,021
I'd trade them in.

31
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,758
This kid looks like
she can roll over and fetch.

32
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,957
I learn everything I can

33
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,162
and I write down
everything I see.

34
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:00,434
Golly says if I want
to be a writer

35
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,202
then I'd better start now.

36
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,710
Which is why I am a spy.

37
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,381
Lady with a purse.

38
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,393
Man with...

39
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:22,021
her wallet.

40
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,656
Oh, help!

41
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,428
Please!

42
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:28,692
Stop him!

43
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:30,137
Stop him!

44
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,352
Quack

45
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,416
Quack, quack

46
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,926
Quack

47
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,589
Quack, quack

48
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,996
And... done.

49
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,771
What is it?

50
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:00,773
It's Nanomichi.

51
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:02,901
You know, the god
of storm and thunder.

52
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,878
- Cool, huh?
- Okay, come on, hurry up

53
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:05,879
before it dries.

54
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:06,880
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:08,404
Okay, ready?

56
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,711
Here, give me
your foot.

57
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,218
The secret tattoo.

58
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:14,153
My best friends Sport,
Janie and I thought

59
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,054
we should be blood buddies.

60
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:18,457
But this was so much
less painful.

61
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,961
Just remember the rule.

62
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,991
If anyone sees
the secret tattoo...

63
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,470
...swift and painful death.

64
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,314
It's... starting.

65
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:45,856
Here comes...

66
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:50,260
nice Marion Hawthorne.

67
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,592
It's happening.

68
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:53,725
I can feel it happening.

69
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,166
Good Lord.

70
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,227
It's the dreaded
Hawthorne effect.

71
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,671
Oh.

72
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,205
Good morning, Janie, Simon...

73
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:10,183
and Harriet.

74
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,612
Harri... et!

75
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,524
I got to get to class.

76
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,356
See ya.

77
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,454
See you guys in a few.

78
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,262
Sixth grade.

79
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:32,210
All the usual suspects
are back in action.

80
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:36,044
First of all there's
Rachel Hennessy,

81
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:38,242
Marion's second in command.

82
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,718
The only thing more pathetic
than being Marion Hawthorne

83
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:45,246
is wanting to be
Marion Hawthorne.

84
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,357
Pinky Whitehead,

85
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:51,387
the human fish belly.

86
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,798
If Janie's theory is right,
then Pinky's DNA

87
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,668
was combined with a pint
of vanilla yogurt at birth.

88
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:59,299
Carrie Andrews thinks
she's cool...

89
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:03,377
'cause she spent her summer
vacation growing boobs.

90
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:09,074
Laura Peters looks like
someone pinched her face

91
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:11,451
and it stuck that way.

92
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:13,922
The boy with purple socks.

93
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:16,050
A man of mystery.

94
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,027
He never talks.

95
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:21,225
If I were known
only by my footwear,

96
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:23,199
I'd hang myself.

97
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,966
Beth Ellen Hansen always looks
like she's about to cry.

98
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,371
I wish someone
would just kick her

99
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,898
and get it over with.

100
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,377
And then of course,
there's our teacher...

101
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:36,848
Miss Elson.

102
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:39,147
She's nice, and polite.

103
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:41,881
I bet one day she goes
on a psycho killing spree,

104
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,685
and all her neighbors
will say...

105
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,715
"She was nice and polite."

106
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,594
Well, from what your last
two teachers tell me,

107
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,498
it looks like
déja vu all over again.

108
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:01,674
It's time to vote for
a sixth grade class president.

109
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:05,613
And for the third year
in a row...

110
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:08,743
we're down to our final
two nominees,

111
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:12,483
and they are Harriet Welsch

112
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:15,584
and Marion Hawthorne.

113
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:19,358
And so, as you may know,

114
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:22,333
the duties of the class
president include

115
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:26,702
taking attendance,
reporting bad behavior

116
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:33,009
and best of all, editing
the sixth grade newspaper.

117
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,546
And now we vote.

118
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:42,480
Marion Hawthorne... again.

119
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,356
Three years in a row.

120
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:48,761
You know what?
I think I'll invent a poison.

121
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:49,786
A really good,

122
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:51,959
clean, untraceable poison.

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,467
One that fries your brains

124
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:55,971
and makes all your bodily
fluids boil at once.

125
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,267
- Could you?
- Check it out.

126
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:59,705
One day I'd be like,
"Oh, hi, Marion.

127
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,733
"Oh, no, I'm not
finishing this soda."

128
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:02,939
And she'd be like...

129
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,421
I'm serious.

130
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,083
Any of you guys
want to come over?

131
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:14,182
I got to get home.

132
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:16,057
If my amoebas start
incubating,

133
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,925
they really stink up the house.

134
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:19,090
Harriet?

135
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,099
Sorry. Spy time.

136
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,633
Spy route.

137
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,502
Harrison Withers' place.

138
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,701
Higher altitude, lower risk.

139
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:01,142
But always a show.

140
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:09,476
Yeah, everybody's gonna have
some grease today...

141
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,823
All right, now, Jelly Roll.
Yeah.

142
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,385
Lady Day

143
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:20,887
Come what may,
whatever you say

144
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,798
We all gonna have
a good time

145
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:24,996
A little bit
for you, Satchmo

146
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,528
You, Bessie

147
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:28,972
And how 'bout you,
Jelly Roll?

148
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,240
Golly says, people
who love work love life.

149
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,439
Dizzy, Dizzy

150
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,311
I like Harrison Withers,

151
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:38,045
'cause he's a guy
that loves both.

152
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:40,145
Scooby dah...

153
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:42,019
Scooby-dooby, du-day

154
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:44,287
Okay, that's it.

155
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,331
Curiously, Harrison lives

156
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,958
for his cats.

157
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,232
Wow! Birdland.

158
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:59,198
But his work is for the birds.

159
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,474
Charlie Parker.

160
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:07,075
Yardbird.

161
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:11,021
In any case, his cages
are the most beautiful

162
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,387
I've ever seen.

163
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,821
It's him.

164
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:47,329
The Health Department
has it in for Harrison,

165
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,591
'cause they say he's got
too many cats.

166
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,328
I know, I know.

167
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:56,464
Too bad for them,
Harrison has a system.

168
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,102
See a hat, don't be home.

169
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:02,375
No hat, no problem.

170
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:08,442
Another score for the cat fan.

171
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,198
Hey.

172
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,294
Hey.

173
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:24,702
Want some necklace?

174
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,969
How about you, man?

175
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,238
Ew. You got it all spitty.

176
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,109
Tastes better that way.

177
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,306
Good.

178
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:34,315
Hey, Harriet,
what are you writing?

179
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:35,475
Notes.

180
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:36,814
Can we read them?

181
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:38,980
Can you read this?

182
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:39,989
Okay, okay.

183
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:41,012
I just wanted to know

184
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:42,957
why you're always
writing like a maniac.

185
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:44,983
I want to remember everything.

186
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,758
I want to know everything.

187
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:48,196
Well, you must realize, Harriet,

188
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,223
knowing everything
won't do you a bit of good

189
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,326
unless you use it to put
beauty in this world.

190
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:53,598
True or false?

191
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:54,332
True.

192
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:55,339
Of course it is.

193
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:56,772
Harriet, your mother called.

194
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:57,968
She's going to be late.

195
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,135
Come on, Sport, Janie.

196
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:00,804
I'll have you home
before dinner.

197
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,712
Golly always takes us places.

198
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,717
She sees things
other people barely notice.

199
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:10,189
She's my nanny and...
well, she's Golly.

200
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:11,782
Okay, survey of the day.

201
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,224
Today's question is:

202
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,160
What wouldn't you eat
for a million dollars?

203
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,095
Bratwurst.

204
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,098
Sport?

205
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,465
Um... camel boogers,
dried roadkill,

206
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:23,266
and my dad's meatloaf.

207
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,464
Janie?

208
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:31,171
It's the last day of summer.

209
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:33,238
Sad but true.

210
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,649
Au revoir, monsieur soleil.

211
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,312
Farewell!

212
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:38,319
So long, bye-bye.

213
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:39,320
Sayonara!

214
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,654
- Good-bye...
- We're here.

215
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:48,329
Is this a garden?

216
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,332
What a place!

217
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:50,333
What is this?

218
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:51,562
Golly, what's that?

219
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:54,595
That's Mrs. W.,
a very good friend of mine.

220
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,902
Kind of unusual.

221
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,910
You know, there are as many ways
to live

222
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,343
as there are people
in this world.

223
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:01,812
And each one
deserves a closer look.

224
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,679
Welcome!

225
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:04,910
Come on in.

226
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:05,919
Hi.

227
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:06,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:08,182
Hi.

229
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,281
Look around.

230
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:12,052
Have fun.

231
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:15,763
Whoa! Awesome!

232
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:24,664
Bop, bop, bop, bop!

233
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,980
Do-wat, do-wat, do-wat

234
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:36,383
I'm goin'!

235
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,526
Ooh.

236
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:58,976
I'm goin'!

237
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:06,945
Hey, you guys...

238
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,480
what do you say
I propose a toast?

239
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:11,958
Come on.

240
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,060
Oh... go away.

241
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,068
Say it quick, before
it stops fizzing.

242
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:21,593
Shake it up, take a sip,
and wish for what you want

243
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:22,605
most in the world.

244
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,106
Okay.

245
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,507
I want to replicate
my own DNA

246
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,272
and win
the Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah.

247
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:30,981
Oh!

248
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,141
Very good, Janie.

249
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,207
Okay, shake it up, Sport.

250
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,240
Shake it up.

251
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,877
I want to play
more baseball games

252
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,012
than Cal Ripkin, Jr.

253
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:38,352
Oh, yeah!

254
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,452
And get filthy rich doing it.

255
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:42,483
Oh, yeah!

256
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:45,326
Shake it, Harriet.

257
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,989
I want to see the whole world

258
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,025
and I want to write down
everything.

259
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,074
Harriet, slow down.

260
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:01,673
That's very impressive.

261
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:02,910
Harriet?

262
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:04,953
I'm goin'!

263
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:06,079
That's good, Harriet.

264
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:07,486
That's very pretty,
isn't it, Janie?

265
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:08,512
Yes, I like it.

266
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,021
Got you!

267
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,480
Hey, wait up.

268
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:39,119
Everybody, hello!
It sucks, sixth grade!

269
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,524
Feet off the bed, please.

270
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:42,256
Okay.

271
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:45,657
Feet off.

272
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,099
Oh, the heinie bounce.

273
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:48,102
Good choice.

274
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:49,603
Very cute, Harriet,
very cute.

275
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:50,935
The neighbors
will ask me,

276
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:52,667
"What happened
to Harriet Welsch?"

277
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:53,675
"I don't know,"
I'll answer.

278
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,676
"Such a shame.

279
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,905
"She disappeared
without a trace.

280
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:59,073
And she was
so adorable."

281
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:01,141
How long have you been
with me, Golly?

282
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,708
Since you were born.

283
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:05,654
11 years and
12,000 tomato sandwiches ago.

284
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,623
And you'll never leave me,
right?

285
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,524
Well, I won't leave you
"leave you," Harriet,

286
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,791
but, you know, one day
you're going to be big enough.

287
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,992
And well... well, big enough
to take care of yourself.

288
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,125
And when that day comes

289
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,897
you won't need me
and I'll be gone.

290
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,495
But you know what?

291
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,506
That day is not today.

292
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,303
And now, it's time for bed.

293
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,106
Are Mom and Dad
tucking me in?

294
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,112
No.

295
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,137
They're at a very fancy party

296
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:31,241
and I bet they're thinking
about you right now. Really.

297
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,776
Listen, I think I can hear 'em.

298
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,721
Harriet...

299
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,725
listen to everything
Golly says to you.

300
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,753
We're drinking champagne
and eating caviar, Harriet.

301
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,129
Come on.

302
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,464
Let's go to bed.

303
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:47,968
Who's going to bed?

304
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:49,562
Uh, you are, tough guy.

305
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:51,073
- Come on.
- Ow! Ow!

306
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,096
Child abuse! Child abuse!

307
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,506
Oh, you think
that's child abuse?

308
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,010
You haven't even...
How about that?

309
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,774
What about that?
What about one of these?

310
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:01,810
Stand still,
you little booger.

311
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:03,479
Ugh!

312
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:08,018
I'm telling you,
just give me the big knife

313
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,424
and this will all be over.

314
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:11,122
Harriet, dear,
you have taken

315
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:13,290
a tomato sandwich
to school with you...

316
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,299
With mayonnaise.

317
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,630
...with mayonnaise
every day

318
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:16,896
for that past five years.

319
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:17,960
Don't you want
a little variety?

320
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:18,971
Nope.

321
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,770
Not even cream cheese
with olive?

322
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:22,866
Yum-yum-yum!

323
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,537
Or how about pastrami?
Roast beef?

324
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:28,139
How about the fancy
cucumber kind,

325
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,047
with the crust cut off?

326
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:34,020
Mom, I can't help it
if I know what I like.

327
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:36,923
And I know that I like tomato.

328
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,429
After school spy route...

329
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:53,068
Hong Fat's Food Emporium

330
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,862
Holy cats, a veggie thief.

331
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,131
This must be investigated
thoroughly.

332
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,146
Frankie, you took the truck
last week.

333
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:03,051
Wasn't that enough?

334
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,180
Stop walking around.

335
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,556
Frankie, go do some homework.

336
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:07,719
I've done my homework.

337
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:08,728
Do some reading.

338
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:09,990
Watch TV.
Do something.

339
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,496
Grandpa, all I need
is the truck.

340
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:12,760
I know you know
that I mean.

341
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:18,768
Come on, Ma,
let me have the truck.

342
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:21,943
I got a date!

343
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:23,535
What do you take me for?

344
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:26,706
The Hong Fats have a son...
Frankie.

345
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:29,047
He's cool; American style.

346
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:31,383
His parents are
Chinese-style cool.

347
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,047
Frankie likes going out,

348
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:35,387
but they'd rather
he work in the store,

349
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:38,690
selling milk and bread
and lizards.

350
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,931
Ugh!

351
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:56,147
I mean, do I try to interfere
with your bookkeeping?!

352
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:57,410
My business is comedy!

353
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:58,643
That's what I do!

354
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:00,243
I'm funny!
I'm the funny guy!

355
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,254
Yes, you are.

356
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,949
They're the money guys.

357
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:03,956
Okay, slippery,

358
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,957
bath time's over.

359
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:06,219
Come out with your hands up.

360
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,226
But I just got in.

361
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,853
Oh, sure.
I believe that one.

362
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:10,864
Let's see your fingers,
prune girl.

363
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:12,695
Talk to the hand,
'cause the face

364
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:13,825
ain't gonna listen.

365
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,495
He asked me to come up

366
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,300
with something new,
something fresh.

367
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,567
You read it.
It was good.

368
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:20,131
- Yes.
- It was the funniest script

369
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,164
we've had all year!

370
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,939
Yes, it was. So what
was their problem?

371
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,469
Hey, I want to hear.

372
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:26,778
Oh, yeah?
I want to sing opera,

373
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:28,647
but I can't, so I don't.

374
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:29,845
That downstairs is...

375
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:34,722
Well, your dad
has a high-pressure job.

376
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,055
What's a high-pressure job?

377
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:38,027
It's when you don't
get to do what you want

378
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,086
and when you do,

379
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,392
you don't have time to do it.

380
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,265
Do spies have
high-pressure jobs?

381
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,064
Only when
they're caught.

382
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm never caught.

383
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,598
You're right.

384
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,800
You never are.

385
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,468
Oh, look, a ugly water bug!

386
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,169
Hey!

387
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,236
Caught ya.

388
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,577
Here she is.

389
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:01,988
Night.

390
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:02,989
Good night.

391
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:05,015
Good night. You want
me to tuck you in?

392
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:06,185
Golly can do it.

Let me see.

401
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:32,650
Crap? No, no.

402
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,214
This stuff is beyond crap.

403
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:37,057
This is what crap wants
to be when it grows up.

404
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:38,221
Listen to this.

00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:06,921
Hello.

418
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:10,558
What's that smell?

419
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,362
Delicious
German bratwurst.

420
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,369
We hate bratwurst.

421
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,031
I love bratwurst.

422
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:17,199
Since when?

423
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:19,568
I'll get it!

424
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:21,201
No. No, no. I will get it.

425
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:22,768
I'll get it! I'll get it!
I'll get it!

426
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:24,782
I'll get it!
I'll get it! I'll get it!

427
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:26,010
I said I'll get it

428
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,381
and I mean
I'll get it.

429
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:28,942
- I got it!
- No.

430
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,387
I'll get it!

431
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:33,050
Good evening, Katherine.

The veggie thief.

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,057
Katherine?

Harriet Ann Welsch,

435
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,393
Mr. George Waldenstein.

436
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,127
How do you do?

437
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,727
Yeah.

438
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,931
I've seen him around.

439
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:47,770
Bet he stole that pineapple.

440
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:22,913
Good soup.

441
00:24:22,947 --> 00:24:24,107
Harriet,

442
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:25,480
where are your manners?

443
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:26,484
I don't know.

444
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:28,544
Maybe somebody stole them.

445
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,521
Hey, you cheated.

446
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:07,890
Oh, you win.

447
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:09,126
My congratulations.

448
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,100
Yeah, well, I know some stuff.

449
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,534
So, you're

450
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,537
a delivery boy?

451
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:15,004
Mm-hmm.

452
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,373
Well, no offense, but, uh,
you're like, what, 45?

453
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,707
Ish.

454
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,372
Shouldn't you be
a delivery man by now?

455
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:23,938
Harriet!

456
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:26,042
Well, Harriet, I'll tell you.

457
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:28,383
Not long ago,
I had another life.

458
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:30,514
I had a big business,
I had a lot of money,

459
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:31,524
and you know what?

460
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:34,925
I was the most
miserable man alive.

461
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,896
So, one day,
I told my wife that...

462
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,591
- Wife?
- I told my wife that I

463
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:40,828
wanted to start all over
again and if she wanted to,

464
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:42,268
she could start all over
with me.

465
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:43,895
So what happened?

466
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:46,736
Oh, she left me, but that's
all right, that was her choice.

467
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:49,243
My choice was to become
a delivery boy... well, man.

468
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:51,007
I don't have the
business, of course.

469
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:52,172
I don't have the money.

470
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:54,182
You know what?

471
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,583
My life is sweet again.

472
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:01,190
Hmm.

473
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,856
The wurst!

474
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,023
Oh, no! My wurst!

475
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,190
No, no!

476
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,496
Oh...

477
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,504
Oh, Lord.

478
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:13,800
Oh, no. No.

479
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,931
Don't be sad, Katherine.

480
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,372
This is a blessing
in disguise.

481
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,204
That's a pretty
good disguise.

482
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,268
Don't you see?

483
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:20,904
The three of us
have to go out for dinner.

484
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:21,914
- No.
- Yeah!

485
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,382
Yes, dinner and a movie!

486
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,317
Movie, movie, movie!
Come on, Golly!

487
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,911
The idea seems
popular enough.

488
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:29,149
Yes, but the Welschs...

489
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,157
Will be out.

490
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:32,386
Till million o'clock!

491
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,088
- Oh, please, Golly.
- Please, oh, please?

492
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:37,792
Oh, please, please,
please, oh, please.

493
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:39,732
Oh, please, please, please.

494
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,030
What the heck.

495
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:27,611
This is absurd.

496
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:43,268
Yes!

497
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,171
Don't speak.

498
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:52,108
Wait! Wait for me!
I'm not dead.

499
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,085
Are you okay?

500
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:03,357
Yeah.

501
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:04,590
Hey.

502
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,621
How come
all the lights are on?

503
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,497
Where is my child?

504
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:10,331
Uh-oh.

505
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:11,894
Harriet? Harriet,
what are you doing

506
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:12,906
in that contraption?

507
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,373
Come in here at once.

508
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:15,499
Miss Golly,
what are you doing

509
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,339
with my child, at this hour,
without my consent?

510
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:18,605
- Who is that?
- My name is...

511
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:19,613
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

512
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:21,114
We only went to dinner
and then a movie.

513
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:23,083
Harriet is not
your daughter, Miss Golly.

514
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,017
She is mine,
and you have no idea, none,

515
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:26,577
what it is like
to come home and find

516
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,385
- that your child is missing.
- We had no idea

517
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,515
that you'd be home this soon.

518
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:31,185
I don't care.
I don't care what you did

519
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:32,285
or where you went or why.

520
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:34,193
All I know is this
can never happen again.

521
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,689
Miss Golly... you are fired.

522
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:38,701
What?! No!

523
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:40,032
Just a moment.

524
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,129
This is my fault. Please.

525
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:44,403
Well, it seems
awfully sudden.

526
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:45,602
Actually...

527
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:48,942
maybe it's not.

528
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,415
I think you're right,
Mrs. Welsch.

529
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,315
It is time for me to go.

530
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,286
What?

531
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,344
What?

532
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:57,787
What?

533
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,787
Now, look, I admit, I lost it...

534
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:04,558
because, I just...
I was frightened.

535
00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:07,032
But the thing is, the fact is
we need you, Golly.

536
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,035
We can't do it alone.

537
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:11,970
We all spoke out of turn,
I think.

538
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:13,701
None of this is causing...

539
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,539
Absolutely not.

540
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:16,544
Absolutely, no.

541
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:19,172
I mean, I think we were
talking about...

542
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:20,613
our feelings out there.

543
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:22,514
You were afraid
and-and-and now

544
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:24,816
what we should
be focusing on, right?

545
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:26,014
Is-is Harriet.

546
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,545
Look, I'm sorry.

547
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,921
- I lost my head out there.
- Look. There.

548
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,323
- No, no.
- I was just...

549
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,385
but you can't go...
I mean, we need you.

550
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:34,327
Harriet would never
stand for it.

551
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:35,695
Please, won't
you reconsider?

552
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,199
You know, it's not about

553
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,667
what happened
outside tonight.

554
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:39,692
It really isn't.

555
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:40,897
But Golly...

556
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:43,407
I just... no, I think it's time.
I really do.

557
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:46,068
Harriet can take care of herself
now, so she should.

558
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,203
But Harriet's just...

559
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,372
She's just a little girl.

560
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:49,904
You know, it's the right thing.

561
00:29:49,949 --> 00:29:51,712
It's the right thing
for all of us...

562
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,745
for me, for you
and for Harriet.

563
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,759
Are you sure?

564
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:02,353
Yeah, I am.

565
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:14,608
"'The time has come,"
the Walrus said,"

566
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:16,133
"To talk of many things...

567
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:19,239
"Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax..."

568
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:26,622
"Of cabbages and kings...

569
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:30,058
"And why the sea
is boiling hot...

570
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,461
And whether pigs have wings."

571
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,452
Where you going to go?

572
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:01,485
Well, I don't really know.

573
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:03,621
I'm thinking I may travel.

574
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:07,193
Are you going to go be
some other kid's nanny now?

575
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:10,433
And love them more than you?

576
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,699
Never.

577
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,177
Remember, in my life,
in this world

578
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:18,180
there will always
only be one Harriet.

579
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:23,111
So get back to work...
you've lost nearly

580
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:24,382
an entire day
on your notebook.

581
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:26,185
It doesn't matter.

582
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:28,384
It doesn't matter?

583
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:30,121
Did I hear you say
"It doesn't matter"?

584
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:31,629
Because I thought
I heard you say

585
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:32,630
"It doesn't matter,"

586
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:34,154
but Harriet wouldn't say that,
would she?

587
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,166
Now come on...

588
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,895
just because
you're on your own,

589
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:39,166
doesn't mean the world
stops turning,

590
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:41,469
or that there are
no more fascinating people

591
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,668
to observe and fill
your notebooks with.

592
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,610
That's your job, Harriet.

593
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,477
That's your job for life.

594
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,742
And when you're all grown up

595
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,047
and you sell
your first novel,

596
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:54,453
I'll be first in line
at that bookstore,

597
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:56,252
getting my autographed copy.

598
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,021
I hope.

599
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,822
I'm not going to cry.

600
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,399
I'm not going to cry.

601
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:08,903
I'm not going
to cry.

602
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:10,531
Ah, it's okay to cry.

603
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:12,439
But whatever you do,
don't laugh.

604
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:13,908
No, Harriet,

605
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:17,175
I will not tolerate laughter
as I leave, no.

606
00:32:18,248 --> 00:32:19,238
Hey...

607
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:20,773
come here.

608
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:26,253
You remember...

609
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,759
a good spy can
get in there and fight.

610
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,656
Good-bye, Harriet the Spy.

611
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:16,310
I was kind of worried, you know?

612
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:18,440
I kind of thought, "Well,
there's something wrong

613
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:19,847
with me or something," and so...

614
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:25,654
Growing up from girl to woman,

615
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,284
there's so much to get used to.

616
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:32,559
This is the time when a whole
new set of feelings unfold.

617
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:37,126
Feelings about yourself
and your maturing body...

618
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:41,470
Everything's the same
as when Golly was here.

619
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:45,773
It looks the same...

620
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:48,714
it smells the same...

621
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,718
but there's this
tiny hole inside me

622
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:52,310
that wasn't there before.

623
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,950
It's like...

624
00:33:58,994 --> 00:34:01,189
like a splinter
in your finger...

625
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,595
only this one's
right above my stomach.

626
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:21,282
Harriet,

627
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:22,911
are you okay?

628
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:25,548
Uh-huh.

629
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:39,936
Something's... different.

630
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:53,251
No cats?

631
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:57,020
How can Harrison Withers
not have a billion cats around?

632
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,111
They finally nailed him.

633
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,463
I will always remember
that face.

634
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:38,597
That's the face you make
when you really lose something.

635
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:47,745
Uh-oh, Frankie took the truck.

636
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,559
Speak English!

637
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:07,435
Oh, okay, you want us
to speak English, huh?!

638
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:09,370
Well, you are a jerk, huh?

639
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:12,070
I tell you, "Don't
take the truck.

640
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:13,271
You smash the truck."

641
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:14,609
Well, you tell me now,

642
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:16,137
Mr. Wise Guy,
was one date worth it?

643
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:17,444
...we have people
here shopping!

644
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,018
Yeah.

645
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:25,381
Hey, all right, Grandpa.

646
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,586
It's cool, right?

647
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:28,356
It wasn't a big deal, huh?

648
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,693
I knew you'd
understand, right?

649
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,764
Sometimes I think
families everywhere

650
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:38,932
are exactly the same.

651
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,635
Everybody get back to work.

652
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:42,941
Mom, Dad, please?
Grandpa!

653
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:45,174
Just calm down.

654
00:36:48,818 --> 00:36:49,808
Too exciting.

655
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:56,216
$6.75.

656
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:13,338
You got it or not?

657
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:29,796
Hey, Sport.

658
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:31,299
How you doing?

659
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,858
Hi.

660
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:39,264
Um, I saw you drop this outside.

661
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:40,970
Oh...

662
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:44,210
Thanks.

663
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:56,851
I got to go.

664
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:13,276
Now it's time for our annual
sixth grade holiday pageant.

665
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:16,147
So... pageant ideas...

666
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:18,675
who would like
to make a suggestion?

667
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,585
Simon.

668
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:21,850
Pirates.

669
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,984
Okay.

670
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:29,598
Good dramatic potential,
if not exactly seasonal.

671
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,259
Anyone else?

672
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,968
How 'bout the Manhattan Project?

673
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,734
I can be J. Robert Oppenheimer

674
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:38,469
and with the right chemicals,

675
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:40,566
I know I can do
a mushroom cloud.

676
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:42,603
That's impressive, Janie.

677
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:46,583
But I believe there's
a taste issue involved.

678
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:47,607
Ballet.

679
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:48,812
Pilgrims.

680
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:50,151
Musical.

681
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:51,986
Swan Lake.

682
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:56,893
Jazz.

683
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:57,919
Vlad the lmpaler.

684
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:00,057
Yeah, that's cool!

685
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,627
I think the most excellent idea
for a pageant

686
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,162
would be
a giant holiday feast.

687
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:10,610
Something healthy, low in fat,
and very delicious, of course.

688
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:13,079
There could be parts
for everybody.

689
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:17,211
Uh, grains, vegetables

690
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:20,983
and best of all,
a shiny, silver centerpiece.

691
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,958
That's a very good idea, Marion.

692
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:25,358
You could play the barf bag.

693
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:28,262
She made me an onion.

694
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:29,391
Tell me about it.

695
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,834
"You, my dear,
are a great big squash."

696
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,633
I'd like to squash her.

697
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,936
I've got something better.
Come here.

698
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:44,905
Smell this.

699
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,145
Ugh!

700
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:47,482
What is that?

701
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,713
You like it?

702
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:50,484
Wait, I mean you hate it.

703
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,321
It's like something crawled
up my nose and then died.

704
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,327
Excellent.

705
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,158
It's a sulfur-based
alkaloid.

706
00:39:56,196 --> 00:39:58,255
I want it to chemically
fuse with combustibles.

707
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:00,994
And, in English,
that would mean...

708
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,161
Stink bomb.

709
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:03,795
Stink bomb.

710
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:05,499
We tape it to the
school air ducts,

711
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,632
attach it to a timer,

712
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:09,166
and five minutes before
the school play starts...

713
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:11,704
Empty auditorium.

714
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:15,715
Hey...

715
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:17,413
What are you girls doing?

716
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:19,115
Nothing.
Nothing.

717
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:21,784
Are you getting ready
for your big stage debut?

718
00:40:21,825 --> 00:40:22,951
Actually, Mrs. Gibbs,

719
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:25,360
Janie and I were just talking
about the school play.

720
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:26,522
Right, Janie?

721
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:28,464
Yeah, we're really
looking forward to it.

722
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:32,001
Good, good.

723
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:33,800
That's good.

724
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,467
Janie, what is this
supposed to be?

725
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:37,532
No, Mom.

726
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:38,167
Don't touch it.

727
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:42,807
What?!

728
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:44,077
Janie!

729
00:40:44,117 --> 00:40:46,210
It's an experiment with mold.

730
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:48,379
Oh... Janie!

731
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:51,789
That's where my Veronica's
Closet bra went to, huh?

732
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,657
You know,
I'm sick to death

733
00:40:53,694 --> 00:40:55,559
of this mad scientist baloney.

734
00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:56,654
Look at this.
Look at this.

735
00:40:56,697 --> 00:40:57,756
Girl, we got to talk.

736
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,494
I don't know what I'm
going to do with you,

737
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:01,559
but we're going
to talk.

738
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:03,764
Some of Janie's experiments
really creep me out.

739
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:08,072
I wonder if she'll grow up
to be a billion-IQ genius,

740
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,374
or a total nutcase.

741
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:15,275
Sport, Sport...

742
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:25,455
Chicken man.

743
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:33,600
Do it again, do it again.

744
00:42:48,356 --> 00:42:50,848
Sport.

745
00:42:50,893 --> 00:42:53,384
Sport...

746
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,420
Sport!

747
00:42:56,733 --> 00:42:58,598
Help me.

748
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,466
Hey, Harriet.

749
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:05,975
Hey.

750
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,604
All right, come on.

751
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:21,851
How does it look?

752
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:24,385
Uh...
give me the mousse.

753
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:28,530
No, no...

754
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:32,300
Don't worry, it's just
one of Dad's nightmares.

755
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:33,704
I mean day-mares.

756
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:35,732
He says it happens
to all great writers

757
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:37,506
before they get their big break.

758
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:40,275
Hmm, a real writer.

759
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,419
My dad calls guys like your dad
"a starving artist."

760
00:43:48,457 --> 00:43:50,118
Who's starving?

761
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,028
I cook, I clean,
I do the dishes and the books.

762
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,895
What do you mean,
do the books?

763
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,865
These are the books.

764
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,873
Every week I get a check.

765
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,602
I write the amount
down in here,

766
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,873
I pay the bills and then
whatever's left is food money.

767
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:09,471
I hate money.

768
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:12,678
You'd like it a lot more
if you didn't have any.

769
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:15,585
I got to get to work.

770
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:26,889
Hey, Sport?

771
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:28,299
No! Don't.

772
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:29,495
Yeah, yeah, come on.

773
00:44:29,537 --> 00:44:30,629
Strike a pose.

774
00:44:39,614 --> 00:44:43,312
Spy route: Brand-new stalk.

775
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:45,843
Home of Agatha K. Plummer,

776
00:44:45,888 --> 00:44:50,053
a big private house
with big-type security.

777
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:53,290
Until today.

778
00:45:19,058 --> 00:45:21,289
A spy must choose
ingenious tricks,

779
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:24,320
must blend
into her surroundings.

780
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:26,332
Hiya, Freckles.

781
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:29,495
Must live with being called...
"Freckles."

782
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:42,513
Here we go, in you go.

783
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:46,556
Here he is.

784
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,147
So, here's the little monster.

785
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:51,024
Bye. Wave to the man.

786
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:55,558
Are you happy?

787
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,727
Good.

788
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,948
Oh, score!

789
00:46:57,503 --> 00:46:59,562
Quiet. Quiet, puppy dog.

790
00:46:59,638 --> 00:47:01,196
Go away!

791
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:03,936
Don't, don't, don't.
Go away.

792
00:47:05,045 --> 00:47:07,843
Pee-wee, don't make me
come in there.

793
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:09,371
Away.

794
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,542
Go away!

795
00:47:14,755 --> 00:47:17,724
Pee-wee... get away

796
00:47:17,758 --> 00:47:20,193
from that dumbwaiter.

797
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:22,321
Shut up.

798
00:47:23,398 --> 00:47:26,424
Stupid fuzzball.

799
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:30,371
I ought to shave you down
and teach you to hunt.

800
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,969
Shut up!

801
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,871
No, no.

802
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,214
No, darling.

803
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:43,244
If you want to talk about
something delicious...

804
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,549
...I have

805
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:47,091
something delicious.

806
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,924
I have the secret of life.

807
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:51,259
Yes, darling.

808
00:48:51,297 --> 00:48:52,491
You simply

809
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,056
crawl into your bed,

810
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,763
and you never, ever
leave it again.

811
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,132
Never...

812
00:48:59,173 --> 00:49:02,142
Ah, sweet Liberace.

813
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:07,780
What was that?

814
00:49:07,816 --> 00:49:09,340
I have no idea.

815
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:11,511
Then why don't you

816
00:49:11,587 --> 00:49:14,886
go over there and get an idea?

817
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,529
And if it's that rat...

818
00:49:19,596 --> 00:49:21,530
kill it!

819
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:23,327
Oh, Mrs. Plummer,

820
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:24,390
I'm sure

821
00:49:24,434 --> 00:49:26,425
it's absolutely nothing.

822
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:38,006
Oh, well...

823
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,544
A good spy never gets caught.

824
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:44,557
A good spy
never gets caught.

825
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:48,357
A good spy never gets caught.

826
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:51,022
I am the suckiest spy on earth.

827
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:55,331
Hey, Harriet, check this out.

828
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:58,463
"This year's winter
pageant promises

829
00:49:58,506 --> 00:50:01,908
"to be truly inspiring,

830
00:50:01,943 --> 00:50:05,777

Oh, my God.

I'd like to see her
split a turkey suit

836
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,962
with butt-breath
Pinky Whitehead.

837
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:27,597
Hurry up.

838
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:28,901
You're so slow.

839
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,464
Come on, you guys.

840
00:50:30,508 --> 00:50:32,374
Harriet, you want
to go play in the park?

841
00:50:32,411 --> 00:50:34,641
Or do you have to do that
top secret spy deal again?

842
00:50:36,649 --> 00:50:38,708
No. I can play.

843
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:39,741
You can?

844
00:50:40,755 --> 00:50:42,154
Yeah, come on.

845
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,316
No way.

846
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:45,086
I still say we play
"Buy the Volvo."

847
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,252
No way.

848
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:47,626
- That's stupid.
- No.

849
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:48,754
No way!

850
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:49,991
You guys, I can be the dealer.

851
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:51,499
You guys can be
the couples looking

852
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:53,262
for a sassy yet affordable
family vehicle.

853
00:50:53,302 --> 00:50:54,360
Get real.

854
00:50:54,403 --> 00:50:55,962
Yeah, right.

855
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:57,734
Okay, I've got it:
Hide and Seek.

856
00:50:57,774 --> 00:50:59,639
- No.
- Hide and Seek?

857
00:50:59,709 --> 00:51:00,437
I am set.

858
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:01,807
That's retarded.

859
00:51:01,845 --> 00:51:02,777
Red Rover, Red Rover.

860
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:03,802
No!

861
00:51:03,848 --> 00:51:05,076
That's a kid's game.

862
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:06,548
I don't think so.

863
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:09,217
- Kick the can.
- Kick...

864
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:12,589
What about Spin the Bottle?

865
00:51:12,624 --> 00:51:13,750
Ew!

866
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:14,952
Yeah, right.

867
00:51:16,228 --> 00:51:17,456
I got it.

868
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:18,757
Bumper tag.

869
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:20,459
See, now, that's a good idea.

870
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:21,591
Eenie-meenie, miney-mo,

871
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:22,964
Catch a tiger by the toe.

872
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:24,367
If he hollers, let him go.

873
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:27,133
My mom said to pick
the very best one,

874
00:51:27,174 --> 00:51:29,142
and you are

875
00:51:29,176 --> 00:51:30,336
it.

876
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:36,483
Away, you foolish mortals!

877
00:51:38,653 --> 00:51:40,644
Beth's it!

878
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,759
Got you!

879
00:52:22,635 --> 00:52:23,864
You run fast,

880
00:52:23,904 --> 00:52:26,464
but now I shall destroy you.

881
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:28,664
Yeah.

882
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,708
Oh.

883
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:10,281
You winded?

884
00:53:10,322 --> 00:53:11,722
Nope.

885
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:13,817
Me, too.

886
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:17,655
Upsey-daisy.

887
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,960
Time to move.

888
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:35,917
Where's my notebook?

889
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:37,180
Your what?

890
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,279
My notebook!

891
00:53:43,293 --> 00:53:45,022
Oh, my God.

892
00:53:46,563 --> 00:53:47,530
Boy...

893
00:53:47,564 --> 00:53:48,861
- Wait, wait. No, wait.
- Carrie...

894
00:53:48,899 --> 00:53:50,230
Carrie.
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie.

895
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:51,235
Andrews.

896
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,236
Get this. Get... Okay.

897
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,033
"Carrie Andrews thinks
she's so cool

898
00:53:54,072 --> 00:53:55,937
"'cause she spent
her summer vacation

899
00:53:55,974 --> 00:53:57,464
growing boobs."

900
00:54:00,713 --> 00:54:02,112
- Come on, read some more.
- Okay.

901
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:03,513
Hold on, hold on.

902
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:04,675
Okay.

903
00:54:04,717 --> 00:54:06,708
"Now, the Boy with
the Purple Socks

904
00:54:06,753 --> 00:54:08,050
is a man of mystery."

905
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:09,851
Mystery!

906
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,551
Hold on, you guys,
you guys.

907
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:12,580
Listen, listen, listen.

908
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:14,057
"The only thing more pathetic

909
00:54:14,094 --> 00:54:15,460
"than being Marion Hawthorne,

910
00:54:15,496 --> 00:54:17,930
is wanting to be
Marion Hawthorne."

911
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:19,296
Oh, Rachel.

912
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,527
Rachel.

913
00:54:20,568 --> 00:54:21,933
She is...

914
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:23,437
- Jealous.
- She's jealous.

915
00:54:23,472 --> 00:54:24,700
It's pure jealousy.

916
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,071
You give that back now!

917
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:27,973
Looks like there's something
in here for everyone.

918
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,568
You heard her, Marion.

919
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:33,070
Give it back before I pound you
into the cement.

920
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:35,550
Ooh, I'm so scared.

921
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:36,813
Hey, maybe there
is something

922
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:38,013
in here for you.

923
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:45,589
Janie...

924
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:47,325
Janie, Janie, Janie...

925
00:54:47,365 --> 00:54:48,525
Come and get it.

926
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:50,091
Read it. Come on.

927
00:54:50,135 --> 00:54:51,625
What does it say?

928
00:54:51,736 --> 00:54:53,966
- Come on.
- Janie, Janie.

929
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:56,031
"Janie really
creeps me out."

930
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:57,235
Ooh.

931
00:54:57,276 --> 00:55:00,370
"I wonder if she'll grow up
to be...

932
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:02,780
a total nutcase..."?

933
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:04,113
A nutcase!

934
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:06,582
Oh.

935
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,780
Hey.

936
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:09,083
Her best friend.

937
00:55:09,123 --> 00:55:10,921
That's her best friend.

938
00:55:12,327 --> 00:55:13,521
Beth.

939
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:18,097
"I wish
someone would kick Beth Ellen."

940
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:19,260
Oh!

941
00:55:22,505 --> 00:55:24,473
Uh, Laura.

942
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:29,741
"Laura Peters...
her face looks totally...

943
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:30,905
pinched."

944
00:55:30,947 --> 00:55:33,279
Oh.

945
00:55:38,156 --> 00:55:40,147
"If I were the boy
with the purple socks...

946
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:43,287
I'd hang myself."

947
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:47,124
Something else.

948
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,394
Cut it out, Marion.

949
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:50,834
Oh.

950
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,100
Maybe there is something
in here for Sport.

951
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:54,834
No!

952
00:55:54,874 --> 00:55:55,966
"Sport..."

953
00:55:56,009 --> 00:55:56,941
Shut up!

954
00:55:56,976 --> 00:55:57,943
Fine, then.

955
00:55:57,977 --> 00:55:59,138
I'll read it right out loud

956
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,169
so everybody can hear.

957
00:56:01,782 --> 00:56:02,441
No!

958
00:56:04,218 --> 00:56:06,414
"Sport is so poor,
he can't even afford food.

959
00:56:06,454 --> 00:56:08,581
"Why can't his father

960
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,089
just get a real job?"

961
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:13,284
Oh, and get this, as well.

962
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,321
"One day, I had to pretend
he dropped a dollar

963
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:19,334
just so he could afford
some milk and bread."

964
00:56:19,368 --> 00:56:21,859
Oh.

965
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:23,964
Ooh, harsh.

966
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:25,872
Oh, oh, oh.

967
00:56:26,977 --> 00:56:29,172
That's mean.

968
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:31,842
Sport, I...

969
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:33,009
I-I got to go.

970
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:34,814
It-it's spaghetti night.

971
00:56:34,852 --> 00:56:36,615
I got to make spaghetti.

972
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:38,646
I can't stay here anymore.

973
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:43,123
Harriet...

974
00:56:43,162 --> 00:56:46,097
sit over there till we decide
what to do with you next.

975
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:48,527
Wait. What's this?

976
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:50,433
"I learn everything I can

977
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,995
"and I write down everything
I see.

978
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,873
"Golly says if I
want to be a writer,

979
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,969
"then I'd better start now,

980
00:56:58,012 --> 00:56:59,206
"which is why

981
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:00,578
I'm a spy."

982
00:57:06,154 --> 00:57:07,382
My position is bad.

983
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:09,322
My position is terrible.

984
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:11,327
My position could not be worse.

985
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,023
Golly would know what to do.

986
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,800
Harriet?

987
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:24,002
Harriet, are you all right?

988
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,872
Fine.

989
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,241
Do you want anything?

990
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:28,712
No.

991
00:57:28,747 --> 00:57:30,908
You sure?

992
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,430
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,
Ole Golly,

993
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,529
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,

994
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:55,474
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,
Ole Golly.

995
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,944
Harriet?

996
00:57:57,979 --> 00:57:59,311
I said

997
00:57:59,348 --> 00:58:00,474
I'm fine.

998
00:58:00,516 --> 00:58:02,609
Really.

999
00:58:22,674 --> 00:58:23,800
Lookit.

1000
00:58:23,841 --> 00:58:25,035
Oh, my God.

1001
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:34,243
Hey, Sport.

1002
00:58:38,258 --> 00:58:40,249
Janie.

1003
00:58:42,229 --> 00:58:43,662
You hear something?

1004
00:58:44,664 --> 00:58:46,656
No.

1005
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:04,584
Plug this in over there.

1006
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:05,747
Over there?

1007
00:59:05,788 --> 00:59:07,756
Um, well, that one's closer.

1008
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,487
Carrie? Carrie?

1009
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:15,459
Oh, my...

1010
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:25,176
Sport? Sport, catch.

1011
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:49,102
Let me see.

1012
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,644
We love our teacher,
and our best friend

1013
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,954
We'll stay together

1014
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:09,653
Until the end

1015
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:11,753
We're moving up...

1016
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:17,759
...and together,
we'll always have fun

1017
01:00:17,803 --> 01:00:21,797
We love our teacher,
and our best friend

1018
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:24,105
We'll stay together

1019
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:27,112
Until the end

1020
01:00:27,146 --> 01:00:30,514
We're one for all,
and all for one

1021
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:34,078
And together,
we'll always have fun...

1022
01:00:43,898 --> 01:00:46,595
I will always have a notebook.

1023
01:00:46,635 --> 01:00:48,626
Only Golly understands this.

1024
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:51,469
I will write down everything,
and I'll know everything.

1025
01:00:51,507 --> 01:00:53,270
And I'll take everything
I know,

1026
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:54,675
and write my memoirs,

1027
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:56,110
and be a huge, big, celebrity,

1028
01:00:56,146 --> 01:00:57,443
and go on all the talk shows

1029
01:00:57,481 --> 01:00:59,278
and tell them
Marion Hawthorne smells.

1030
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:03,219
And... won't that rock?

1031
01:01:12,564 --> 01:01:13,826
What smells?

1032
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:15,163
Eww!

1033
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,258
Did something die?

1034
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:20,996
- Get away.
- Eww!

1035
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:29,678
Where's your notebook, Harriet?

1036
01:01:29,717 --> 01:01:31,981
I don't know, Marion.

1037
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:35,114
Have you looked
up your butt?

1038
01:01:36,558 --> 01:01:38,890
You all better stop
being mean to me,

1039
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:40,485
or else, I'm going to...

1040
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:41,792
Or else, what?

1041
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,696
Yeah, what are you
gonna do about it?

1042
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,257
I'm gonna get you real bad.

1043
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:46,393
I'm gonna...

1044
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,838
No, that's where you're
wrong, Harriet the Spy.

1045
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,171
We're gonna get you so bad...

1046
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:53,608
and you know why?

1047
01:01:53,644 --> 01:01:55,373
'Cause we have a plan.

1048
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,401
Yeah!

1049
01:02:37,727 --> 01:02:40,855
I don't like giving orders
twice, you know.

1050
01:02:40,897 --> 01:02:44,697
I told you to nail it
to the side, not to the right.

1051
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:48,704
One, two, three, heave!

1052
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:54,002
I need more nails.

1053
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,547
Harder, harder.

1054
01:03:07,727 --> 01:03:09,696
Hold it, hold it.

1055
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:15,193
A club for catching spies?

1056
01:03:15,235 --> 01:03:17,932
I'm doomed.

1057
01:03:24,779 --> 01:03:27,806
"If Golly said choose
between being a spy

1058
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:29,841
"and having friends...

1059
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:36,088
I'd pick spy."

1060
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:44,458
Maybe you're not allowed
to have both."

1061
01:03:53,812 --> 01:03:54,801
Ugh!

1062
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,707
Get her!

1063
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:26,247
Spy-catchers are everywhere.

1064
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:28,250
My route is ruined.

1065
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:30,617
No one can stand in my way.

1066
01:04:35,192 --> 01:04:36,454
Forget that my heart sank

1067
01:04:36,493 --> 01:04:38,553
when I saw you standing there
with that policeman.

1068
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:39,688
This is your mother talking.

1069
01:04:39,797 --> 01:04:41,788
But when I ask you
for some kind of explanation,

1070
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:42,800
it's like...

1071
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:43,801
It's not that big a deal.

1072
01:04:43,835 --> 01:04:44,802
Oh, no... wrong.

1073
01:04:44,836 --> 01:04:46,134
Being brought home by the cops

1074
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:47,297
is a very big deal, Harriet.

1075
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:48,966
Cop. Cop.

1076
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:52,205
One guy. That's it.

1077
01:04:52,244 --> 01:04:54,270
No, that's not it;
we've spoken with Miss Elson.

1078
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:55,406
You remember school?

1079
01:04:55,448 --> 01:04:57,279
And she tells us
that you've done

1080
01:04:57,317 --> 01:04:58,648
zero schoolwork in days.

1081
01:04:58,685 --> 01:05:00,812
All you do is play
with your notebook.

1082
01:05:00,854 --> 01:05:02,789
It's not play, it's work.

1083
01:05:02,823 --> 01:05:05,121
School is your
work, Harriet.

1084
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:09,153
Yeah, well, she can shut up,
'cause I'm learning tons.

1085
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:10,164
Oh, yes?

1086
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,756
Well, not about history, huh?

1087
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,824
Not about geography.

1088
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:13,835
Not even English.

1089
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:15,860
I swear, if it's
not in your notebook,

1090
01:05:15,904 --> 01:05:18,203
it's as if you don't
want to know about it.

1091
01:05:18,241 --> 01:05:20,675
So what?

1092
01:05:22,578 --> 01:05:24,102
Harriet...

1093
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,955
This... obsession
you've developed

1094
01:05:33,992 --> 01:05:36,654
is not entirely
healthy.

1095
01:05:36,695 --> 01:05:40,222
Now, we've made
a decision.

1096
01:05:40,265 --> 01:05:41,290
And-And we, uh...

1097
01:05:41,334 --> 01:05:42,426
We want you to stop

1098
01:05:42,468 --> 01:05:43,696
with the notebook.

1099
01:05:47,707 --> 01:05:50,836
S-Stop writing?

1100
01:05:50,877 --> 01:05:55,041
Not forever,
just as an experiment.

1101
01:05:55,082 --> 01:05:57,347
Harriet, the world is filled
with so many things

1102
01:05:57,385 --> 01:05:59,012
a person like yourself
could enjoy.

1103
01:05:59,053 --> 01:06:00,611
Well, that's right.

1104
01:06:00,655 --> 01:06:03,590
And you're going to find that,
sometimes

1105
01:06:03,624 --> 01:06:06,458
just experiencing
them can be enough.

1106
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:10,659
That's how I experience things...
with my notebook.

1107
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:11,960
Harriet...

1108
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,868
No. Let's see you
experience things

1109
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:18,135
without your unhealthy
obsessions, huh?

1110
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,665
Every day you come home,
and pour yourself a big martini.

1111
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:22,268
How come you don't
give that up?

1112
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:24,304
And how many days go by

1113
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:26,077
without you going
to a stupid party?

1114
01:06:26,117 --> 01:06:28,985
Or buying some other piece
of crappy jewelry... like, two?

1115
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,681
Don't take that tone with us,
young lady.

1116
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:33,019
We're your parents.
We make the rules in this house.

1117
01:06:33,058 --> 01:06:34,252
Now, hand over
the notebook.

1118
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:36,226
I threw it away.

1119
01:06:36,261 --> 01:06:38,628
You're sitting on it.

1120
01:06:38,664 --> 01:06:41,292
I'm not moving.

1121
01:06:42,802 --> 01:06:44,828
If you make me move you,

1122
01:06:44,872 --> 01:06:46,931
I will move you.

1123
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:05,324
I'll just get another one.

1124
01:07:05,361 --> 01:07:06,350
Oh?

1125
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:09,160
Miss Elson will be checking.

1126
01:07:11,334 --> 01:07:12,801
Harriet?

1127
01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:16,005
Don't you want
to talk about this?

1128
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,473
No.

1129
01:07:23,648 --> 01:07:28,177
Harriet... did we forget?

1130
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,621
Notebook check.

1131
01:07:42,236 --> 01:07:43,669
Dweeb!

1132
01:08:52,415 --> 01:08:55,009
Hey...

1133
01:09:16,943 --> 01:09:19,969
Harriet the Spy,
Harriet the Spy...

1134
01:09:23,316 --> 01:09:27,310
Harriet the Spy,
Harriet the Spy...

1135
01:09:32,193 --> 01:09:33,660
Oops!

1136
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:36,156
I'm sorry!

1137
01:09:36,197 --> 01:09:37,960
You did that
on purpose!

1138
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:40,092
It was an accident,
I swear.

1139
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,126
- Here, let me help you.
- No!

1140
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:47,700
Get away!

1141
01:09:47,743 --> 01:09:50,304
Get away!

1142
01:09:51,815 --> 01:09:53,612
That's it, work together,

1143
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:56,118
and we'll have Harriet
cleaned up in no time.

1144
01:09:56,153 --> 01:09:57,313
Don't worry, Harriet,

1145
01:09:57,355 --> 01:09:59,550
we'll all help you.

1146
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:00,579
No, stop it.

1147
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:02,115
I don't need your help.

1148
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,387
You all get away!

1149
01:10:03,427 --> 01:10:04,554
No!

1150
01:10:04,596 --> 01:10:06,587
No!

1151
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:14,306
Harriet!

1152
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,568
Wait!

1153
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:17,735
Whoa...

1154
01:10:17,777 --> 01:10:20,212
Well, that wasn't
very dignified.

1155
01:11:44,374 --> 01:11:47,936
"To be... or not to be...

1156
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:50,311
"That is the question.

1157
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,111
Wait.

1158
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,981
Is that a question?

1159
01:11:56,655 --> 01:12:02,924
"Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:27,485
"And the thousand
nags of shock...

1171
01:12:27,522 --> 01:12:29,684
"The flesh

1172
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:32,660
"is here, too...

1173
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:35,163
"'Tis a consummation

1174
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:40,637
"Development to be wished

1175

To die... to sleep no more."

1176
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:51,108
There are many signs that Tom
is changing from a boy to a man.

1177
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:52,981
Tom is getting a deeper voice

1178
01:12:53,018 --> 01:12:55,782
and sometimes it gives him
a little trouble.

1179
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:57,118
Don't be insulting

1180
01:12:57,156 --> 01:12:58,783
my... friend.

1181
01:12:58,824 --> 01:13:02,386
This is an actual photograph
of vocal chords taken through

1182
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:04,329
a special instrument.

1183
01:13:04,364 --> 01:13:06,730
The chords vibrate
when the person breathes out.

1184
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:10,562
The larynx is here
at the top of the windpipe

1185
01:13:10,605 --> 01:13:14,097
and is the housing
for the vocal cords.

1186
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:41,962
Bra on a pole!
Bra on a pole!

1187
01:13:49,982 --> 01:13:51,813
Oh, no.

1188
01:14:09,003 --> 01:14:11,062
Hello, Marion.

1189
01:14:11,105 --> 01:14:13,734
Get away from me, Harriet.

1190
01:14:13,776 --> 01:14:18,406
Or what, you gonna
tell your father?

1191
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:21,212
I heard my parents talking.

1192
01:14:22,452 --> 01:14:24,420
You don't have a father.

1193
01:14:24,454 --> 01:14:28,084
All those stories about
horseback riding are garbage.

1194
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:30,252
You made them all up.

1195
01:14:30,294 --> 01:14:33,422
Your father lives in Amsterdam.

1196
01:14:33,464 --> 01:14:37,094
He hasn't seen you
in three years.

1197
01:14:37,135 --> 01:14:40,298
And you want to know why,
Marion?

1198
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:45,778
'Cause he
doesn't love you.

1199
01:14:45,812 --> 01:14:47,803
Move.

1200
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,480
Harriet?

1201
01:15:55,657 --> 01:15:58,319
Harriet, come down here.

1202
01:16:02,364 --> 01:16:05,232
Harriet, what's happened to you?

1203
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:08,726
We've gotten calls
from every parent at school.

1204
01:16:08,838 --> 01:16:10,829
They're all either
furious or terrified.

1205
01:16:10,873 --> 01:16:12,239
Marion Hawthorne
can't stop crying.

1206
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,403
Laura Peters has locked herself
in the bathroom

1207
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,639
and won't come out.

1208
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,306
The only parents
we haven't heard from

1209
01:16:17,347 --> 01:16:18,439
are Pinky Whitehead's.

1210
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:21,710
I'm not answering that.

1211
01:16:21,753 --> 01:16:23,311
I always hated school myself.

1212
01:16:23,354 --> 01:16:24,616
No, now, see,
that's the problem.

1213
01:16:24,656 --> 01:16:25,714
What? I know...

1214
01:16:25,757 --> 01:16:27,385
Something is very wrong here,
Ben, and you need

1215
01:16:27,426 --> 01:16:28,620
...to take this seriously.
- I am!

1216
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:30,060
- No, come on.
- I'm just as serious as...

1217
01:16:30,096 --> 01:16:31,085
You know what you're doing.

1218
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:32,757
- You're coming in and teasing...
- No, I'm not.

1219
01:16:32,832 --> 01:16:33,764
We have a really
bad situation.

1220
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:35,233
We don't know what
the situation is at all.

1221
01:16:35,268 --> 01:16:37,065
You always come in and make
jokes and then I have to come in

1222
01:16:37,104 --> 01:16:38,093
Do we know
what the situation is?

1223
01:16:38,138 --> 01:16:39,105
...and be the grumpy one.

1224
01:16:39,139 --> 01:16:40,265
Maybe we should find out
what it is.

1225
01:16:40,307 --> 01:16:43,402
I'm fine, I'm fine...

1226
01:16:43,444 --> 01:16:45,469
I'm fine,
I'm fine...

1227
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:47,606
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine...

1228
01:16:47,648 --> 01:16:49,240
I'm fine!

1229
01:16:50,284 --> 01:16:51,547
No, sweetheart.

1230
01:16:51,587 --> 01:16:54,647
I can't understand
how this is fine.

1231
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,824
Harriet, uh, uh,
can you explain this?

1232
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:27,752
Well, what do we do now?

1233
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,327
We can do anything you like.

1234
01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:31,228
What am I supposed to do?

1235
01:17:31,265 --> 01:17:32,857
How about a game?

1236
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,629
Do you play chess?

1237
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:37,432
Golly was going
to teach me, but...

1238
01:17:37,471 --> 01:17:38,597
Golly?

1239
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:39,971
Who's he?

1240
01:17:41,309 --> 01:17:43,436
Just somebody.

1241
01:17:45,213 --> 01:17:48,775
You sit here and play
with this stuff all day?

1242
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:50,113
Don't you have toys at home?

1243
01:17:50,152 --> 01:17:51,312
Yeah.

1244
01:17:51,353 --> 01:17:52,752
But I'm 11.

1245
01:18:04,035 --> 01:18:06,936
You stink.

1246
01:18:06,971 --> 01:18:08,370
What are you doing?

1247
01:18:08,406 --> 01:18:09,737
Just taking notes.

1248
01:18:09,774 --> 01:18:11,106
Are they the mean,

1249
01:18:11,143 --> 01:18:15,705
nasty kind...
or the regular kind?

1250
01:18:15,747 --> 01:18:17,612
Why?

1251
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:19,242
Because...

1252
01:18:19,285 --> 01:18:20,582
I'm just telling you,

1253
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:24,056
it's tough getting away
with the nasty kind these days.

1254
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,785
Thanks for the advice.

1255
01:18:26,794 --> 01:18:28,762
Nobody ever takes

1256
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,990
your notebook away from you,
I bet.

1257
01:18:31,899 --> 01:18:34,561
Tell you what.

1258
01:18:34,602 --> 01:18:37,071
How about I give
you a notebook.

1259
01:18:37,105 --> 01:18:40,939
Would you like that?

1260
01:18:40,976 --> 01:18:43,411
Yeah. Sure.

1261
01:18:43,446 --> 01:18:44,936
This guy's not bad.

1262
01:18:44,981 --> 01:18:47,347
Definitely one of those people

1263
01:18:47,383 --> 01:18:50,045
Golly says deserves
a closer look.

1264
01:18:50,086 --> 01:18:53,784
At least he knows the value
of a good notebook.

1265
01:18:53,824 --> 01:18:55,348
Harriet?

1266
01:18:55,392 --> 01:18:56,757
Hmm?

1267
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:58,226
It's time to go.

1268
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:02,131
Can I keep the notebook?

1269
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:04,600
I'll have to talk
to your parents about that.

1270
01:19:11,944 --> 01:19:14,242
Well, what did he say?

1271
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,010
What did he say?

1272
01:19:16,049 --> 01:19:19,917
Well, he says that, uh,
you're fine.

1273
01:19:19,953 --> 01:19:24,755
And, uh, you're a wonderful girl
and very smart

1274
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:27,920
and you'll be
a terrific writer some day.

1275
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:30,453
I could've told you that.

1276
01:19:56,328 --> 01:19:58,888
I didn't read it.

1277
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,795
Good.

1278
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:02,733
You know, Harriet,

1279
01:20:02,768 --> 01:20:07,671
uh, someday... when you grow up...
you might have children.

1280
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:09,732
Doubt it.

1281
01:20:09,775 --> 01:20:12,074
Well, not tomorrow,

1282
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:14,637
or soon, but some day.

1283
01:20:14,681 --> 01:20:16,273
Maybe.

1284
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:18,250
And, if you do,

1285
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:21,483
you're going to try really hard
to understand them.

1286
01:20:21,522 --> 01:20:22,819
But I keep telling you...

1287
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,949
I know, you told me
about the notebook.

1288
01:20:24,993 --> 01:20:26,791
And even though
you're telling me,

1289
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:28,421
and even though
I'm listening,

1290
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:31,160
I still don't
understand it, Harriet.

1291
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,500
Is that why you
took it away?

1292
01:20:34,537 --> 01:20:36,869
We made a mistake.

1293
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:43,335
Don't do it
again, okay?

1294
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,871
We try.

1295
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,847
Mom?

1296
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:52,015
Yeah?

1297
01:20:52,057 --> 01:20:53,456
Will you tuck me in?

1298
01:20:53,492 --> 01:20:55,722
Sure.

1299
01:20:59,065 --> 01:21:01,329
There we go.

1300
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,041
Green.

1301
01:21:11,078 --> 01:21:12,545
G-R-E-E-N.

1302
01:21:12,579 --> 01:21:15,310
Aren't you going to work
on your notebook today?

1303
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:16,442
Yeah. Pick a number.

1304
01:21:17,485 --> 01:21:18,713
Seven.

1305
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:21,551
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

1306
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:23,114
All right.

1307
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,128
"Turn around."

1308
01:21:26,162 --> 01:21:27,754
That's not a fortune.

1309
01:21:27,797 --> 01:21:29,162
Turn around.

1310
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:31,064
Why?

1311
01:21:31,101 --> 01:21:33,160
Turn around.

1312
01:21:33,203 --> 01:21:35,535
Golly?

1313
01:21:36,873 --> 01:21:38,432
Golly!

1314
01:21:49,555 --> 01:21:51,182
Why, Harriet the Spy,

1315
01:21:51,223 --> 01:21:53,020
I believe you've grown
a full inch.

1316
01:21:53,058 --> 01:21:55,357
Nuh-uh.

1317
01:21:55,395 --> 01:21:57,192
You certainly have grown.

1318
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,130
Oh, Golly!

1319
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:02,965
So what do I do now, Golly?

1320
01:22:03,003 --> 01:22:06,029
"Beauty is truth,
truth beauty.

1321
01:22:06,073 --> 01:22:07,802
"That is all
ye know on Earth

1322
01:22:07,908 --> 01:22:09,136
and all ye need
to know."

1323
01:22:09,176 --> 01:22:10,804
John Keats.

1324
01:22:10,912 --> 01:22:12,777
What is that
supposed to mean?

1325
01:22:12,814 --> 01:22:14,372
It means you've
got trouble.

1326
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,008
You wrote down the
truth in your notebook,

1327
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:18,213
and your friends, who weren't
supposed to see it, did.

1328
01:22:18,254 --> 01:22:20,154
Now there are only two
things for you to do,

1329
01:22:20,189 --> 01:22:22,316
and you're not going to
like either one of them.

1330
01:22:22,358 --> 01:22:24,690
Like what?

1331
01:22:24,727 --> 01:22:28,926
Well, you have to apologize
and you have to lie.

1332
01:22:28,966 --> 01:22:31,764
But you said never to lie.

1333
01:22:31,802 --> 01:22:34,169
I know, I did.

1334
01:22:34,205 --> 01:22:37,003
Let me see how
I can explain this.

1335
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:41,740
Sometimes a little lie that
makes people feel better

1336
01:22:41,779 --> 01:22:43,839
isn't really wrong.

1337
01:22:43,883 --> 01:22:46,351
You know, like,
you can thank someone

1338
01:22:46,385 --> 01:22:49,047
for a meal they cooked you,
even if you hated it.

1339
01:22:49,088 --> 01:22:51,216
You could tell a sick friend
that they look better,

1340
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:53,556
even if they don't.

1341
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:57,723
Sometimes a really small lie
can be a really big help.

1342
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:01,326
They tried to squash me
like a bug.

1343
01:23:01,369 --> 01:23:03,496
It's too hard.

1344
01:23:03,538 --> 01:23:05,267
It's not worth it.

1345
01:23:05,306 --> 01:23:08,037
Aw, never say
that, Harriet.

1346
01:23:08,076 --> 01:23:09,475
You're worth it.

1347
01:23:09,511 --> 01:23:11,502
You're an individual,
and you know something?

1348
01:23:11,547 --> 01:23:13,037
That makes people nervous.

1349
01:23:13,081 --> 01:23:15,482
And it's going to keep making
people nervous your whole life.

1350
01:23:15,518 --> 01:23:16,815
My whole life?

1351
01:23:16,886 --> 01:23:17,978
Yep.

1352
01:23:18,021 --> 01:23:19,716
What do I do?

1353
01:23:19,756 --> 01:23:22,351
You stay true to Harriet
and you accept the cost.

1354
01:23:22,393 --> 01:23:23,519
Now, come on.

1355
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:25,825
That's enough lessons
for today, okay?

1356
01:23:25,896 --> 01:23:27,591
You're 11.

1357
01:23:27,631 --> 01:23:30,499
I think it's time for you
to start writing something

1358
01:23:30,535 --> 01:23:32,469
other than notes.

1359
01:23:32,504 --> 01:23:34,028
Like what?

1360
01:23:34,072 --> 01:23:35,733
You'll think of something.

1361
01:23:35,774 --> 01:23:39,176
Can't you come back
for just a little while?

1362
01:23:39,212 --> 01:23:42,807
Oh, no, I never go back.
Only forward.

1363
01:23:42,848 --> 01:23:44,941
And you know what else?

1364
01:23:44,984 --> 01:23:47,385
Good friends are one
of life's blessings.

1365
01:23:47,421 --> 01:23:49,719
Don't give them up
without a fight.

1366
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:04,963
Replicate.
Replicate.

1367
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:07,805
Stupid spores.

1368
01:24:07,844 --> 01:24:09,402
Hi, Janie.

1369
01:24:10,414 --> 01:24:12,041
Look what you made me do.

1370
01:24:12,082 --> 01:24:13,640
This stuff is going to eat

1371
01:24:13,684 --> 01:24:15,151
right through the floor.

1372
01:24:15,186 --> 01:24:20,124
Three months of incubation
down the porcelain pee hole.

1373
01:24:21,927 --> 01:24:25,363
If you roll the rug over it,
it won't show so much.

1374
01:24:25,397 --> 01:24:28,265
Oh, so next time you
can ruin the rug?

1375
01:24:28,301 --> 01:24:29,393
No.

1376
01:24:29,435 --> 01:24:30,959
Then why are you here?

1377
01:24:31,003 --> 01:24:33,369
I just want to say that...

1378
01:24:33,406 --> 01:24:36,433
What?

1379
01:24:36,477 --> 01:24:38,536
Forget it.

1380
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:40,171
Fine.

1381
01:24:40,214 --> 01:24:41,807
Forget it.

1382
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,859
I'm sorry, Janie, okay?

1383
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:57,763
I'm sorry.

1384
01:25:02,405 --> 01:25:04,032
Will you take a look at this.

1385
01:25:04,074 --> 01:25:05,371
Huh? Huh?

1386
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,707
What do you think of your
old man now, Sport?

1387
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:10,680
10,000 smackaroos.

1388
01:25:13,518 --> 01:25:15,749
No more paying with change.

1389
01:25:15,787 --> 01:25:18,551
No more, no more spaghetti.

1390
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:20,353
Going to feel like steak.

1391
01:25:20,392 --> 01:25:22,554
And you know those fancy
basketball sneakers

1392
01:25:22,595 --> 01:25:24,586
with the, with the
buckles and the Velcro

1393
01:25:24,631 --> 01:25:25,996
and the crap all over them?

1394
01:25:26,032 --> 01:25:28,262
Their yours, buddy boy,
all yours.

1395
01:25:33,874 --> 01:25:34,841
Hello?

1396
01:25:34,942 --> 01:25:35,966
Murray.

1397
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:37,842
Hey, hey,
I take it all back.

1398
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:39,675
All agents
aren't useless.

1399
01:25:39,714 --> 01:25:42,012
Oh, I'm kidding you,
I'm kidding you, man.

1400
01:25:43,218 --> 01:25:44,651
You know I was always
in your corner.

1401
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:45,949
Oh, yeah, I knew
you'd come through.

1402
01:25:45,988 --> 01:25:47,046
Well, Sport and I
are gonna do

1403
01:25:47,089 --> 01:25:48,113
a little celebrating today...

1404
01:25:48,157 --> 01:25:51,684
- Hey.
- Hey.

1405
01:25:51,727 --> 01:25:54,060
Sold his book?

1406
01:25:54,097 --> 01:25:55,860
Got a real job.

1407
01:25:55,966 --> 01:25:57,991
Hey, Harriet, you
hear the good news?

1408
01:25:58,035 --> 01:25:59,229
You're a writer.

1409
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:02,268
So how's it feel?

1410
01:26:02,307 --> 01:26:04,605
Oh, big slice off heaven,

1411
01:26:04,642 --> 01:26:06,473
side order of fries.

1412
01:26:06,511 --> 01:26:08,103
Say, you hungry?

1413
01:26:08,146 --> 01:26:09,944
I feel like going
to the fanciest,

1414
01:26:09,982 --> 01:26:11,643
schmanciest
restaurant in town.

1415
01:26:11,684 --> 01:26:12,912
We'll abuse the waiter.

1416
01:26:12,952 --> 01:26:14,180
Who's with me? Harriet?

1417
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:15,413
She can't come.

1418
01:26:15,454 --> 01:26:17,046
What do you mean,
she can't come?

1419
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,387
You haven't even asked her.

1420
01:26:18,425 --> 01:26:20,552
I said she can't come.

1421
01:26:23,897 --> 01:26:26,025
You can't be my friend
if you're not my friend.

1422
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,805
I'm sorry, Sport.

1423
01:26:35,844 --> 01:26:38,574
I'm sorry.

1424
01:26:46,489 --> 01:26:50,984
No one will forgive me.

1425
01:26:51,028 --> 01:26:54,361
Things will never be the same.

1426
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:13,278
I have nothing left to lose.

1427
01:27:15,756 --> 01:27:18,247
Someone told me
the only reason

1428
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:20,623
you guys play with me is
because of my mom's cake.

1429
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:23,529
Well, it is very good cake.

1430
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:30,633
Yeah, but how come we get
these pieces and you get those?

1431
01:27:30,673 --> 01:27:32,641
We told you,
we're officers.

1432
01:27:32,675 --> 01:27:34,199
And we need our strength.

1433
01:27:34,243 --> 01:27:36,143
You get to fix the clubhouse.

1434
01:27:37,714 --> 01:27:39,341
Somebody's dreaming.

1435
01:27:39,382 --> 01:27:42,146
I am so bored.

1436
01:27:42,185 --> 01:27:44,085
If you don't like it,
you can leave.

1437
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,180
Hey, you're right.

1438
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,487
Wait up.

1439
01:27:51,529 --> 01:27:53,589
Anybody sick of
listening to her

1440
01:27:53,632 --> 01:27:55,463
ought to get a life.

1441
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:59,370
Okay, but you can't come back!

1442
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,839
We're voting! It's official!

1443
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:31,299
Shh! Teacher!
There she is.

1444
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:33,836
Good morning.

1445
01:28:33,877 --> 01:28:35,242
Today, we are...

1446
01:28:35,278 --> 01:28:37,212
Yes, Harriet?

1447
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,351
Miss Elson,
I've been thinking a lot,

1448
01:28:45,389 --> 01:28:46,947
and you know how class president

1449
01:28:46,991 --> 01:28:51,258
automatically gets to be editor
of the sixth grade newspaper?

1450
01:28:51,296 --> 01:28:54,356
Yes.

1451
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:59,736
Well, I think...

1452
01:28:59,773 --> 01:29:02,674
I think that it's
too much for one person

1453
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:05,474
and that it's not fair
to everybody

1454
01:29:05,513 --> 01:29:08,778
because everybody
deserves a chance.

1455
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:12,953
And...

1456
01:29:15,257 --> 01:29:17,316
And we should change it.

1457
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:18,986
Objection!

1458
01:29:19,027 --> 01:29:20,688
This isn't a courtroom, Marion.

1459
01:29:22,265 --> 01:29:25,428
I like that idea, Harriet.

1460
01:29:25,468 --> 01:29:27,197
Let's see what the class thinks.

1461
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:28,828
Miss Elson, I think

1462
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,204
I speak for everyone when I say

1463
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:34,938
this is, this is a really,
really stupid idea.

1464
01:29:34,978 --> 01:29:36,605
That is one opinion.

1465
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:40,242
But let's take a vote.

1466
01:29:40,285 --> 01:29:44,449
Marion is now editor
of the Guidepost.

1467
01:29:44,489 --> 01:29:48,324
Would anyone like to nominate
another candidate?

1468
01:29:55,402 --> 01:30:00,305
Well, I guess if no one
has anything to say...

1469
01:30:02,243 --> 01:30:04,768
I have something to say.

1470
01:30:11,153 --> 01:30:16,147
I think that Harriet's
a very good writer and...

1471
01:30:16,191 --> 01:30:19,719
if we only listen
to one person's opinion

1472
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:22,458
we may never
get anywhere new.

1473
01:30:22,498 --> 01:30:26,333
But Harriet might have
something very original

1474
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:29,168
and I'd like to read
what she has to write.

1475
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:37,213
Is there a second?

1476
01:30:37,249 --> 01:30:39,683
I second it.

1477
01:30:45,157 --> 01:30:47,216
I third it.

1478
01:30:51,064 --> 01:30:52,395
Okay, then.

1479
01:30:52,432 --> 01:30:56,266
Harriet Welsch is now
a candidate for editor.

1480
01:30:57,805 --> 01:30:59,432
Who votes for Harriet?

1481
01:31:30,842 --> 01:31:34,073
That... is that.

1482
01:31:34,112 --> 01:31:36,444
Yes.

1483
01:31:59,674 --> 01:32:01,643
I am on a mission
to be a great writer.

1484
01:32:03,779 --> 01:32:05,212
A good friend once told me

1485
01:32:05,247 --> 01:32:08,740
that all great writers
try to see everything.

1486
01:32:08,785 --> 01:32:11,720
Okay, here goes:

1487
01:32:11,755 --> 01:32:14,690
I knew this guy once.

1488
01:32:14,725 --> 01:32:16,887
He used to be a bajillionaire.

1489
01:32:16,928 --> 01:32:18,987
Now he rides a bike.

1490
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:21,658
Want to know the freaky part?

1491
01:32:23,968 --> 01:32:26,335
He says the bike's better.

1492
01:32:26,372 --> 01:32:28,932
Please write in
if you think he's lying.

1493
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,039
There's a difference
between looking at stuff

1494
01:32:38,084 --> 01:32:40,382
and really seeing it.

1495
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:44,017
Look who's here.

1496
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,685
Give them some bread, huh?

1497
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,557
Here you are.

1498
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:49,928
To really see,

1499
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:52,489
you've got to get a closer look.

1500
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:54,592
Why, thank you.

1501
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:55,603
So much.

1502
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:56,866
A cabbage.

1503
01:32:56,906 --> 01:32:59,670
Carrots in here for you.

1504
01:32:59,709 --> 01:33:01,199
And a sausage.

1505
01:33:15,927 --> 01:33:17,895
I've noticed that, sometimes,

1506
01:33:17,929 --> 01:33:20,865
stuff you think
is broken forever

1507
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,336
is actually totally fixable.

1508
01:33:26,372 --> 01:33:30,707
But some stuff is supposed
to fall apart.

1509
01:33:30,744 --> 01:33:31,802
Speaking of which,

1510
01:33:31,845 --> 01:33:34,643
certain high ranking officials
of a certain

1511
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:37,242
secret club had better
de-dorkify themselves

1512
01:33:37,285 --> 01:33:38,912
in a hurry...

1513
01:33:39,687 --> 01:33:41,518
or else everybody's going back

1514
01:33:41,556 --> 01:33:43,922
to where they were
in the first place.

1515
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:45,927
This reporter believes

1516
01:33:45,994 --> 01:33:49,225
that de-dorkification
is a difficult,

1517
01:33:49,264 --> 01:33:51,164
but not impossible, process.

1518
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,601
Mostly, you've got to want
to be cured.

1519
01:33:57,073 --> 01:34:01,477
But I'm pretty sure
it's a two steps forward,

1520
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:04,538
one step back kind of deal.

1521
01:34:04,582 --> 01:34:08,040
In theater news, Miss Elson's
sixth grade holiday pageant

1522
01:34:08,085 --> 01:34:12,386
was the theatrical controversy
of the season.

1523
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:15,791
Some were happy to see it,

1524
01:34:15,827 --> 01:34:17,819
and who am I to argue?

1525
01:34:33,882 --> 01:34:37,113
Others say... it stunk.

1526
01:34:40,723 --> 01:34:43,351
This reporter has no comment.

1527
01:34:43,392 --> 01:34:45,292
And, hey, stupid school board,

1528
01:34:45,327 --> 01:34:48,023
give Miss Elson a raise,
would you?

1529
01:34:49,065 --> 01:34:51,829
She's not so bad,
as teachers go.

1530
01:34:51,868 --> 01:34:54,564
And she puts up with a lot.

1531
01:34:55,806 --> 01:34:58,298
There's evidence to suggest
that Janie Gibbs

1532
01:34:58,342 --> 01:35:01,243
will grow up to be
the world's greatest scientist.

1533
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:04,613
So far, she has shown amazing
progress in the areas

1534
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:07,744
of mold manipulation
and chemical combustibles.

1535
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:10,812
We have also learned
that Sport's father

1536
01:35:10,856 --> 01:35:13,052
is rolling in dough
from his latest book,

1537
01:35:13,092 --> 01:35:15,560
which just goes to show,
if you stick to what you love...

1538
01:35:15,595 --> 01:35:19,224
and work like a dog...
you will succeed.

1539
01:35:19,265 --> 01:35:21,894
For those of you who don't know,
a retraction

1540
01:35:22,002 --> 01:35:24,470
is when a newspaper
takes something back.

1541
01:35:24,505 --> 01:35:28,101
This newspaper would like
to retract certain statements

1542
01:35:28,143 --> 01:35:29,303
in a certain notebook

1543
01:35:29,344 --> 01:35:31,744
which may have hurt
certain people's feelings.

1544
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,906
They were lies.

1545
01:35:32,948 --> 01:35:35,246
And those that weren't lies...

1546
01:35:35,283 --> 01:35:36,911
were mean.

1547
01:35:36,953 --> 01:35:40,116
Like, just because
a person's father is far away

1548
01:35:40,156 --> 01:35:42,454
does not mean
he doesn't love you.

1549
01:35:42,491 --> 01:35:44,084
Anyway, don't think about it.

1550
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:48,862
The truth is important,

1551
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:52,358
but so are your friends.

1552
01:35:54,305 --> 01:35:58,935
And if you can have them both,
then it's a good life.

1553
01:35:58,977 --> 01:36:04,712
Until next issue, I remain
your faithful correspondent,

1554
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:11,486
Harriet M. Welsch.

1555
01:36:15,997 --> 01:36:17,828
Get up offa that thing

1556
01:36:17,865 --> 01:36:20,766
And dance till you feel better

1557
01:36:20,801 --> 01:36:21,893
Get up offa that thing

1558
01:36:21,969 --> 01:36:24,336
And dance till you...
sing it now

1559
01:36:24,373 --> 01:36:26,398
Get up offa that thing

1560
01:36:26,441 --> 01:36:28,466
And dance till you feel better

1561
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:30,740
Get up offa that thing

1562
01:36:30,779 --> 01:36:32,475
Just try to release
that pressure

1563
01:36:32,515 --> 01:36:33,914
Get up offa that thing

1564
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:36,748
And shake till you feel better

1565
01:36:36,786 --> 01:36:38,276
Get up offa that thing

1566
01:36:38,321 --> 01:36:39,914
And shake... say it now

1567
01:36:39,957 --> 01:36:42,585
Get up offa that thing

1568
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:44,093
And shake till you feel better

1569
01:36:44,128 --> 01:36:45,925
Get up offa that thing

1570
01:36:45,963 --> 01:36:48,489
Try to release that pressure

1571
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:50,091
Get up off...

1572
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:51,932
Huh

1573
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:53,096
Good God

1574
01:36:53,138 --> 01:36:54,901
So good

1575
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:57,676
Uhh

1576
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:59,575
Everybody ready?

1577
01:37:02,815 --> 01:37:04,113
Follow me

1578
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:06,711
Get up offa that thing

1579
01:37:06,753 --> 01:37:09,051
And shake till you feel better

1580
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:10,522
Get up offa that thing

1581
01:37:10,557 --> 01:37:12,048
And shake till you...
say it now

1582
01:37:12,093 --> 01:37:14,527
Get up offa that thing

1583
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:17,030
And shake till you feel better

1584
01:37:17,065 --> 01:37:19,295
Get up offa that thing

1585
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,064
Just try to release
that pressure

1586
01:37:21,103 --> 01:37:22,661
Get up offa that thing

1587
01:37:22,705 --> 01:37:24,866
And shake till you feel better

1588
01:37:24,907 --> 01:37:27,068
Get up offa that thing

1589
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:29,510
And shake till you...
sing it now

1590
01:37:29,546 --> 01:37:31,878
Get up offa that thing

1591
01:37:31,915 --> 01:37:33,473
And shake till you feel better

1592
01:37:33,516 --> 01:37:35,678
Get up offa that thing

1593
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,278
Ooh... so good

1594
01:37:43,762 --> 01:37:44,922
Huh!

1595
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:46,361
Whoo-hoo!

1596
01:37:53,773 --> 01:37:55,866
Get up offa that thing

1597
01:37:55,908 --> 01:37:56,875
Eew, a stink bomb!

1598
01:37:56,909 --> 01:37:59,309
Get up offa that thing

1599
01:38:01,515 --> 01:38:03,779
Get up offa that thing

1600
01:38:03,817 --> 01:38:05,876
Dance till you feel better

1601
01:38:05,986 --> 01:38:07,887
Get up offa that thing

1602
01:38:07,989 --> 01:38:09,547
Just try to release
that pressure

1603
01:38:09,591 --> 01:38:10,751
Wait a minute

1604
01:38:14,095 --> 01:38:16,189
Funky

1605
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:19,895
I need it.

1606
01:38:42,629 --> 01:38:45,427
A crack in the door

1607
01:38:45,465 --> 01:38:48,731
A slit in the vines

1608
01:38:48,769 --> 01:38:51,932
A hole in the fence

1609
01:38:51,972 --> 01:38:53,940
So easy to find

1610
01:38:53,974 --> 01:39:00,278
People doing people things

1611
01:39:00,315 --> 01:39:06,880
Whatever that might be

1612
01:39:06,923 --> 01:39:13,727
They go on
about their business

1613
01:39:13,764 --> 01:39:20,068
Too wrapped up to see

1614
01:39:20,105 --> 01:39:23,563
In the shadows

1615
01:39:23,608 --> 01:39:29,411
My unblinking eye

1616
01:39:29,448 --> 01:39:34,943
I love...
the secretive life

1617
01:39:39,459 --> 01:39:42,587
I hide in the park,
behind a bush

1618
01:39:42,629 --> 01:39:44,598
I see runners and skaters

1619
01:39:44,632 --> 01:39:49,262
And a half naked man
showing off his tattoos

1620
01:39:49,303 --> 01:39:52,762
And I see old Mr. Gray
in his bad toupee

1621
01:39:52,808 --> 01:39:55,936
With some dumb girl
about half his age

1622
01:39:55,978 --> 01:40:02,282
- People doing people things
- Definitely not his wife

1623
01:40:02,318 --> 01:40:09,122
Are calling out to me

1624
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:15,293
All their grand
and foolish schemes

1625
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:22,296
It's better than TV

1626
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:31,649
They're so funny,
I could almost cry

1627
01:40:31,685 --> 01:40:37,988
I love...
the secretive life

1628
01:40:38,025 --> 01:40:41,484
There's Johnny's dad
on his third martini

1629
01:40:41,529 --> 01:40:43,326
And his nose
is getting bigger

1630
01:40:43,364 --> 01:40:46,822
As I watch him through
the kitchen window

1631
01:40:46,868 --> 01:40:51,499
They really oughta
close those blinds

1632
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:54,509
And under my coat,
I got a microrecorder

1633
01:40:54,543 --> 01:40:58,002
A pad, and a pencil,
and a picture of you

1634
01:40:58,048 --> 01:41:01,347
I can't believe you did that

1635
01:41:01,384 --> 01:41:04,286
I see two love birds
walking by

1636
01:41:04,322 --> 01:41:07,621
With that sick and dreamy
look in their eye

1637
01:41:07,658 --> 01:41:11,288
And there's a big fat cop
with a Magnum mustache

1638
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:14,959
Trying so hard to look mean

1639
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,833
The secretive life
