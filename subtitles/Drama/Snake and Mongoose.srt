Hello, everybody. I'm
Dave McClelland,

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,008
and welcome to the 24th
annual NHRA U.S. Nationals

8
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,011
at Indianapolis Raceway Park.

9
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,980
A lot of stories have developed
at the U.S. Nationals

10
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,750
through four full
days of qualifying.

11
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,654
This is one of the longest rivalries
in drag-racing history...

12
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,023
three-time world champion
and defending champ.

13
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:00,526
Don "The Snake" Prudhomme of
Granada Hills, California,

14
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,195
against his longtime
friend and Nemesis,

15
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,766
Tom "The Mongoose" McEwen of
Fountain Valley, California.

16
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,701
Prudhomme got his
nickname "The Snake"

17
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,203
because of his amazingly
quick reflexes

18
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,505
on the starting line.

19
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,875
These two have a history
going back two decades.

20
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,877
They even raced together
in a partnership...

21
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,745
the Wildlife Racing team.

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,548
What better than when you
have a snake and a mongoose

23
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,017
but to team up and
tour the country?

The classic Snake versus
Mongoose battle once again.

28
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,542
The burnout's complete and
approaching the starting line.

29

That has been the better Lane
in racing this afternoon.

33

In the near Lane, Tom McEwen.

34

The concentration begins
on that Christmas tree.

about the big picture here.

My gig is dangerous,

A lot of drivers
have families, Don.

I don't want to miss
out on that with you

because we're afraid of something
that might not happen.

406
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,188
Yeah, well, having
a kid costs money.

407
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,056
- I know that.
- All right? We have no idea.

408
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,358
So let's get an idea.

409
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,261
Tom is always coming up with
a way to make some money.

410
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,731
Maybe it's time that
we heard him out,

411
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,775
took him seriously for a change.

412
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,103
He changed his name to
Mongoose, for Christ's sakes.

413
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,839
I mean, I don't know.

414
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,374
You're part of this whether
you like it or not,

415
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,488
so we might as well see if we
can make some money with it.

416

417

Don, it's pretty catchy.

418
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,756
If it's that important to you,

419
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,767
I'll track him down and see
what he's got cooking.

420
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,330
That's all I'm asking.

- Can I have a bite of that?
- No.

Leave first, don't
redline, don't freewheel,

429
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,785
don't cross over the center
line, and don't lift.

430
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,787
- Damn straight.
- My point exactly.

431
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,889
All right.

432

Got to read the starter, man.

434
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,762
He'll have certain gestures, tics,

435
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,764
preferences in the way he
moves that'll give it away,

436
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,000
and then he wraps it
up, puts a bow on it,

437
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,102
and hands me a single
1/100 of a second.

some serious money at this?

just be another hamburger.

00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,746
These are called Hot Wheels.

610
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,381
Toy cars. That's great.

611
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,384
Now, Mattel makes a lot of
money selling these toy cars.

612
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,486
Die-cast, brother, that's
where the dough is.

613
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,221
And?

614
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,256
Well, remember I said
we have to think big?

615
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,191
Okay, what about a match-race tour,

616
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,661
except this time, we're fully
sponsored by Hot Wheels?

617
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:41,366
Now, we're talking new cars,
new engines, the lot.

618
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,936
What's a kids' toy company want
with two drag racers, man?

619
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,039
Oh, well, they get to put their
names all over our hot wheels

620
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,509
while we race them up
and down the country,

621
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,377
seen by thousands.

622
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,212
The cool part's this.

623
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,248
They get to sell
these little suckers

624
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,929
with our Mongoose and
Snake cartoons on 'em.

625
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,762
Kids really dig this, Don.

626
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,268
I mean, this is groovy, right?

627
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,497
Okay, man.

628
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,063
Hell, you're the talker.
Talk to 'em.

629
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,698
I already did.

630
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,469
How the hell did you manage that?

631
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,136
My stepfather.

632
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,906
Joe? Joe doesn't
even like you, man.

633
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,108
Yeah, well, they want
to see me again,

634
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,076
with you, the Mongoose and Snake.

635
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,244
That's what this is.

636
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,613
You want Snake to come in
and close the deal for you?

637
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,282
- Okay.
- That's just fine, buddy.

638
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,750
Let's do that. Set it up.

639
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,452
I already did.

640
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,120
I'll pick you up at
9:00 tomorrow morning.

641
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,288
All right, man.

642
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,766
And, Don, wear something sharp.

643
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,075
Still can't believe
you're wearing that.

644
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,910
Shh. Man, I'm cool.

645
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,179
Sometimes you got to show
a little class, Don.

646
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,327
<font color="#808080">(SCOFFS)</font>
Yeah, you're all class, Tom.

647
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,454
Yes? Can I help you?

648
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,289
Yeah, we're here to see Art Spear.

649
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,259
You must be Mr. McEwen
and Mr. "Produm."

650
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,927
- <font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>
- Prudhomme.

651
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,496
Mr. Spear is ready for you.

652
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,007
- Follow me, gentlemen.
- Laugh it up.

653
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,170
Thanks, Betty.

654
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,606
Thank you.

655
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,975
- Nice to see you again, Tom.
- Hey, Art. Hi.

656
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:33,511
So you must be the Snake
part of the equation.

657
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,312
- Is that right?
- Don Prudhomme.

658
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,148
The Mongoose and Snake...
that's what the fans call us.

659
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,522
Right. Sit down.

660
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:46,156
Tell me again, Tom. How
can we all work together?

661
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,691
Hot Wheels.

662
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,960
Now, you hype them as the
fastest cars on Earth.

663
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,530
Yes, and we're actually
doing very well with them.

664
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,398
Ah, Larry.

665
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,001
Gentlemen, this is Larry Wood,
our Hot Wheels design guy.

666
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,168
Larry, this is...

667
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,570
- Mongoose and Snake.
- Hey, hey.

668
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,972
- <font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>
- You know these guys?

669
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,041
Oh, sure. Sure.

670
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,911
See, what if you could combine
the fastest toy cars on Earth

671
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,479
with the fastest
real cars on Earth?

672
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,880
And you can do this?

673
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,249
Mr. Spear, we are this.

674
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,351
Take a look here.

675
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,520
Brought some photos here for you.

676
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,689
Now, see here. These
are the animals.

677
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,924
- These are our logos here.
- Right.

678
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,092
This is me here and Don, okay?

679
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,761
Larry, are these guys for real?

680
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,497
Snake's won the U.S.
Nationals twice.

681
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,533
Yeah. That's the Super
Bowl of drag racing.

682
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,868
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

683
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,937
Oh, for the past four years,

684
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,239
Don and I have been
the hottest ticket

685
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,708
in what is the fastest-growing
sport in America.

686
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:41,211
Without even trying, we pack
the stands every weekend,

687
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,013
either together or separately.

688
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:47,094
What you have in your office right
here is the biggest draw in racing.

689
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,289
Now, together, as a team,
sponsored by Mattel Hot Wheels,

690
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,527
driving cars with the Hot Wheels
logo big and bold on the sides,

691
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,762
well, hell, we're
200-mile-per-hour billboards.

692
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,066
Drag racing attracts more kids than
any other kind of auto racing,

693
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:05,569
more than stock cars or sprints,
hell, more than the Indy 500.

694
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,237
Why? Because we're fast.

695
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,040
And we're flashy
with fiery burnouts.

696
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,241
Hell, instant winners.

697
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,277
Kids can walk the pits,
meet the drivers.

698
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,613
- You know, hell, we're...
- Accessible?

699
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,748
You're damn right we're accessible.

700
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,985
We are in real life what Hot
Wheels is in miniature.

701
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,554
- And there's TV coverage, right?
- For the big events.

702
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:27,224
So our logo gets across the finish line
first in front of millions of viewers?

703
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,259
- Damn right it does.
- Well, we can't guarantee

704
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,761
one of us will win every time.

705
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,663
It'd be better if you did.

706
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,833
How much funding do you think
you'd need to pull this off?

707
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,968
Oh...

708
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:43,941
100 grand should be enough
to build two funny cars,

709
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,576
record-setting cars, of course.

710
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,944
Funny cars?

711
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,479
Oh, there it is.

712
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,814
- Yeah.
- Very cool.

713
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,858
- That's it right there.
- Look, guys.

714
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,286
<font color="#804040">ART</font>: Oh.

715
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,689
Well, trophies are fine,

716
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,357
but I'm looking for branding.

717
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,127
I want every kid in America
to buy Hot Wheels.

718
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,129
Not just to know the brand,

719
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,031
but to love it,

720
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,075
like...

721
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,770
well, like Barbie.

<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>

723
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:19,309
Mr. Spear, you put these cartoon
characters on the cars,

724
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,353
and you watch the kids go nuts.

725
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,649
The more I think about this...

726
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,020
the more I like it.

727
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,689
So he just keeps a Barbie
sitting in his desk like that?

728
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,856
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>
I guess so.

729
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,360
But, brother, we're about
to become a team, the team.

730
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,797
Well, what do you think about
Wildlife Racing as a name?

731
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,832
I mean, you're the Snake.
I'm the Mongoose.

732
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,002
- Kind of makes sense, right?
- Wildlife Racing.

733
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,171
Hell, the way you drive, I
guess that does make sense.

734
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:48,373
Very funny.

736
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,225
- Whoo-ee!
- Let's get 'em buttoned up, boys.

737
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,760
- Watch the merchandise.
- This is the real deal here, Donny.

738
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,862
Chop-chop. Let's get out of here.

739
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,397
All right, let's line
up real quickly.

740
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,833
Let's go, guys. Don. Don.

741
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,435
Tommy, let's go. Spear
wants a photograph.

742
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,205
- Let's line it up.
- Hey, lose the cigarette.

743
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,407
Now that Coke's a sponsor,
they want one too.

744
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,875
- Ready for this? Look good.
- Here we go.

745
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,510
- Right this way, girls.
- Shake my hand.

746
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,418
Look pretty. Here we go. Smile.

747
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,602
Don, smile.

00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,972
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mike, is that big voice

749
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,974
we hear at the track
your real voice?

750
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,076
- You mean this one?
- Yeah, that one.

- Buddy, you're right.
- "Super Stock," huh?

756
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,289
Oh, look at that.
We're on the cover.

757
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,491
Oh, look at that.
Your name's first.

758
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,561
It's 'cause I'm prettier.
Ah, hell, come on.

759
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,096
You said you didn't care
about any of that anyway.

760
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:20,564
- Yeah, I didn't.
- Uh-huh.

01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,134
Yeah.

1352
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,736
And even though I'm just the mouth,

1353
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,439
I won it.

1354
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:21,143
Hey, we all got to
die someday, Snake.

1355
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,153
Can't live your life
in fear of that.

1356
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:26,315
Now what else are you
going to do, huh?

1357
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,359
You going to go back
to painting cars?

1358
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,254
I know I ain't got nothing
else going on outside of this.

1359
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:34,323
You and me, we are
drag racers, man.

1360
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,834
That doesn't mean I got
to drive 'em anymore.

1361
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,204
You gonna let someone else race me?

1362
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:43,074
Damn it, we need you
out there, Don.

1363
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,637
- Here.
- What's this?

1364
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,639
'71 sponsorship money.

1365
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,207
200 grand?

1366
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,309
That's right.

1367
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,545
Now we can finally big those
rear-engine dragsters

1368
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:59,648
that the Garlits dreamed of.

1369
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:02,090
Hell, with that, we take
luck out of the equation.

1370
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,361
Time to get back behind
the wheel, brother.

1371
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,532
<font color="#804040">ANNOUNCER</font>: Don Prudhomme's Snake.

1372
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,735
Torn McEwen's Mongoose.

1373
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:23,240
Dragdom's fastest duo goes from
the drag strip to your home.

1374
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,242
It's Mattel's
Mongoose-Snake drag set,

1375
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:28,911
just like the big ones.

1376
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:32,381

Hey, kids, you guys
have Hot Wheel cars?

1381
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,361
Absolutely, yes, Sir.

01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,397
<font color="#804040">DON</font>: Well, who's faster,
Snake or Mongoose?

1383
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:52,067
- Snake.
- Oh, no. Come on.

1384
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,036
You paid those kids to say that.

1385
01:07:54,037 --> 01:07:55,910
- They know the truth.
- <font color="#804040">ART</font>: Hey, guys.

1386
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,106
Great crowd.

1387
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,676
Look at all the kids. I love it.

1388
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:02,244
What do you think of the new cars?

1389
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:04,346
Hey, great new colors.

1390
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:06,915
You mean the same cars, Art?
They look the same to me.

1391
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,685
Those cars were number-one and
number-two best sellers last year.

1392
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:11,219
Don't fix it if it ain't broken.

1393
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,888
- Right, Don?
- Yeah.

1394
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:14,456
- You'd know.
- Here you go.

1395
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,958
Right.

1396
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:18,193
Here are the new dragsters.

1397
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,668
<font color="#804040">TOM</font>: All right, different cars.

1398
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,264
Somehow the same color.

1399
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:26,470
Here, Art. This is our schedule
for the next six months.

1400
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,571
Not a lot of dates open for us.

1401
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,274
Yeah, well, the NHRA keeps growing,

1402
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,042
which is great for both of us.

1403
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,445
We can keep racing cars, and
you can keep selling 'em.

1404
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,447
I hope so, Tom.

1405
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,282
- Me, too.
- I got to get going.

1406
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,817
I got a meeting at General Motors.

Hey, Top Fuel cars and funny cars.

01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,605
That's what you wanted, right?

1410
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:57,299
Sure. I mean, I guess so.

1411
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,601
No, you got to play ball, Don.

1412
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,436
Come on. Damn it.

1413
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,406
And with the smoking
in front of the kids.

1414
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:06,008

Thanks for coming in.

I thought it only fair
to do this in person.

What's going on here?

1441
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,892
Well, Tom, Don, Hot
Wheels' marketing team

1442
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,427
has decided to make some changes.

1443
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,096
What kind of changes?

1444
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:35,831
I'm sorry, but Mattel
will not be renewing

1445
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:38,100
our major sponsorship
with Wildlife Racing.

1446
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:40,035
But you said our cars
were your best sellers.

1447
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:42,537
Well, they've both done great.

1448
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,039
Times are different.

1449
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,675
We're shifting gears, so to speak,
keeping other options open,

1450
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,944
and frankly we think the
sales on these cars

1451
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:51,179
- have reached their peak.
- Here we go.

1452
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,348
Look, I'm not saying that we
want to pull out altogether.

1453
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,351
We'd like to stay on
as a secondary sponsor

1454
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:58,054
for the next year or two.

1455
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:04,803
You guys have been great,
but this is business.

1456
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,131
No hard feelings, right?

1457
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,270
Well, that was all your fault.

1458
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,105
Are you kidding me, man?

1459
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,274
You're always bitching and moaning
to Spear about something.

1460
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,442
No wonder they're dropping us.

1461
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,078
Maybe if you tried to win a
race once in a while, Tom...

1462
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:24,780
- To hell with you.
- ...they wouldn't be so bored with us.

1463
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,115
It was always me who
kept our deal on track.

1464
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,751
Is that right, Tom? Wow.

1465
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,920
I saw this coming.

1466
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,455
I already got another
sponsor lined up.

1467
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,957
Oh, I bet you saw this coming.

1468
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,394
- Beech-Nut Gum.
- Beech-Nut?

1469
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,129
You never said anything
about talking to them.

1470
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,465
Well, you're always too busy
with the damn cars, Don.

1471
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:46,134
Yeah, Tom, that's how it works.

1472
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,737
All right, partner.
Tell me about the deal.

1473
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,472
Well, we show them
what we're worth.

1474
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,274
This time next year,
it'll be a big payday.

1475
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:54,309
I'm not auditioning for
some chewing gum, man.

1476
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,412
You've got to have Patience, Don.
You've got to develop relationships.

1477
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,649
I've been patient my whole damn
life. Don't preach Patience to me.

1478
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,084
Oh, you hold on a second
here, Mr. Hotshot.

1479
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,987
I got us the Mattel deal.
You remember that?

1480
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,155
My idea.

1481
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,091
Without me, you'd still be
painting cars with your old man.

1482
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,527
You don't think I could
do this without you, huh?

1483
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:15,163
I'd be better off if I did.

1484
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,933
I'll tell you what. I'll
get my own deal, Tom.

1485
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:20,001
You race your team. I'll run mine.

1486
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,838
This Midlife Racing
crap is over, man.
