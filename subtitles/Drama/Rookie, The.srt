1
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:16,962
I still don't get it.

2
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:17,932
What?

3
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,895
Maybe you'll figure it out, huh.

4
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,630
- Woo! Nice take, nice take.
- Nice take.

5
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:27,945
I'm just saying, you an Swarek are solid.

6
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,634
Look, it is what is is.

7
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:31,855
Sucker!

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,748
Okay, good.

9
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:36,603
People stay together.
People break up. Whatever.

10
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:38,697
Well, you seem to be dealing pretty well.

11
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,567
What else am I gonna do?
I mean, I have the choice.

12
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,801
I either fall apart or keep moving,

13
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:44,186
and I choose to keep moving.

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,737
You know what?

15
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:47,138
With everything that
happened with Gail and Traci,

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,441
my romantic life is not an issue.

17
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,577
Yeah, it kinda puts it into perspective.

18
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:53,245
I'm getting over it. I'm fine.

19
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,746
♪ 'Cause it's a war zone out here ♪

20
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,031
Nice.

21

22

24
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:03,956
Great workout,

25
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,507
although she totally
cleaned my stove. (Chuckles)

26
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:07,509
It was brutal.

27
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:09,011
- So you're taking me in, right?
- Absolutely.

28
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:10,629
Thanks again for lending me your truck.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,181
Oh, that's no problem.

30
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:14,349
Must be a pretty big doctor's appointment.

31
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:15,851
I mean, if you're taking the whole day.

32
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:19,137
Not just doctor. Dentist,
optometrist, podiatrist...

33
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:20,672
I do 'em all, same day, once a year.

34
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:22,524
Optimization of transportation.

35
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,476
(Chuckles) Okay.

36
00:01:24,527 --> 00:01:25,978
You coming?

37
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:27,029
(Keys jangle) Right behind ya.

38
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:28,530
Just gotta grab my coat.

39
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,399
(Clicks tongue) (Jangles)

40
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:32,017
(Horn honks in distance)

41
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:35,737
(Beeps)

42
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:39,357
Hey. It's me. I got the truck.

43
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,959
Be there in 20.

44
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:42,244
<i>(Woman) ♪ and every
time you touch me right ♪</i>

45
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:43,829
<i>♪ it's like, oh, oh</i>

46
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,964
Really? That's what we're gonna listen to?

47
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:49,251
Yep. I mean, you're the one who
wanted to pick me up, remember?

48
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:51,253
Oh, so that means you
get to choose the music?

49
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:54,389
Fine. Let's see what you have on preset.

50
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:58,227
(Changing radio stations)

51
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:00,545
(Chuckles)

52
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:03,214
(Turns off radio) Whoa! Good
God, man. How old are you?

53
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,850
I'm old enough to know what I like.

54
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:06,985
Yeah, well, we gotta
get you with the program,

55
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:09,387
because you are a virile young man.

56
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,690
(Chuckles) We need to get you set up here.

57
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,775
Hey, you know I don't actually
need a ride to work, like,

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,360
every single day, right?

59
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:16,328
(Turn indicator clicking)

60
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:17,696
Dude, I'm good.

61
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:21,399
No, I know. I just... I like the company.

62
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:24,086
Oh.

63
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,421
And the sparkling conversation.

64
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,874
Okay. (Turns on radio)

65
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:30,542
Ohh.

66
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:31,593
<i>(Man) ♪ yeah ♪ (Woman) ♪ all night</i>

67
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:33,045

<i>♪ ... from scratch, oh,

70
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,634
I can't lose you right now, Callaghan.

71
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:39,918
I'm already short a detective.

72
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,470
You've got Nash starting back today.

73
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:44,422
She can take over some
of Jerry's case files.

74
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:46,058
You're in a rush to get
out of here. I get it.

75
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,726
I didn't say that.

76
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,444
Project Dakota?

77
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:52,230
Heard about it at headquarters.

78
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:54,199
It's a big deal. Congratulations.

79
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,951
No idea what you're talking about.

80
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:57,286
(Chuckles)

81
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,788
(Lowered voice) Well, we should figure
out who you need in terms of people.

82
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,373
Major task force on organized crime.

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,791
We got the best of the best right here.

84
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,661
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

85
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:08,213
What? You'll keep that in mind?

86
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,214
You spent years in this building.

87
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,299
Where's your loyalty?

88
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:11,282
(Lowered voice) Look, Frank,

89
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:13,669
15's in a rough patch, okay?

90
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,120
Your numbers are down.

91
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,956
It's not your fault that a detective
was killed in the line of duty.

92
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,392
Our numbers have nothing to
do with abilities or talents.

93
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,728
I understand that, but
people are starting to notice.

94
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,896
Getting any of your people on
a major task force right now

95
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,148
would be a tough sell.

96
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,748
(Clatters)

97
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,462
(Indistinct conversations)

98
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:05,170
Why are you in uniform?

99
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:06,388
Already cleared it with Frank.

100
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,023
(Frank) All right. Listen up.

101
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,891
As of today, we're
putting the past behind us,

102
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,560
which means we're moving forward.

103
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:13,311
Officer Swarek, "back to basics"...

104
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:14,896
what does that mean to you?

105
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:17,482
It means hit the streets.
Foot patrols, traffic stops.

106
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,784
That's right.

107
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,036
Talk to ten people. Make two arrests.

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,740
Back to basics, people. I
want to see results today.

109
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:27,358
McNally, Collins, Anderson, Pearce,

110
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,862
I want you guys at Jarvis,
Sherbourne, and Carlton.

111
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:32,464
Get out of your cars. Get on the streets.

112
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,882
Be proactive.

113
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,366
(Lowered voice) I guess
numbers are down again.

114
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,368
(Lowered voice) You think?

115
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,704
(Indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

116
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,539
Nash?

117
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,758
Can you come here a second?

118
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:45,560
(Radio chatter)

119
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,078
What's going on?

120
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,146
Frank didn't tell you?

121
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:49,398
Tell me what?

122
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,883
(Clears throat) It's my first shift back,

123
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:56,304
and I just thought that...
I should start on the street,

124
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,606
you know, get back on the horse.

125
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,808
How long?

126
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:02,344
Look, Nash, I've been
saving files for you.

127
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:04,796
I'm dealing with Jerry's
entire caseload on my own.

128
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:07,048
I just need a couple of days.

129
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:09,167
I... I know you've been through a lot,

130
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:11,153
but you've been off a month already,

131
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:14,556
and this detective job...
this is a training rotation,

132
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,525
so if you can't do this,
you need to let me know,

133
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,877
because I gotta find somebody who can.

134
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:25,467
It won't even... it'll be,
like, unintentionally all...

135
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:27,202
Hey. McNally, how ya doin'?

136
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,336
Good. Fine. You?

137
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,204
Ready to get back to basics?

138
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:30,255
Yes, sir.

139
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:32,174
Hey, hey. Hey, wait. Wait up.

140
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:35,293
(Radio chatter)

141
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,462
Hey. (Sighs)

142
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:39,147
Uh, I want to talk to you about something.

143
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:41,383
Okay.

144
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:46,121
Um... (Sighs)

145
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:47,539
uh, my keys, um, to the truck.

146
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:48,757
I just, um, it's my only other set.

147
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,325
I should probably get those back.

148
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:53,512
Keys. Yeah. Uh...

149
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,813
I think they're in my locker.

150
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,198
I can go grab 'em right now for you.

151
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:59,301
No, no. Later's fine.

152
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:01,853
All right. Have a good shift.

153
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,421
You, too.

154
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,641
Diaz, come on! Let's go!

155
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,610
(Chuckles) You got that right.

156
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:10,545
See ya.

157
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,697
Back to basics. I love it.

158
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,783
(Siren wailing)

159
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:15,984
(Door opens)

160
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:17,268
Hey, did you check your weapon?

161
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,269
Yes.

162
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:19,270
And your radio's turned on?

163
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,622
Yes, Gail.

164
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:21,456
Hey, who knows what kind of bad habits

165
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,674
you picked up at the D's?

166
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:25,177
I mean, this is real policing right here.

167
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:27,612
(Radio chatter)

168
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,813
(Horn honks)

169
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:29,948
There you are.

170
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:30,982
(Sniffles, voice breaking) Hey.

171
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:31,967
I was looking for you inside.

172
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:33,151
I thought you might have gone in...

173
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,038
Yeah, no. I'm, uh, I'm
a keener, so... (Sniffles)

174
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,173
(Seat belt buckle clicks) You okay?

175
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:40,108
(Sniffles) Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

176
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:41,259
Let's get to work.

177
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,244
(Starts engine)

178
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:44,212
(Sniffles)

179
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,547
(Exhales deeply)

180
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:47,932
(Radio chatter)

181
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,519
Disobeying a traffic
light, improper Lane change,

182
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:53,104
failure to signal,
taillight or headlight out...

183
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,373
today nothing escapes our notice.

184
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:56,458
(Radio chatter)

185
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,510
So you've been doing all right?

186
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,979
I mean, considering
everything that's happened

187
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,964
and... and you and Andy breaking up?

188
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,616
- Diaz.
- Right. Yeah.

189
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:05,901
If you don't want to talk
about it, that's cool, too.

190
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:08,286
Red Corolla up ahead. Notice anything?

191
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:11,223
Busted taillight. Nice.

192
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,761
(Radio chatter)

193
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:22,417
You know, my worst breakup, I
cried every day for two weeks.

194
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:26,771
No, but I did buy a motorcycle

195
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,940
and joined the army, so...

196
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,175
I don't know.

197
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,726
And then I grew a mustache.

198
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,261
(Chuckles) (Chuckles)
You know how some guys

199
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,480
look really good with mustaches
and some guys just do not?

200
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:38,300
Well, I do not, and I went to Afghanistan,

201
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,736
and all these guys were
like, "I cannot believe... "

202
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:45,423
"good riddance: How to ditch
that loser and keep smiling."

203
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:47,893
Wow. Okay. You definitely win.

204
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:50,111
Yeah. My mom got it for me.
She thought it would help me.

205
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,663
So did it?

206
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:53,848
I don't know. I haven't
read it all the way yet.

207
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,534
(Sniffles)

208
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,653
(Keypad beeping) I don't know.
Guy seemed kinda frazzled.

209
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,438
Couple of baby seats in the back.

210
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:01,990
Maybe we should cut him a break.

211
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:04,292
Two priors for domestic assault.

212
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:06,044
Beats his wife.

213
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,996
We let him off 'cause
she won't press charges.

214
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:10,081
Turns around, beats her again.

215
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:13,151
Okay, but right now all we
got is a busted taillight.

216
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,986
Good thing we're back to basics.

217
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,989
(Radio chatter)

218
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:22,844
(Sighs)

219
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:25,847
(Radio chatter continues)

220
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,354
Not a good day for you, my friend.

221
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:33,688
You rolled right through that stop sign

222
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,707
when you made your turn back there.

223
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:38,293
Uh, your rear marker, the
little light over the top

224
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:41,446
of your license plate... not illuminated.

225
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,900
Failure to sign your
vehicle registration in ink.

226
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:48,820
You used a pencil.
That's a separate offense.

227
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,807
Failure to produce insurance documents,

228
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,676
and you have a broken taillight.

229
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,512
<i>Five tickets? Are you serious?</i>

230
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:58,963
You're gonna give me five tickets?

231
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:00,431
We don't make the rules, sir.

232
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,233
Oh, forget it! I'm not paying these!

233
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:03,201
Please step out of the car, sir.

234
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:04,202
Oh, come on!

235
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,037
(Seat belt buckle clicks)

236
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,173
Over here, sir.

237
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,642
- I want your badge numbers, both of you.
- We're just doing our job, sir.

238
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,810
Yeah? And I pay your salaries, jackass.

239
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,380
Never heard that one before.
Do you write your own material?

240
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,698
Screw you.

241
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,883
And that's called "assaulting an officer."

242
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,251
- Here we go.
- Ohh! Hey.

243
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:21,503
- Sir, I need you to hold still.
- Ow!

244
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,971
(Handcuffs click)

245
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:24,956
"Rule number 3... do not
talk to your ex for 60 days."

246
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,608
Ooh, well, good thing you
guys don't work together.

247
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,543
Okay, you don't have to read it out loud.

248
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,028
It says here you need a breakup buddy,

249
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,563
rule number five... "someone
who will kick your ass

250
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,931
and make sure you follow the rules."

251
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:33,898
Skipping it.

252
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,083
Oh, my God.

253
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:36,067
You want me to be your breakup buddy.

254
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,585
Andy, I am touched.

255
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,220
(Laughs) Shut up.

256
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:40,522
(Radio static)

257
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:41,806
(Woman) 1520, we've got a vehicle fire

258
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:43,324
at Queen and Cowan at St. Julian's Church.

259
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,260
Please attend. Fire has
been dispatched. (Static)

260
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:47,178
1520. Show us responding. (Static)

261
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:49,531
(Receiver clicks, siren wailing)

262
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:52,484
(Indistinct conversations,
flames crackling)

263
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:57,338
(Static) 1520.

264
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:59,424
Vehicle is indeed on fire.

265
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,942
Put a rush on the fire
department. (Static)

266
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:04,662
(Extinguisher spraying)

267
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,164
Whoa! Whoa!

268
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:08,733
- Hey! Move back! Get back!
- Hey! What are you doing?!

269
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:11,202
- Hey, come on!
- I got ten crates of tomato sauce in there. Come on!

270
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:12,236
Okay. Come on, sir. Let's go, please.

271
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,172
Come on. Come on!

272
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,924
- Come on. Move back.
- Get against the building.

273
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:16,925
Back up against the building.

274
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,577
No, all four of you.

275
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:21,129
Is that your car there?

276
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:24,382
(Speaks indistinctly)

277
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,184
(Sighs)

278
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,705
I was unloading stuff into the kitchen.

279
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:35,007
Two minutes I must have been down there.

280
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,926
When I came back up, the van was on fire.

281
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:39,461
You didn't see anyone around it?

282
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:40,445
No.

283
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:41,730
No one running away?

284
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:43,782
Nobody.

285
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:45,167
Is there anyone you can think of that
might want to hurt you? (Siren whoops)

286
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:48,387
I'm a priest. Who would
want to hurt a priest, right?

287
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,122
Well, someone's trying
to send you a message.

288
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:52,507
Probably some junkie I pissed off.

289
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:53,625
I got one rule... you show up high,

290
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,927
you get nothing. No exceptions.

291
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,462
So you think a junkie
set your van on fire?

292
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,514
It could be. I mean,
it's pretty easy, right?

293
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:02,417
A beer bottle half-full
of gas, stuff a rag in it.

294
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:03,835
It's pretty simple. Takes two minutes.

295
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:05,771
(Radio chatter)

296
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:06,971
Hey, you mind if I get in there?

297
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:08,290
I may be able to salvage something.

298
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:09,875
Uh, no. Sorry, father.

299
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,059
Crime scene, right?

300
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:12,677
Well, it's all a write-off, anyway.

301
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,880
Just 'cause something's damaged don't mean

302
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:17,482
you gotta throw it away.

303
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,767
Let you know when we're done.

304
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:20,318
Mm-hmm.

305
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,656
(Traci) None of these kids
was outside when it happened.

306
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:26,174
(Gail) Yeah, but what about the priest?

307
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,677
<i>Well, he says he didn't see anything.</i>

308
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:30,178
- But...
- Well... (Sighs)

309
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:31,196
I don't know. I met this guy before.

310
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:32,381
He doesn't miss a trick.

311
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:33,799
What does he have to hide?

312
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,133
He runs a program for street kids.

313
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:36,618
He gives 'em a safe place to sleep.

314
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:38,887
He feeds them. He tries
to get them off drugs.

315
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,856
Maybe he's protecting one of his kids.

316
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,723
Yeah, it'd be a priest-like thing to do,

317
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:42,991
turn the other cheek.

318
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,209
Well, either way, it's a death threat,

319
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:45,343
so we have to take it seriously.

320
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,762
You coming?

321
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:47,879
Maybe we talk to one of the locals,

322
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,864
see if they saw something?

323
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,615
Let's do it.

324
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,618
(Grunts) Let me guess. Brick collection?

325
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,053
(Closes door) Textbooks. (Chuckles)

326
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:58,256
Listen, Dov, thanks for helping
me move on such short notice.

327
00:11:58,307 --> 00:11:59,908
I just... I just didn't
have anyone else to call.

328
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,726
No, I told you, whatever you need,

329
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:03,445
<i>but... along with all these books,</i>

330
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:04,529
you're also gonna need some furniture.

331
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,864
First time moving out,

332
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:07,015
maybe your mom will
spring for a new couch.

333
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,484
She's helped enough with med school.

334
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:11,436
Yeah, I know, but once she sees
how empty your apartment is.

335
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,288
I don't want her help.
Besides, I don't think

336
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:14,756
she's gonna be coming by here anyway.

337
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,541
Okay. None of my business.

338
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:17,676
That's right. (Sighs)

339
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:18,977
But if it were, I might ask.

340
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:21,363
My mom found out I was talking to you.

341
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,650
That's why you're moving out?

342
00:12:25,718 --> 00:12:29,371
It's... it was my decision.
It's not a big deal. I left.

343
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:32,374
So are you gonna help me move or what?

344
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,046
(Traci) Nobody's talking.

345
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,631
Yeah, what a surprise.

346
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,683
I almost forgot how hard it was.

347
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,068
See, this is exactly my point.

348
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,853
It's not exactly a cakewalk out here,

349
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:48,340
and you spent all that time
training to be a detective.

350
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,142
Just don't want you to throw it away.

351
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,810
I'm not throwing it away.

352
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:53,411
I'm just trying to figure out where I fit.

353
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:57,766
Here we go. 1:00.

354
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:01,236
So those are the corner guys,
the ones taking the orders?

355
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,522
Yeah, except I think we
might be cramping their style.

356
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:05,090
(Police radio chatter)

357
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:08,260
Where are the runners, the
kids who deliver the drugs?

358
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:11,213
(Children speak indistinctly)

359
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,649
(Radio chatter continues)

360
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:16,418
God, look at them. They could
care less that we're here.

361
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:20,138
As long as they're under 12,
they're practically immune.

362
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:23,708
Hey. You kids want to have a chat?

363
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,160
Hey!

364
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:26,878
Hey!

365
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:30,381
- Ow! Let go! Let me go!
- Oh, d... don't be so dramatic.

366
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:31,783
This is total brutality!

367
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:33,401
You just hit me in the
face with a slushie.

368
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,253
Okay, you little punk? So guess what?

369
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,455
You can go for a ride in my squad car.

370
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:39,007
You okay?

371
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:42,627
Like I said, it's not exactly a cakewalk.

372
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,996
Last three months, church
been vandalized six times...

373
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,165
broken windows, graffiti...

374
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:48,166
(Knock)

375
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:49,634
Hey. You got a minute?

376
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,736
No.

377
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:55,257
Father Jean Pierre Solaine.
Five years for armed robbery.

378
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:58,693
Three for aggravated assault.
Got out of prison in 2006.

379
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:01,129
So he wouldn't be the first
guy to find God in jail.

380
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:02,614
(Nick) Think he knows
who set the van on fire.

381
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:05,083
'Course he does. He's not gonna tell you.

382
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:08,036
Look, people confide in
him, tell him their sins.

383
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,554
One honest conversation with this guy,

384
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:12,591
I could probably close 18 cases.

385
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,192
Curtis Payne.

386
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,560
(Keyboard clicks, beep)

387
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:17,479
Local dealer.

388
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,447
Hires the neighborhood kids.

389
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:20,966
Father Jean Pierre's been
pushing back for years.

390
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,784
Your van fire probably has
something to do with that.

391
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,653
Well, it sounds like the
priest is doing something right.

392
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:26,354
Look, if you want to get
any traction with this,

393
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:27,622
you're gonna need an eyewitness,

394
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,990
somebody who can put Curtis at the fire.

395
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:30,492
If you can get Curtis Payne on this...

396
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:31,960
Then we can trade up
and get to his suppliers.

397
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:33,395
Back to basics.

398
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,864
Curtis Payne is no joke.
He's dangerous, okay?

399
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,465
Andy, I'm serious.

400
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:43,371
Curtis buys them anything they
want... running shoes, iPod...

401
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:45,390
he even takes 'em to hockey games.

402
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,726
Yeah, that's what these
kids want, is attention, huh?

403
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:49,511
That's why nobody snitches on him.

404
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,047
Curtis just sucks them into
the life, and they're lost.

405
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:54,182
They end up in jail or dead.

406
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,100
The father tries to make
sure that doesn't happen.

407
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:58,587
He did the same thing for me.
I used to work the streets.

408
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,804
Hey, you want to give me a hand with this?

409
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,306
Sure. Where's this going?

410
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,541
Downstairs. Cory will show you where.

411
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,627
- Lead the way.
- Follow me.

412
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:06,962
Got something for you, too.

413
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:07,946
Okay.

414
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,364
And there we go.

415
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:10,899
(Police radio chatter)

416
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:14,052
See, I knew you guys
were good for something.

417
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,805
(Police radio chatter)

418
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,440
- We're good to go.
- Yep.

419
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:19,524
Here's fine.

420
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:20,558
Just make a pile.

421
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,127
All right.

422
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:23,828
Sounds like father Jean
Pierre's doing pretty good work.

423
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,931
Yeah, I guess.

424
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:29,784
Hey, Cory? Any idea who might
have burned the van today?

425
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:30,952
It was Curtis, for sure.

426
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:32,654
Oh, yeah? You saw him?

427
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:34,839
No.

428
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:38,510
Oh. Father Jean Pierre
taught you not to lie, huh?

429
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:40,462
Father's a smart man.

430
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:41,596
(Gunshots, glass shattering)

431
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,247
(Andy) Cory, get down!

432
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:44,265
- (Nick) Don't move!
- Cory, are you okay?

433
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,017
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Stay there!

434
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:49,888
1520, 10-33, Queen
and Cowan. Shots fired.

435
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:52,807
(Police radio chatter, tires screeching)

436
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,948
(Holsters gun) What happened?

437
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:01,399
It's called a drive-by.

438
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,534
- Everyone okay?
- I'm good.

439
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:03,768
You take care of her.

440
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:06,071
Hey. Father. Come on. Let us handle this.

441
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,823
<i>Let you handle this? Are you serious?!</i>

442
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,042
You're the reason we're
getting shot at, officer.

443
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,044
It's your fault!

444
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:22,347
(Sirens wailing in distance)

445
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:28,372
Watch yourself there, pal.
Big step forward, all right?

446
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,274
Got a cruiser coming
in. Come on. You guys?

447
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:33,076
I need you on the other side
of the street, all right?

448
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:34,728
So the bullets hit up here,
taking out the windows,

449
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:36,063
and father Jean Pierre was down here?

450
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:38,115
Mm-hmm. Guess they
didn't have very good aim.

451
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:40,768
Or they're just sending a
message, trying to scare him.

452
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:42,019
I met this guy a few times before.

453
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,604
I don't think he scares that easy.

454
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:45,038
Callaghan, you want to give
me the tag, I'll run it down?

455
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,024
We didn't get the license plate, actually.

456
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,026
By the time we got out
here, they were gone.

457
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,512
I'm sorry. So you were
both inside the church?

458
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:54,364
Yeah. Father Jean Pierre
asked us to bring in some gear.

459
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,033
What kind of gear?

460
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,751
Tomato sauce.

461
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,039
So you were unloading groceries
while the priest was out here

462
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:04,725
<i>getting shot at. Is that right?
Did anyone see the vehicle?</i>

463
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,077
Well, far as we can gather, gold S.U.V.

464
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,612
Full size, maybe an Escalade.

465
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:10,397
I'll see if I can find any gold S.U.Vs

466
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:12,316
registered in the neighborhood.

467
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:15,151
(Sam) Genius. Why don't you two
talk to father Jean Pierre again,

468
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,336
see if he remembers anything else?

469
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:17,871
Mm-hmm.

470
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,209
Some, uh, fantastic
leadership there, Sammy.

471
00:17:22,277 --> 00:17:23,727
You want to take a shot at me next?

472
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:25,245
Good to have you back, Callaghan.

473
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,230
Keep saying that.

474
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:27,931
Always a pleasure.

475
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:30,000
How many times I gotta tell you?

476
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,269
They came out of nowhere,
started shooting at us.

477
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,437
It happened so fast.

478
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:34,955
So you didn't recognize the car?

479
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:37,591
Once again, it was a S.U.V.
I didn't see anything else.

480
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:41,795
It was Curtis Payne, wasn't
it? Why is he shooting at you?

481
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:43,497

00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:39,553
Oh, no. Oh, no. No.

642
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:42,439
No, thank you. No. No, th...
whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no! No!

643
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:43,440
Car wash, sir?

644
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,808
(Engine starts) Stop.

645
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,026
Stop! No! We don't need anything!

646
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,978
Get away from our car! Stop!

647
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,447
(Nick) We're fine! Thank
you! Step off the car!

648
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,449
Watch it with the squirting, okay?

649
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,784
(Tires pealing) Back off. Up against
the fence. Up against the fence.

650
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,453
(Groans)

651
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:06,935
Curtis Payne is a major
player in this neighborhood.

652
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:09,271
Intimidation, violence...

653
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,773
he's a suspect in seven
different assaults.

654
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,942
In, like, six years, we
haven't been able to touch him.

655
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:15,844
All the more reason we
need to play it by the book.

656
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,096
Informants, undercover
buys... none of it's worked.

657
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:21,716
He's too careful. Best we
can do is rattle his cage.

658
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:24,253
Speaking of which...

659
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,072
All right, gentlemen. Let's
go. Hands against the wall.

660
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:28,524
(Man)... Talking about, man?

661
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:30,209
What did I just say?
Hands against the wall.

662
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,160
- (Man) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- (Man) Hey, man! Man!

663
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:33,812
What are you doing?

664
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,564
What do you think we're
doing, Officer Diaz?

665
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:36,932
We're arresting criminals.

666
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:39,034
Arresting them for what?

667
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:42,137
<i>You didn't see 'em selling
drugs? I saw 'em selling drugs.</i>

668
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:43,839
They just seem like a
bunch of kids hanging out.

669
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:46,074
No, no, no. Let's take a closer look.

670
00:24:46,142 --> 00:24:47,359
(Thud)

671
00:24:50,797 --> 00:24:52,681
(Police radio chatter)

672
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:55,117
Dispatch is gonna put a lookout
on Father Jean Pierre's car.

673
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:57,185
Is he gonna get in trouble for taking off?

674
00:24:57,253 --> 00:24:59,071
No, he's not. We are
trying to protect him.

675
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:00,739
We don't want anybody getting hurt.

676
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:02,691
I already told you, I
don't know where he went.

677
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:03,909
Okay, well, did he talk
to you about what happened?

678
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:05,744
Father J.P. doesn't talk about that stuff.

679
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:07,896
Oh, come on, Carlene. You
know exactly what's going on.

680
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,283
Van fire, shooting... same day.

681
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,251
(Sighs)

682
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:15,303
Um, Curtis and the father...

683
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:17,539
they've been having
this war over the kids,

684
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:19,224
and then this whole thing with Thomas...

685
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,976
it just set it all off again.

686
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:23,095
(Andy and Nick) Who's Thomas?

687
00:25:23,162 --> 00:25:26,515
Totally amazing kid. He was a
scholarship winner last year.

688
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,400
He used to hang out here all the time...

689
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,520
and, uh, then, a few days ago,

690
00:25:31,588 --> 00:25:33,605
Father J.P. went out and found him.

691
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,574
He was working the corners.

692
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:37,959
On his arm right here,
it was all infected.

693
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:39,528
Someone burned him with a cigarette.

694
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:41,229
And father Jean Pierre freaked out.

695
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:45,100
So the shooting... had
something to do with Thomas?

696
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:46,401
Carlene.

697
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:47,669
He was in the car.

698
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,054
Thomas was? You saw him?

699
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:50,772
He wasn't the one with the gun,

700
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,342
but he was there in the back seat.

701
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:56,114
Curtis was making a point.

702
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:58,317
I think Father J.P. might
have gone out to find Thomas.

703
00:25:58,401 --> 00:25:59,751
Where does Thomas live?

704
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:01,503
(Door buzzes and beeps)

705
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:06,592
Jordan Lewis.

706
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:09,177
I called Child and Youth
Services, and it turns out

707
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:11,330
there's not that many
Jordans in the neighborhood,

708
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:13,549
so didn't take long to pull your file.

709
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:17,986
You've been in foster care
since you were 2 years old.

710
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,672
12 different families.

711
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:22,808
That must have been tough.

712
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,712
Do you ever talk to your real parents?

713
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:31,433
No. They don't need me. I don't need them.

714
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:34,253
I don't need anyone.

715
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:39,191
How old is this kid?

716
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:40,742
- (Traci, filtered voice) I get it.
- 11.

717
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,178
You feel like you're all
alone, but what about Curtis?

718
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,113
I mean, he must be like your family now.

719
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:47,282
What's he like? Is he a nice guy?

720
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,334
'Cause I know he's generous.
I know he gives you guys...

721
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:50,702
What's with the new clothes?

722
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,020
Sorry?

723
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:54,740
You were in uniform. Why'd you change?

724
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:56,675
Did you think I'd like you better?

725
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,662
Actually, I did.

726
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,034
You're still a cop. I hate cops.
Put me in jail, I don't care.

727
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:12,124
Hey. You guys need to see this.

728
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,593
- (Traci, filtered voice) Jordan, you're not going to jail...
- What is it? What's wrong?

729
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:18,664
Come on. You, too. Let's go.

730
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:20,315
(Radio chatter)

731
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:23,418
I was going through that
girl's phone, looking for, uh,

732
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:26,254
looking for somebody to
contact. I found this.

733
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,606
(Key clicks)

734
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,508
<i>You ready, Thomas?</i>

735
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,993
<i>Ready?</i>

736
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:36,398
<i>Give me your arm.</i>

737
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:37,399
Come on, man.

738
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,367
<i>Do it.</i>

739
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:39,334
Do it.

740
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:40,335
<i>(Sizzle)</i>

741
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:43,838

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,808
<i>(Children speak indistinctly, clapping)</i>

743
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:49,027
<i>(Curtis) That's it, little man. It's over.</i>

744
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:51,430
<i>It's over. Welcome to the family.</i>

745
00:27:51,514 --> 00:27:53,048
<i>(Boy) Yeah! Welcome to the family.</i>

746
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:54,566
<i>- Aren't you proud of your brother?
- Whoo! Yeah!</i>

747
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:55,851
<i>Make some noise. Come on, guys.</i>

748
00:27:55,902 --> 00:27:56,818
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:57,819
(Key clicks)

750
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:01,523
(Woman) Thomas isn't here.

751
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:02,958
Well, we're actually looking
for Father Jean Pierre.

752
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,209
Do you have any idea
where he is right now?

753
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:06,094
You need to tell me what's going on.

754
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:07,429
Well, somebody drove by the church,

755
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,247
and shots were fired
at Father Jean Pierre.

756
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:10,399
Is he okay?

757
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:11,733
Yeah, he's fine,

758
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:13,268
but we think Thomas was
in the back of the car.

759
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,356
Andy? Traci forwarded me
something you should see.

760
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,573
Oh.

761
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:21,777
Ms. Young, is that your son?

762
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:23,362
What's happened to him?

763
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:25,313
Curtis Payne.

764
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:28,250
Looks as though he burned Thomas.

765
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,321
J.P. came looking for
Thomas about 20 minutes ago.

766
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:35,424
Why is he so desperate to find Thomas?

767
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,628
Jean Pierre... h...

768
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,430
he's Thomas's father.

769
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,501
Sir, I don't think these guys are dealers.

770
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:49,919
We don't know that.

771
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,754
I only found one joint in this bag,

772
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,890
and none of them will tell me whose it is.

773
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,109
Well, I guess we're gonna have to bring
'em all in, then. (Cell phone rings)

774
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,811
(Ring, beep)

775
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,330
McNally?

776
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:01,864
Hey, Sam.

777
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,466
Listen, we think Jean Pierre's
going after Curtis Payne.

778
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:04,651
What? Why?

779
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:07,003
Because Curtis has his son... Thomas.

780
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,671
He was in the car when
the shots were fired.

781
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:10,139
I'm sorry. The priest has a son?

782
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:11,558
Yes, from a previous life.

783
00:29:11,642 --> 00:29:12,992
Look, I will explain all of this later.

784
00:29:13,077 --> 00:29:14,410
We're heading to Skyline right now.

785
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,545
We're gonna see if we can catch up

786
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,113
with Jean Pierre before anything happens.

787
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,781
All right. We'll meet you there.

788
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:20,884
Listen, we know Curtis is armed,
so do not go inside without us.

789
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,218
(Beep)

790
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:23,486
Pearce says he can take
a couple of these guys.

791
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,054
He can take 'em all. We
got someplace else to be.

792
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:27,790
I gotta go. All right?

793
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:28,858
(Car door closes)

794
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,376
Thought Swarek said to wait.

795
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:31,744
Screw Swarek.

796
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:34,797
God bless the program.

797
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,916
Ready?

798
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:40,853
(Laughter in distance)

799
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,845
- (Man in distance) Come on, son.
- (Speaks indistinctly)

800
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,548
Father, you shouldn't be in here.

801
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,684
(Chuckles)

802
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:57,086
That's Curtis Payne back there.

803
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:59,555
Dude is so untouchable.

804
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:01,874
Nobody comes after him, right?

805
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:06,029
That's right. (Chuckles) Until today.

806
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,732
When he comes out that door,
with God looking over me...

807
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:11,951
Gun.

808
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:13,636
I'm gonna kill him.

809
00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:15,405
Father, put the gun away.

810
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,440
All these years on the streets,

811
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:19,642
not knowing if I'm doing any good.

812
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,463
(Whispers) This right
here... this would be good.

813
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:24,747
That's not true.

814
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:25,932
(Normal voice) Yes, it is true.

815
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:27,900
That is not true. That's not how it works.

816
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:30,503
One bullet... one...

817
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:33,423
and I save lives... kids' lives.

818
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,676
Who's getting it done? You? You?

819
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:38,628
Let me do what I came
here to do, and after that,

820
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:40,830
you can read me my
rights. I'm good with that.

821
00:30:40,898 --> 00:30:42,515
This isn't up to you. You
don't get to decide that.

822
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,983
You're not God.

823
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:46,202
You damn right, and I'm-a
deal with the good lord

824
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,754
when this is all over with.

825
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:49,555
Hey, how you doing, man?

826
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,107
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

827
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:53,076
Father, put the gun down. Put it down.

828
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:54,844
That's the look I was waiting on.

829
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,229
You like that, Curtis?

830
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,263
Put it down.

831
00:30:57,348 --> 00:30:58,547
Walk away.

832
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,283
<i>This is between me and Curtis!</i>

833
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,584
You know we can't do that.

834
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,119
Just say you came two seconds too late.

835
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,304
That's all you gotta do.

836
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:05,488
You gonna let him do this?!

837
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:06,572
Yo, Curtis, shut up.

838
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,425
"Thou shalt not kill."

839
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:12,829
That's what you teach the kids, right?

840
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:16,215
(Holsters gun)

841
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,851
Ten simple rules.

842
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:21,954
What are they gonna think
if you break number six?

843
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,524
What about Thomas? What's he gonna think?

844
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,193
Thomas is the reason why I'm here.

845
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:31,397
You are a good man.

846
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:35,368
Are you really willing
to throw everything away?

847
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:39,005
If you do this, you're
gonna lose your son forever.

848
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:43,576
He's gonna find out you did this.

849
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,661
He is.

850
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:48,197
What if he can't forgive you?

851
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:52,068
What if he can't forgive himself?

852
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:53,469
(Whispers) Don't.

853
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,304
(Whispers) Don't.

854
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,305
(Normal voice) Come on.

855
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:57,940
(Clatter)

856
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:00,109
Come on. (Speaks indistinctly)
Hands against the wall.

857
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:01,611
You, turn around.

858
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:03,112
<i>(Curtis) You're cuffing me?</i>

859
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,833
I gotta search you. Turn
around. Turn around. Arms up.

860
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:11,371
I told you to wait till I got here.

861
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:12,705
I heard you.

862
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,090
(Police radio chatter)

863
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:15,758
Turn around.

864
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:18,211
(Handcuffs click)

865
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:20,380
It's okay.

866
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:24,851
(Handcuffs clicking)

867
00:32:26,854 --> 00:32:29,472
It's okay.

868
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:33,226
(Whispers) Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned. Forgive me.

869
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:42,232
You can save it.

870
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,967
I'm not saying nothing till my
lawyer gets here. (Door closes)

871
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:45,435
That's cool. You don't
have to say anything.

872
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,970
Just wanted to show you

873
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:49,406
we recovered this from the
premises of your restaurant.

874
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,790
We're just waiting on
the ballistics report,

875
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,326
which I'm almost positive
is gonna match the slugs

876
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:55,295
we pulled from the mortar at St. Julian's.

877
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,547
Well, you know, a lot of people
come and go from my place.

878
00:32:57,615 --> 00:32:59,232
You know, that could belong to anybody.

879
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:00,850
That's true,

880
00:33:00,885 --> 00:33:02,519
but that's why we're looking
at you for something else.

881
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,745
<i>(Curtis) You ready, Thomas?</i>

882
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,397
<i>Give me your arm.</i>

883
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,232
(Boy) Come on, man.

884
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,717
<i>(Boy) Do it.</i>

885
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:20,653
<i>(Thomas yelling, children
speaking indistinctly)</i>

886
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:22,922
Whatever. Just some people messing around.

887
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:25,224
Well, what you call,
"messing around," we call,

888
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:29,512
aggravated assault of a minor.
Carries a pretty serious charge.

889
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,530
And jail time.

890
00:33:30,598 --> 00:33:31,498
Assault of a minor?

891
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:33,199
Yeah, child abuse?

892
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:36,553
Child abuse... what's that
gonna do for your reputation?

893
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,639
I guess you could carefully explain it

894
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,708
to your fellow inmates.

895
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:44,711
Maybe eventually they'll
see it like you do,

896
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:47,163
that you were just "messing around."

897
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:54,537
Or you know what?

898
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,806
You could just give us some names...

899
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:59,409
you know, a couple
players, your suppliers.

900
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,562
Maybe then we could talk
about a different charge...

901
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:05,398
lighter sentence.

902
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:07,417
(Door buzzes and beeps)

903
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:10,870
We'll give you some
time to think that over.

904
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,694
I give him till his lawyer
arrives before he cracks.

905
00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:20,330
Nah, it's not gonna take that long.

906
00:34:21,348 --> 00:34:23,233
Good work on this.

907
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:27,220
You're wondering what
else you could have said.

908
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:28,905
Not to Curtis... the girl.

909
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,174
You didn't get through to
her, and that bothers you,

910
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:33,042
so you're already planning what
you'd do different next time.

911
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:35,845
How'd you know?

912
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:38,481
Because I'm a detective, too.

913
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:43,887
(Door opens)

914
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:47,173
Thomas is here. He says
that he let you down.

915
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,842
He wants to apologize.

916
00:34:54,114 --> 00:34:55,665
Does he know?

917
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:58,151
I mean, did you tell him?

918
00:34:58,202 --> 00:34:59,919
No.

919
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:02,305
It's between you and his mother,

920
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:04,524
but if it were me, I'd want to know.

921
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,134
Hey.

922
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:16,603
Hey.

923
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:27,113
So what's new?

924
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:28,748
Lots of things.

925
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:32,285
Okay, so this woman... she's
from Child and Youth Services,

926
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:35,305
and she's gonna help you find
a new home, a new family...

927
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:38,024
it's gonna feel like a fresh start.

928
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:41,411
Jordan. You don't fool
me, not even for a second.

929
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:44,130
Your whole tough guy
act... I just don't buy it.

930
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:46,666
So I want you to have my card.

931
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:48,184
I want you to hang onto it,

932
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:51,187
and if anyone ever hurts
you or makes you feel afraid,

933
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:55,124
I want you to call me,
okay? That's me... Gail Peck.

934
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:58,011
(Clatter)

935
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:05,468
(Keys jangle)

936
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:06,919
Hey.

937
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:09,772
Here's your keys. (Keys jangle)

938
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:11,608
Thank you.

939
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,635
(Bag zips)

940
00:36:22,703 --> 00:36:25,471
Just finished releasing
those guys we picked up today.

941
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:27,924
Whole lot of paperwork for nothing.

942
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,926
(Lock clicks) Sends a message.

943
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,011
You know, I gotta think

944
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:34,831
it's police work like today
that makes kids not trust cops.

945
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:38,568
Diaz, you get 'em for
what you can, when you can,

946
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:43,006
'cause that's the job, even if
you have to push it sometimes.

947
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:49,445
No. It's not. Not for everybody.

948
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:55,768
Look, I know you and
Detective Barber were friends,

949
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:58,855
and I know this thing with
you and Andy's gotta be tough,

950
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:00,740
but whatever you're going through,

951
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:04,260
you need to deal with it, soon.

952
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:08,581
(Door opens)

953
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:11,301
(Door closes)

954
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:16,222
(Keys clatter)

955
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:26,983
Thanks to Curtis Payne, 15
division just made 8 arrests.

956
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:29,319
Should help boost your numbers.

957
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:31,037
That is true.

958
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,739
(Keys click)

959
00:37:32,806 --> 00:37:34,307
So who would you recommend?

960
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:38,411
For the task force. Say I
was looking at people from 15.

961
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:40,596
Who would you recommend?

962
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:43,866
(Telephones ring in distance)

963
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:48,221
Well, I think it's safe to
say you earned this today.

964
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:49,955
What's that?

965
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:53,142
Just a little tear-out diploma
I found in the back of the book.

966
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:56,913
Oh, you just ripped it
right out, hey? No scissors?

967
00:37:56,997 --> 00:38:00,033
Uh, not just yet. Still
have to do number ten.

968
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,286
Final cry. Come on. It's your
last chance to let it all out.

969
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,054
What if I don't need it?

970
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:06,639
Sure about that?

971
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:10,493
Yeah.

972
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:12,645
I think I'm good.

973
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:16,616
Well, then, congratulations. You graduate.

974
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,436
Hey, Nick.

975
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:22,521
Are you driving me or what?

976
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:24,073
Want a lift?

977
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:27,760
No. No, no, no, go. It's
a nice night. I'll walk.

978
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:29,429
Thought you said you didn't need a ride.

979
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,131
I changed my mind. I'm cold.

980
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,999
Two words... high maintenance.

981
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:36,269
Five words... boring-est person
I've ever met ever. (Siren whoops)

982
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:38,488
Well, that was six. How'd
you get into the academy?

983
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,039
Shut up.

984
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,359
<i>♪</i>

985
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:45,995
Can I get one of each? Thanks, T.

986
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:50,717
Thanks to Curtis Payne,
we made eight arrests.

987
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:54,253
Yeah, I heard. Congratulations.

988
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:58,074
Actually, can I get two of these?

989
00:38:58,142 --> 00:38:59,442
(Woman) Yeah.

990
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:02,295
(Clatters)

991
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,868
You want some advice?

992
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:11,387
Uh, no.

993
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,157
You're an idiot.

994
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:17,160
If you don't figure that out soon,

995
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:18,327
you're gonna lose Andy for good.

996
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:22,415
Take it from me.

997
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:29,522
(Siren wailing in distance)

998
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:33,826
(Both stammer)

999
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:36,595
Um, yeah. (Chuckles)

1000
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,115
(Door opens and closes)

1001
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,943
(Grunts)

1002
00:40:07,027 --> 00:40:10,563
(All grunting) (Thuds)

1003
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,902
(Pants)

1004
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,422
That one's for Tyler Markes. (Grunts)

1005
00:40:19,506 --> 00:40:21,290
You stay away from his
sister, you hear me?

1006
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,846
(Man) Go.

1007
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:28,681
(Tires peal)

1008
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:32,602
