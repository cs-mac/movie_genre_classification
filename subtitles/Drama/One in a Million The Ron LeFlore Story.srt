00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,315
<i>This is a story of long, long ago...</i>

2
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,717
<i>...when the world was just beginning.</i>

3
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,717
<i>A young world.</i>

4
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,469
<i>A world early in the morning of time.</i>

5
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,429
<i>A hard, unfriendly world.</i>

6
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,031
<i>Creatures who sit and wait.</i>

7
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,635
<i>Creatures who must kill to live.</i>

8
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,512
<i>And man, superior to the creatures</i>
<i>only in his cunning.</i>

9
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,916
<i>There aren't many men.</i>

10
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,157
<i>A few tribes scattered</i>
<i>across the wilderness.</i>

11
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,956
<i>Never venturing far, unaware</i>
<i>that other tribes exist even.</i>

12
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,118
<i>Too busy with their own lives</i>
<i>to be curious.</i>

13
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,312
<i>Too frightened of the unknown</i>
<i>to wander.</i>

14
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,513
<i>Their laws are simple.</i>
<i>The strong take everything.</i>

15
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,598
<i>This is Akhoba,</i>
<i>leader of the Rock tribe.</i>

16
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,035
Sakana.

17
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,036
<i>And these are his sons,</i>
<i>Sakana and Tumak.</i>

18
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,198
<i>There is no love lost between them.</i>

19
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,073
<i>And that is our story.</i>

20
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,032
Tumak.

21
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,273

28
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,234
Ahot...

29
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,835
...Loana....

30
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,632
Ahot.

31
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,590
Ahot, Loana....

32
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,919

00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,152
Tumak.

35
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,390
Tumak!

36
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,516
Tumak!

37
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,719
