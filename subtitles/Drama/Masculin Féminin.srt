{4396}{4459}Excuse me, but aren't you|Madeleine Zimmer?
{4466}{4514}Yes, why? Do you know me?
{4520}{4587}I've seen you here before
{4594}{4643}Could be
{4756}{4834}A friend of mine, Robert Poiccard...
{4840}{4923}...knows someone called Dumas|who knows you
{4940}{4987}Yes, Marcel
{5404}{5489}He said this Dumas might find me a job
{5494}{5603}- On the magazine?|- I didn't know he worked on a magazine
{5608}{5691}If it's Marcel Dumas you mean, he does
{5956}{6027}Do you work for this magazine, too?
{6052}{6155}I used to be in the picture department,|but now I want to be a singer
{6160}{6255}Why, are you looking for work?
{6260}{6334}Well, I've just finished my|military service
{6340}{6382}Did you enjoy it?
{6388}{6478}Sixteen months without comfort,|money, love or leisure
{6484}{6599}Subjected to absolute authority|twenty-four hours a day
{6604}{6659}Just like modern society,|in other words
{6666}{6747}Sixteen months which confirm that|for a young Frenchman...
{6752}{6819}...even relative freedom is|difficult to achieve...
{6828}{6956}...in the face of established authority|when he's had the wrong education
{6972}{7055}Sixteen months of obedience|likely to become permanent...
{7061}{7143}...since the military and industrial|systems co-exist happily
{7148}{7239}Discipline and finance|share the same logic
{7244}{7355}It doesn't sound much fun.|Now you're at a loose end?
{7396}{7483}Not exactly, but I'd like a change
{7556}{7703}I often have to work under adverse|conditions. I'm at Napthachemicals now
{7708}{7743}What's that?
{7748}{7822}It's the big white building|near Citroën's
{7829}{7955}I've met some great guys there;|the working class in Paris is O.K.
{7972}{8083}They talk a lot; maybe that's|what's wrong with the Party
{8108}{8207}There aren't all that many militants,|really
{8212}{8284}Working conditions are to blame
{8290}{8403}The bosses have cut down on breaks,|to step up production
{8428}{8509}So a worker isn't his own man any more
{8516}{8619}It's work, eat, sleep, and|that's my lot, thank you
{8644}{8757}I'm meeting Marcel here, actually;|what's your friend called?
{8796}{8847}You're a bitch!
{8852}{8903}I'm sick of your insults!
{8908}{9030}That's your look-out, you slut;|you don't know what you want
{9036}{9070}Yes, I do!
{9076}{9155}Let go of Patrick, I'm taking him!
{9236}{9307}Find someone else to slave for you
{10444}{10503}- Everything O.K.?|- No
{10508}{10611}- What's wrong?|- Everything's wrong till ten o'clock
{10748}{10851}- It's five past ten now|- Everything's O.K., then
{10964}{11003}Still on night shift?
{11012}{11139}Haven't you seen the papers?|We're on strike
{11172}{11278}- With union backing?|- The communists, anyway
{11284}{11363}What do the anti-communist creeps say?
{11380}{11483}I know... the same as the Catholics
{11508}{11571}While I think of it, sign this
{11732}{11822}"The undersigned, deeply concerned|at the imprisonment...
{11828}{11959}"...of eight members of the world of|arts and letters in Rio de Janiero...
{11964}{12075}"...for expressing their disagreement|with official policy...
{12108}{12247}"...protest against this violation of|freedom of thought in Brazil...
{12252}{12339}"...and demand the liberation of|the eight prisoners"
{12420}{12559}Last week it was Madrid. What next?
{12564}{12622}Athens, Baghdad, Lisbon
{12628}{12684}What do you earn now?
{12696}{12724}HUMAN LABOUR
{12732}{12783}MAKES THINGS RISE
{12790}{12816}FROM THE DEAD
{12900}{12963}Have you asked about the room?
{13028}{13123}I can't; I was meaning to tell you
{13173}{13219}Still sleeping in your car?
{13268}{13323}Yes, I'm still at Soissons
{13340}{13459}Did you see me the other day in|the Place Clichy? I shouted
{13524}{13589}Yes, but I was with my cousin
{13595}{13691}- Making out?|- It's pretty heavy going
{13724}{13782}Have you seen that girl again?
{13788}{13875}Madeleine? I can't be bothered|with her any more
{13900}{13963}Given up screwing, have you?
{14092}{14171}- The Sports Palace?|- The other side of town
{14348}{14427}- The Sports Palace?|- The other side of town
{14476}{14563}- What are you doing?|- Putting myself in his place
{14645}{14691}Nothing happened
{14796}{14899}So to put yourself in his place|doesn't make you understand someone
{15037}{15080}Watch this
{15173}{15227}May I take some sugar?
{15620}{15659}Not bad
{15676}{15715}What, her breasts?
{15732}{15771}I'll try
{15884}{15939}May I take some sugar?
{16156}{16195}Fantastic!
{16252}{16331}- I'm off|- See you on Friday
{16876}{16963}Paris today; what do young girls|dream about?
{16970}{17030}But which girls?
{17036}{17174}The checkers at Simca who are|too tired after work to make love?
{17180}{17305}Eighteen-year-old manicurists and|hairdressers whoring in posh hotels?
{17348}{17459}Schoolgirls who know their Bergson|and Sartre and nothing else...
{17466}{17539}...because their parents|shut them up at home?
{17578}{17611}The average Frenchwoman doesn't exist
{18556}{18619}Marcel told me it was all right
{18788}{18899}- How about the pay?|- He said he'd see on Tuesday
{19076}{19131}It's the twenty-third today
{19148}{19195}So what?
{19260}{19307}What about the twenty-third?
{19340}{19422}You said we could go out on|the twenty-third
{19428}{19475}I never said that
{19748}{19795}I never said that
{19868}{19939}I think you're an awful liar
{19996}{20043}I don't agree
{20100}{20203}- Why "Ha-ha"?|- I don't know; don't you ever lie?
{20252}{20284}Never?
{20290}{20382}Well, sometimes, naturally,|but not often
{20388}{20435}How come?
{20588}{20639}With you, sometimes
{20644}{20699}Why do you lie to me?
{20972}{21051}Don't I appeal to you?
{21068}{21115}It isn't that
{21212}{21283}Do you think my nose is too big?
{21300}{21347}Not at all
{21532}{21611}Why do you want to go out with me?
{21644}{21739}Because you're pretty,|because of tenderness...
{21860}{21923}Doesn't anything else about me|interest you?
{21964}{22011}Yes, everything
{22044}{22123}Your hair, eyes, nose, mouth, hands...
{22212}{22275}By going out, you mean|sleeping with me?
{22380}{22443}Tell me the truth
{22620}{22659}How old are you?
{22700}{22747}Twenty-one
{22932}{22995}Are your parents alive?
{23132}{23219}- Do you see them often?|- Now and again
{23540}{23614}- Do you often go out with girls?|- Now and again
{23636}{23731}Yes, I'd really like to sleep with you
{23772}{23851}- How about you?|- I've never thought about it
{23868}{23931}But now that I've asked you?
{24036}{24109}Why did you say we'd go out|on the twenty-third?
{24116}{24159}That was a lie
{24164}{24235}Why? I believed you
{24268}{24347}I know it wasn't nice, but...
{24516}{24599}Do you sometimes go out with girls|at night?
{24604}{24651}I told you I did
{24764}{24859}- What kind of girls?|- Girls I like
{24866}{24915}Girls like me?
{25060}{25126}Have you been with whores, too?
{25132}{25255}Once in a way; but I find them cold|and depressing
{25260}{25351}- I don't want to know|- I didn't mean anything
{25356}{25407}Why say it, then?
{25412}{25503}I don't know; it's what I think
{25516}{25670}What do you do when you're alone in|the evenings? What about tonight?
{25677}{25811}I've a whole lot of photographs|to sort for the magazine
{25916}{26011}- What kind of photographs?|- Some fashion shots we took
{26172}{26267}You said you were trying to become|a singer now
{26292}{26374}I can do both, can't I?
{26380}{26455}I still sort and classify photographs
{26461}{26523}- Of you?|- No, never
{26652}{26726}Are you going out with somebody|tonight?
{26733}{26811}I saw you with a big, tall bloke|the other night
{26836}{26909}I just happened to run into him
{26916}{26982}That's not true
{26988}{27047}It is true... it is
{27052}{27155}- Where did you go?|- Just to a café
{27212}{27307}- What did you talk about?|- My record
{27420}{27499}Are you afraid I'll make love to you?
{27556}{27659}- Is that why you won't go out with me?|- Could be
{27677}{27771}Why should you be afraid?|I think you're lovely
{27796}{27843}It makes me uneasy
{27900}{27987}I think you have very classy breasts
{28052}{28099}It's important, you know
{28268}{28315}Look me in the eyes
{28364}{28459}What are you thinking of|at this very moment?
{28477}{28507}Nothing
{28540}{28647}You have to be thinking something.|Now, looking at me?
{28652}{28747}- I'm looking|- But what are you thinking?
{28796}{28864}What is the centre of the world|for you?
{28870}{28915}The centre of the world?
{28948}{29043}Our first real conversation, and|you ask such amazing questions
{29133}{29259}It's quite an ordinary question.|What's your answer?
{29277}{29323}Love, I suppose
{29420}{29499}That's odd. I'd have answered: Me
{29661}{29715}Does that seem funny to you?
{29844}{29915}Don't you feel you're the centre|of the world?
{29940}{29987}Yes, of course, in a way
{30020}{30067}In what way?
{30084}{30163}Living, being, seeing|with your own eyes...
{30170}{30259}...speaking with your own mouth,|thinking with your own head
{30492}{30595}Do you think one can live alone?|Always alone?
{30612}{30709}No, I don't think one can,|it's impossible
{30716}{30819}Without tenderness you'd|shoot yourself
{31020}{31067}Look me in the eyes
{31261}{31359}Would it please you if I said|I might love you some day?
{31364}{31415}Of course it would
{31660}{31774}The coming December elections|raised great hopes on the Left
{31780}{31892}I was now twenty-one. Robert and I|stuck posters everywhere
{31916}{31982}Meantime, I made progress|with Madeleine
{31988}{32034}She introduced me to Elisabeth
{32052}{32128}Robert was interested in Catherine...
{32136}{32218}...probably a virgin, but|good militant material
{33828}{33882}Great guns in Vietnam, eh?
{33932}{33986}Killing lots of communists there?
{34052}{34130}Burning the place with napalm?|Terrific!
{34244}{34338}Peace in Vietnam
{34620}{34736}PHILOSOPHER AND FILM-MAKER SHARE|A GENERATION'S OUTLOOK
{34780}{34853}Paris, 25 November, 1965
{34860}{34962}I have a blue coat; Elisabeth's|is trimmed with white
{34980}{35061}I share her flat opposite|the elevated Métro
{35068}{35098}It's cold out
{35116}{35174}We lunched in a snack bar|on Rue Marbeuf
{35180}{35242}Paul kissed me for the second time
{35248}{35334}Elisabeth is a bit jealous;|I don't care
{35340}{35442}My first single comes out tomorrow;|I hope it sells
{35468}{35538}If so, I'll buy a Morris-Cooper
{35544}{35650}I'm glad Paul's in love with me;|I'll sleep with him eventually
{35684}{35746}I hope he doesn't become a nuisance
{37172}{37258}- Did you see?|- No. What'll we do?
{37276}{37326}I'm going on to the Etoile
{37332}{37413}- Let's go to the Palladium|- No, I'm tired
{37420}{37490}I'll go as far as Montparnasse|with you, then
{37916}{37974}- How about it?|- I don't feel like it
{37980}{38053}You can be a real nigger bastard|when you try
{38060}{38154}No comment. No comment, I said
{38236}{38303}That's enough; now shut it!
{38340}{38466}You know what you niggers are?|You're killers in the making
{38492}{38534}And you know it
{38540}{38630}You just dream of being like|those Hollywood whores
{38636}{38746}All you think of is money;|it's written all over your face
{38796}{38866}They don't even know|what it's all about
{38980}{39042}They don't even know|what it's all about
{39048}{39146}"Oh, I adore Bessie Smith",|they mutter
{39508}{39574}They don't understand what|Bessie's telling them
{39580}{39690}"Here's my big, black ass!"|She's not singing about love
{39716}{39762}What, then?
{39876}{39954}It's not about desire or the blues
{39988}{40034}Nothing like that
{40100}{40146}Want me to tell you?
{40204}{40330}She's shouting: Kiss my big,|black ass, that's what
{40436}{40495}Charlie Parker's the same
{40540}{40588}Look out!
{40594}{40660}If you told Charlie...
{40674}{40736}...throw away your sax...
{40756}{40838}...and you can kill the first ten|whites you see, he'd do it
{40844}{40886}He'd never play another note
{40892}{40945}What are you staring at?
{41048}{41090}NOTHING: JUST A WOMAN
{41098}{41138}AND A MAN
{41146}{41187}AND AN OCEAN
{41196}{41234}OF SPILT BLOOD
{41252}{41338}The sexual organ is purely natural
{41344}{41394}Yes, obviously, but...
{41420}{41469}So is sexuality
{41508}{41554}I don't agree
{41580}{41730}For me, sexuality involves the skin.|I think that's very important
{41844}{41957}Otherwise, there can be no real|contact between two people
{41964}{42053}You shake someone by the hand,|for instance...
{42060}{42131}...and you know at once|if you felt anything
{42164}{42266}What about the eyes, looking?|Isn't that important?
{42308}{42362}The eyes, looking
{42416}{42498}Do you think he's good in bed? Paul?
{42566}{42682}THE MOLE IS BLIND, YET BURROWS|IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION
{42740}{42834}- I've no time|- It will only take five minutes
{43180}{43253}It's my first record,|but you don't care
{43260}{43322}Yes, I do, really
{43372}{43418}Let's sit down
{43908}{43954}Well, what do we do?
{44076}{44157}Let's go over there;|I don't like it here
{44164}{44210}Say your piece
{44508}{44578}"Eglantine, madly in love"
{44692}{44805}"There will always be girls who|lie down when asked to sit"
{44812}{44914}"The duchess was nude; the little|prince was dressed as Chaplin"
{44948}{45053}"Not even a bra or panties,|entirely nude"
{45060}{45157}"Finally, the fleur-de-lys panties|had slipped off"
{45164}{45218}"She had long legs"
{45276}{45382}"Early the next morning I went|into the little garden"
{45388}{45509}"I've seen all kinds,|but never one so willing"
{45516}{45597}"Quickly I laid her, naked,|on my coverlet
{45604}{45698}"Her arms reached out in|the most wonderful..."
{45716}{45805}"She weighed only a hundred and|twelve pounds...
{45812}{45878}"...but her plump thighs|were like satin"
{45884}{45938}It's nicer over there
{46188}{46230}What would you like?
{46236}{46306}I haven't time for anything, thanks
{46324}{46402}It's not that I want to; I have to
{46476}{46574}I learned one thing when|I lost my wife
{46580}{46706}It's that you just can't stop;|I have to begin all over again
{46764}{46842}I'm just asking you to be patient
{46848}{46906}I have to dash
{46932}{46997}Won't you leave me, let me go?
{47004}{47078}To you I'm just a girl, I know
{47084}{47154}Let me set my life aflow
{47228}{47330}What I wanted to say was:|Will you marry me?
{47348}{47408}Let's discuss it later
{47576}{47638}Won't you let me know the day
{47644}{47718}My first true love will come my way?
{47724}{47782}Won't you let me find at last
{47788}{47853}The one who'll come to hold me fast?
{48054}{48134}For you somehow girls must cry
{48140}{48197}For you somehow I don't know why
{48204}{48278}For you I'd gladly spend all day
{48284}{48374}Waiting for you to come my way
{48380}{48450}Leave me with my unhappiness
{48458}{48518}I believe in faithfulness
{48524}{48594}Give me time to dream a while
{48860}{48906}Like a drink?
{49412}{49474}I'm sorry about before
{49580}{49634}Sandie Shaw's terrific, isn't she?
{49740}{49858}I think it's disgusting,|exhibiting yourself like that
{50116}{50234}How about going? I've had enough|of him today
{50260}{50306}Good idea
{50564}{50610}Will you pay?
{50692}{50746}Shall I see you at the baths later?
{51540}{51650}Would you like to take some pictures|with me?
{51676}{51714}Photographs, I mean
{52452}{52526}It's 15,000 francs to see my breasts
{52532}{52574}I've only got 10,000
{52580}{52642}O.K., but hands off, then
{52648}{52714}You must be kidding
{53436}{53498}I want to live with you
{53572}{53666}You won't come to meet me tonight
{53708}{53794}The stars are falling, Madeleine
{53836}{53901}Here we are in the city
{53908}{54005}lmagine it's written, Madeleine, like:
{54012}{54101}"Astor, the modern man's cigarette!"
{54108}{54226}Remember: You were leaving the baths,|the same record was playing
{54364}{54450}5 December, 1965. The stars
{54556}{54661}I want to live with you, bikini-bronzed
{54668}{54722}We'll play the machines
{54812}{54906}Look, it's the airport here
{54924}{55010}You put on your lipstick,|snuggle against me
{55036}{55082}We've taken off
{55147}{55222}Hello, control tower here
{55228}{55322}Boeing 737 calling Caravelle,|Paul calling Madeleine
{55788}{55890}I don't believe your promises,|you've lied to me once more
{55897}{56013}You know what my address is,|but there's no letter at my door
{56020}{56109}For days and days I waited,|but it was all in vain
{56116}{56226}You broke my heart completely|when no message came
{57164}{57212}Guess what happened
{57224}{57274}I hear running footsteps
{57324}{57369}What is it? I wonder
{57378}{57418}I turn round
{57468}{57602}And a bloke says: "Did I frighten you?|Do forgive me"
{57636}{57671}I wait
{57680}{57764}But when I go on, so do the footsteps
{57780}{57909}The guy says: "Did I frighten you?|Do forgive me"
{57916}{58042}All very courteous, but I realize|it's a different man
{58060}{58106}I go on
{58203}{58310}This time the footsteps go past
{58372}{58447}But the guy stops just in front of me
{58456}{58582}I look at him, and it's not|the same guy
{58588}{58666}I mean, it's a third guy
{58732}{58794}"You're not the same one", I say
{58828}{58913}He looks at me and says: "Maybe so...
{58920}{59042}"...but the point is you thought|you were being followed
{59084}{59130}"Who by doesn't matter
{59156}{59202}"If I'd run faster...
{59324}{59388}"You would have been afraid
{59394}{59466}"But I didn't and you weren't"
{59500}{59557}"Listen", I say to this guy...
{59564}{59674}"...if that's your idea of a joke,|I don't think much of it"
{59691}{59738}He looks at me and says:
{59744}{59858}"Do you really think it's a joke?|Well!
{59966}{60031}"You just haven't understood", he says
{60036}{60156}- Coming poster-sticking on Saturday?|- You know I can't on Saturday
{60174}{60272}- Bring her along|- Hell, no
{60278}{60364}Well, it's up to you
{60430}{60526}But there are no individual solutions,|you know
{60532}{60684}One learns by joining the struggle.|You accept too many things too easily
{60747}{60828}My problems with women are my affair
{60853}{60948}It's all very simple really:|Women, money
{61053}{61148}It's like a movement of|perpetual revolt
{61166}{61284}I can't accept things like you.|That's what makes me a militant
{61326}{61385}I admire you for it
{61392}{61444}Join in, then
{61486}{61532}I'll think about it
{61574}{61656}- What are you reading?|- An article on Bob Dylan
{61662}{61726}- Who's he?|- A Vietnik
{61732}{61836}- What's that?|- It comes from beatnik and Vietnam
{61918}{61988}"Who are you, Mr. Bob Dylan?"
{62190}{62276}Old Hitler said it
{62282}{62368}And old Stalin, too
{62374}{62447}Now old Johnson says it
{62453}{62548}There's only one thing to do
{62574}{62628}And that's to kill them all
{62709}{62806}Hasn't Madeleine mentioned him?|He sells 10,000 records a day
{62812}{62948}I think I'm going to drop her.|I'll find out tonight, anyway
{63006}{63116}My landlady wants my room|for her nephew
{63182}{63260}Madeleine might let me stay with her
{63286}{63335}But that bitch Elisabeth?
{63341}{63406}I'm crazy about freckles!
{63412}{63472}Catherine's a better bet
{63478}{63588}Think so? Last Saturday I asked her|what make of bra she wore
{63630}{63670}What a clout I got
{63718}{63768}That must be an Oh Yes!
{63774}{63828}"Oh Yes! The bra that boosts"!
{63853}{63924}Do you know why Camille was|such a success?
{63958}{64052}Give me your hand...|with your finger like that
{64278}{64391}I don't know why I'm joking;|actually, I feel miserable
{64397}{64436}Because of Madeleine?
{64486}{64596}Do you realize the word masculine|comprises mask and ass?
{64678}{64740}- And feminine?|- Sweet nothing
{64806}{64847}PURITY IS NOT
{64856}{64894}OF THIS WORLD
{64926}{64942}BUT
{64974}{65064}ONCE IN TEN YEARS ITS LIGHT|GLEAMS BRIEFLY
{65078}{65172}Lonely and terrible the night|followed by no day
{65192}{65313}American scientists have succeeded|in transmitting thoughts...
{65322}{65376}...through injections
{65382}{65505}Man's existence is not determined by|his conscience. Rather, the reverse
{65566}{65687}In the near future, each citizen|could well be wearing...
{65694}{65772}...an electrical apparatus designed|to stimulate pleasure...
{65786}{65839}...and sexual gratification
{65850}{65884}Give us this day...
{65896}{65982}...TVand car, but deliver us|from freedom
{66370}{66451}My dear Marquis, you seem so cheerful
{66458}{66505}Joyous, of nothing fearful
{66512}{66572}Is it simply satisfaction?
{66578}{66632}Or is there cause for your reaction?
{66770}{66872}My voice doesn't match my deep|and solemn thoughts
{66890}{66944}Unlike Boileau
{67018}{67099}That struck me when I was at school
{67106}{67200}I don't know why, but it often|happens to me
{67546}{67600}What are they playing at?
{67634}{67696}Do you often fall in love?
{67778}{67848}- Can I speak frankly?|- Of course
{68010}{68104}- You don't really mean that|- Yes, I do
{68234}{68373}You look sincere, but I'm sure|you're being defensive
{68382}{68512}Still, it's Madeleine I care about.|It's a pity, though
{68594}{68648}You said it
{68738}{68800}I'm going to ask you a question, too
{68882}{68952}Actually, she asked me to;|she's afraid...
{69026}{69066}...of getting pregnant
{69154}{69240}The idiot. I'm old enough|to know better
{69258}{69424}- Would you be afraid?|- No, I've got a thingumajig
{69594}{69672}- What is it?|- An American contraption
{69706}{69776}An Air France bloke brought it over|for Elisabeth
{69794}{69872}Madeleine won't use it; she's shocked
{69938}{70000}I can see why she's afraid
{70066}{70176}- I'm sure this wasn't her idea|- Ask her yourself
{70322}{70400}- Ask me what?|- Nothing
{70442}{70539}My record's number six in Japan
{70546}{70620}Who is there ahead of you?
{70626}{70747}The Beatles, France Gall,|Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra
{70754}{70827}I didn't know you were warm and lively
{70890}{70995}"She continues to create a world|entirely of her own
{71002}{71099}"The chiselled, classic beauty|of her features...
{71106}{71228}"...is belied by a mischievous,|fun-loving smile
{71234}{71330}"Instinctively mistrustful of|any kind of insincerity...
{71336}{71432}"...her artistic integrity makes her|spurn the 'modern' style"
{71602}{71630}Stop making fun
{71762}{71824}Someone phoned for you
{71842}{71984}The memory's gone, I don't know who.|Paul took the call
{71990}{72080}I told him to let my poor old mum|alone
{72122}{72210}No poor old mum? How dare you,|Marquis!
{72216}{72276}Has he gone mad?
{72282}{72324}Clear the table
{72330}{72428}Madame Durand,|your daughters are grand
{72434}{72520}But, Madame Durand,|their noses expand
{72538}{72600}Right. A bath and then bed
{72930}{73008}Going to listen to that|outlandish music?
{73042}{73088}Then I'm off
{73922}{73968}It's fantastic
{75434}{75504}- What's wrong?|- I've got a flea
{75690}{75755}And there's no paper in the bog
{75762}{75824}There's a copy of Le Figaro
{75850}{75899}Poor Mauriac!
{75906}{76040}When you think that Beaumarchais|invented the word Figaro...
{76074}{76203}...and now it's a synonom for|bourgeois; it makes you sick
{76210}{76272}She's been seeing Robert, obviously
{76314}{76372}You keep Paul, Catherine
{76378}{76424}No, come here, Paul
{76698}{76784}- Do you mind?|- Please yourself
{76790}{76856}I'm going to have a last cigarette
{76874}{76952}Don't switch the light off yet
{77586}{77643}Move your backside over, Madeleine
{77650}{77712}Don't say my backside,|say chubby cheeks
{77730}{77784}Don't say chubby cheeks, say jacksey
{77810}{77880}No, say my posterior
{77886}{77939}Sit-me-down
{77946}{77984}Parson's nose
{78010}{78043}Fanny
{78050}{78080}Bum
{78098}{78160}What do you say for sexual organs?
{78186}{78260}You say three-piece suite
{78746}{78808}Can I put my hand there?
{78866}{78920}Do me a favour!
{79122}{79176}I've always wondered...
{79210}{79256}Not so loud, Paul
{79378}{79488}Love, love... in the man's heart|is solitude
{79514}{79640}And on the face of my naked|femininity your face is mirrored
{79674}{79768}And my love is in the sea, in dreams
{79786}{79848}And we are faced by death
{80050}{80143}KIND SLEEP, FREE ME BRIEFLY|FROM MYSELF
{80150}{80256}Here on Earth, the cruelest star,|among men less feeling than stones
{80866}{80912}What are you doing?
{80978}{81072}Take that string there
{81330}{81400}You've heard of the Marquis de Sade?
{81442}{81552}Didn't he say: "Once more into|the Republican breach..."?
{81626}{81703}A nation took up Turenne's sword...
{81712}{81788}...launching the first army|of justice into Europe
{81810}{81955}For a hundred years this ragged army|fulfilled the highest dreams
{81962}{82076}It drove out a king, crossed|the Alps and the Rhine
{82082}{82184}What have you and I,|Monsieur Mitterand, to do...
{82190}{82330}...with this vast shadow which made|Europe dance to the tune of liberty?
{82768}{82868}I don't believe your promises|any more
{82874}{82980}Too many girls have believed you|before
{82986}{83029}You're laughing at my tears...
{83034}{83121}DIALOGUE WITH A CONSUMER PRODUCT
{83128}{83180}You're a friend of Madeleine's?
{83254}{83356}- Where did you meet?|- She used to work on the magazine
{83430}{83492}What magazine? Miss 19?
{83590}{83647}What's your job?
{83654}{83726}Well, I was chosen as Miss 19
{83734}{83831}Why all these questions, anyway?|What are you doing?
{83836}{83926}- It's a public opinion survey|- Changed jobs?
{83934}{84044}Yes, I wasn't earning enough|with the magazine
{84062}{84132}I've always been interested in|sociology
{84206}{84312}Why do you want to be Miss 19?
{84318}{84456}I don't particularly; I just had|the good luck to be chosen
{84462}{84580}I've never really known why,|but I'm Miss 19 for a year
{84586}{84664}Why do you say "good luck"?
{84670}{84740}For me there are all sorts of|advantages; it's fantastic
{84774}{84908}All sorts of things... I have a car,|I get fabulous trips
{84950}{85052}- What did you do before?|- I was studying
{85110}{85180}- What for?|- My baccalauréat
{85238}{85312}Didn't you want to go on?
{85318}{85428}No, everything changed when|I was chosen, you see
{85434}{85526}You'd rather have your car than|your baccalauréat?
{85532}{85604}I'm happy to say I have both
{85846}{85935}Do you think socialism has a future?
{85942}{86020}Socialism, did you say?
{86054}{86143}I don't really know enough about it
{86150}{86216}What do you understand by socialism?
{86222}{86316}I won't try to answer that,|or I'll get all muddled
{86374}{86428}Say you had to choose...
{86486}{86572}...between socialism and|the American way of life
{86614}{86656}Is there a difference?
{86662}{86740}Of course, but it's difficult|to explain
{86790}{86872}What do you understand by|American way of life?
{86878}{86964}Everything going at a terrific pace,|very free and easy
{87006}{87124}I was lucky enough to be able to go|and see what America was like
{87142}{87180}What was it like?
{87186}{87268}Pretty terrific; I really liked it
{87310}{87412}What was terrific about it?|I mean, what in particular?
{87430}{87512}It's all so different from France,|you see
{87518}{87652}They live and work hard, but|everything goes at such a pace
{87686}{87748}You get the impression...
{87766}{87860}...that everyone's running all the|time, busy with important things
{87918}{88024}One thing is that women play|a more important role there
{88030}{88116}Does the word reactionary|mean anything to you?
{88318}{88388}It's difficult to explain|what it means
{88422}{88520}To be reactionary is to be|in opposition...
{88526}{88664}...to react against things,|not to accept just anything
{88670}{88724}Is it a good or a bad thing?
{88742}{88828}Good; I don't like yes-people
{88910}{89012}Does the Popular Front|mean anything to you?
{89054}{89112}What awful questions!
{89118}{89228}- What's so funny?|- I don't want to answer such questions
{89262}{89372}- Do you want to have children?|- Later, not just yet
{89398}{89439}Why later?
{89446}{89572}Because I want to live a little first,|to be independent
{89622}{89672}So children are out
{89678}{89780}Do you know what birth-control means?
{89814}{89916}More or less; there's a lot|talked about it
{89950}{90028}What does it actually involve?
{90182}{90236}Come on, tell me
{90286}{90396}It's so embarrassing...|I know what it is, but...
{90430}{90464}...I can't...
{90470}{90580}I'm making a general survey of|Frenchwomen, not just you
{90586}{90692}I see; well, birth-control is...
{90782}{90860}Do you know any practical methods?
{90902}{90999}I know some, but I'd rather not|name them
{91006}{91068}Just give one or two examples
{91118}{91220}Well, there are pills,|to use a general sort of term
{91238}{91295}Or else a diaphragm
{91302}{91391}Yes, but aren't there other things|besides pills?
{91398}{91452}I told you: A diaphragm
{91478}{91532}Do you often fall in love?
{91614}{91652}Certainly not
{91686}{91743}Don't you like being in love?
{91750}{91847}Yes, but it isn't something|you go looking for
{91854}{91951}It just happens; and when it does,|it's terrific
{91958}{92052}It's something you can't help, and|it doesn't happen every day
{92070}{92148}Do you know of a war going on|just now?
{92286}{92335}That doesn't concern me
{92342}{92436}No, but isn't there one|going on somewhere?
{92454}{92516}I don't know... I don't know...
{93060}{93098}Well?
{93788}{93834}She'll be here in fifteen minutes
{93860}{93933}If she appears at the Olympia,|I'll kill her
{93940}{93988}You're crazy
{93994}{94074}No, I think it's disgusting;|I'll kill her
{94372}{94434}Let's talk about something else
{94572}{94626}That's between you and Madeleine
{94892}{94938}Still thinking about her?
{94964}{95074}No, I was thinking about my father.|It's the mashed potatoes
{95268}{95386}One day at home we were eating|mashed potatoes
{95436}{95554}Suddenly my father stopped and said:|"I've got it!"
{95620}{95682}"Got what?", my sister asked
{95740}{95842}He'd discovered why the earth|goes round the sun
{95868}{95946}Of course, Galileo discovered it first
{95980}{96077}But all of a sudden, just like that,|my father...
{96084}{96173}...had rediscovered why the earth|goes round the sun...
{96180}{96242}...exactly as Galileo did originally
{96260}{96346}So he stopped eating mashed potatoes|and said: "I've got it!"
{96492}{96586}Me, I made a crack, and got|the mashed potatoes in my face
{96748}{96826}Did I tell you I saw that guy again?
{96876}{96962}The one we went to Fontainebleau with?
{96980}{97038}I hadn't heard about that
{97044}{97138}Surely Madeleine told you|we went with him?
{97308}{97410}- Remember how cross you were after?|- Not about that
{97484}{97538}I thought you were angry about...
{97588}{97646}Nothing; you'd be hurt
{97652}{97708}Tell me, anyway
{97716}{97762}It was nothing
{97768}{97846}The guy wants to go again|this weekend, because...
{97852}{97922}...he saw you with me and|wants to bring his woman
{97964}{98018}- Poor Paul!|- Why?
{98124}{98198}We're not the sort of girls for you
{98204}{98266}What bloody business is it of yours?
{98500}{98570}I repeat: What bloody business is it|of yours?
{98588}{98642}I just mentioned it
{98748}{98826}I don't care, anyway;|Madeleine's pregnant
{98940}{98994}She isn't; I know her
{99060}{99122}I don't think you do, really
{99180}{99266}She takes her temperature|before sleeping around
{99332}{99378}She's very careful
{99956}{100018}I'm still out of breath
{100188}{100269}- I've been rushing|- It doesn't show
{100276}{100306}Feel
{100348}{100387}Well, really!
{100394}{100482}Oh, come on. He's entitled to that
{100892}{101018}I met Sylvie at the studio; she|gave me a signed copy of her record
{101044}{101106}Here you are
{101148}{101218}Something less hip for you
{101268}{101370}Yes, I'd rather have had|Bach's Concerto in D
{102164}{102246}May I wait until you've finished?
{102252}{102338}Look, I think I know that woman
{102388}{102477}She's the one who took a shot|at her husband
{102484}{102546}I don't think it's the same woman
{102564}{102613}She's hustling
{102636}{102694}I haven't much money
{102700}{102806}I have to economize if I'm to see|the châteaux on the Loire
{102812}{102908}How much can you give me?
{102914}{102962}That's too much
{102980}{103042}How much do you have on you?
{103107}{103229}Not much; why, do you have|different prices?
{103236}{103290}It depends on what you want
{103324}{103394}Let me work it out
{103507}{103554}Are you German?
{103628}{103714}I'm not French, and people think|I'm German...
{103740}{103794}...but I hate the Germans
{103876}{103954}Because my parents died in Germany
{104004}{104034}Whereabouts?
{104060}{104130}Never heard of concentration camps?
{104148}{104242}I'm fed up with people saying|things like that
{104307}{104413}I was ten years old at the time;|you, too, probably
{104419}{104517}Maybe you were, but your father wasn't
{104524}{104571}I dissociate myself from him
{104619}{104706}It must be strange, screwing|fifty guys a day
{104724}{104806}I don't suppose it's more than|two or three
{104812}{104908}No, at weekends they do|over a hundred in the slums
{104914}{104941}Who's to blame, then?
{105060}{105162}- Laughing on your lonesome?|- That's why I'm laughing
{105172}{105246}She looks just like Brigitte Bardot,|doesn't she?
{105252}{105342}No, the sequence doesn't work;|I'd marked it already
{105348}{105418}You don't take it quickly enough
{105436}{105517}Vauthier's direction says "quickly"
{105524}{105606}I love sham, I love lies,|everything phoney...
{105612}{105690}...everything secret, caressing,|reassuring and false
{105707}{105821}You've got to go much quicker;|the same with the accident bit
{105828}{105888}After the guy's run over?
{105894}{106029}Yes, the rhythm's wrong there;|it says "in convulsive snatches"
{106036}{106158}It was terrible, whoever was at|fault; and what did I say?
{106164}{106229}There's one idiot the less
{106236}{106269}It says "quickly"
{106276}{106394}He should have been more careful;|nobody loves a loser
{106419}{106525}The same goes for the visit to|the housing project
{106531}{106621}It says "with a sort of|wild enthusiasm"
{106628}{106717}The memory of the marvellous|innovation will remain
{106724}{106788}The play isn't called The Marvels|for nothing
{106794}{106908}She speaks "ardently": A vast area|raised by human hand...
{106914}{107021}...and where there was nothing,|endless identical boxes
{107028}{107162}I think you must try to forget you've|rehearsed it, forget it all
{107169}{107277}Do it as if you were reading it|for the first time
{107284}{107358}Just read it any old how
{107364}{107434}All right, I'll try
{107457}{107512}It was constructed, it was perverse
{107519}{107630}There was no one there. The people|had gone, leaving their traces
{107640}{107704}There was nothing, nothing at all
{107714}{107794}They were lost and happy,|nothing left to desire
{108300}{108394}Got any change? Neither have I
{109460}{109514}What are you doing there, Paul?
{109731}{109774}I'm going for a pee
{109795}{109850}It's the sub-titled version
{109876}{109950}Good; dubbing's strictly for suckers
{110412}{110466}Get lost, punk!
{111084}{111218}Down with the republic of rat-finks
{111972}{112048}Don't mess about, Paul
{112188}{112250}Make your minds up
{112412}{112474}I love you, you silly oaf
{112556}{112650}- Have you finished, darlings?|- Shut up, Trotskyite!
{113834}{113930}They're cropping the picture;|I'll go and complain
{114204}{114266}Where's the projection box?
{114444}{114578}"The film should be projected in the|ratio in which it was shot
{114612}{114754}"The ratio of 1:1.85 constitutes a|limit which should not be exceeded...
{114780}{114898}"...in accordance with standards set|by international agreement"
{116380}{116506}We master ideas, which are nothing,|but not our emotions, which are all
{116652}{116702}What's happening?
{116707}{116802}A man and a woman in a foreign city...
{117580}{117690}- I don't like it; let's leave|- I want to see it
{117772}{117866}Oh, let's go. All this eroticism|is disgusting, anyway
{117884}{117938}Speak for yourself
{118188}{118234}Come on, let's go
{118260}{118322}- Are you staying?|- Yes, I am
{118860}{118887}At movies...
{118916}{118994}...the screen would light up|and we'd shiver
{119084}{119148}But more often we'd be disappointed,|Madeleine and I
{119619}{119676}But more often we'd be disappointed,|Madeleine and I
{119731}{119869}The images seemed old and flickery;|Marilyn Monroe had aged terribly
{119876}{119917}We were sad
{119924}{119998}This wasn't the film we'd imagined...
{120004}{120088}...the perfect film each of us|carried within...
{120094}{120234}...the film we would like to have|made, or perhaps even to have lived
{120472}{120539}Why do you find discussion|so difficult?
{120544}{120635}The government won't let workers|go to university
{120640}{120727}They're afraid, so they shut us out
{120744}{120810}It's the lack of money that does it
{120816}{120911}You need to learn how to say|what you want
{120981}{121047}What was it you were trying to tell me?
{121072}{121199}- Why do you love Paul, not me?|- I don't love Paul; Madeleine does
{121280}{121399}- Oh, sure. Why?|- I don't want to talk about it
{121528}{121599}Because it's none of your business
{121696}{121799}- Don't you like going out with boys?|- It depends on the boy
{121881}{121962}Are you going out with someone|just now?
{121969}{122015}Mind your own business
{122128}{122207}- Where do you want to take me?|- To the cinema
{122336}{122415}- Do you often take girls out?|- Now and again
{122512}{122559}What kind of girls?
{122569}{122602}Just girls
{122640}{122703}What's your boy friend like?
{122752}{122831}I'm not going out with|anyone special just now
{122872}{122959}- So you sleep around?|- No, I don't sleep around
{122976}{123027}You just said you did
{123032}{123131}I said I'm not going out with|anyone special
{123136}{123223}There's a difference between|going out and sleeping with
{123320}{123439}- Have you any ideas about democracy?|- Not particularly
{123688}{123779}Are you interested in|what goes on around you?
{123784}{123850}Of course, but it depends on|what it is
{123856}{123951}Politics don't interest me,|but there are other things
{124032}{124095}I can't think offhand...
{124120}{124227}...but there are all sorts of things|I'm interested in
{124232}{124321}Well, I read the newspapers,|for instance...
{124326}{124431}...and if it's an interesting article,|I go on; if not, I skip
{124448}{124519}You don't like being bored?
{124576}{124635}Why won't you speak about yourself?
{124640}{124754}Because it's none of your business|and I don't see any point in it
{124760}{124847}What good would it do you?
{124881}{124935}I'm none of your business
{124962}{125039}Do you often go with whores?
{125081}{125114}Now and then
{125120}{125166}If you can't find a girl?
{125172}{125258}No, not because I can't find a girl
{125264}{125391}I can't... I like whores in a way,|for lots of reasons
{125456}{125518}- How much does it cost?|- I never pay
{125536}{125607}About us going out...
{125640}{125743}- You prefer going out with Paul?|- Listen, I don't go out with Paul
{125905}{125991}The way you look at him,|I'd say you were in love
{125998}{126071}I'm not; don't go on about it
{126193}{126263}- Are you in love with anyone?|- No, why?
{126360}{126415}Really? No kidding?
{126464}{126535}Do you think I'm prettier|than Madeleine?
{126569}{126639}No, physically I prefer Madeleine
{126760}{126858}Madeleine said she'd shown you|her breasts; is it true?
{126864}{126911}I don't remember
{126936}{126975}That's not true
{127064}{127121}Did she show them to Paul?
{127193}{127303}- Like to talk about Paul, don't you?|- Don't go on so!
{127424}{127511}- Don't you like going out with boys?|- It depends on the boy
{127608}{127666}What kind do you like?
{127672}{127766}No particular kind, but I know|right away
{127772}{127839}- Johnny Halliday?|- Not likely!
{127856}{127919}- General de Gaulle?|- No fear!
{127936}{128028}Who, then? American film stars?
{128064}{128166}I get the feeling I'd seen you|somewhere before Paul introduced you
{128172}{128235}Maybe in a bar in Montparnasse?
{128240}{128319}Could be, I'm often around|the Montparnasse bars
{128344}{128379}Doing what?
{128384}{128467}Talking to friends,|playing pinball machines
{128502}{128559}Don't you like talking about yourself?
{128600}{128679}Because it's none of your business
{128728}{128823}- But you're your business|- Yes, but I'm not yours
{128840}{128959}- Why not talk, then?|- Because I don't concern you
{129064}{129146}But I love you, so I want to know|what you're like
{129152}{129255}Well, if it isn't mutual,|it's just egoism on your part
{129400}{129495}- Do you sleep with boys sometimes?|- No, why?
{129502}{129567}- Never?|- Mind your own business!
{129624}{129711}- Have you ever made love?|- Mind your own business
{129896}{129996}- What's the paper?|- My lecture to the cell
{130064}{130127}- What's it about?|- The revolution
{130160}{130295}Why is a workman described as skilled,|but not actors or clerks?
{130302}{130435}I go into that. There are three|categories of skilled worker
{130440}{130562}Being capable of executing a complete|revolution, I belong to the third
{130569}{130627}What is a complete revolution?
{130632}{130739}Take a piece of complex machinery,|for instance
{130744}{130835}You're given the raw material|and the design...
{130840}{130920}...showing what it should be like|when finished
{130926}{131010}There's no time to lose,|so you must be capable...
{131016}{131119}...of exceptional precision in thought|as well as gesture...
{131136}{131263}...visualizing at once not only how to|do it, but each stage in the operation
{131280}{131410}You have each stage clearly in mind,|even before you start
{131416}{131543}You take it up and you know|exactly what you have to do
{131632}{131743}And as you work, your mind can see|what must come next
{131750}{131841}You have already foreseen|the necessary tools and phases
{131848}{131983}This is known as a revolution; this,|too, is the revolutionary spirit
{132068}{132124}THIS FILM COULD BE CALLED
{132132}{132185}THE CHILDREN OF MARX AND COCA-COLA
{132196}{132243}MAKE OF IT WHAT YOU WILL
{132480}{132527}Got a light?
{132656}{132695}My matches!
{132936}{132975}Kiss the children
{133096}{133175}- My matches!|- Let this poor Messiah pass
{133240}{133303}I want to see what he does
{133592}{133683}He poured petrol over himself|and set fire to it
{133688}{133791}He can't have, he'd have cried out;|I heard nothing
{133816}{133895}He'd put sticking-plaster over his|mouth to silence himself
{133902}{133971}Why would he do it outside|the American Hospital?
{133976}{134055}There's a piece of paper;|go and look for yourself
{134288}{134333}What does it say?
{134340}{134415}"Peace in Vietnam". He's dead
{134904}{134975}Kill a man and you're a murderer
{135032}{135135}Kill thousands and you're a conqueror
{135168}{135247}Kill them all and you're a god
{135264}{135319}God doesn't exist
{135352}{135399}We'll soon see
{135448}{135527}- Do you love Madeleine?|- Don't start that again!
{135752}{135903}First tell me your name|and I'll tell you mine
{135952}{136079}Let's go far away from here|and then we'll talk
{136096}{136239}I don't want anyone to know|I've met you
{136272}{136415}I don't want them to say|you've kissed me
{136480}{136551}What is it? Can't you go away?
{136576}{136627}Watch your p's, Madeleine
{136632}{136720}It's the echo; I can't hear|what I'm singing
{136726}{136799}Watch my baton, Madeleine
{138064}{138143}Not bad, Madeleine... it was so-so
{138248}{138319}Did you like it? Was it good?
{138752}{138863}Could we re-do that tomorrow?|I'm not so good there
{138896}{138975}All right, three o'clock tomorrow
{139200}{139263}Someone from Radio Europe One|is waiting for you
{139416}{139514}Madeleine Zimmer? Did the session|go well?
{139520}{139610}Very well. I must speak to|my secretary
{139616}{139658}The car, Paul
{139664}{139711}- What car?|- Don't be thick
{139776}{139895}- How do I get a car?|- Use those cool wits you boast about
{139902}{139935}Shut up!
{139960}{139999}I'll phone
{140344}{140387}Your favourite singers?
{140392}{140483}The Beatles; and for the classics,|Bach
{140488}{140591}Bach seems rather surprising, given|the kind of songs you sing
{140602}{140675}They don't rule each other out,|you know
{140680}{140810}- Any special traits?|- Well, I hardly ever wear make-up
{140816}{140943}And I like flat shoes and short skirts
{140950}{141023}You like the young look?
{141040}{141139}In America you see billboards|along the highways saying:
{141144}{141187}"You're in the Pepsi Generation"
{141192}{141283}I love Pepsi-Cola, really I do
{141288}{141359}Well, we look forward to|your third record
{141456}{141559}- What about the car?|- What car? Did you steal one?
{141592}{141706}You haven't the guts,|you're no Pierrot le Fou
{141712}{141779}No? Well, I phoned the War Ministry
{141784}{141887}"This is General Doinel", I said.|"Where the hell's my car?"
{141912}{142031}It may not come; Robert and I|have worked the trick before
{142392}{142455}Long live the French army!
{142752}{142825}January to March: I continue my survey
{142832}{142910}Do you like cheese in tubes?
{142918}{142956}Do you read?
{142964}{143034}What is a cadre?
{143048}{143126}What do you think of short skirts?
{143136}{143178}What do you do at an accident?
{143192}{143276}Suppose your fiancée took up|with a black?
{143288}{143398}Do you know there's a famine|in India? What is a communist?
{143408}{143473}Do you take the pill?
{143488}{143551}Or do you prefer|vaginal contraception?
{143576}{143675}Why are society women more often|frigid than working class women?
{143688}{143774}Do you know the Kurds are|at war with Iraq?
{143784}{143879}Gradually I began to realize|that such questions...
{143888}{143996}...often distorted rather than|reflected a collective mentality
{144016}{144145}My own lack of objectivity,|even though unconscious...
{144168}{144254}...was inevitably matched by|insincerity in those I questioned
{144264}{144357}Unaware of deceiving them, I may|have been deceived, too. Why?
{144376}{144478}Probably because such surveys tend|to forget their real objective...
{144488}{144609}...seeking value judgements,|instead of observing behaviour
{144664}{144811}I discovered that all these questions|I was asking French people...
{144824}{144919}...expressed an ideology of the past|and not of the present
{144936}{145072}I had to remain vigilant; I had|gleaned a few insights as guidelines
{145096}{145191}A philosopher is a man who pits|his awareness against opinion
{145198}{145283}To be a aware is to be open|to the world
{145288}{145366}To be honest is to act as though|time didn't exist
{145424}{145551}To see life, to really see it,|that is what wisdom means
{145728}{145787}What happened?
{145792}{145906}He inherited some money from his|mother and bought a flat
{145912}{146047}Nobody really believed it until|Elisabeth and Madeleine saw the flat
{146104}{146239}It was in a tower block|being built at Neuilly
{146296}{146366}They talked about furnishing|the rooms...
{146372}{146447}...the kitchen, the dining-room|and so on
{146464}{146531}They had a quarrel
{146536}{146671}I think because Madeleine wanted|Elisabeth to live with them
{146776}{146875}Anyway, Paul apparently wanted|to take some photographs
{146880}{146991}He must have retreated too far|and he fell
{147048}{147151}I can't believe it was suicide;|it was a stupid accident
{147728}{147775}Madeleine Zimmer?
{147912}{147959}What happened?
{147984}{148095}It happened exactly as Catherine|told you... exactly
{148152}{148255}Your friend Elisabeth says you're|pregnant. What will you do?
{148328}{148375}I don't know
{148424}{148463}I'm not sure
{148544}{148639}I don't know... Elisabeth mentioned|curtain rods...
{148936}{148959}I'm not sure
