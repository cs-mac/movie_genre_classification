1
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,084
Tickets.

2
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,128
Tickets, please.

3
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,090
Tickets. Tickets.

4
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,346
Thank you. Tickets.

5
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,349
Is it far to Tucumcari?

6
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,143
We should pass there
in about three or four minutes.

7
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,270
Thanks.

8
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,690
Excuse me,
but you've made a mistake, Reverend.

9
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,900
I couldn't help hearing
you're going to Tucumcari.

10
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,193
I peddle goods around here,

11
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,446
and l better tell you
you're on the wrong train.

12
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,411
I think the nearest stop
to Tucumcari is Amarillo.

13
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:51,540
By getting off at Santa Fe
and returning by way of Amarillo,

14
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,876
you should be able to get
right where you're going.

15
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,882
You see, the train
doesn't stop at Tucumcari.

16
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,895
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.

17
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,548
Take it easy, everybody!

18
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,593
Why'd you stop?
Something's gone wrong?

19
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,887
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.

20
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,650
Hey, mister, you just can't pull
the emergency cord and jump off.

21
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,738
Tell me, why'd you stop that train?
If you want to get off, you...

22
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,281
Well, the railroad company

23
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,450
would be mighty pleased
to make any arrangements

24
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,661
for any passenger
if you want to get off here, sir.

25
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,663
I did get off. Thanks.

26
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,668
All right, let's go!

27
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,754
Go ahead! Let's go!

28
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,083
Guy passed by here in person
and added on those two zeros.

29
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,419
He was spitting mad
when he saw what they was offering.

30
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,795
He wasn't flattered.

31
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,840
He said, "A measly 1,000 bucks
for me is much too little.

32
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,342
"I'm worth a lot more than that."

33
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,802
That's right. He said that,

34
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,805
and then he added the zeros on the 1,000.

35
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,351
There isn't anyone got the guts
to face that killer, eh?

36
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,071
At least it's been that way till now.

37
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,906
Where is he?

38
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,225
I have no idea where he'd be today.

39
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,123
-Hold still.
-But, Guy...

40
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,168
-Hold still, l said.
-You hurt me with those hands of yours.

41
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,255
-Then do as l tell you.
-Stop it!

42
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,966
Now see, you've made me drop the soap.

43
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,720
-Wait, I'll get it for you.
-You're killing me.

44
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,724
Oh, look. What's that?

45
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,185
Pardon me, ma'am.

46
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,154
I'll kill you for this.

47
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,334
There you are. $1,000.

48
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,723
What do you know about Cavanagh?

49
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,726
About a week ago
he was seen at White Rocks.

50
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,394
Thanks.

51
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,397
If it's of any interest to you,

52
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,900
somebody else dropped in
to see me about him.

53
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,113
-Who?
-I’d never seen him before.

54
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,574
His name is Manco.

55
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,159
Light?

56
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,081
You know Baby Cavanagh?

57
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,629
Now tell me,
you know where l can find him?

58
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,972
There, at that table.

59
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,599
He's got his back to you.

60
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,479
Thanks.

61
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,130
Two cards.

62
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,464
Didn't hear what the bet was.

63
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,719
Your life.

64
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,959
Alive or dead, it's your choice.

65
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,131
Let Red go.

66
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,962
$2,000. It's a lot of money.

67
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,090
Takes me three years to earn it.

68
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,719
Tell me, isn't a sheriff supposed to be
courageous, loyal,

69
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,388
and above all, honest?

70
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,891
Yeah, that he is.

71
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,531
I think you people need a new sheriff.

72
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,796
Yuri.

73
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,940
Hasta luego.

74
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,526
Amigo.

75
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,710
How are you, Niño?

76
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,628
Better when l see you.

77
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,643
Go on. Go ahead.

78
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,459
Open it.

79
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,314
-What's up? Who is it?
-Rodriguez, señor.

80
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,140
You, come along.

81
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,491
I'm letting you live, hero.

82
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,745
That's so you can tell everybody
you've seen what takes place here.

83
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,469
For the lousy money.

84
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,555
No. No, no.

85
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,480
You took money to put me behind bars.

86
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,277
You should've killed me when you could.

87
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,321
It would be better for you.

88
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,781
And for them.

89
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,329
How old is the boy?

90
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,127
How old is the boy, l asked?

91
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,713
He's 18 months now.

92
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,217
Just the time that l was in jail.

93
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,597
-You used the reward that you got...
-Oh, no, no.

94
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,724
...to start raising a family.

95
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,896
And that's why l feel
your family is partly mine.

96
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,483
I'll take my part now.

97
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,360
Outside.

98
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,115
They're both innocent.

99
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,617
Please let them go.

100
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,577
I was the one. You know that.

101
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,331
Oh, no.

102
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,059
No!

103
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,022
I know.

104
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,484
I'm sure you hate me just enough.

105
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,844
This time you'll have a chance
to shoot me, but not in the back.

106
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,723
Let go.

107
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,398
When you hear the music finish, begin.

108
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,110
Or do you think you can?

109
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,489
Let's start.

110
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,399
Now.

111
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,649
-Check those figures again.
-Yes, sir.

112
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,113
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.

113
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,782
Mortimer.

114
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,328
-Douglas Mortimer.
-Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?

115
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,747
-Carolina.
-That's right, Carolina.

116
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,749
Can l help in some way?

117
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,628
-I'm looking for a first-class bank.
-Oh, but exactly.

118
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,338
Yeah.

119
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,966
The largest and most secure bank
in the territory.

120
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,510
Well, Mr. Mortimer,

121
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,012
l want to assure you
our bank here has everything,

122
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,889
all the safeguards you're looking for.

123
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,226
I don't doubt that,
but l have a large sum to deposit.

124
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,436
Now, suppose I'm a bandit.

125
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,857
A bandit?

126
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,277
A very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers.

127
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,406
Now what would be
the most impossible bank for me to rob?

128
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,369
In your case, the one bank
l would suggest is the Bank of El Paso.

129
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,955
Not even Indio
would dare to attack that one.

130
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,833
It's not a bank. It's a fortress there.

131
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,924
-What time's the next train for El Paso?
-11:30.

132
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,635
I'll telegraph to my colleague
in the Bank of El Paso

133
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,595
that you're going to arrive.

134
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,721
Thanks.

135
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,624
Hey, mister. Captain. General. Welcome.

136
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,543
Do you need a stable or a room?

137
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,044
Do you want to take a bath?

138
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,796
My name is Fernando.

139
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,049
The stable is right here.
And that is your hotel.

140
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,845
Why this hotel and not some other?

141
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,639
You probably wouldn't like
that other place as much, señor.

142
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,309
You'd have to spend half the night
shooting cockroaches.

143
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,811
At this hotel,
the rooms will cost you so much less.

144
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,731
And there's a landlady at this one, señor.

145
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,359
-Married?
-Yes, but she doesn't care.

146
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,506
That's the bank.
As soon as l get some money, I'll put it in.

147
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,426
Well, you're gonna have to earn it first.

148
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,180
I have 50 cents here for you
if you'll let me know

149
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,309
when anybody you've never seen before
here in El Paso comes to town.

150
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,480
At the hotel, señor.
A stranger just came out of there.

151
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,613
Where's he staying?

152
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,290
The hotel.

153
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,381
Let me know if you see
any more strangers.

154
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,840
Sure, señor.

155
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,274
Help you, sir?

156
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,276
I want the room right above.

157
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,071
I'm sorry, it's occupied. It's too bad.

158
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,865
The hotel's filled to capacity.

159
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,828
I'm sorry. The room you want is our best.
It’s always occupied.

160
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,121
By who?

161
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,415
Check the register.

162
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,666
Mary!

163
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,628
It's Señor Martinez.

164
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,890
-It's free now.
-That room is taken!

165
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,561
I'll see to it.

166
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,402
He's nothing but a wild, vicious animal.

167
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,738
He's tall, isn't he?

168
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,702
You're just dirty!

169
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,383
Proprietor, quick! My bill!

170
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,178
I want my bill!

171
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,765
Before he comes down here,
give me my bill.

172
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,058
Oh, no. There's no need to check out.

173
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,226
I assure you, everything's gonna be
all right, Mr. Martinez.

174
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,561
I'll give you another room immediately.

175
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,480
-It's the best in the whole hotel, the best.
-No.

176
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,231
We'll let him have the bridal suite.

177
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,192
No, no, Mary, the bill.
I’d like to stay, only l can't.

178
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,736
-Don't go, Mr. Martinez.
-L have an appointment elsewhere.

179
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,404
Señor Martinez.

180
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,576
Yes, señor. What do you want?

181
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,250
I don't wear them.

182
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,337
I'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.

183
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,794
Watch this.

184
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,571
Hello, my friends.

185
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,615
Hello, Indio.

186
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,910
You see, l didn't waste a minute
coming here.

187
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,080
Indio calls
and Groggy comes running right away.

188
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,456
And Sancho?

189
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:12,502
If you're waiting for Sancho,
I'll go and come back in about four years.

190
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,797
He's in prison for four years.

191
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,426
No amor. No dinero. No sun.

192
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,390
Bad for him. Not so bad for the rest of us.

193
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,519
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect, huh?

194
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,732
What's it all about, huh?

195
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,650
Now just listen.

196
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,406
A bank at El Paso.

197
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,951
Let's see.

198
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,829
We'll say this is the inside of the bank.

199
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,081
Niño is the safe.

200
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,793
Which weighs three tons
and can't be opened with dynamite.

201
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,880
There's the part with two cashiers.

202
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,758
This is the manager's desk.

203
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,136
Right in back
is a fancy cabinet containing bottles

204
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,097
for offering drinks to the rich depositors.

205
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,561
There's the main door,
and opposite they built a double wall.

206
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,813
What happens, Groggy?

207
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,984
Let's say you've already killed
the two cashiers and the manager.

208
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,738
And for the next few minutes,
you're the boss of the bank.

209
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,573
Now what?

210
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,244
The time's been wasted, Indio.

211
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,789
Right, a waste of time.

212
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,875
Especially, Groggy,
to blast open that damn iron safe.

213
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,797
We'd have to be using so much dynamite
that the whole bank would just disappear.

214
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,591
And you'd all go up with it.

215
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,137
And besides, the presence of a safe alone

216
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,432
doesn't always signify
that there is money inside.

217
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,353
To help you understand what l mean,

218
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,484
l would like to relate a nice little parable.

219
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,781
Once upon a time there was a carpenter.

220
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,245
You don't think a carpenter
can make money, eh?

221
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,163
No? You're wrong.

222
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:18,628
This one did well
because he was a builder of safes.

223
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,215
There was a banker once

224
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,260
who decided
he must have his iron safe disguised

225
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,221
to look like a wood cabinet.

226
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,101
To get it made

227
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,272
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job,

228
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,317
and one day, as destiny has it,

229
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,653
the carpenter's in El Paso.

230
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,991
He happens to walk into the bank there,
and what does he find?

231
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,826
The cabinet.

232
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,414
Since he'd worked on the cabinet,
he spotted it right away.

233
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,584
From that day on,
he couldn't work anymore.

234
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,461
Pity, because

235
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,048
there was something he had to do.

236
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,508
There was this crazy idea.

237
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:10,513
And it stayed.

238
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,976
To put his hands on the money inside.

239
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,396
Get in there and grab all the money.

240
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,817
Sure, you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out.

241
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,945
That he was lucky to go in just that bank.

242
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,572
It wasn't true.

243
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,785
His good fortune stopped that day.

244
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,705
Because later, as a prisoner,

245
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,251
he ran into me.

246
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,052
The carpenter told me the story,
and l tell you.

247
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,645
The money isn't in the safe.
It’s right in this.

248
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,733
Almost a million dollars in it.

249
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,239
Your colleague in Tucumcari
told me that this bank

250
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,492
has the largest deposits
in the whole state.

251
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,536
Yes, that's correct, Mr. Mortimer.

252
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,037
Here at the bank at El Paso

253
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,207
we have half a million dollars
reserve on hand.

254
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,253
I see.

255
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,131
You sure this bank is secure enough
to hold that much?

256
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,134
From the moment your money's
on deposit here, Mr. Mortimer,

257
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,636
you can sleep without any worries.

258
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,181
Besides,

259
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,018
when the bank is closed,
an armed guard always remains here

260
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,479
and a patrol is on guard outside.

261
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,692
Even the Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.

262
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,695
Exactly. The truth is, Mr. Mortimer,

263
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,199
to try robbing us would be so futile

264
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,286
that only a complete fool
would attempt it.

265
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,454
Yeah.

266
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,415
Or a complete madman.

267
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,304
Get out of the way! Get out of here!

268
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,059
More news, amigo.

269
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,605
Another stranger in town?

270
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,691
Yes. And l know something else.

271
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,034
There was another stranger
l didn't tell you about.

272
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,412
Listen to me, you sawed-off little runt!

273
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,040
I want to know
how many men there are all together.

274
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,292
Well, there were two.
Now there's two more.

275
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,544
Where?

276
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,046
In the saloon.

277
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,927
Whiskey.

278
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,597
Listen, mister, why do you choose
my place to commit suicide?

279
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,600
I know that man.
It’s a miracle you're alive.

280
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,771
Why should a man walk around with
a pistol and then let himself be insulted?

281
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,939
It's mighty strange.

282
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,650
Sir, if the hunchback didn't shoot you,

283
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,862
he had a very, very
important reason, that's all.

284
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,074
I was thinking that myself.

285
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:06,554
One, two, three,

286
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,766
now four, now five.

287
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,228
Seis, siete, ocho,

288
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,481
nueve, diez.

289
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,068
11, 12, 13,

290
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,530
14, 15, 16,

291
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:29,035
17, 18, 19,

292
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:33,080
20, 21, 22,

293
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:38,002
23, 24, 25,

294
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,962
26...

295
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:44,133
27, 28, 29,

296
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,345
30, 31,

297
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:51,015
32 and 33.

298
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,284
No. No, no.

299
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,705
All right, now.

300
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,126
I don't know him! I don't know him!
L don't know him!

301
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,211
Come on, now, you know everybody.

302
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:48,132
I don't know anybody anymore! I'm dead!
Understand?

303
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,676
Well, there was a time
when l knew everybody.

304
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,596
That was a long time ago
when all this was prairie.

305
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,306
But in these days, everybody's in a hurry.

306
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,683
That's right, with your damned
good-for-nothing trains!

307
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,103
Your damn trains! Toot-toot-toot-twee!

308
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,522
Disgusting!

309
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,150
One day, someone from the railroad
comes here to see me.

310
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,820
And he says, "Prophet, the railway's
gonna go right past your house."

311
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,490
"ls that so?" l said.

312
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,201
"Yep, that right," he says.

313
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,328
"All those trains gonna go right past here.

314
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,331
"And the best thing for you, Prophet,
is to sell your land to the company

315
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,666
"or else we'll buy Baker's.

316
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,376
"He lives next to your place,

317
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,962
"and I'll put the tracks there
and that'll make you go crazy.

318
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,881
"What do you say? Will you sell out
to our company, Prophet?"

319
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,425
"Oh, is that so?" says l.

320
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,222
He was very anxious for me to sell out.

321
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,516
You know what l told him
about the railroad?

322
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,560
You know what l told him
he could do with his railroad?

323
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,832
You know what my decision
about selling was?

324
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,293
-Well, you said no.
-You're right about that.

325
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,212
No to him and his damn trains.

326
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,797
I wouldn't! No!

327
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:13,259
Look, listen to me, old man.

328
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,094
You're supposed to be a prophet.

329
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,139
I didn't come here
to listen to you rattle on about trains.

330
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,726
I wanted to find out about this man.
It’s obvious you don't know anything.

331
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,645
No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came here to do,

332
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,066
you can clear out of my house fast
before l lose my temper. Understand?

333
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,115
Hey! Where you going?

334
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:42,455
I guess l better leave
before you go and lose your temper.

335
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,082
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?

336
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,626
Hurry up. Give me that pistol there.

337
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,587
Yeah, right there behind you.

338
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,297
Hurry!

339
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,300
Yes, yes, that's the one.
Now, hand it over.

340
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,512
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.

341
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,557
There's only one question,
how does he carry his gun?

342
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,268
-He wears it here, across his belly?
-Yeah.

343
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,354
Well, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place, my boy.

344
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,815
Of course l know the man
you're trying to find out about.

345
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,692
Of course l know him.

346
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,028
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.

347
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,907
Mortimer, a brave man, a soldier.

348
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,410
He was known
as the best shot in the Carolinas.

349
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,079
A great soldier.

350
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,832
Now he's reduced to being a bounty killer,
same as you.

351
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,667
Because of trains.

352
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,295
Because of the damn trains! Damn them!

353
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,301
Take it to the station.

354
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,386
The gentleman's leaving.

355
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,017
Hold it.

356
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,855
Take it back.

357
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,443
Take it to the station.

358
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,948
-Go inside.
-The station.

359
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,727
Just like the games we know.

360
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,493
-He's picking it up.
-A trick, maybe.

361
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:21,979
How can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this?

362
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,648
That contraption

363
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,444
almost sent you to your grave.

364
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,949
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel,
l was shooting at your hat.

365
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,285
Well, l was only shooting at yours.

366
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,246
But l recall firing first.

367
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,458
Boy,

368
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:46,545
I've reached almost 50 years
of age with my system.

369
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,881
Not many men last long in these parts.

370
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,258
How long do you expect to last?

371
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,803
Much longer than that.

372
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:59,266
When l get my hands on Indio
and that $10,000,

373
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,895
I'm gonna buy myself a little place,
possibly retire.

374
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,396
Yeah.

375
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,566
Well, l don't believe
we ought to start another fight.

376
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,651
But you forget one small detail.

377
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,028
What's that?

378
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,572
I wanna get my hands on Indio, too.

379
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,991
Sure, after me.

380
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,161
Or before you.

381
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,830
Or at the same time.

382
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,668
Ls that a proposition?

383
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,755
An equal partnership.

384
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,549
Why? Why should l?

385
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,635
Well, l can think of three reasons.

386
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,970
First is, there's 14 of them.

387
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,931
Yeah, that's a lot.

388
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,349
A lot for me.

389
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,060
Yeah. No small number even for two of us.

390
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:47,439
Second reason?

391
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,153
The second reason is
you could make it 15-to-1.

392
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,906
Don't forget
l wanna play in this game, too.

393
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,952
As you're aware,
when two hunters go after the same prey

394
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,120
they usually end up
shooting each other in the back,

395
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,374
and we don't want to
shoot each other in the back.

396
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,920
Then the colonel dies?

397
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,050
All right, I'll be generous.

398
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,720
You can have the reward for Indio

399
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,266
and I'll take the reward
for the rest of the band.

400
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,394
No. All wrong.

401
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,980
No, Indio's worth $10,000 dollars,

402
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,233
but the rest of the band
adds up to much more than that.

403
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,820
Blackie's worth four,
Wild's worth three, Niño two.

404
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,238
Niño's one.

405
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,159
Well, Frisco's worth two.

406
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,579
Well, that's $10,000.

407
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,081
Yeah, but

408
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:49,334
there's a few more
that'll add up to more than that, I'm sure.

409
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,754
-How do you know that?
-L have my information, Colonel.

410
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,756
You know, when all is said and done,

411
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,218
l think l might just take you up
on your proposition.

412
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,348
Let's drink to this partnership.

413
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,272
To the partnership,
with no tricks, of course.

414
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,816
No tricks.

415
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,198
Now, then, you realize, of course,

416
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,702
we're gonna have to figure out
some way to get them in the middle.

417
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,870
Yup.

418
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,914
One from the outside,
one from the inside.

419
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,208
There's no other way.

420
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,128
One of us will have to join Indio's band.

421
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,050
Why are you looking at me
when you say "one of us"?

422
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,801
Because they don't know you.

423
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,763
Wild sees me
and his hump will catch on fire.

424
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,975
Tell me, Colonel,

425
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,228
how do you propose
that l join up with Indio?

426
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,814
Maybe bring him a bunch of roses?

427
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:57,444
Well, you could do that, but I'd
suggest you take him Sancho Perez.

428
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,281
-Who's Sancho Perez?
-A friend of Indio's.

429
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,241
Right now he's cooling off.

430
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,786
He's cooling off in Alamogordo jail.

431
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,871
How do you know all this?

432
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,792
I've got my information, too.

433
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:18,006
Naturally, you'll have to arrange
for his release.

434
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,344
Naturally.

435
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,764
Tell me, Colonel,

436
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,100
were you ever young?

437
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,436
Yup.

438
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,272
And just as reckless as you.

439
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,070
Then one day something happened.

440
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,115
Made life very precious to me.

441
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,200
What's that?

442
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:52,541
Or is the question indiscreet?

443
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,418
No.

444
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,754
The question isn't indiscreet.

445
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,049
But the answer could be.

446
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,536
They told me you were put away.

447
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,331
You'd be resting
for four long years in prison.

448
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:26,046
No, Indio, for four weeks.
No more than four weeks.

449
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,965
Sancho.

450
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,517
Who is that with you?

451
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,771
He got me out. The man's a friend of mine.

452
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:53,031
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?

453
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,535
Yeah. Amigo, why did you help me out?

454
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:04,417
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen

455
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:09,297
that l thought l might just tag along
on your next robbery.

456
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,133
Might just turn you in to the law.

457
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,760
Amigo,

458
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,016
that's the one answer
that would prove you're all right.

459
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,855
And you arrived just in time, too.
The job is already set.

460
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,232
It's tomorrow.

461
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,901
The place is

462
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:14,696
the bank in El Paso.

463
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:20,493
Not far from El Paso
there's a little town, Santa Cruz.

464
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:23,872
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico, Paco,

465
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,417
and you, amigo,

466
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,086
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.

467
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,465
Shoot, kill,
get every gun in the area after you

468
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,508
especially those from El Paso.

469
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,970
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.

470
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:44,392
And then after the job,
we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.

471
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,523
Where are you going?

472
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,949
Well, if there's gonna be any shooting,

473
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,785
l gotta get my rest.

474
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,592
Hey, amigo,

475
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:21,429
you know when you told that story
yesterday, l fell for it.

476
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,057
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

477
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,776
Who said l was joking?

478
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,738
I don't get that. If it's true...

479
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,782
Too bad you have to die.

480
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,330
What is it?

481
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,014
By now they should be at Santa Cruz.

482
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,599
Listen, shorty,

483
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:37,023
Indio and his band
have just robbed the bank here in town.

484
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:40,151
Now why don't you just sit down
and send out the alarm to El Paso

485
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,238
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn them, right?

486
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:47,200
But, mister, l didn't hear any shots
at the bank, and l sure would have.

487
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:49,035
You might hear one.

488
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,162
The alarm.

489
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,623
Easy now.

490
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,794
They've robbed the bank at Santa Cruz!

491
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,088
Follow me!

492
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,022
Groggy, the telegraph wires.

493
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,680
-Good day, gentlemen.
-Good day, sir.

494
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,061
-Sir.
-Good afternoon.

495
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,297
The other side.

496
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:02,677
11,

497
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,470
12...

498
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:08,599
14.

499
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,012
Let's go!

500
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,265
What are you doing here?
You're not running away, are you?

501
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,977
No, I'm not running away.
I'm going after them and I'm going alone.

502
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:23,687
Our partnership is dissolved.

503
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,397
Now, boy, let's wait and talk it over.

504
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:27,691
Yeah? Well, all we've done is talk.

505
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,860
I've been reasonable with no results.

506
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,195
Now take it easy.

507
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,364
We only knew
the Santa Cruz part of this plan.

508
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,533
Well, you were the one
who had their strategy all worked out.

509
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:40,162
-Now I'm gonna meet Indio.
-L see. I better go along.

510
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:42,164
I'm going alone. Me.

511
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,540
I have an appointment with Indio

512
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,668
and I'm not gonna let
anyone else interfere.

513
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:48,629
-You certain about that?
-That's right, Colonel.

514
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:51,173
All right, in that case, I'm sorry.

515
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,221
That's not bad.

516
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,932
Indio sent four men to Santa Cruz.

517
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:03,185
And one man returns,
a new man without a scratch.

518
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:05,229
Indio's no idiot.

519
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,940
When you ride up to him again
and show him that little nick you got,

520
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:09,817
he might believe you.

521
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:11,902
And don't forget, that as of today,

522
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,780
the whole gang is worth $40,000 more.

523
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:18,075
That's the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back.

524
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:22,079
-ls the partnership operating again?
-Just how do you figure?

525
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:27,042
Try to convince Indio to go north,
and then go along the Rio Bravo.

526
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:30,337
It's a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires.

527
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:33,966
Yeah. You on the outside,
me on the inside, right?

528
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,344
North?

529
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:42,349
North.

530
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,661
Yuri.

531
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:12,755
Wait a minute.

532
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:16,050
We need time to open it
and this isn't the right place.

533
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,830
And the others?

534
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,415
-Dead?
-Yeah.

535
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:54,046
After Santa Cruz, we headed for El Paso
and they hit us from all sides.

536
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,343
And you just saved your own skin.
Isn't that right? You yellow...

537
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,989
You did your part of it. Let's go.

538
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,450
Which way we headed?

539
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:25,786
North.

540
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:28,789
North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?

541
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:30,624
Why not?

542
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:35,129
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.

543
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:38,924
You know a better way to go?

544
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:40,384
Yeah, south.

545
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,304
Ride to the border?

546
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:49,309
Yeah, they'll never expect you to cross
the border now that the alarm's been sent.

547
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:54,940
No.

548
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:56,900
Think we'll head east.

549
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,320
There's a place l know about,
Agua Caliente.

550
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:04,700
Here we are. That's Agua Caliente.

551
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,828
Yes, l have many friends here.

552
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,664
It looks just like a morgue.

553
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,167
But look out.

554
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,170
It could be one so easily.

555
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:20,757
-They don't like strangers, eh?
-No, they don't like anybody.

556
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:25,929
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?

557
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:28,891
No.

558
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:31,935
Did any of you?

559
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,858
We don't know
how you'd be in emergencies.

560
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:42,237
I was thinking, this is the right place.

561
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,698
I got a way you can show the men.

562
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,577
How's that?

563
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,330
Go into town alone, amigo.

564
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,039
Bravo.

565
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,175
Do you mind telling me
how you got here?

566
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,177
I just reasoned it out.

567
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,013
I figured you'd tell Indio

568
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:40,475
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed.

569
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,104
And he's suspicious enough
to figure out something else.

570
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:48,275
Since El Paso was out of the question,
well, here l am.

571
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,154
Rum, a double.

572
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,282
Tequila for all of us.

573
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:14,468
Well, well, if it isn't the smoker.

574
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:17,929
Well.

575
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:28,607
Remember me, amigo?

576
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:32,319
Of course you do.

577
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:33,904
El Paso.

578
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,576
It's a small world.

579
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:42,162
Yes, and very, very bad.

580
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,707
Now, come on. You light another match.

581
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:50,212
I generally smoke just after l eat.

582
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,881
Why don't you come back
in about 10 minutes?

583
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:55,675
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

584
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,968
Get up!

585
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,428
Stay calm.

586
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,224
On your feet.

587
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,191
Cuccillo,

588
01:32:13,152 --> 01:32:14,694
count to three.

589
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,330
One,

590
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:29,918
two,

591
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,380
three!

592
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:38,051
Stop it!

593
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:01,908
Who are you?

594
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,913
I'm the one
who can open the safe for you.

595
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:12,252
What safe, señor?

596
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,672
The one from El Paso.
You got there ahead of me.

597
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,674
-However...
-However?

598
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:23,263
Open that safe and you're gonna destroy
half the bank notes.

599
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:25,890
I can open it without blowing it up.

600
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,569
-What'll it cost?
-$5,000.

601
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,616
Two is all I'll pay you.

602
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:44,993
Five.

603
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,574
Keep your hands off it!

604
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:28,244
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.

605
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,788
Take it out.

606
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,415
Now, every man in New Mexico
is after us.

607
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,001
All they have to do
is catch one of us with some of this money

608
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:37,128
and we'll all end up the same way.

609
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,255
We're going to wait here
for an entire month

610
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,257
if l think it's necessary.

611
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,802
Then everybody will get his share.

612
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:46,596
And you will wait a month
to get your money.

613
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:48,765
Naturally.

614
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,309
I'll be in the tavern.

615
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:54,813
The air around here stinks anyway,
just like the food.

616
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,899
But the month will go fast.

617
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,222
All right.

618
01:35:37,773 --> 01:35:39,149
Right here.

619
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:41,568
Let's go.

620
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,548
I was worried about you.

621
01:38:08,632 --> 01:38:12,343
All alone with so many problems to solve.

622
01:38:29,528 --> 01:38:31,279
It's all right here.

623
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:37,869
Go ahead.

624
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:49,732
You shouldn't have shot
the apples off that tree.

625
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,328
Put it on.

626
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:41,844
What's he doing now,
this sheriff of El Paso?

627
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:45,181
Right now?
Looking for the cash that was in the bank.

628
01:41:46,308 --> 01:41:47,475
Right.

629
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:52,021
And suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside El Paso

630
01:41:53,148 --> 01:41:55,274
with lots of money on them?

631
01:41:56,985 --> 01:41:58,820
What will the sheriff think?

632
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:01,614
-Well, he...
-That's right.

633
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:22,111
Slim.

634
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,366
What is it, Niño?

635
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:31,037
A change of plans.

636
01:43:31,496 --> 01:43:33,706
Indio wants you to...

637
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,499
It's not loaded.

638
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,776
I think you should get out fast now.

639
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,279
Here's your guns without bullets.

640
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:50,324
And listen,
don't you let Indio find you both around.

641
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:42,418
I know you don't like questions, Indio,
but why are you doing this?

642
01:45:42,961 --> 01:45:47,173
Niño, how long have you known
that Manco's a bounty killer?

643
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:51,594
I found out tonight. Why?

644
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:58,351
I knew he was one
from the first moment he arrived.

645
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:06,525
The other one's also a bounty killer.

646
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:10,029
So l have an idea.

647
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,698
They'll be useful to us.

648
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:15,534
We'll try it.

649
01:46:16,661 --> 01:46:19,747
Those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun.

650
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:24,043
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.

651
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:27,213
But that won't really matter to me.

652
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,425
Or you.

653
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:36,222
Because we'll be far away, right?

654
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:44,563
And we'll have all the money.

655
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:48,776
Go on.

656
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:51,821
Go on and wake Cuccillo.

657
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:43,581
Who did it?

658
01:47:43,665 --> 01:47:46,000
Why don't you look at the knife?

659
01:47:54,926 --> 01:47:56,343
It's mine.

660
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:59,054
Then it shouldn't be there, should it?

661
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:11,692
But l didn't kill him, Indio. I didn't do it.

662
01:48:12,652 --> 01:48:15,779
Cuccillo, it's difficult to prove that.

663
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:19,867
Indio, l am innocent.

664
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:23,746
One of your horses is outside.

665
01:48:24,372 --> 01:48:26,665
Let's see if you can get to it.

666
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,361
Indio.

667
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:10,793
Cuccillo,

668
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:16,382
he just killed Slim.

669
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:21,387
And he helped those two bounty killers
get away.

670
01:49:26,017 --> 01:49:27,560
I want them back

671
01:49:29,187 --> 01:49:30,521
right now.

672
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:34,650
Right now.

673
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:38,320
Right now!

674
01:49:44,035 --> 01:49:46,120
What are you doing here?

675
01:49:46,204 --> 01:49:48,706
Go and get them back!

676
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:51,250
Groggy,

677
01:49:53,169 --> 01:49:55,045
those two bounty killers
are sitting on our backs

678
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:58,424
and l tell you
they both must be killed right away.

679
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:04,805
We can't let them go free.

680
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:21,196
It's done now.

681
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:25,367
Prepare to get out of here.

682
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:10,329
-Here, Niño.
-Indio.

683
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,165
Hold it.

684
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,381
Not a bad idea, Indio.

685
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:23,217
But I'm one thing you forgot about.

686
01:51:23,301 --> 01:51:24,843
Open it up now.

687
01:51:46,866 --> 01:51:49,118
All right, come on now, open it.

688
01:52:47,802 --> 01:52:49,470
Leave Indio to me.

689
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:54,099
All right.

690
01:53:26,966 --> 01:53:28,759
Where in hell is it?

691
01:53:56,996 --> 01:54:00,165
I'll kill them, but I'll rip out their guts first.

692
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,376
I have a plan, Groggy.

693
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,384
What?

694
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,428
Let's just wait, Groggy.

695
01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:15,347
They'll be back here.

696
01:54:18,476 --> 01:54:21,103
And this way, there'll be two of us.

697
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:24,022
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.

698
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:25,482
Who? They?

699
01:54:30,446 --> 01:54:33,532
Are you sure of that, Indio?
That they haven't?

700
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:38,704
I thought something different.

701
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:43,500
You made the boys ride on out
to make sure they're both killed and fast.

702
01:54:44,627 --> 01:54:47,546
I'm not as dumb as the rest of them, Indio.

703
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:50,173
There was no help for it.

704
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:24,977
Go on.

705
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,336
That watch,

706
01:58:15,838 --> 01:58:18,632
it's been a long time that l wanted to ask.

707
01:58:20,218 --> 01:58:22,844
I can see that it means a lot to you, Indio.

708
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:24,012
Why?

709
01:59:57,106 --> 01:59:58,273
Indio!

710
02:00:01,194 --> 02:00:02,652
Listen to me!

711
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:06,698
This is Colonel Mortimer!

712
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:11,036
Douglas Mortimer!

713
02:00:13,289 --> 02:00:15,790
Does the name mean anything to you?

714
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:51,094
When the chimes end, pick up your gun.

715
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:54,681
Try and shoot me, Colonel.

716
02:01:56,767 --> 02:01:58,018
Just try.

717
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:56,469
Very careless of you, old man.

718
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:23,788
Try this.

719
02:04:31,547 --> 02:04:33,006
Now we start.

720
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:25,577
Bravo.

721
02:07:07,036 --> 02:07:09,621
There seems to be a family resemblance.

722
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:16,961
Here.

723
02:07:22,051 --> 02:07:24,677
Naturally, between brother and sister.

724
02:07:25,387 --> 02:07:26,596
My gun.

725
02:07:32,019 --> 02:07:35,313
My boy, you've become rich.

726
02:07:36,774 --> 02:07:39,400
You mean we've become rich, old man.

727
02:07:39,485 --> 02:07:42,487
No, it's all for you. I think you deserve it.

728
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:45,615
What about our partnership?

729
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:49,786
Maybe next time.

730
02:08:32,579 --> 02:08:35,707
10,000, 12,000,

731
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:38,000
15,

732
02:08:39,795 --> 02:08:41,462
16,

733
02:08:41,797 --> 02:08:43,089
17,

734
02:08:43,924 --> 02:08:45,591
22...

735
02:08:46,552 --> 02:08:47,635
22.

736
02:08:53,934 --> 02:08:54,976
27.

737
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:59,355
Any trouble, boy?

738
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,817
No, old man.

739
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:07,321
Thought l was having trouble
with my adding.

740
02:09:08,157 --> 02:09:09,907
It's all right now.
