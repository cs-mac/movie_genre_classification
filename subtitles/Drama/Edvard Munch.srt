Karlemann looked at them

66

- Yes, a little.

81

Open wide and I'll have a look.

82
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:10,827
The first symptoms are fatigue
and poor appetite,

83
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:15,109
an evening temperature
and a hint of a cold.

84
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:19,708
When the disease develops,
one's temperature rises

85
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,105
and the cold grows worse.

86

- The unfortunate wretches go mad.
- This applies to everyone.

96

All evil can be traced
to Christianity.

112

Christianity suppresses

Of course there's evil but

00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:37,750
<i>"and accompanied me all my life."</i>

155
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,912
We can sit by the fire
until the water gets hot

156
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,031
before you go to bed.

157
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:06,708
My sister Sophie

158
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:10,548
also died from tuberculosis.

159
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,905
She was 15 years of age.

160
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:18,307
"And I saw the dead
stand before the throne"

161
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:23,748
"and books were opened.
The Book of Life was opened"

162
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:29,308
"and the dead were judged
in accordance with their deeds"

163
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:35,466
"and the sea gave up its dead..."

164
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:40,306
My sister Laura was very talented.

165
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:46,305
She learned languages
and mathematics effortlessly.

166
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:50,547
She got honours in Latin.

167
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:57,314
But she was born with a difficult
and nervous disposition

168
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:58,663
so she could never

169
00:14:58,795 --> 00:15:01,025
make use of her education.

170
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:06,343
It's so dreary at home!
What did you do when you were young?

171
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:11,465
That doesn't concern you.
At any rate I wasn't out and about.

172
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,950
<i>Munch is to say later of his father:</i>

173
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,629
<i>"When anxiety did not possess him..."</i>

174
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,385
<i>"he would joke and play with us
like a child."</i>

175
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:27,709
<i>"When he punished us, he could be
almost insane in his violence."</i>

176
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:33,304
You get no inspiration from
those people. And that woman...

177
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:37,104
It would've turned out better
if I hadn't been scolded at home.

178
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:40,274
Edvard, I want to talk to you.

179
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:43,392
Your aunt said that a plate
was broken.

180
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,154
Was it Peter Andreas?

181
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,914
- No, it was Laura.
- No, it was Edvard.

182
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:52,354
The Bible says that you're punished!
Onan was punished.

183
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:54,751
It also says that man

184
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:56,633
must replenish the earth.

185
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:59,070
One doesn't do that
by masturbating!

186
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:03,746
That was nice and warm, wasn't it?

187
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:09,749
Now we'll wash our ears.

188
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,343
<i>Two brothers and three sisters</i>

189
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:23,309
<i>watching each other
grow into puberty</i>

190
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,910
<i>tended over by their aunt Karen</i>

191
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:29,870
<i>who, remaining unmarried,
has devoted her life</i>

192
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:33,305
<i>to raising the children
of her dead sister.</i>

193
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:38,992
Half of the adults
in this country are women.

194
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:44,984
They are also citizens but
they are placed under guardianship

195
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:49,194
and are tyrannized
by men and by society

196
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,984
emotionally, legally and economically.

197
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:59,745
I must make sure that
there aren't too many bills at once.

198
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:05,905
In the workplaces where we're
admitted, industries and schools,

199
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:11,513
we get one-third of the wages
men get for the same work.

200
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:26,074
<i>Using his reﬂection in a mirror</i>

201
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:31,304
<i>4 years ago Edvard Munch painted
the first of his self-portraits.</i>

202
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,344
<i>"These self-trials
from the difficult years."</i>

203
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:48,029
What sort of work do they do?

204
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:55,909
They work at putting together
matchboxes.

205
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:06,674
Their fingers are burned
by the phosphorus.

206
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:14,634
<i>Many of Norway's older painters
have now returned from Europe.</i>

207
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:17,309
<i>Some have set up informal academies</i>

208
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,985
<i>such as Christian Krohg, age 32</i>

209
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:25,109
<i>whose own canvases,
showing a direct concern for life</i>

210
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:28,983
<i>both in his awn middle-class milieu
and in the poorer class</i>

211
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:32,949
<i>have already pioneered "naturalism"
in Norwegian art.</i>

212
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,993
How much do they earn?

213
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,953
One crown a day.

214
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:42,590
How old are the children?

215
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:47,069
The oldest is 14.
The youngest girl is 12.

216
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:53,188
The most important thing in art

217
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,994
is its own means, like colour.

218
00:18:56,155 --> 00:19:00,307
It doesn't matter what you paint.
You can paint horse dung.

219
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,991
- Then you paint for yourself?
- The colour must be a joy to see.

220
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:10,345
<i>Fritz Thaulow,
leading Naturalist painter,</i>

221
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:15,148
<i>whose work reﬂects
the opposing Norwegian school of art.</i>

222
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:19,149
<i>Such painters as Thaulow, Gerhard Munthe
and Christian Skredsvig.</i>

223
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:23,624
<i>Hans Heyerdahl, Erik Werenskiold
and Harriet Backer</i>

224
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:27,749
<i>tend to express a feeling for
the countryside and for people</i>

225
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:32,674
<i>but often from a less political
and more personal viewpoint.</i>

226
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,304
Who wants to look at horse dung?

227
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:40,664
The paint can be
an aesthetic pleasure for you.

228
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:46,594
But the public need not regard it
as an aesthetic pleasure.

229
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,309
He must concentrate on art!

230
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:54,825
People must undergo
an experience looking at art.

231
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,311
But which people?
The bourgeoisie.

232
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:02,313
They can afford

233
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:04,631
to buy works of art.

234
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:09,034
But what about those
who queue for food?

235
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:18,307
<i>For Edvard Munch
the artistic problem lies deeper:</i>

236
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:25,104
<i>somehow to express the tension
growing in himself and in his family.</i>

237
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:40,147
"To Norway, giants' native land
Let's drink this toast of honour."

238
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:44,225
<i>In answer to the
10 commandments of Christianity</i>

239
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:48,310
<i>the Boheme, seen here
singing a patriotic sang</i>

240
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,150
<i>has published nine of its own.</i>

241
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:53,985
<i>Amongst these, the requirements</i>

242
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:56,709
<i>to never borrow less than 5 krone!</i>

243
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:59,110
<i>To never wear celluloid cuffs</i>

244
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,911
<i>to never fail to make a scandal
in the Kristiania theatre</i>

245
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:04,753
<i>to never regret</i>

246
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,184
<i>to sever all family bonds</i>

247
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:09,751
<i>and to take one's own life.</i>

248
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,906
There has been a lot of illness

249
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,349
and death in our family.

250
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:21,149
Mamma died of tuberculosis
when she was 30 years old

251
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:28,144
and Granny died of the same disease
when she was 36.

252
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:36,028
I have a dream of founding
a school for young women

253
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,709
who are morally confined.

254
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,905
Just look at the bourgeoisie

255
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:46,114
and all the middle-class girls
that suffer from anemia.

256
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:53,230
It's a good cause. I mean...
founding a school for them

257
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:59,115
and teaching them to develop
their feeling for love.

258
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:02,348
They can become capable of feeling.

259
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:12,706
<i>The Christian names of the woman
sitting to the night of Edvard Munch</i>

260
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:15,907
<i>are Andrea Fredrikke Emilie.</i>

261
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,071
<i>She is nicknamed "Millie".</i>

262
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,875
<i>Her age is 24.</i>

263
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:25,104
<i>For 3 years she has been married
to a Kristiania city doctor</i>

264
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:28,073
<i>who is 9 years her senior in age.</i>

265
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,071
<i>She has no children.</i>

266
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:49,515
All the virtuous little misses

267
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:53,264
will trip down the Karl Johan.

268
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:59,104
<i>Jæger's vision is to set up
a special school</i>

269
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:03,114
<i>for the "prim young misses"
of middle-class Kristiania</i>

270
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:05,585
<i>educate them into proud women</i>

271
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:08,309
<i>who might walk freely
down the Karl Johan</i>

272
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:12,707
<i>with all the world knowing
that they lave and have lovers.</i>

273
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:16,032
<i>They would write
Boheme literature, open and frank</i>

274
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:18,993
<i>about their personal experiences.</i>

275
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:26,988
<i>Despite the somewhat bleaker reality
of the Karl Johan,</i>

276
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:31,188
<i>Hans Jæger is also planning to write
a highly personal account</i>

277
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:32,987
<i>of his own love life</i>

278
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:37,307
<i>with a frankness hitherto unknown
in Norwegian literature.</i>

279
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:41,344
<i>He urges Edvard Munch
to express himself in his work</i>

280
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,110
<i>with the same total frankness.</i>

281
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:50,228
His father walked back and forth.
He kept his hands clasped.

282
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:01,583
<i>Hans Jæger is himself
currently and publicly</i>

283
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:04,309
<i>having an affair
with a married woman.</i>

284
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:07,871
<i>Oda Lassen, age 24</i>

285
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:12,709
<i>a painter, whose husband
is a wood and ice-merchant</i>

286
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,866
<i>8 years her senior.</i>

287
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,785
I consider marriage

288
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:33,188
to be based on something which
is completely impossible for me.

289
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:41,307
One is obliged to love
another human being all one's life.

290
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:46,393
It seems utterly absurd.
No one can order me

291
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:50,594
to love someone
I have grown to hate.

292
00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:13,474
What do you think of
the Bohemians' conduct?

293
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:19,312
One might characterize
their conduct as follows:

294
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:24,514
I consider it to be
extremely unprepossessing

295
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:33,749
and a distinct danger for
certain easily inﬂuenced souls.

296
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:41,110
I'm not talking about prostitutes
but human beings who can love.

297
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:49,508
The only thing they seem capable of
is so-called free love.

298
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:53,347
But rabbits are capable of that too.

299
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:59,744
"I love you, love you.
Take me, kiss me, hold me and then"

300
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:05,150
"embrace me, hug me
so that I never breathe again."

301
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:08,069
<i>"Your kiss is so fiery tonight."</i>

302
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,630
"Fever takes you in command."

303
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:15,545
"Your tears run slowly down
and burn into my hand."

304
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:19,503
<i>Sigurd Bødtker,
student and poet.</i>

305
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:22,866
"Do you think that
I've tired of you?"

306
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:27,273
"Oh no! Smile happily
as you did before."

307
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:29,905
"Stay with me tonight."

308
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:33,909
"Let my arm
curl close about your waist."

309
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:40,672
How were sexual matters

310
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:42,871
dealt with in your home?

311
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,027
They weren't dealt with at all.

312
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:49,466
Everything was kept secret
around me.

313
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:54,626
I understood nothing
until it was too late.

314
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:14,106
<i>Hans Jæger has told Munch
that the human function of sex</i>

315
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:18,874
<i>is the most important
single process known to man.</i>

316
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:23,745
<i>It is a source of pleasure,
a wave of sweetness and warmth</i>

317
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:27,834
<i>through which man is elevated
and made less lonely.</i>

318
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:34,311
In her testament, Mamma asked
us to be good

319
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:38,470
and to love Jesus.

320
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:42,308
I try to obey my lusts.

321
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:45,872
We have only one life and

322
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:50,870
we must develop our ability
to feel and to love.

323
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:56,873
<i>The final passage of Jæger's book
details the burial of its hero:</i>

324
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:03,189
<i>"Then, they have all vanished
and Jarman lies alone again"</i>

325
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:09,665
<i>"there in the desolate cemetery and
rots under his cover of ﬂowers."</i>

326
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:13,873
Sophie, shall we sing
a Christmas carol?

327
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:32,315
<i>"And suddenly something opened"</i>

328
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:36,713
<i>"and we could see far,
far into heaven"</i>

329
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:41,033
<i>"and saw angels ﬂoat,
quietly smiling."</i>

330
00:28:55,875 --> 00:29:02,872
Four of Granny's eight children
died before they were 16.

331
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:11,864
The Kristiania Bohemians say,
"Thou shalt

332
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:15,147
take thine own life."
What are your views on that?

333
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,671
I think it is wrong.

334
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:26,907
We don't have a right to throw away
the lives God has given us.

335
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:32,874
They should be used for Him
and our lives do have a meaning.

336
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,390
Tell us about his work.

337
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:50,151
Edvard Munch is a talented
young painter.

338
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:53,387
But he's more interested

339
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:57,707
in painting light and shadow
than social conditions.

340
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:04,835
<i>In 1884 Edvard Munch paints
this study of a servant girl</i>

341
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:09,830
<i>partly dressed, seated on the edge
of a rumpled bed.</i>

342
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:14,594
<i>The sunlight dissolves
the colours and contours.</i>

343
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:17,914
<i>There is a sense of softness</i>

344
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:20,105
<i>what Munch is to cal! Later</i>

345
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:24,632
<i>his "nervous dissolving
treatment of colour."</i>

346
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:09,629
What sort of a person is he?

347
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:16,750
Very reticent, almost
aristocratically so

348
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:22,466
which creates a distance
to the other members of the group.

349
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:26,385
<i>Amongst the colleagues
of Edvard Munch...</i>

350
00:31:27,115 --> 00:31:28,946
<i>are Carl Nordberg.</i> ..

351
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:32,311
<i>Andreas Singdahlsen.</i> ..

352
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:34,713
<i>Halfdan Strøm...</i>

353
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,706
<i>and Thorvald Torgersen.</i>

354
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,310
<i>And Jørgen Sørensen</i>

355
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,910
<i>crippled since the age of seven</i>

356
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:46,268
<i>who is to die in his early 30's.</i>

357
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:51,225
We must take part in

358
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:54,268
what is happening around us

359
00:31:54,435 --> 00:32:00,067
and, what with poverty and need
and children who have to work,

360
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:03,426
we must join forces with the people

361
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,865
not with the bourgeoisie.

362
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:09,869
Painters mustn't be led astray
by new ideas...

363
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:10,865
My Lord!

364
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:13,993
...but sacrifice themselves
for their painting.

365
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,264
Painting?

366
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:22,024
Yes, but his painting emerges
from his own person.

367
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,909
He is the one who paints.

368
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:29,869
So art must express
the subjective view

369
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,948
of the artist on reality.

370
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:42,307
<i>In 1884, Edvard Munch begins work
on a canvas of his younger sister</i>

371
00:32:42,915 --> 00:32:46,624
<i>a portrait that illuminates
her face and her hands.</i>

372
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:50,312
<i>The remainder of her body
is shrouded in darkness.</i>

373
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:54,273
<i>There is no movement
save for the tension</i>

374
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:58,031
<i>in the slight raising
of the left hand.</i>

375
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:05,828
Edvard, my brother,

376
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:10,153
almost died too
from the same disease.

377
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:14,705
Lord God, I beg you...

378
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:20,113
<i>The near-death of 13 year-old
Edvard Munch</i>

379
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:22,191
<i>from a pulmonary haemorrhage</i>

380
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:26,826
<i>took place on Christmas Day, 1875.</i>

381
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:31,190
Has all the suffering

382
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:35,069
in your family affected your faith?

383
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:41,430
I don't think it's for me
to interfere in God's will.

384
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:47,432
He loves us and we must be grateful.

385
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:22,986
"Our Father which art in heaven."

386
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,834
"Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come."

387
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:33,188
"Thy will be done in earth
As it is in heaven."

388
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:36,591
<i>"A strange man,
dressed all in black"</i>

389
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:39,270
<i>"stood at the foot of the bed
and prayed."</i>

390
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,947
<i>"The air was heavy and black."</i>

391
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:46,313
Munch's family is puritan.

392
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:49,951
Everyone who's seen
his father knows that.

393
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:53,028
When he's with us

394
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:57,154
he has to go home
for family evening prayer!

395
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:18,108
"Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil."

396
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:23,310
"For Thine is the kingdom
The power and the glory."

397
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,188
"For ever."

398
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:27,030
"Amen."

399
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:57,307
- Have you met his family?
- I've not seen him pray either.

400
00:35:57,475 --> 00:35:59,352
He sits there like a monk!

401
00:36:29,515 --> 00:36:33,554
It was distressing
for the older children

402
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:38,344
to see so much illness
and death.

403
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,468
<i>Are you sick?</i>

404
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:52,587
"If anyone worships
the beast's image"

405
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:56,225
"and receives a mark
on his forehead or hand"

406
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:59,707
"he shall drink
the wine of God's wrath"

407
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:02,827
"poured unmixed into
the cup of his anger"

408
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:08,063
"and he shall be tormented
in the presence of the holy angels."

409
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:16,631
To be free on Sundays I have to work
17 to 18 hours the other days.

410
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,274
It's hard work.

411
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:22,065
Some of my friends,
after working hours,

412
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:27,269
make so little that they often
take to the streets.

413
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:33,710
<i>The prostitutes of Kristiania</i>

414
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,668
<i>many of them from the district
known as "Vika"</i>

415
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,315
<i>are legalized
into a public institution</i>

416
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:43,104
<i>under the control
of the police health authorities.</i>

417
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:47,389
Look at prostitution
in Kristiania today.

418
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:53,752
According to Christian morals
there is no prostitution today.

419
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:58,784
It's typical that prostitution
is controlled by the police.

420
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:04,114
But you're for making people
live on prostitution.

421
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:08,666
No. In my society there is
no room for prostitution.

422
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:14,671
<i>There are 300 police officers
in the city of Kristiania.</i>

423
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:19,630
<i>Amongst their principal duties,
the control of venereal disease.</i>

424
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:25,032
It's the bourgeoisie
who gain from prostitution.

425
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:29,794
Yet bourgeois morals
do not allow it to exist:

426
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:33,027
"Thou shalt not commit adultery."

427
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:36,512
What are your views on marriage?

428
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,503
In my opinion

429
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:46,473
marriage is an incalculably
important and necessary institution

430
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:51,714
which undoubtedly
forms the foundation

431
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:56,113
of our social and cultural structure.

432
00:38:57,075 --> 00:39:04,709
Without marriage, rootless
and chaotic conditions would arise

433
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:08,230
which in turn, I fear,

434
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:13,273
might easily lead to anarchy.

435
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:20,431
In brief, if we want
to maintain peace and order,

436
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:25,823
it is essential to support
and expand our institutions.

437
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:39,827
The way society is today,
if one marries and has a wife,

438
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:44,147
she is just as prostituted
as "the girls from Viken".

439
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:51,665
<i>Once every week each prostitute must
report to the police for inspection.</i>

440
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,103
Sit there.

441
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:00,310
<i>The year 1884.</i>

442
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:06,104
<i>An American inventor called Maxim
develops the machine gun</i>

443
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:09,468
<i>and the United States receives
Pear! Harbor</i>

444
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,586
<i>as a Pacific naval base.</i>

445
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:18,305
Those who are prostituted
are excluded from society

446
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:21,714
by the same people...

447
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,308
Lean back.

448
00:40:23,435 --> 00:40:25,949
...who've put them
in that situation.

449
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,669
That's the bourgeoisie's
love of humanity.

450
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:36,514
A little wider.
Raise your feet higher.

451
00:40:47,475 --> 00:40:50,785
- Name and address.
- Line Pedersen.

452
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:53,668
When I ask for your name,
I want your surname first.

453
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:56,667
- Pedersen.
- Name...

454
00:40:58,395 --> 00:40:59,271
Pedersen.

455
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:04,868
Because of my illness,
I'm grateful for the girls in Viken

456
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:11,508
but I don't use them any more
than Mr Average uses his wife.

457
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:15,033
To me marriage
is legal prostitution.

458
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,153
You can go now.

459
00:41:20,435 --> 00:41:23,029
I assume the present assembly

460
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:25,908
is well aware of who it is

461
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:30,831
uses prostitutes:
the bourgeoisie and the police.

462
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:08,707
Once, when Grandfather came
home from a business trip,

463
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:13,312
he found Granny behind
a screen together with

464
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:15,506
three dead children.

465
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:24,630
<i>When Edvard Munch first shows
his completed painting, Inger in Black</i>

466
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:29,707
<i>the conservative press
in Kristiania refer to...</i>

467
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:32,827
<i>"his almost frighteningly
ugly portrait"</i>

468
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:34,588
<i>"of a lady in black"</i>

469
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:39,783
<i>thus beginning a critical assault
on his work</i>

470
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:44,034
<i>that is to last
for at least 15 years.</i>

471
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:54,225
<i>In May 1885,
Edvard Munch visits Paris.</i>

472
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,305
<i>For the first time in his life,
he comes</i>

473
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:01,190
<i>face to face with
full-size classical art.</i>

474
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:03,829
<i>He sees Velasquez and Rembrandt</i>

475
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:05,389
<i>and Manet.</i>

476
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:27,071
<i>Three weeks later,
Munch returns to Norway</i>

477
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:30,705
<i>and shortly afterwards
takes a boat with his family</i>

478
00:43:30,995 --> 00:43:35,352
<i>down the Kristiania fjord
to the little village of Bone.</i>

479
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:57,343
Hello.

480
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:02,594
You live quite close to here?
Then we're neighbours.

481
00:44:03,355 --> 00:44:07,143
- Will you visit me one day?
- I'd like to.

482
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:11,269
Some ladies are visiting today.
Perhaps tomorrow?

483
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:20,745
<i>In his diaries, Edvard Munch
refers to this woman</i>

484
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:23,105
<i>as "Mrs Heiberg".</i>

485
00:44:23,355 --> 00:44:25,994
<i>It is not her real name.</i>

486
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:30,187
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes, I am hungry.

487
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,708
Beautiful landscape here.

488
00:44:49,515 --> 00:44:50,789
It's so blue.

489
00:44:58,835 --> 00:45:01,144
<i>The year 1885.</i>

490
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:04,269
<i>Genera! Gordon dies at Khartoum.</i>

491
00:45:04,355 --> 00:45:06,994
<i>Serbia invades Bulgaria</i>

492
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:09,834
<i>the British annex Bechuanaland.</i>

493
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,908
<i>Karl Marx writes
volume two of Das Kapital</i>

494
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:20,270
<i>and the future General Patton
and D. H. Lawrence are born.</i>

495
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:29,671
All the things he'd wanted to say!
He felt awkward and afraid.

496
00:45:31,915 --> 00:45:37,547
They walked on in silence.
His cheeks burned.

497
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:52,105
<i>Later in his life, Edvard Munch
is to express a deep disillusionment</i>

498
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:56,031
<i>that all his father could do,
as a doctor</i>

499
00:45:56,275 --> 00:46:00,234
<i>for his dying mother and
his dying sister and for himself</i>

500
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,752
<i>was to put his hands together
and pray.</i>

501
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:20,908
She spent time in bed

502
00:46:23,675 --> 00:46:25,711
coughing into a handkerchief.

503
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:29,149
Did blood come this time too?

504
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:55,865
- I kissed you. Are you angry?
- No.

505
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:01,471
Kissed your neck...

506
00:47:03,235 --> 00:47:06,068
If you're angry, you can beat me.

507
00:47:08,555 --> 00:47:10,546
I'm not angry.

508
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:17,706
Perhaps you'll let me
kiss your mouth?

509
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:35,632
I'm in a fortunate position,
married with no children.

510
00:47:42,155 --> 00:47:46,990
One is free when one is married
and has no children.

511
00:47:48,795 --> 00:47:51,389
But what about your husband?

512
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:54,667
He's nice. He lets me do
as I please.

513
00:47:58,915 --> 00:48:02,908
- Is he as nice as that?
- He's awfully nice.

514
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:09,713
I probably hurt him
but I can't help it. I have to.

515
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:22,506
Stand still like that.
Let me see you.

516
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:26,508
How picturesque
you are in this light.

517
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:38,228
<i>I'm so restless at night.</i>
I <i>can't sleep.</i>

518
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:41,110
I have such dreadful dreams.

519
00:48:42,835 --> 00:48:46,828
I sleepwalk. I have such
a longing to come to you.

520
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:56,152
I do so like the dark.
I can't stand the light.

521
00:48:57,755 --> 00:49:01,794
It should be like tonight.
So mysterious.

522
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:17,188
I could do the most awful things
in the dark. Anything.

523
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:25,111
<i>Upon his return to Kristiania.</i>

524
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:28,308
<i>Edvard Munch pays
his first social cal!</i>

525
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,945
<i>On the home of Mrs Heiberg.</i>

526
00:49:35,195 --> 00:49:37,345
He looked at the worn steps.

527
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:41,710
He remembered all
he had heard about her,

528
00:49:42,075 --> 00:49:47,752
all the lovers who had passed here
and quarreled with her husband.

529
00:49:53,675 --> 00:49:55,950
He looked well, he thought.

530
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:02,625
It was so heavy and dark
and subdued.

531
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:11,625
He'd heard she usually lay
on the couch all morning.

532
00:50:12,995 --> 00:50:15,828
The light in here was favourable.

533
00:50:25,635 --> 00:50:30,470
Have you seen how the hair
grows out of his ears?

534
00:50:33,995 --> 00:50:35,826
Now he felt shy.

535
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:40,470
He could find nothing to say.

536
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:47,829
When they were near he felt
that she waited for him

537
00:50:47,995 --> 00:50:50,225
to throw his arms about her.

538
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:55,464
We got these last spring.
They were rather expensive.

539
00:50:58,835 --> 00:51:01,986
But he thought it was...
he felt cold.

540
00:51:04,515 --> 00:51:06,551
<i>It was the same shyness.</i>

541
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:10,793
He longed to be out
in the fresh air.

542
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:14,504
This is where my husband works.
He's very orderly.

543
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:17,548
Daddy, what I'm spitting up
is so dark.

544
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:20,024
Everything has its place.

545
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:23,865
I made that for him.

546
00:51:26,475 --> 00:51:29,194
- Shall we go out?
- No, I can't.

547
00:51:30,515 --> 00:51:32,471
Perhaps this evening?

548
00:51:34,755 --> 00:51:36,154
It's blood, Daddy.

549
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:37,664
I don't want to!

550
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:42,586
He stroked his head.
Don't be afraid, my son.

551
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:49,669
I don't want to!

552
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:52,747
What? Don't you want to?
Come here.

553
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:54,666
Are you crazy?

554
00:51:55,515 --> 00:51:58,029
Don't be so frightened.

555
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:02,313
What a wretched idiot you are.

556
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:04,951
A cowardly wretch!

557
00:52:12,555 --> 00:52:17,390
Why are you so set on
becoming a great painter?

558
00:52:19,395 --> 00:52:24,025
You're going to die anyway.
Then you'll be gone.

559
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:33,112
<i>Using his aunt and a young girl
called Betsy as models.</i>

560
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:35,351
<i>Edvard Munch begins work
on a canvas measuring</i>

561
00:52:35,835 --> 00:52:42,104
<i>119.5 cm by 118.5 cm.</i>

562
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:45,149
<i>The death of his sister Sophie.</i>

563
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:47,550
How quiet it is in the forest.

564
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:57,311
Imagine living here, not alone
but with someone else.

565
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,509
It's so mysterious here.

566
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:56,109
Shouldn't he sit a little closer?

567
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:02,990
But he remained where he was,
staring at Mrs Heiberg.

568
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:06,991
At table Petra said,

569
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,826
"I saw you talk to Mrs Heiberg."

570
00:54:10,675 --> 00:54:12,711
"Wasn't it Mrs Heiberg?"

571
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,231
"Yes," he said carelessly
and reddened.

572
00:54:18,235 --> 00:54:23,355
"She looks dull," his father said.
"She behaves badly to her husband."

573
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,831
People talk so much.

574
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:38,466
What a ridiculous dream

575
00:54:38,595 --> 00:54:40,790
it has been all these years.

576
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:45,790
A great painter...
It's better than being a doctor.

577
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:50,550
But, compared to a king, it's nothing.

578
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:55,264
And a king is no more
than a tiny microbe.

579
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:59,268
<i>Munch now begins to add
layer upon layer of texture</i>

580
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:03,105
<i>with brush, palette knife
and even kitchen blade.</i>

581
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:09,111
I've started work on
a few canvases

582
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:12,547
and there is one of them I think

583
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:15,354
I can get something out of.

584
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:17,473
I think it is going to be

585
00:55:17,595 --> 00:55:23,670
a good painting. I'm already
very pleased with it.

586
00:55:27,515 --> 00:55:30,348
I've been thinking of you.

587
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:39,228
In the colours especially,
I can develop myself.

588
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:46,145
It's something new.
As I said, I think it will be good.

589
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:52,114
Is something troubling you?

590
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:56,872
I do have a lot on my mind.
I have worries too.

591
00:55:57,995 --> 00:56:00,429
I have my work to think of.

592
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:16,428
The beautiful pale face
with its soft full mouth,

593
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:20,944
half closed eyes and throat.

594
00:56:23,395 --> 00:56:25,147
He had to own it again,

595
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:29,354
to look into those eyes,
so often hard.

596
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:39,626
Sophie and Edvard...

597
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:46,508
I shall soon be leaving you

598
00:56:49,595 --> 00:56:54,953
and I'm so afraid of what
will happen to our family.

599
00:57:00,395 --> 00:57:03,228
That's why I want to talk to you

600
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:07,428
and I hope you can promise me

601
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:13,825
to take care of
Laura, Andreas and Inger

602
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:19,465
so that I can go to heaven
with an easy mind.

603
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:23,307
- Will you promise me, Sophie?
- Yes, Mamma.

604
00:57:26,115 --> 00:57:29,346
- Will you promise me, Edvard?
- Yes, Mamma.

605
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:09,744
I feel you in here very strongly.

606
00:58:12,995 --> 00:58:16,624
- Have you had physical relationships?
- Many.

607
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:21,233
Do you feel that you've fulfilled
yourself as a human being?

608
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:26,630
I try. But there are
many obstacles.

609
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:32,544
- Do you achieve satisfaction?
- Now but not before.

610
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:37,224
When one is born one knows nothing.

611
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:41,430
One is surrounded by adults
one looks up to,

612
00:58:41,675 --> 00:58:44,985
adults full of words and prejudices.

613
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:51,145
Particularly in my family
which is very bourgeois.

614
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:54,507
I was filled with lots
of admonitions.

615
00:58:54,675 --> 00:58:57,109
You mustn't do this. Do that.

616
00:59:00,075 --> 00:59:03,511
Things that I wanted to do

617
00:59:03,635 --> 00:59:06,911
were considered wrong
and conﬂicts arose.

618
00:59:12,955 --> 00:59:16,994
I've been thinking of you all night.
I haven't slept.

619
00:59:27,755 --> 00:59:29,586
A plate was broken today.

620
00:59:29,715 --> 00:59:30,943
Was it you?

621
00:59:31,155 --> 00:59:34,670
- No, it was Sophie.
- Sophie, did you do it?

622
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:36,269
No. Edvard.

623
00:59:42,755 --> 00:59:45,792
- Sophie, was it you?
- No. Edvard.

624
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:51,829
<i>In</i> Jæger's <i>book</i>
'From The Kristiania Boheme'

625
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:55,471
<i>he describes a scene
with a 16 year-old girl</i>

626
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:57,711
<i>whom he has met on the street.</i>

627
00:59:57,835 --> 01:00:00,303
"I went down on my knees"

628
01:00:00,715 --> 01:00:04,913
"and stretched my hands
with my gaze resting on her eyes."

629
01:00:05,755 --> 01:00:09,794
"Her eyes retained
their shy expression."

630
01:00:09,955 --> 01:00:13,470
"Then at once they grew
large and tender."

631
01:00:13,675 --> 01:00:17,634
"And she drew me up to her,
put her arms about me"

632
01:00:17,795 --> 01:00:21,629
"and rested her head
against my shoulders."

633
01:00:21,995 --> 01:00:26,147
"I leaned my head against hers
and kissed her black hair."

634
01:00:56,315 --> 01:00:58,749
<i>Munch writes in his diary:</i>

635
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:02,588
<i>"They were lying beside each other."</i>

636
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:05,070
<i>"They didn't talk much."</i>

637
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:06,874
<i>“Poor you', she said</i>

638
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:12,745
<i>"and stroked his wet hair
slowly... slowly."</i>

639
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:19,394
"She lay there with her head back
and her beautiful throat exposed."

640
01:01:19,595 --> 01:01:22,587
"I kissed it and wanted
to carry her to the bed."

641
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:25,110
"But the touch of her soft limbs"

642
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:28,307
"took all strength from my arms."

643
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:33,306
<i>"She lay down on him."</i>

644
01:01:34,235 --> 01:01:37,147
<i>"The moment again when everything
ceased to exist."</i>

645
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:40,705
<i>"Again and again."</i>

646
01:01:44,395 --> 01:01:49,071
And that married woman:
you shouldn't be seen with her.

647
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:56,032
Have you got something
besides your work to think of?

648
01:01:57,275 --> 01:02:01,666
I feel much calmer.
I sleep at night too.

649
01:02:03,555 --> 01:02:04,988
That's fine.

650
01:02:15,995 --> 01:02:18,429
You know that I need you.

651
01:02:31,755 --> 01:02:34,189
I'm so happy you came.

652
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,105
What wonderful lips you have.

653
01:02:57,755 --> 01:03:02,112
<i>Munch writes in his diaries
of making appointments to meet.</i>

654
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:03,953
<i>Mrs Heiberg on the Karl Johan</i>

655
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:09,314
<i>only to have her pass him by with
her husband or a friend on her arm.</i>

656
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:13,988
<i>Exactly who began to break
the appointments first is not known</i>

657
01:03:14,115 --> 01:03:15,992
<i>but Munch writes of retaliating</i>

658
01:03:16,115 --> 01:03:19,903
<i>by ignoring Mrs Heiberg
when they next meet.</i>

659
01:03:20,115 --> 01:03:24,154
I waited for half an hour
on the Karl Johan.

660
01:03:26,355 --> 01:03:28,949
And when at last she came

661
01:03:29,195 --> 01:03:31,629
she simply walked past.

662
01:03:32,755 --> 01:03:35,189
She scarcely looked at me.

663
01:03:41,635 --> 01:03:45,469
It's a good thing
I don't like her any more.

664
01:03:45,675 --> 01:03:50,226
<i>At about this same period,
Oda Lasson has told Hans Jæger</i>

665
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:55,025
<i>that she is becoming emotionally
involved with Christian Krohg.</i>

666
01:03:58,595 --> 01:04:02,634
When I try to live according to
what is right for me

667
01:04:02,995 --> 01:04:08,194
and try to find my freedom
and live according to my rules,

668
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:14,634
the only thing the bourgeoisie
are interested in

669
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:17,389
is how many love affairs I have.

670
01:04:19,115 --> 01:04:25,463
Only my friends look at
and talk about what I do...

671
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:28,869
talk about my paintings.

672
01:04:32,395 --> 01:04:36,832
She talked about how
he had not greeted her on the street,

673
01:04:37,275 --> 01:04:40,506
how she was just as good
as other ladies.

674
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:44,664
Look at Mrs Pettersen who
went with the lieutenant to Paris.

675
01:04:45,235 --> 01:04:49,228
It made him shudder to hear
of her affection.

676
01:04:57,315 --> 01:04:59,112
<i>At first, Munch adds</i>

677
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:01,954
<i>domestic details to the periphery
of the painting</i>

678
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:04,310
<i>such as a chair, a glass, a bottle,</i>

679
01:05:04,395 --> 01:05:07,114
<i>a ﬂowerpot on a window
and curtains.</i>

680
01:05:07,915 --> 01:05:10,907
<i>Then, slowly, over the months</i>

681
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:13,909
<i>he begins to remove these details</i>

682
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:17,994
<i>concentrating more and more
on the head of his sister.</i>

683
01:05:18,675 --> 01:05:22,304
<i>Munch's affair with Mrs Heiberg
is already deteriorating.</i>

684
01:05:23,195 --> 01:05:28,986
<i>He takes the hand of his sister and
paints it in broad and vague strokes</i>

685
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:32,949
<i>blurring out its ability
for human contact.</i>

686
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:39,954
Her hand was large and coarse.
She placed her cheek against his.

687
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:42,704
He turned his head away

688
01:05:42,915 --> 01:05:45,145
so their mouths didn't meet.

689
01:05:45,315 --> 01:05:47,112
She was too repulsive.

690
01:05:52,675 --> 01:05:54,905
I'm so glad you came.

691
01:05:56,235 --> 01:05:58,430
I saw you outwith another man.

692
01:05:59,075 --> 01:06:00,064
Just a friend.

693
01:06:00,275 --> 01:06:01,754
Just a friend?

694
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:09,189
I'd been waiting half an hour
and you walked straight past!

695
01:06:09,635 --> 01:06:12,388
I was with Lt. Lund.

696
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,870
He's just a friend.

697
01:06:16,115 --> 01:06:17,787
Don't shout.

698
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:20,671
Everybody can hear.

699
01:06:21,955 --> 01:06:27,905
Damn it, I have hundreds of things
to think of. This can't go on!

700
01:06:28,795 --> 01:06:32,105
I waited for more than half an hour!

701
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:35,228
- Who was it?
- The banker.

702
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:42,186
<i>The year 1886.</i>

703
01:06:42,755 --> 01:06:45,349
<i>The French government
presents the United States</i>

704
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:47,671
<i>with the Statue Of Liberty</i>

705
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:53,115
<i>and equips its own army with
the Lebel smokeless powder riﬂe.</i>

706
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:30,703
Perhaps if I tell her
that it's all my fault...

707
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:35,112
Perhaps then she'll like me...

708
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:40,267
If I tell her I could die for her...

709
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:43,184
This is nothing to laugh at!

710
01:08:09,115 --> 01:08:11,504
Don't take it so much to heart.

711
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:17,424
There are plenty of women
with her qualities.

712
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:22,711
I find it difficult to know
what life I should lead.

713
01:08:23,275 --> 01:08:28,713
Even if I try to live freely
with men, they don't change.

714
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:32,904
They consider that
a woman should behave

715
01:08:33,435 --> 01:08:38,031
in such-and-such a way,
which I can't do.

716
01:08:53,555 --> 01:08:55,227
It's long past midnight

717
01:08:57,315 --> 01:09:00,352
and you're out every evening.

718
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,108
Will you answer?

719
01:09:03,275 --> 01:09:05,345
- Don't push me!
- Are you drunk?

720
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:08,230
What do you do when you're out?

721
01:09:08,835 --> 01:09:11,030
He's just a friend.

722
01:09:12,155 --> 01:09:14,146
This can't go on!

723
01:09:17,435 --> 01:09:21,474
I feel that if ever
I am to find myself

724
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:25,184
I can't adapt myself
to their standards.

725
01:09:26,715 --> 01:09:31,869
Men I am with,
who say that they are free,

726
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:37,314
have beliefs too,
which obstruct my freedom.

727
01:09:38,155 --> 01:09:43,468
In fact I don't even know
what my freedom is.

728
01:09:43,715 --> 01:09:48,709
I can't take any more of this.
You know that!

729
01:09:52,595 --> 01:09:57,715
We mustn't speak to each other
like this. We mustn't.

730
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:02,786
You're a human being
in a society oppressed

731
01:10:02,955 --> 01:10:07,710
by standards and prejudices
in every direction.

732
01:10:08,075 --> 01:10:12,307
Painters can't take notice
of political programmes.

733
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:17,146
You have to paint something
as you see it.

734
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:23,227
You can't sit down
and paint details.

735
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:28,464
If you come from a bedroom
into the living room in the morning

736
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:32,714
and see everything
as if in a bluish light,

737
01:10:32,915 --> 01:10:35,554
even the darkest shadows,

738
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:40,188
that's how you should paint it.
As you see it.

739
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:49,074
Colour means a great deal.
Colour is the mainstay of painting.

740
01:10:49,675 --> 01:10:51,154
Mood as well.

741
01:11:25,475 --> 01:11:29,991
She let herself be drawn closer.
Right up against him.

742
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:36,749
He held her gently about the waist.
She reached up towards him.

743
01:11:39,155 --> 01:11:44,707
He felt a warm mouth against
his throat, a wet mouth against his

744
01:11:45,595 --> 01:11:48,029
and his mouth slipped in
towards hers.

745
01:11:56,795 --> 01:12:01,152
"A feeling of sweet impotence
poured over my shoulders"

746
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:04,154
"and ﬂowed through my limbs."

747
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:08,511
"I knelt and pressed her
tight against me"

748
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:12,833
"and kissed her uncovered throat
like one possessed."

749
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:20,153
<i>Haagen Ludwig Berg, an actor</i>

750
01:12:20,315 --> 01:12:23,148
<i>and a Lieutenant
in the part-time army.</i>

751
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:31,112
<i>Miss Drefsen, referred to by Munch
as "Miss Rocker"</i>

752
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:34,873
<i>whom he recently met at a carnival.</i>

753
01:12:35,955 --> 01:12:40,346
Something I don't understand
occurs again and again

754
01:12:41,035 --> 01:12:45,074
and that is that a relationship
starts strongly.

755
01:12:45,275 --> 01:12:47,709
And I know what passion is.

756
01:12:47,955 --> 01:12:52,392
I don't know what love is
but I know what passion is.

757
01:13:25,595 --> 01:13:29,110
The odd thing is that it
begins with the feeling

758
01:13:29,315 --> 01:13:30,873
that all is worthless

759
01:13:31,075 --> 01:13:33,714
without this one person.

760
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:48,826
We should not have spoken of it.

761
01:14:03,675 --> 01:14:08,908
And gradually, without you noticing
what is happening,

762
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:13,949
this person becomes
the one who holds you back.

763
01:14:17,155 --> 01:14:20,352
<i>Seeking now to de-emphasize
all unimportant details</i>

764
01:14:20,595 --> 01:14:22,631
<i>by blurring their images</i>

765
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:26,186
<i>struggling to eliminate
Mrs Heiberg from his mind</i>

766
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:30,749
<i>striving somehow to impart the
quiver and intensity of his feelings</i>

767
01:14:30,915 --> 01:14:33,827
<i>on to the raw surface
of his canvas</i>

768
01:14:33,995 --> 01:14:37,226
<i>seeking to awaken
a similar mood in the viewer.</i>

769
01:14:37,315 --> 01:14:41,069
<i>Munch works and reworks
the head of his sister</i>

770
01:14:41,155 --> 01:14:44,192
<i>detailing hair, eyes and mouth</i>

771
01:14:44,315 --> 01:14:48,228
<i>only to scrape the oil
from the canvas and begin again.</i>

772
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:52,228
<i>Using his knife, the back
of his brush, the point of a pencil.</i>

773
01:14:52,675 --> 01:14:56,987
<i>Munch scratches and scores
deep into the thick oil</i>

774
01:14:57,115 --> 01:15:01,745
<i>as he struggles to remember
and struggles to forget.</i>

775
01:15:04,675 --> 01:15:09,032
She looked into my eyes
with her fair hair

776
01:15:09,955 --> 01:15:12,628
and her pale, delicate skin.

777
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:17,391
We had a good time
when last we met, didn't we?

778
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:25,790
- I like you.
- You're sweet.

779
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,871
I've been thinking of you.

780
01:15:30,795 --> 01:15:32,433
The whole time.

781
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,788
- I like you too.
- How beautiful you are.

782
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:43,513
You're strange.

783
01:15:45,115 --> 01:15:49,791
But you're a fine person.
You're sweet.

784
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:55,347
What do you think of women

785
01:15:55,555 --> 01:15:58,672
who have extra-marital
relationships?

786
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:06,344
In my opinion a woman is
and ought to be a defenseless

787
01:16:07,675 --> 01:16:13,671
and beautiful little being,
both in body and soul,

788
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:17,424
who needs the protection
and security

789
01:16:17,675 --> 01:16:19,188
of a man.

790
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,992
If you think this is funny, it's...

791
01:16:28,915 --> 01:16:36,595
She smiled with her pale lips
and white teeth.

792
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:43,715
We suit each other, don't we?
You're so strange, Munch.

793
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:52,109
<i>In December 1885 Hans Jæger's book,
From The Kristiania Boheme</i>

794
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:55,870
<i>is confiscated within two hours
of its publication.</i>

795
01:16:56,635 --> 01:16:59,911
<i>Four months later Jæger
is found guilty of blasphemy</i>

796
01:17:00,035 --> 01:17:03,391
<i>and "violation of
modesty and morality".</i>

797
01:17:03,675 --> 01:17:05,950
<i>He is sentenced to 60 days in prison</i>

798
01:17:06,075 --> 01:17:08,987
<i>and the permanent banning
of his book.</i>

799
01:17:10,115 --> 01:17:14,870
<i>Aimar Sørensen, Minister of Justice
in the Liberal Government.</i>

800
01:17:14,995 --> 01:17:20,467
I received a copy of the book
from the police in Kristiania

801
01:17:21,155 --> 01:17:23,715
with certain parts underlined.

802
01:17:25,195 --> 01:17:30,872
I telegraphed at once to ask
all the police commissioners

803
01:17:31,275 --> 01:17:34,392
to stop publication of the book.

804
01:17:35,395 --> 01:17:40,833
In this part the lead character
in the book

805
01:17:41,075 --> 01:17:44,511
addresses himself
to a very young girl,

806
01:17:44,675 --> 01:17:48,224
so young that she could be
his daughter.

807
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:51,514
She is sitting on his knee.

808
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:57,103
This will give you an idea
of what it's about.

809
01:17:58,115 --> 01:18:02,666
"Listen, I said to her
while I patted her on the cheek."

810
01:18:03,675 --> 01:18:06,747
"Let's have a sensible little chat."

811
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:13,866
"Do you know what this is?
I had taken a condom from my pocket."

812
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:17,392
"No, she said.
Well, I'll tell you..."

813
01:18:17,595 --> 01:18:21,224
<i>The following year Hans Jæger
will be forced to ﬂee from Norway</i>

814
01:18:21,315 --> 01:18:23,783
<i>after the Liberal government
imposes upon him</i>

815
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:27,749
<i>a second sentence of
150 days in prison</i>

816
01:18:27,955 --> 01:18:31,106
<i>this time for sending
300 copies of his book</i>

817
01:18:31,235 --> 01:18:33,703
<i>out of the country to Sweden</i>

818
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:38,266
<i>under a cover entitled
"Christmas Tales by Hans Jæger".</i>

819
01:18:39,275 --> 01:18:42,267
"...and it doesn't pass
through because..."

820
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:48,152
"And I blew up the condom.
Not even air passes through."

821
01:18:51,075 --> 01:18:55,466
I could read more
but I think that suffices.

822
01:19:01,115 --> 01:19:05,711
<i>Cell no. 1 of the Møllergaten
district prison in Kristiania.</i>

823
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:11,150
Does imprisonment
influence your work?

824
01:19:11,515 --> 01:19:14,552
No, it has no influence whatsoever.

825
01:19:15,155 --> 01:19:19,512
That good people,
who use literature for diversion,

826
01:19:19,715 --> 01:19:24,914
scream and <i>cross</i> themselves,
means nothing. I knew they would.

827
01:20:30,395 --> 01:20:39,269
It provokes the bourgeoisie
who live their cosy, false life.

828
01:20:40,155 --> 01:20:43,272
It provokes them to see free women.

829
01:20:43,955 --> 01:20:49,109
Everything outside the fence
they have raised around themselves

830
01:20:50,195 --> 01:20:52,663
is so terrifying for them

831
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:57,666
except perhaps in their dreams,
when they indulge in fantasies.

832
01:21:03,195 --> 01:21:06,392
But, because I live openly and freely,

833
01:21:08,075 --> 01:21:10,589
I think they become terrified.

834
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:15,705
The so-called free women
we're always hearing about,

835
01:21:16,795 --> 01:21:19,263
they can't be quite normal

836
01:21:20,955 --> 01:21:26,825
but they can become normal
if they discover their real capacity.

837
01:21:28,475 --> 01:21:31,194
Half an hour before she came

838
01:21:32,155 --> 01:21:34,385
and <i>she just smiles
as she passes</i> by...

839
01:21:37,395 --> 01:21:39,226
with another man.

840
01:21:43,675 --> 01:21:44,903
Oh, damn!

841
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:08,626
Finally I finished, exhausted.

842
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:13,674
I had brought out a lot
of the first impression,

843
01:22:16,435 --> 01:22:18,471
the trembling mouth,

844
01:22:19,155 --> 01:22:23,706
the transparent shine
and the tired eyes

845
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:29,064
but the colours were not finished.

846
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:35,233
It was pale and grey.
The painting was heavy as lead.

847
01:22:39,715 --> 01:22:43,867
<i>At almost the last stage,
Munch attacks the canvas again</i>

848
01:22:43,955 --> 01:22:46,264
<i>scoring deep into the oil</i>

849
01:22:46,355 --> 01:22:50,234
<i>and, in one gesture of
broad sweeping strokes</i>

850
01:22:50,355 --> 01:22:54,633
<i>eliminates the carefully executed
window, curtains and ﬂowerpot</i>

851
01:22:54,715 --> 01:22:57,275
<i>on the right-hand side
of the canvas.</i>

852
01:22:58,115 --> 01:23:00,185
<i>The final distracting details</i>

853
01:23:00,595 --> 01:23:01,994
<i>have gone.</i>

854
01:23:49,915 --> 01:23:53,271
<i>Edvard Munch is aware that
he has made a major breakthrough</i>

855
01:23:53,715 --> 01:23:55,706
<i>in terms of his own art.</i>

856
01:23:55,915 --> 01:23:59,703
<i>But he is not yet aware of
the dimensions of this breakthrough.</i>

857
01:24:00,715 --> 01:24:03,354
<i>At this time, in the mid 1880's</i>

858
01:24:03,675 --> 01:24:06,269
<i>each of the major artists
in the Western World</i>

859
01:24:06,915 --> 01:24:11,909
<i>is still involved in the traditional
presentation of the exterior reality.</i>

860
01:24:12,195 --> 01:24:13,594
<i>Cézanne...</i>

861
01:24:13,795 --> 01:24:17,913
<i>the early work of Gauguin
and, even at this stage...</i>

862
01:24:17,995 --> 01:24:19,872
<i>Vincent Van Gogh.</i>

863
01:24:21,075 --> 01:24:23,953
<i>The difference between these works
and Munch's canvas</i>

864
01:24:24,235 --> 01:24:25,827
<i>is most clearly seen in</i>

865
01:24:26,115 --> 01:24:28,345
<i>the contemporary presentation
of young women:</i>

866
01:24:28,635 --> 01:24:30,307
<i>Auguste Renoir...</i>

867
01:24:30,915 --> 01:24:32,394
<i>Bertha Morison'...</i>

868
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,314
<i>the American Mary Cassatt...</i>

869
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:38,711
<i>the Norwegian Hans Heyerdahl.</i>

870
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:44,910
<i>But Edvard Munch's canvas,
with its deeply scored surface,</i>

871
01:24:45,035 --> 01:24:47,913
<i>which has transcended
all exterior reality</i>

872
01:24:48,355 --> 01:24:52,633
<i>to become the first
expressionist painting of "feeling"</i>

873
01:24:52,715 --> 01:24:56,390
<i>in the history of Western art,
is strongly attacked</i>

874
01:24:56,715 --> 01:25:00,310
<i>both by the Kristiania public
and by its conservative press.</i>

875
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:10,913
The public won't accept
that sort of madness.

876
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,947
<i>When one passes</i>

877
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:16,704
people stand laughing
at the painting.

878
01:25:16,955 --> 01:25:22,587
Some people always set themselves up
as guardians over others.

879
01:25:23,115 --> 01:25:27,870
In literature they decide
what is decent and indecent.

880
01:25:28,755 --> 01:25:33,385
<i>Says one colleague to Munch,
"I think that your painting is shit."</i>

881
01:25:33,715 --> 01:25:36,707
<i>Asks another,
"What are all those strokes for?</i>"

882
01:25:36,795 --> 01:25:38,592
<i>"It looks like it's raining."</i>

883
01:25:38,715 --> 01:25:41,275
A human life is decent

884
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:44,746
but writing about
human sexual life is indecent.

885
01:25:44,915 --> 01:25:48,225
<i>Another friend tells Munch
that he will go mad</i>

886
01:25:48,395 --> 01:25:49,987
<i>if he continues in this way.</i>

887
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:52,225
As long as I can write,

888
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:56,224
I'll combat society and its rules
to create a society

889
01:25:56,515 --> 01:25:59,313
in which literature is free.

890
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:03,150
Who has the right to stop anyone
writing about his emotional life?

891
01:26:03,475 --> 01:26:05,147
No one!

892
01:26:05,275 --> 01:26:11,748
The best way to judge Munch's picture
is to see it at a distance.

893
01:26:12,715 --> 01:26:16,105
<i>Andreas Aubert, art historian
and critic.</i>

894
01:26:16,235 --> 01:26:21,867
The colours and contours appear
most clearly on cloudy days.

895
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:26,469
If one really wants
to get a better impression

896
01:26:27,195 --> 01:26:30,551
of this extremely strange painting,

897
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:34,384
one should look at it like this,
between two fingers.

898
01:26:35,955 --> 01:26:38,594
<i>At some point in this period
of his life.</i>

899
01:26:38,715 --> 01:26:43,266
<i>Edvard Munch writes in his diary
of chasing a woman through the streets</i>

900
01:26:43,395 --> 01:26:45,750
<i>whom he believes to be Mrs Heiberg.</i>

901
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:50,312
I'm faltering. I think I am falling.

902
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:56,628
But he has been lured
into throwing away his talent

903
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,628
<i>in</i> such a <i>useless way</i>

904
01:27:00,395 --> 01:27:06,789
and encouraged to follow
this path which leads nowhere.

905
01:27:08,075 --> 01:27:12,944
I have no feeling in my legs.
They won't carry me.

906
01:27:14,275 --> 01:27:18,268
Everyone passing looks
alien and strange.

907
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:22,187
I think they are all staring at me.

908
01:27:23,595 --> 01:27:26,234
My whole body is shaking.

909
01:27:26,515 --> 01:27:28,551
Sweat pours from me.

910
01:27:29,235 --> 01:27:34,104
I have received an anonymous letter
in my capacity as critic

911
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:39,594
in which the writer claims to see
nothing but meaninglessness

912
01:27:39,795 --> 01:27:46,394
and an attempt to be original
in Munch's work.

913
01:27:46,675 --> 01:27:50,304
All I can say to this person
is that he get himself

914
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,625
a new pair of eyes.

915
01:27:53,755 --> 01:27:57,907
Anyone who can't see that
here we have a great

916
01:27:58,155 --> 01:28:01,113
and genuine talent, has no right

917
01:28:01,355 --> 01:28:02,913
to judge art at all.

918
01:28:13,515 --> 01:28:17,952
I want life, that which is alive.

919
01:28:19,915 --> 01:28:23,954
What do I care whether
the chair is properly made?

920
01:28:25,315 --> 01:28:31,345
What I wanted to bring out is
what cannot be measured.

921
01:28:32,635 --> 01:28:38,187
The tired movement
in the eyes, in the eyelids.

922
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:42,265
The lips must seem
to have whispered something.

923
01:28:42,675 --> 01:28:48,511
It must have been painted
by one almost mentally deranged

924
01:28:49,795 --> 01:28:53,913
who sees hallucinations
as if in a fever.

925
01:28:56,155 --> 01:29:00,865
I lay down on a sofa in the corner.
I lay half asleep.

926
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:03,870
I hated them for looking at me.

927
01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:11,791
It is possible that Munch can speak
in some way or other

928
01:29:12,475 --> 01:29:16,514
to those with a sick emotional life.

929
01:29:17,243 --> 01:29:23,478
But I think it's one of the most
dreadful things I've ever seen.

930
01:29:24,243 --> 01:29:33,720
One would have expected that
a painter who presents his paintings

931
01:29:33,843 --> 01:29:39,076
at a public exhibition,
would respect people's taste

932
01:29:39,443 --> 01:29:41,877
in a totally different way.

933
01:29:44,123 --> 01:29:47,957
<i>Hurt and confused by the attack
on The Sick Child</i>

934
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:52,873
<i>and by the constant references
to his work as "unfinished sketches".</i>

935
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:57,793
<i>Edvard Munch now checks the advance
begun by his revolutionary painting</i>

936
01:29:58,123 --> 01:29:59,476
<i>and steps back.</i>

937
01:30:10,163 --> 01:30:15,157
<i>He paints a third self-portrait,

938
01:30:15,403 --> 01:30:19,191
<i>a pose of defiance,
looking down on the viewer.</i>

939
01:30:19,923 --> 01:30:23,916
<i>A 2-year period of withdrawal
has begun.</i>

940
01:30:27,963 --> 01:30:30,352
<i>January 1888.</i>

941
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:35,195
<i>By this period, the group
known as the Kristiania Boheme</i>

942
01:30:35,483 --> 01:30:37,394
<i>has began to disintegrate.</i>

943
01:30:37,923 --> 01:30:41,279
<i>Personal tragedy, alcoholism,
syphilis</i>

944

<i>scarring relationships,
social isolation</i>

945

<i>Jørgen Sørensen will die an invalid</i>

953

<i>Jæger himself, with the germs

<i>Outside the death room,

968
01:32:50,203 --> 01:32:54,037
Why do you think
I shouted so angrily

969
01:32:56,883 --> 01:32:59,522
and said I couldn't see you again?

970
01:33:01,163 --> 01:33:03,119
It was because you lied!

971
01:33:06,603 --> 01:33:12,633
It's your inaccessibility
that makes me so angry!

972
01:33:19,723 --> 01:33:22,601
You said I shouldn't come so often.

973
01:33:23,243 --> 01:33:30,274
Yes but then I didn't know
how much I liked you.

974
01:33:34,723 --> 01:33:40,161
You've forgotten me now.
You have someone else.

975
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:44,681
I love you.

976
01:33:45,403 --> 01:33:52,195
If I'd only known that you went to
somebody else to punish me.

977
01:33:58,163 --> 01:34:06,753
It's the uncertainty that
makes me so nervous, so furious.

978
01:34:27,403 --> 01:34:29,963
You demand more and more
love from me.

979
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:34,156
Don't you understand I can't
give you more than I have?

980
01:34:43,603 --> 01:34:47,562
The moment you show
your feelings, it seems like

981
01:34:47,803 --> 01:34:51,512
you want to take something stolen back.

982
01:34:53,483 --> 01:34:56,714
Is it for your art you save yourself?

983

I like you but we really

<i>Dominating the exhibition

<i>Entitled Spring, it is a re-working

<i>But gone now is

<i>of the earlier work.</i>

1054
01:41:30,043 --> 01:41:32,477
<i>Here, there is minute detail:</i>

<i>a strand of hair</i>

1056
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:36,840
<i>a blood stained handkerchief</i>

1057
01:41:36,963 --> 01:41:39,875
<i>a carefully outlined bottle and vase</i>

I expect things are difficult for you.

1062
01:41:52,763 --> 01:41:57,041
It must feel strange
when you think of her.

1063
01:41:57,243 --> 01:42:04,240
Why has Munch's work changed
so much since The Sick Child?

1064
01:42:04,923 --> 01:42:08,757
I can only guess something
must have happened to him,

1065
01:42:08,923 --> 01:42:12,711
which made him lose faith
in himself and his art,

1066
01:42:13,163 --> 01:42:16,394
poor criticism and other factors.

1067

<i>Society accepts

1068
01:42:36,243 --> 01:42:39,792
but, if a woman has a lover,
it's quite different.

01:42:44,003 --> 01:42:47,882
Later perhaps...
Perhaps we can meet then.

01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:52,994
Everything could be different.

1071
01:42:56,043 --> 01:42:58,682
We mustn't take it so casually.

1072
01:42:59,563 --> 01:43:03,476
If I marry, I must live
for my husband.

1073
01:43:04,443 --> 01:43:09,517
A woman often marries
because she needs to be supported.

1074
01:43:10,003 --> 01:43:13,075
She can't earn what
she needs to live.

1075
01:43:35,243 --> 01:43:42,354
What was she thinking
as she sleepwalked along?

1076
01:43:42,963 --> 01:43:45,602
A Madonna-like beauty.

1077
01:43:51,003 --> 01:43:55,315
That's the way it goes,
year after year, a sort of trap.

1078
01:43:56,443 --> 01:44:00,994
Having now promised
to live together in matrimony

1079
01:44:01,523 --> 01:44:07,314
and vouchsafed it before God and
this congregation, I declare you...

1080
01:44:08,643 --> 01:44:15,162
Was she now thinking also
of the pale man behind the column?

1081
01:44:15,643 --> 01:44:17,554
...and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

1082
01:44:18,123 --> 01:44:19,761
What God has joined together,

1083
01:44:19,923 --> 01:44:22,278
let no man put asunder.

1084
01:44:26,363 --> 01:44:31,278
<i>The affair between Jappe Nilssen
and Oda Krohg is now developing.</i>

1085
01:44:32,483 --> 01:44:35,475
<i>Åsgårdstrand, 1889.</i>

1086
01:44:37,723 --> 01:44:42,035
She forced her way
between me and my ideal,

1087
01:44:42,283 --> 01:44:43,272
My am.

1088
01:44:45,003 --> 01:44:47,471
Yet I can't stop loving her.

1089
01:44:50,443 --> 01:44:52,399
I can't put up with

1090
01:44:52,603 --> 01:44:54,673
any more of her lies!

1091
01:44:57,043 --> 01:44:58,874
Her love is poisonous!

1092
01:45:01,283 --> 01:45:02,272
She has feelings, too.

1093
01:45:02,723 --> 01:45:04,953
I don't give a damn!

1094
01:45:05,283 --> 01:45:10,232
Damn it, I said to her,
you're lying on white sheets.

1095
01:45:10,883 --> 01:45:14,512
Your body will be deformed
by disease and rot.

1096
01:45:17,523 --> 01:45:20,799
You're going to die
ugly and stinking!

1097
01:45:21,323 --> 01:45:26,636
I'll laugh while I drink wine
with beautiful women.

1098
01:45:27,563 --> 01:45:34,275
My joy will be even greater than
the despair she brought.

1099
01:45:34,723 --> 01:45:37,840
I shall laugh, laugh, laugh!

1100
01:45:40,071 --> 01:45:42,790
<i>Hurt and angered by

<i>Edvard Munch leaves

1104
01:46:01,511 --> 01:46:06,141
<i>He meets with Emmanuel Goldstein,

1105
01:46:06,431 --> 01:46:10,902
<i>whose own work bears
a disillusioned view on love.</i>

1106
01:46:11,071 --> 01:46:14,427

<i>November 1889.</i>

1110
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:31,668
Dr Munch's death was
a hard blow to the family.

1111
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:37,304
We had just moved to Hauketo

1112
01:46:39,511 --> 01:46:43,550
and Dr Munch liked it
very much out here.

1113
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:48,786
The Sunday before he became ill

1114
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:55,380
we took a walk home from the church

1115
01:46:55,671 --> 01:46:59,789
and the rest of us could not
keep pace with him.

1116
01:47:02,551 --> 01:47:06,066
<i>Now that he and his father
can never be reconciled.</i>

1117
01:47:06,351 --> 01:47:10,139
<i>Edvard Munch begins to re-assess
the values and beliefs</i>

1118
01:47:10,471 --> 01:47:13,349
<i>that Hans Jæger has taught him.</i>

1119
01:47:15,351 --> 01:47:19,867
There is a city in the city,
the city of the dead.

1120
01:47:20,271 --> 01:47:23,502
There the graves lie side by side.

1121
01:47:24,071 --> 01:47:27,700
There you'll find hovels and palaces.

1122
01:47:28,671 --> 01:47:32,300
There quiet people live, the dead.

1123
01:47:34,831 --> 01:47:36,901
It's a popular city.

1124
01:47:38,231 --> 01:47:40,301
The bones make way for new.

1125
01:47:41,671 --> 01:47:43,866
What does it matter if one dies?

1126
01:47:44,111 --> 01:47:47,262
"Naught but sorrow and torment,
misery and strife."

1127
01:47:47,951 --> 01:47:50,988
"There is not much more
to be had from life."

1128
01:47:51,191 --> 01:47:54,501
"You pay a price too high
for joys too brief."

1129
01:47:55,031 --> 01:47:58,262
"Our pleasures are bought
by torment and grief."

1130
01:47:58,631 --> 01:48:01,270
"If to love's pleasure
your body surrenders."

1131
01:48:01,671 --> 01:48:05,505
"The source of all pains
a new life is engendered."

<i>1889.</i>

1149
01:49:07,191 --> 01:49:09,227
When I light the lamp

1150
01:49:09,391 --> 01:49:11,780
I suddenly see my own
enormous shadow

1151
01:49:11,951 --> 01:49:13,430
over the entire wall

1152

up to the ceiling.

1153
01:49:15,551 --> 01:49:18,782
In the mirror above
the fireplace I see myself

1154
01:49:18,951 --> 01:49:20,828
the face of my own ghost

1155
01:49:23,231 --> 01:49:25,461
and I live with the dead.

1156
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:39,385
All it said was, "Dearest,
come at 8 o'clock tomorrow."

1157
01:49:40,031 --> 01:49:45,310
I stared at each letter, each stain,
for the marks of her fingers.

1158
01:49:47,151 --> 01:49:49,585
Did she love me
or was she pretending?

1159
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:54,744
Did she love me or the other
or both at the same time?

1160
01:50:02,271 --> 01:50:03,670
"You are the vampire"

1161
01:50:04,151 --> 01:50:06,745
"which <i>sucks</i> my sparkling blood,"

1162

"from the channels of my heart"

1163
01:50:09,151 --> 01:50:11,346
"with icy draining looks."

1164
01:50:13,231 --> 01:50:17,270
"My body glows like desert sand
burned and charred"

1165

<i>Munch now sees the work

1168
01:50:36,271 --> 01:50:40,264
We didn't even know each other
and yet was it because

1169
01:50:42,071 --> 01:50:46,701
she took my first kiss that she took
the fragrance of life from me?

1170
01:50:48,151 --> 01:50:51,382
Was it because she
lied and deceived

1171
01:50:53,191 --> 01:50:54,465
that she suddenly

1172
01:50:54,551 --> 01:50:56,781
took the scales from my eyes?

1173

<i>Munch now begins to formulate

<i>that he is to pursue

<i>of woman's existence</i>

1177

<i>links in an endless chain tying
together thousands of generations.</i>

1179
01:51:29,831 --> 01:51:35,030
There was to be no more painting
interiors, people reading and knitting

1180
01:51:35,711 --> 01:51:41,502
but living people who breathe,
feel, suffer and love.

1181
01:52:09,311 --> 01:52:12,747
She closes her eyes and listens

1182
01:52:13,031 --> 01:52:16,990
to the words he whispers
into her long hair.

1183
01:52:17,671 --> 01:52:22,506
I'd depict it as I saw it now,
but in the blue haze.

1184
01:52:23,271 --> 01:52:29,665
I remember something Munch
once said a couple of years ago.

1185
01:52:30,431 --> 01:52:36,347
He had discovered that the Greeks
regarded death as blue.

1186
01:52:37,671 --> 01:52:43,701
It says somewhere in The Iliad,
"Blue death closes his eyes."

1187
01:52:44,991 --> 01:52:50,429
"Here in the grey gloomy North,"
Munch said, "we see death as black.

1188
01:52:51,031 --> 01:52:57,379
"But in sunny Hellas
they regard it as blue."

1189
01:52:58,031 --> 01:53:00,704
"Why shouldn't it be blue?"

1190
01:53:28,511 --> 01:53:33,460
Those at home, my aunt,
my brother and sisters

1191
01:53:34,751 --> 01:53:37,345
think that death is just sleep,

1192
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:41,586
that my father sees and hears.

1193
01:53:41,751 --> 01:53:50,386
On Monday he suffered a stroke
and within a few days

1194
01:53:51,351 --> 01:53:56,300
he lost the power of speech
and then consciousness.

1195
01:53:57,951 --> 01:54:03,105
Now and then we think he recognised us
for he smiled and pressed our hands.

1196
01:54:04,991 --> 01:54:09,348
I can do nothing
but let my sorrow run out

1197
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:14,306
into the dawn and into the dusk.

1198
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:19,508
<i>Munch's painting
Night in St. Cloud</i>

1199
01:54:19,831 --> 01:54:24,666
<i>a study of despondency in
swirling blue and black silhouette</i>

1200
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:26,543
<i>is a major breakthrough</i>

1201
01:54:26,671 --> 01:54:31,506
<i>in parallel to the similar breakthrough
now occurring in Norwegian literature</i>

1202
01:54:31,871 --> 01:54:35,466
<i>a subjective and personal
form of art.</i>

1203
01:54:35,511 --> 01:54:40,346
The use of the first person
in literature is introversive art

1204
01:54:40,671 --> 01:54:47,907
which breaks with naturalism
in a psychological, mysterious way.

1205
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:53,626
Things can be said in the first person
which were unsaid before.

1206
01:54:54,271 --> 01:54:55,260
This form

1207
01:54:55,391 --> 01:54:59,430
is born of a desire
to get right to the bottom

1208
01:54:59,631 --> 01:55:03,863
of the human being,
or the mood one is faced with.

1209
01:55:05,431 --> 01:55:10,107
It becomes like a vision
or hallucination

1210
01:55:10,871 --> 01:55:12,509
and it would be strange

1211
01:55:12,591 --> 01:55:19,429
if this form of intensity did not
make people shudder and tremble

1212
01:55:20,631 --> 01:55:24,988
and listen to what
the poet wants to say.

1213
01:55:25,831 --> 01:55:29,710
There is a rupture between
the comprehensive view of realism

1214
01:55:29,831 --> 01:55:34,109
and the new personal form.
Art for the sake of art

1215
01:55:34,271 --> 01:55:37,104
and for the satisfaction of the artist.

1216
01:55:38,191 --> 01:55:41,786
At last someone is willing
to listen to the heart.

01:55:51,471 --> 01:55:55,623
<i>to the official State Autumn
Exhibition in Kristiania.</i>

1221
01:55:55,911 --> 01:55:59,347
<i>The painting which he calls
Night in St. Cloud</i>

1222
01:55:59,471 --> 01:56:01,063
<i>is heavily attacked.</i>

1223
01:56:02,511 --> 01:56:04,069
<i>For the second time.</i>

1224
01:56:04,191 --> 01:56:07,866
<i>Edvard Munch returns
to self-exile in Europe.</i>

1225
01:56:08,671 --> 01:56:12,300
This painting which is called Night

1226
01:56:13,351 --> 01:56:18,505
makes such demands
on one's ability to guess

1227
01:56:18,711 --> 01:56:24,263
that few people go to the trouble
of studying it more closely.

1228
01:56:25,031 --> 01:56:29,946
The atmosphere around the painting
is so faintly designated

1229
01:56:30,391 --> 01:56:34,543
that it seems to disappear
before one can grasp it.

1230
01:56:36,471 --> 01:56:44,264
The painter himself follows
his own path in a misty

1231
01:56:44,511 --> 01:56:47,071
and shapeless world of dreams.

1232
01:56:48,351 --> 01:56:54,221
<i>And the critic of Aftenposten refers
to Munch's "sick mind" and states that:</i>

1233
01:56:54,351 --> 01:56:59,903
<i>"the borderline between madness and
genius is unconscionably narrow."</i>

1234
01:57:00,111 --> 01:57:02,181
Munch is primarily

1235
01:57:02,511 --> 01:57:04,979
a lyric poet in colour.

1236
01:57:05,711 --> 01:57:10,705
He feels colours, feels in colours
but he does not see them.

1237
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,863
He sees sorrow

1238
01:57:13,031 --> 01:57:15,465
and crying and brooding

1239
01:57:15,791 --> 01:57:17,190
and withering.

1240
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:21,425
<i>To the young poets
and writers of Norway</i>

1241
01:57:21,551 --> 01:57:23,781
<i>now rejecting Naturalism</i>

1242
01:57:24,111 --> 01:57:27,501
<i>the work of Edvard Munch
proves a revelation.</i>

1243
01:57:27,831 --> 01:57:29,423
<i>Wilhelm Krag:</i>

1244
01:57:29,471 --> 01:57:35,944
"The river ﬂows so slowly
Flows and ﬂows and ﬂows."

1245
01:57:36,751 --> 01:57:39,709
"And daylight goes, goes."

1246
01:57:40,311 --> 01:57:42,905
"Night will soon be here."

1247
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:46,910
"The light shines out of my room."

1248
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:52,500
"Turns to regard me
in silence and in anxiety."

1249
01:57:53,071 --> 01:57:54,390
"It knows he is coming."

1250
01:57:56,031 --> 01:57:59,626
Was it that she was so much
more beautiful than others?

1251
01:58:00,231 --> 01:58:04,019
No, I don't even know
if she was beautiful.

1252
01:58:04,871 --> 01:58:09,103
Her mouth was big.
She could be ugly.

1253
01:58:11,031 --> 01:58:14,030
In my article in the
Mercure de France.

1254
01:58:14,031 --> 01:58:16,306
<i>Albert Aurier, critic.</i>

1255
01:58:16,431 --> 01:58:18,786
I refer to this work by Gauguin.

1256
01:58:18,951 --> 01:58:24,503
I explain that it is the duty
of the new artist to choose between

1257
01:58:24,671 --> 01:58:27,788
the numerous elements
which make up objectivity.

1258
01:58:27,991 --> 01:58:31,825
He is also entitled to distort,
to emphasize,

1259
01:58:31,991 --> 01:58:36,746
to exaggerate line, form and colour

1260
01:58:37,151 --> 01:58:39,745
in accordance with
his personal vision

1261
01:58:40,031 --> 01:58:42,147
and individual subjectivity.

1262
01:58:43,031 --> 01:58:45,420
<i>Nice, 1891.</i>

1263
01:58:46,111 --> 01:58:50,946
<i>Two lovers, their faces
dissolved together, featureless</i>

1264
01:58:51,071 --> 01:58:53,824
<i>lurk in the comer of a room.</i>

1265
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:55,828
<i>Perspective has vanished.</i>

1266
01:58:55,951 --> 01:58:59,944
<i>Broken, slashing strokes
of thin paint.</i>

1267
01:59:00,071 --> 01:59:02,665
<i>The breakthrough has begun.</i>

1268
01:59:04,911 --> 01:59:08,108
She was affected,
a liar and a whore!

1269
01:59:14,391 --> 01:59:19,545
<i>The affair between Oda Krohg and
Jappe Nilssen is now at crisis point.</i>

1270
01:59:19,711 --> 01:59:22,987
<i>Jappe wants his relationship
to be clearly defined.</i>

1271
01:59:23,111 --> 01:59:26,501
<i>She, still married,
feels differently.</i>

1272
01:59:27,071 --> 01:59:31,747
<i>Jappe is now taking drugs
and has threatened to kill himself.</i>

1273
01:59:33,551 --> 01:59:41,902
There seem to be rules demanding
that women sacrifice themselves.

1274
01:59:42,911 --> 01:59:46,790
The best thing one can say
about a woman

1275
01:59:46,951 --> 01:59:49,624
<i>is that she is self-sacrificing.</i>

1276
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:53,267
I can't put up with it anymore.

1277
01:59:55,391 --> 01:59:58,827
I am so fond of her but
why is she so angry with me?

1278
02:00:03,671 --> 02:00:05,787
It's so difficult at times.

1279
02:00:06,071 --> 02:00:08,539
I know that I lose control.

1280
02:00:13,751 --> 02:00:17,824
<i>Seeking a way of peeling dawn
to the essence of the inner reality</i>

1281
02:00:17,911 --> 02:00:21,460
<i>of stripping away needless
detail and perspective.</i>

1282
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:25,590
<i>Munch now combines all
the forms of media at his disposal</i>

1283
02:00:25,711 --> 02:00:28,908
<i>using pencil, pastel,
oi! And charcoal</i>

1284
02:00:29,031 --> 02:00:31,704
<i>not separately, but together.</i>

1285
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:35,783
<i>He applies the oil thinly</i>

1286
02:00:36,111 --> 02:00:37,863
<i>to permit the canvas texture</i>

1287
02:00:37,991 --> 02:00:41,142
<i>to remain a visible component
of the finished work</i>

1288
02:00:41,431 --> 02:00:43,501
<i>to emphasize its ﬂat surface.</i>

1289
02:00:44,031 --> 02:00:47,785
<i>He allows the preliminary drawings
in pencil and pastel</i>

1290
02:00:47,871 --> 02:00:49,987
<i>including the corrections
made in them</i>

1291
02:00:50,111 --> 02:00:54,662
<i>to remain in the final work
to show its spontaneity.</i>

1292
02:00:57,911 --> 02:01:01,665
<i>On this canvas, to be known
variously as Melancholy.</i>

1293
02:01:01,871 --> 02:01:04,624
<i>Evening or The Yellow Boat.</i>

1294
02:01:04,751 --> 02:01:08,061
<i>Munch is attempting,
for the first time in his work</i>

1295
02:01:08,391 --> 02:01:10,825
<i>to depict jealousy.</i>

1296
02:01:11,151 --> 02:01:13,506
<i>And not merely
the event of jealousy</i>

1297
02:01:13,671 --> 02:01:17,027
<i>but its psychology
and innermost quiver.</i>

1298
02:01:21,391 --> 02:01:22,665
I wonder if something

1299
02:01:23,111 --> 02:01:28,788
is going on between her
and Jæger. What shall I do then?

1300
02:01:29,271 --> 02:01:32,343
At any rate, I believe
that the idea must be

1301
02:01:34,671 --> 02:01:35,899
to live according to

1302
02:01:36,071 --> 02:01:38,869
one's particular possibilities,

1303
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:42,942
that one has a duty to develop

1304
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:45,102
these possibilities,

1305
02:01:47,111 --> 02:01:49,830
that one has a duty
to expand oneself,

1306
02:01:51,231 --> 02:01:54,507
to acquire more knowledge,
a greater breadth.

1307
02:01:55,671 --> 02:02:00,665
I think that leads to greater
freedom in the long run.

1308
02:02:02,351 --> 02:02:04,819
Look how she's on top of it all.

1309
02:02:05,471 --> 02:02:10,545
Cheerful and smiling,
while the men all lie and perish.

1310
02:02:12,031 --> 02:02:16,343
Not everyone can have feelings
for each other all their lives.

1311
02:02:18,071 --> 02:02:22,383
When a relationship no longer works,
one should be able to break if off

1312
02:02:23,031 --> 02:02:29,630
before it changes to bitterness
and gnawing hate.

1313
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:36,383
<i>This canvas marks a major development
in the work of Edvard Munch.</i>

1314
02:02:36,631 --> 02:02:40,590
<i>It develops still further
the ﬂat application of colour areas</i>

1315
02:02:40,711 --> 02:02:42,383
<i>the lack of perspective</i>

1316
02:02:42,511 --> 02:02:45,423
<i>the tension between
space and surface.</i>

1317
02:02:46,071 --> 02:02:50,064
<i>It is dismissed by the critics
as a "sketch".</i>

1318
02:02:51,031 --> 02:02:55,024
<i>Edvard Munch is now seeking to take
the practical artistic consequences</i>

1319
02:02:55,111 --> 02:02:59,024
<i>of what lies behind
the theories of the symbolists.</i>

1320
02:02:59,871 --> 02:03:03,830
<i>He wants to realise them
in all-powerful subjectivity</i>

1321
02:03:03,951 --> 02:03:08,979
<i>to pass on what he and he alone
experiences from the motif</i>

1322
02:03:09,071 --> 02:03:12,461
<i>at the very moment
that he grips it,</i> or...

1323
02:03:12,711 --> 02:03:14,463
<i>that he is gripped by it.</i>

1324
02:03:14,791 --> 02:03:17,066
I walked along the road
with two friends.

1325
02:03:17,431 --> 02:03:19,262
The sun went down.

1326
02:03:20,231 --> 02:03:22,904
I felt it like a melancholy sigh.

1327
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:26,950
Suddenly the sky became blood red.

1328
02:03:27,711 --> 02:03:28,939
I stopped.

1329
02:03:29,631 --> 02:03:33,021
I leaned against the fence
tired to death.

1330
02:03:34,191 --> 02:03:36,022
I saw the ﬂaming sky

1331
02:03:36,231 --> 02:03:40,144
like blood, like a sword
over the fiord and the town.

1332
02:03:40,951 --> 02:03:45,149
My friends continued on.
I stood there shaking in anguish.

1333
02:03:46,551 --> 02:03:47,779
I felt it like

1334
02:03:47,991 --> 02:03:50,551
a great endless scream
through nature.

1335
02:03:53,671 --> 02:03:57,789
<i>The German Kaiser visits London,
hoping that Britain will agree to</i>

1336
02:03:57,991 --> 02:04:00,789
<i>the Triple Alliance
with Austria and Italy.</i>

1337
02:04:02,071 --> 02:04:07,589
<i>There is civil war in Chile,
widespread famine in Russia.</i>

1338
02:04:17,591 --> 02:04:21,709
<i>Munch now paints and exhibits
a portrait of his sister Inger.</i>

1339
02:04:22,031 --> 02:04:23,589
<i>Another breakthrough.</i>

1340
02:04:23,711 --> 02:04:27,863
<i>Perspective has vanished.
Space and surface are one.</i>

1341
02:04:28,471 --> 02:04:32,669
<i>But this canvas and his work
known as Despair</i>

1342
02:04:32,871 --> 02:04:36,022
<i>with the artist's featureless
and blank profile</i>

<i>its large disconnected strokes of
heavy colour running over each other</i>

<i>are heavily attacked
by the Norwegian press as</i>

1345
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:49,543
<i>"an awe-inspiring
gibberish of futuristic art."</i>

1346

<i>For reasons

<i>including Adolf Rosenberg,

<i>Here in the Berlin

<i>or "art of the gutter."</i>

1365
02:06:03,031 --> 02:06:06,068

Every painting!

1367

The man must be mad.

1368
02:06:11,311 --> 02:06:13,302

to study the piano</i>

1518
02:17:28,831 --> 02:17:31,425
<i>and who has been introduced
to "The Black Pig"</i>

1519
02:17:31,551 --> 02:17:34,384
<i>by her family friend,
Edvard Munch.</i>

1520
02:17:37,871 --> 02:17:41,944
On the other hand, she feels
a sort of instinctive sympathy

1521
02:17:42,071 --> 02:17:46,781
for beggars, braggarts,
liars and dogs,

1522
02:17:46,991 --> 02:17:48,424

<i>Dagny Juell now becomes
the mistress of Edvard Munch.</i>

1525
02:17:58,831 --> 02:18:02,460
Being married is the only way
women have to survive.

1526
02:18:02,671 --> 02:18:06,744
You simply can't exist
without a man.

1527
02:18:09,151 --> 02:18:12,188
If we leave you,
you fall like ninepins.

1528
02:18:17,111 --> 02:18:18,339
You want the women

1529
02:18:18,511 --> 02:18:19,944
submitted to you.

1530
02:18:22,111 --> 02:18:24,989
I can manage
with or without them.

1531
02:18:25,111 --> 02:18:27,341
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

1532
02:18:28,271 --> 02:18:31,069
Why is there a woman
beside you then?

1533
02:18:59,351 --> 02:19:02,423
<i>At this time, Edvard Much
is beginning to suffer</i>

1534
02:19:02,591 --> 02:19:04,149
<i>from agoraphobia.</i> ..

1535
02:19:04,551 --> 02:19:06,906
<i>A fear of open spaces.</i>

1536
02:19:08,871 --> 02:19:12,784
<i>He walks close to walls
and dreads to cross an open square.</i>

1537
02:19:16,111 --> 02:19:17,829
I do as I please.

1538
02:19:24,071 --> 02:19:26,062
<i>The year 1893.</i>

1539
02:19:26,551 --> 02:19:28,860
<i>There is a general strike in Belgium</i>

1540
02:19:28,991 --> 02:19:32,108
<i>serious riots
suppressed by the police.</i>

1541
02:19:32,671 --> 02:19:34,901
<i>Hermann Göring is born.</i>

1542

<i>And Peter Iljich Tchaikovsky dies.</i>

1543
02:19:39,991 --> 02:19:42,664
Not the slightest artistic tradition

1544
02:19:42,871 --> 02:19:47,228
or affinity with
accepted artistic ideals

1545
02:19:47,471 --> 02:19:52,101

or his colleagues.

1546
02:19:57,951 --> 02:20:00,863
<i>Here, in the Germany
of Kaiser Wilhelm I!</i>

1547

<i>Edvard Munch begins work on the
subjective image of a naked woman</i>

1548

her partner in sexual intercourse.</i>

<i>For his exterior model,

1551
02:20:21,671 --> 02:20:22,865
<i>Dagny Juell...</i>

1552
02:20:23,471 --> 02:20:25,780
<i>described by Strindberg</i> as...

1553
02:20:25,951 --> 02:20:30,547
<i>"tall, thin, haggard
from liquor and late hours"</i>

1554
02:20:31,031 --> 02:20:36,105
<i>"speaking with a drawling voice
broken as if by swallowed tears"</i>

1555
02:20:36,871 --> 02:20:41,865
<i>"with the figure of a Madonna and
a laughter that drove men insane."</i>

1556
02:20:48,871 --> 02:20:51,066
<i>Strindberg has discussed with Munch</i>

1557
02:20:51,391 --> 02:20:55,066
<i>fear and distaste
at the idea of his sperm</i>

1558
02:20:55,351 --> 02:20:58,070
<i>coming in contact with
the sperm of another man</i>

1559
02:20:58,431 --> 02:21:01,343
<i>in the vagina
of their common mistress.</i>

1560
02:21:01,551 --> 02:21:04,588
<i>He believes that this meeting
of similar poles</i>

1561
02:21:04,871 --> 02:21:07,465
<i>sensual contact with another male</i>

1562
02:21:07,631 --> 02:21:09,861
<i>is so unbearable and horrible</i>

1563
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:14,822
<i>that the normal man would often,
even prefer, death.</i>

1564
02:21:19,591 --> 02:21:23,743
"I run on. I am filled
with increasing anguish."

1565
02:21:24,111 --> 02:21:27,547
"No one speaks to one other.
No one smiles at one other."

1566
02:21:27,711 --> 02:21:29,941
"They rush off as though whipped."

1567
02:21:38,231 --> 02:21:41,382
So it is difficult to distinguish
a human form

1568
02:21:41,471 --> 02:21:45,862
or even to determine
the nature of an object at all.

1569
02:21:53,831 --> 02:21:56,061
But he was so frightened.

1570
02:21:57,151 --> 02:21:59,585
He felt the blood run
through his chest.

1571
02:22:02,071 --> 02:22:03,663
<i>1893.</i>

1572

<i>An army bill increases the size
of the German armed forces.</i>

1573

<i>An anarchist bomb explodes in
the Paris Chamber of Deputies.</i>

1574
02:22:15,631 --> 02:22:19,909
When he breathed it felt as though
his chest had come loose

1575
02:22:20,671 --> 02:22:24,220
and all his blood poured
through his mouth.

1576
02:22:28,271 --> 02:22:30,182
Jesus Christ!

1577
02:22:33,071 --> 02:22:37,383
<i>Strindberg has posed to Munch
the question, "What is jealousy?"</i>

1578
02:22:38,591 --> 02:22:40,547
<i>and has answered.</i>

1579
02:22:40,951 --> 02:22:43,829
<i>"Jealousy is not

<i>"But the fear of dividing."</i>

1581
02:22:49,071 --> 02:22:50,709
<i>Przybyszewski feels differently.</i>

1582
02:22:51,111 --> 02:22:54,865
<i>He believes that no man
should possess another human being</i>

1583
02:22:54,951 --> 02:22:58,148
<i>and has even offered the key
of his apartment to Strindberg</i>

1584
02:22:58,591 --> 02:23:02,903
<i>so that he may avail himself of
Przybyszewski's common-in-law wife.</i>

1585
02:23:03,671 --> 02:23:05,866
<i>Strindberg has declined.</i>

1586
02:23:08,671 --> 02:23:10,070
<i>Przybyszewski tells Munch</i>

1587
02:23:10,431 --> 02:23:13,867
<i>that he believes sex
to be life's basic substance</i>

1588
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:16,869
<i>and the inner essence
of individuality</i>

1589
02:23:16,991 --> 02:23:21,348
<i>the ever-creating, the transforming
and the destructive.</i>

1590
02:23:21,871 --> 02:23:25,341
<i>Sex created the brain,
says Przybyszewski</i>

1591
02:23:25,631 --> 02:23:28,862
<i>but between them there will
always be a constant fight</i>

1592
02:23:29,031 --> 02:23:33,468
<i>that will inevitably lead
to death and destruction.</i>

1593
02:23:36,991 --> 02:23:40,506
<i>Three years from now, in 1896.</i>

1594

<i>Dagny Juell, accompanied

In her will.

1618

<i>Munch uses the occasion to study</i>

1667
02:31:34,791 --> 02:31:37,942
<i>the effect of his paintings
placed next to one another</i>

1668
02:31:38,151 --> 02:31:40,870
<i>in the order of
their developing theme</i>

1669
02:31:40,991 --> 02:31:42,504
<i>for now he is planning</i>

1670
02:31:42,671 --> 02:31:44,024
<i>and working on</i>

1671
02:31:44,151 --> 02:31:48,429
<i>a whole cycle of paintings
that will link together</i>

1672
02:31:48,591 --> 02:31:51,822
<i>a Frieze of Life
as Munch calls it</i>

1673
02:31:51,951 --> 02:31:54,545
<i>to unfold the very meaning</i>

1674
02:31:54,711 --> 02:31:57,100
<i>of nature and existence.</i>

1675
02:31:58,031 --> 02:32:00,625
It's so calm.

1676
02:32:05,591 --> 02:32:07,070
May I kiss you?

1677
02:32:17,071 --> 02:32:19,346
<i>Munch returns to Berlin.</i>

1678
02:32:19,711 --> 02:32:22,908
<i>The Danish critics echo
the Norwegians and the Germans:</i>

1679
02:32:23,831 --> 02:32:26,903
<i>"Some of the pictures
are shockingly bad."</i>

1680
02:32:27,111 --> 02:32:30,148
<i>"There is little hope that
the artist's talent will develop."</i>

1681
02:32:30,271 --> 02:32:32,307
Do you sleep better now?

1682
02:32:34,911 --> 02:32:38,665
<i>"The disease is almost
certainly incurable."</i>

1683
02:33:00,391 --> 02:33:08,821
The last Sunday Papa and I
went up Liabrubakken to church

1684
02:33:10,271 --> 02:33:17,143
I remember that I said,
"You're very like Edvard today."

1685
02:33:19,591 --> 02:33:23,823
"Am I?" he replied happily
and straightened himself up.

1686
02:33:24,671 --> 02:33:28,107
Look what I bought from
Helgelandsmoen, Edvard.

1687
02:33:31,511 --> 02:33:34,981
Is it wine? It doesn't look
very good.

1688
02:33:46,351 --> 02:33:51,027
When he comes home at night,
he often starts to paint

1689
02:33:51,671 --> 02:33:57,268
and if you visit him in the morning,
you may trip over a palette

1690
02:33:57,391 --> 02:34:02,181
and a new painting
in some crazy position.

1691
02:34:03,431 --> 02:34:07,470
<i>By the early Spring
Strindberg writes of Dagny Juell:</i>

1692
02:34:08,071 --> 02:34:11,381
<i>"When the spark has leaped
and the currents are neutralized"</i>

1693
02:34:11,551 --> 02:34:14,111
<i>"he discovers that she is ugly."</i>

1694
02:34:14,591 --> 02:34:17,469
<i>"When he remembers
how she has offered herself"</i>

1695
02:34:17,631 --> 02:34:20,668
<i>"he is overwhelmed
by revulsion for he! Body."</i>

1696
02:34:20,791 --> 02:34:26,787
Did you know how I suffered?
Did you understand why I was hard?

1697
02:34:28,471 --> 02:34:33,022
I wasn't myself.
She was in me, in my blood.

1698
02:34:35,751 --> 02:34:39,107
Inger promised for all of us

1699
02:34:39,791 --> 02:34:41,622
that we'd be true to God.

1700
02:34:46,871 --> 02:34:50,625
<i>Strindberg first offers Dagny Juell
to the student Lidforss</i>

1701
02:34:50,751 --> 02:34:52,901
<i>who is known to be in love with her.</i>

1702
02:34:53,071 --> 02:34:56,541
<i>But Lidforss tells Strindberg
that he cannot accept.</i>

1703
02:34:56,871 --> 02:34:59,101
<i>He is suffering from syphilis.</i>

1704
02:35:08,071 --> 02:35:11,347
<i>Strindberg then turns to
his next alternative.</i>

1705
02:35:11,511 --> 02:35:14,981
<i>Doctor Ludwig Schleich,
a habitué of the Black Pig.</i>

1706
02:35:15,391 --> 02:35:17,666
<i>Schleich accepts.</i>

1707
02:35:18,231 --> 02:35:19,584
A man can't live

1708
02:35:19,751 --> 02:35:23,539
more than three or four years
with the same woman.

1709
02:35:23,991 --> 02:35:28,781
One must make new discoveries.

1710
02:35:29,191 --> 02:35:35,824
By loving one, can't we love
many at the same time?

1711
02:35:36,311 --> 02:35:38,108
You want to be men,

1712
02:35:38,351 --> 02:35:39,704
not human beings.

1713
02:35:39,871 --> 02:35:42,465
One should strive
to be a human being.

1714
02:35:43,431 --> 02:35:47,106
Both men and women
derive strength

1715
02:35:47,871 --> 02:35:50,431
from being united
in front of everyone.

1716
02:35:52,071 --> 02:35:54,744
Women have become
more and more manly.

1717
02:35:55,151 --> 02:36:00,748
They strive for humanity but
in that they see only manliness.

1718
02:36:08,711 --> 02:36:13,068
Has anyone tried to love a woman
who walks like a man,

1719
02:36:13,831 --> 02:36:18,029
talks like a man, moves like a man?

1720
02:36:18,991 --> 02:36:22,347
It's like loving a man
who acts like a woman.

1721
02:36:22,991 --> 02:36:24,106
Disgusting!

1722
02:36:35,391 --> 02:36:37,746
<i>Przybyszewski says of this painting:</i>

1723
02:36:38,071 --> 02:36:40,585
<i>"A man broken in spirit"</i>

1724
02:36:40,711 --> 02:36:43,942
<i>"an his neck the face
of a biting vampire."</i>

1725
02:36:44,071 --> 02:36:48,781
<i>"There is something terribly silent,
passionless about this picture."</i>

1726
02:37:02,791 --> 02:37:06,579
<i>"The man spins around and around,
powerless."</i>

1727
02:37:07,071 --> 02:37:11,701
<i>"He cannot rid himself
of that vampire no! Of the pain"</i>

1728
02:37:11,871 --> 02:37:16,991
<i>"and the woman will always sit there,
will bite eternally."</i>

1729
02:37:26,791 --> 02:37:29,863
<i>In his canvas
Death in the Sickroom</i>

1730
02:37:29,991 --> 02:37:34,826
<i>contrasted to the detailed, staring
face of his younger sister Inger.</i>

1731
02:37:35,351 --> 02:37:36,909
<i>Munch depicts himself</i>

1732
02:37:37,071 --> 02:37:42,941
<i>turned away, in profile,
his face a blank mask.</i>

1733
02:37:43,231 --> 02:37:47,509
He was very happy that Edvard
had received the scholarship.

1734
02:37:48,551 --> 02:37:54,148
But he was sorry he had forgotten
to send Edvard's Bible.

1735
02:37:56,671 --> 02:37:59,902
I've written to Edvard
to say he must buy one.

1736
02:38:02,151 --> 02:38:03,709
<i>At this period</i>

1737
02:38:03,871 --> 02:38:07,989
<i>as he paints Mrs Heiberg
standing outside summer cottage</i>

1738
02:38:08,111 --> 02:38:10,545
<i>her shadow looming large</i>

1739
02:38:10,671 --> 02:38:15,665
<i>the psychic and sexual tension of
Edvard Munch is at an unbearable peak.</i>

1740
02:38:16,151 --> 02:38:18,711
<i>Constantly his nerves
are at breaking point</i>

1741
02:38:18,871 --> 02:38:21,704
<i>as he struggles to find
the artistic solution</i>

1742
02:38:21,871 --> 02:38:23,782
<i>to expressing his feelings.</i>

1743
02:38:25,471 --> 02:38:30,386
<i>He is isolated from his family,
separated for ever from his father.</i>

1744
02:38:30,511 --> 02:38:33,662
<i>His work is rejected
in his own country.</i>

1745
02:38:33,791 --> 02:38:38,626
<i>He watches his mistress, Dagny Juell,
pass from one hand to another.</i>

1746
02:38:38,951 --> 02:38:43,706
<i>His bronchial condition is worsening.
He is drinking heavily.</i>

1747
02:38:44,271 --> 02:38:48,469
It's far too dangerous
to share a woman with another man.

1748
02:38:48,671 --> 02:38:55,861
If a man mounts a woman
who has just been with another man,

1749
02:38:56,191 --> 02:39:02,460
the preceding man's sperm will enter
the organ of the man now mounting her.

1750
02:39:05,031 --> 02:39:09,900
<i>He believes that he is going insane,
that he is about to die.</i>

1751
02:39:38,471 --> 02:39:41,110
<i>The affair between Dagny Juell
and Ludwig Schleich</i>

1752
02:39:41,431 --> 02:39:44,867
<i>lasts, again, for only two weeks.</i>

1753
02:39:45,391 --> 02:39:49,509
<i>Strindberg then agrees to help
Schleich pass Dagny on to another man</i>

1754
02:39:49,631 --> 02:39:53,465
<i>and now offers her
to Stanislaw Przybyszewski.</i>

1755
02:39:53,631 --> 02:39:56,384
<i>Strindberg himself is in good spirits
at this time.</i>

1756
02:39:56,511 --> 02:39:59,071
<i>He is about to leave Berlin
for his marriage.</i>

1757
02:39:59,351 --> 02:40:01,467
<i>He declares himself to be in love</i>

1758
02:40:01,591 --> 02:40:04,822
<i>and glad to be rid of
the "wretched woman DJ."</i>

1759
02:40:17,911 --> 02:40:21,950
You're disfiguring yourself!
You'll die. Ugly and stinking.

1760
02:40:23,231 --> 02:40:27,065
And I, I shall drink wine
with exultant women.

1761
02:40:27,711 --> 02:40:28,939
I shall laugh

1762
02:40:29,551 --> 02:40:31,109
even more!

1763
02:40:35,871 --> 02:40:40,387
<i>At this time in Berlin,
a party is held in "The Black Pig."</i>

1764
02:40:41,151 --> 02:40:47,624
<i>Accompanied by the sound of the sea
Oda Krohg and an ex-lover of Strindberg</i>

1765
02:40:47,791 --> 02:40:53,070
<i>dance in the centre of the room
with crab-tails placed in their hair.</i>

1766
02:41:21,751 --> 02:41:27,030
<i>With Sigbjøm Obstfelder,
Edvard Munch brieﬂy visits Kristiania.</i>

1767
02:41:27,871 --> 02:41:30,385
<i>At the same time, in Berlin.</i>

1768
02:41:30,471 --> 02:41:34,987
<i>Dagny Juell is marrying
Stanislaw Przybyszewski.</i>

1769
02:41:49,871 --> 02:41:53,181
This can't go on.
I can't put up with any more.

1770
02:41:58,191 --> 02:42:01,786
Emotions. I can't have emotions.

1771
02:42:05,071 --> 02:42:10,304
I wait and then she comes
and simply walks past with a smile.

1772
02:42:21,111 --> 02:42:24,706
"I look. I look at the white sky.

1773
02:42:24,871 --> 02:42:29,626
"I look at the grey-blue clouds.
I look at the bloody sun."

1774
02:42:30,671 --> 02:42:34,949
"So this is the world.
This is the home of the planets."

1775
02:42:35,711 --> 02:42:37,303
"A drop of rain."

1776
02:42:37,551 --> 02:42:40,065
"I look at the high buildings."

1777
02:42:40,191 --> 02:42:44,582
"I look at the thousand windows,
at the distant church spire."

1778
02:42:45,071 --> 02:42:49,144
"So this is the world.
So this is the home of mankind."

1779
02:42:49,751 --> 02:42:53,426
"The grey-blue clouds gather.
The sun disappears."

1780
02:42:53,951 --> 02:42:57,421
"I look at well-dressed gentlemen.
I look at smiling ladies."

1781
02:42:57,671 --> 02:43:02,699
"I look at leaning horses
and the grey-blue clouds grow heavy."

1782
02:43:03,391 --> 02:43:05,586
"I look. I look."

1783
02:43:06,111 --> 02:43:10,263
"I must have come to the wrong globe.
Everything is so strange."

1784
02:43:13,391 --> 02:43:18,863
<i>In late 1893, using pastel
on a base of cardboard.</i>

1785
02:43:19,031 --> 02:43:22,501
<i>Edvard Munch creates The Shriek.</i>

1786
02:43:25,911 --> 02:43:30,621
<i>December 1893. A gallery on
the Unter den Linden in Berlin.</i>

1787
02:43:30,951 --> 02:43:34,068
<i>Edvard Munch's 24th exhibition.</i>

1788
02:43:34,431 --> 02:43:37,901
<i>Amongst the works exhibited
are 5 of his Life Frieze</i>

1789
02:43:38,071 --> 02:43:40,790
<i>listed in the catalogue
under the title.</i>

1790
02:43:40,911 --> 02:43:43,869
<i>Studies for a Series on Love.</i>

1791
02:43:44,431 --> 02:43:48,470
I placed the paintings together
and it was as though

1792
02:43:48,671 --> 02:43:51,231
each was connected to the others.

1793
02:43:52,671 --> 02:44:00,021
Then came atone, a musical tone,
linking the pictures together.

1794
02:44:03,271 --> 02:44:09,221
So, if a relationship between
two people is to be sound

1795
02:44:09,391 --> 02:44:11,188
and I think it can be so

1796
02:44:11,431 --> 02:44:13,228
even if not for ever,

1797
02:44:15,471 --> 02:44:18,668
it must be based on mutual regard,

1798
02:44:21,111 --> 02:44:22,829
on tolerance.

1799
02:44:27,471 --> 02:44:32,625
<i>In the wards of Oscar Kokoschka,
the Austrian Expressionist painter.</i>

1800
02:44:33,871 --> 02:44:38,467
<i>"It was given to Edvard Munch's
deeply probing mind"</i>

1801
02:44:38,591 --> 02:44:41,663
<i>"to diagnose 'panic dread'"</i>

1802
02:44:41,791 --> 02:44:45,101
<i>"in what was apparently
social progress."</i>

1803
02:44:53,151 --> 02:44:56,507
<i>One member of the public
writes in his catalogue</i>

1804
02:44:56,751 --> 02:45:01,108
<i>that the exhibition is
"the world's greatest swindle.</i>"

1805
02:45:01,711 --> 02:45:06,546
<i>"Junk! Take it all
the insane asylum!"</i>

1806
02:45:09,111 --> 02:45:11,705
<i>And Munch himself has written</i>

1807
02:45:11,871 --> 02:45:16,149
<i>in pencil in the red sky
of The Shriek.</i>

1808
02:45:17,351 --> 02:45:21,060
<i>"Could only have been painted
by a madman. ”"</i>

1809
02:45:31,631 --> 02:45:33,462
<i>1894.</i>

1810
02:45:33,871 --> 02:45:36,783
<i>A canvas entitled Anxiety.</i>

1811
02:45:37,911 --> 02:45:39,629
<i>The faces of Edvard Munch.</i>

1812
02:45:39,951 --> 02:45:43,830
<i>Stanislaw Przybyszewski
and Dagny Juell.</i>

1813
02:45:44,551 --> 02:45:46,542
<i>Here, as in "The Shriek"</i>

1814
02:45:46,671 --> 02:45:51,506
<i>the individual is in the grip of
something far beyond his control.</i>

1815
02:46:22,591 --> 02:46:26,709
I have a friend who got married.

1816
02:46:26,911 --> 02:46:29,869
After two months he was a mess!

1817
02:46:30,191 --> 02:46:31,226
As if his wife

1818
02:46:31,511 --> 02:46:33,502
had drawn his teeth.

1819
02:46:33,871 --> 02:46:35,748
And his wife, then?

1820
02:46:35,951 --> 02:46:38,511
She was a dreadful bitch!

1821
02:46:38,951 --> 02:46:40,179
That's what she was!

1822
02:46:40,311 --> 02:46:42,029
Wasn't she disappointed?

1823
02:46:42,631 --> 02:46:47,147
She took everything from him.
She treated him like a dog.

1824
02:46:47,751 --> 02:46:51,027
She said come and he came.
She said go

1825
02:46:51,271 --> 02:46:52,499
and he wanted to go.

1826
02:46:52,591 --> 02:46:56,220
We had to pull him out
of her embrace

1827
02:46:56,471 --> 02:46:58,746
from between her breasts.

1828
02:47:00,951 --> 02:47:04,830
His eyes were quite ashen.
They were empty!

1829
02:47:05,631 --> 02:47:07,622
She was a dreadful bitch!

1830
02:47:14,711 --> 02:47:16,906
<i>Munch has now completed
another three canvases:</i>

1831
02:47:18,711 --> 02:47:22,021
<i>a woman pressed into
the embrace of Death</i>

1832
02:47:22,791 --> 02:47:26,670
<i>the gaunt face of Przybyszewski
above his skeleton arm</i>

1833
02:47:27,431 --> 02:47:30,025
<i>and Dagny Juell, poised...</i>

1834
02:47:30,911 --> 02:47:32,583
<i>inviting.</i>

1835
02:47:54,591 --> 02:47:57,025
You talk about your friend.

1836
02:47:59,111 --> 02:48:06,586
How do you think his wife felt
after an unsuccessful relationship?

1837
02:48:07,071 --> 02:48:11,906
Has she emerged from it proudly,
undamaged? Is she not marked?

1838
02:48:12,071 --> 02:48:13,663
She is thriving.

1839
02:48:20,071 --> 02:48:24,906
<i>Przybyszewski has himself
published a short novel in which</i>

1840
02:48:25,351 --> 02:48:28,388
<i>the hero gives his wife to an artist</i>

1841
02:48:28,551 --> 02:48:32,146
<i>and luxuriates in the feelings
of hate and jealousy</i>

1842
02:48:32,471 --> 02:48:34,780
<i>that he has aroused in himself.</i>

1843
02:48:45,071 --> 02:48:52,466
English doctors have proved that,
if two children lie together,

1844
02:48:52,591 --> 02:48:58,029
the weaker will absorb strength
from the stronger.

1845
02:48:59,831 --> 02:49:03,301
Which of them loses by it?
In bed, I mean.

1846
02:49:04,311 --> 02:49:05,630
The stronger.

1847
02:49:06,111 --> 02:49:07,226
And the male is

1848
02:49:07,431 --> 02:49:08,989
the one who is stronger?

1849
02:49:10,751 --> 02:49:11,581
Yes.

1850
02:49:25,471 --> 02:49:30,545
<i>August Strindberg describes Munch's
canvas The Kiss as</i>

1851
02:49:32,071 --> 02:49:34,585
<i>"the fusion of two beings"</i>

1852
02:49:34,671 --> 02:49:38,459
<i>"the smaller of which,
shaped like a carp"</i>

1853
02:49:38,631 --> 02:49:41,668
<i>"seems on the point
of devouring the larger"</i>

1854
02:49:41,791 --> 02:49:43,702
<i>"as is the habit of vermin"</i>

1855
02:49:43,991 --> 02:49:47,620
<i>"microbes, vampires
and women."</i>

1856
02:49:58,551 --> 02:50:02,260
Who did he get those ideas from?

1857
02:50:04,191 --> 02:50:07,661
Why does he see things like that?

1858
02:50:08,271 --> 02:50:10,307
I don't understand.

1859
02:50:10,671 --> 02:50:14,061
If you love a woman
and she loves you

1860
02:50:14,671 --> 02:50:17,310
it's a reciprocal relationship.

1861
02:50:17,671 --> 02:50:22,301
The tension which passes
from one to the other,

1862
02:50:22,671 --> 02:50:26,584
also goes in the opposite direction.

1863
02:50:27,271 --> 02:50:29,739
I can't understand him.

1864
02:50:31,111 --> 02:50:32,942
But the future...

1865
02:50:34,351 --> 02:50:37,582
Must there be a struggle
between the sexes?

1866
02:50:38,751 --> 02:50:42,539
Must it be man against woman,
woman against man?

1867
02:50:44,711 --> 02:50:49,580
Since our souls were saved
together for Jesus' sake,

1868
02:50:50,351 --> 02:50:53,548
God be with you, Sophie,

1869
02:50:54,151 --> 02:50:57,302
little pale Edvard, Andreas

1870
02:50:57,511 --> 02:50:58,830
and Inger

1871
02:50:59,751 --> 02:51:04,984
and you, my kind, dear, unforgettable
self-sacrificing husband.

1872
02:51:09,231 --> 02:51:16,421
I have also written something
to Edvard, my eldest son.

1873
02:51:19,831 --> 02:51:24,143
"Do not covet that
which is on earth,"

1874
02:51:24,671 --> 02:51:26,980
"but rather that
which is in heaven."

1875
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:29,623
"Keep watch and pray."

1876
02:51:31,671 --> 02:51:33,229
"Your mother."

1877
02:51:48,471 --> 02:51:51,622
<i>Munch creates yet another version
of Melancholy.</i>

1878
02:51:52,991 --> 02:51:57,462
<i>"Blank against the twisting,
sinuous shore of Åsgårdstrand."</i>

1879
02:51:58,071 --> 02:52:02,349
<i>"two rocks, like the black eyes
of a snake"</i>

1880
02:52:02,591 --> 02:52:04,388
<i>"stare at him."</i>

1881
02:52:13,271 --> 02:52:14,989
I can't go on.

1882
02:52:20,551 --> 02:52:23,543
<i>A predominant characteristic
of Munch's work in this period</i>

1883
02:52:23,711 --> 02:52:28,068
<i>is the lack of contact between
the human beings in his paintings.</i>

1884
02:52:28,391 --> 02:52:30,063
<i>People remain isolated</i>

1885
02:52:30,351 --> 02:52:33,468
<i>even though in direct
physical contact.</i>

1886
02:52:33,831 --> 02:52:36,470
<i>The sensory organs disappear</i>

1887
02:52:36,551 --> 02:52:38,428
<i>faces become blank</i>

1888
02:52:38,551 --> 02:52:42,021
<i>hands are clubs or curved hooks</i>

1889
02:52:42,351 --> 02:52:45,741
<i>as the features of human contact
are eliminated.</i>

1890
02:52:46,831 --> 02:52:48,662
<i>For Edvard Munch himself</i>

1891
02:52:48,791 --> 02:52:51,863
<i>human contact
is becoming a matter of fear</i>

1892
02:52:52,031 --> 02:52:55,785
<i>fear of his own ego
dissolving into the psyche</i>

1893
02:52:55,871 --> 02:52:58,066
<i>and into the body of another.</i>

1894
02:53:14,711 --> 02:53:21,822
Colours, brushwork
and lines express so much.

1895
02:53:23,351 --> 02:53:29,586
They're fantastic.
No artist can compete with him.

1896
02:53:31,911 --> 02:53:36,189
To be honest, I don't like
these paintings at all.

1897
02:53:36,391 --> 02:53:40,589
I'm no art expert
but they don't say anything to me.

1898
02:53:40,791 --> 02:53:43,259
I don't like his art at all.

1899
02:53:43,671 --> 02:53:50,668
So unnatural, the colours are
not natural: blue trees...

1900
02:53:51,671 --> 02:53:53,901
I don't like it.

1901
02:53:54,431 --> 02:53:58,470
His figures are
no more than suggested.

1902
02:53:59,991 --> 02:54:03,427
Munch makes
a powerful impression on me.

1903
02:54:03,671 --> 02:54:07,823
He reﬂects a great deal
of humanity in his paintings

1904
02:54:08,951 --> 02:54:13,422
and shows brutal reality,

1905
02:54:13,671 --> 02:54:15,502
as life is.

1906
02:54:16,511 --> 02:54:22,507
I'm a compatriot of Munch
and I've heard it said of him

1907
02:54:23,151 --> 02:54:27,303
that he's an awful,
dreadful man. But I like it.

1908
02:54:27,511 --> 02:54:31,629
He says something
about human beings

1909
02:54:31,791 --> 02:54:33,702
and he speaks to me.

1910
02:54:34,991 --> 02:54:40,509
I know a little about the situation.
I feel that he speaks the truth.

1911
02:54:42,231 --> 02:54:45,064
This is howl really believe it is.

1912
02:55:09,071 --> 02:55:13,508
<i>Working in hotel bedrooms,
on park and railway station benches</i>

1913
02:55:13,631 --> 02:55:15,667
<i>in bars and restaurants</i>

1914
02:55:15,831 --> 02:55:19,141
<i>using the small piece of copper
which he carries in his pocket.</i>

1915
02:55:19,431 --> 02:55:22,468
<i>Edvard Munch begins
his first engraving</i>

1916
02:55:22,631 --> 02:55:26,021
<i>the theme which he captured
the prior year on his canvas.</i>

1917
02:55:26,351 --> 02:55:28,387
<i>Death And The Maiden.</i>

1918
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:31,742
<i>A naked woman,
stretched on tip-toe</i>

1919
02:55:31,871 --> 02:55:35,750
<i>presses he! Full body
into the embrace of Death.</i>

1920
02:55:44,111 --> 02:55:46,500
<i>Towards the end of the 19th century</i>

1921
02:55:46,671 --> 02:55:49,902
<i>a new interest has developed
in the medium of the graphic.</i>

1922
02:55:50,071 --> 02:55:51,948
<i>In Germany, Munch</i>

1923
02:55:52,071 --> 02:55:55,950
<i>here in the company of a professor
of graphic art at Berlin University</i>

1924
02:55:56,071 --> 02:55:59,427
<i>studies the latest trends
in copper engraving.</i>

1925
02:55:59,551 --> 02:56:02,668
<i>In particular, the widely
published etchings</i>

1926
02:56:02,791 --> 02:56:04,986
<i>of the German Max Klinger.</i>

1927
02:56:05,751 --> 02:56:11,462
<i>Here his cycle of eight developing
studies entitled Eine Liebe.</i>

1928
02:56:11,591 --> 02:56:12,990
<i>A Love.</i>

1929
02:56:14,871 --> 02:56:16,941
<i>The technical brilliance
of Klinger's work</i>

1930
02:56:17,071 --> 02:56:22,020
<i>its painstakingly studied detail,
its use of black and white masses</i>

1931
02:56:22,151 --> 02:56:25,029
<i>its fashionable though
superficially treated themes</i>

1932
02:56:25,151 --> 02:56:28,985
<i>of eroticism and despair,
intrigue Munch</i>

1933
02:56:29,151 --> 02:56:32,860
<i>and reinforces his desire
to treat a similar cycle</i>

1934
02:56:33,031 --> 02:56:36,660
<i>on a far deeper
and more expressive level.</i>

1935
02:56:41,511 --> 02:56:43,388
I met a young woman

1936
02:56:44,751 --> 02:56:46,787
on the street one evening.

1937
02:56:47,231 --> 02:56:49,301
Her eyes attracted me.

1938
02:56:49,831 --> 02:56:52,061
They were large childish eyes.

1939
02:56:52,871 --> 02:56:57,501
I looked at her. She turned
and we walked together.

1940
02:56:59,311 --> 02:57:02,144
"Do you want to come up?" I said.

1941
02:57:03,431 --> 02:57:07,265
In my room she seemed
a little shabbily dressed.

1942
02:57:07,671 --> 02:57:12,028
Her face was a little harrowed
but her eyes

1943
02:57:12,231 --> 02:57:13,869
were beautiful.

1944
02:57:14,471 --> 02:57:16,268
"Why did you come with me?" I said.

1945
02:57:17,671 --> 02:57:19,866
"That's why I walk the streets."

1946
02:57:34,671 --> 02:57:39,745
<i>Munch writes in his diary:
"Ill, ill and lonely.</i>"

1947
02:57:40,711 --> 02:57:42,349
<i>"He wanted to put his tired head"</i>

1948
02:57:42,671 --> 02:57:44,468
<i>"on a soft lady's breast"</i>

1949

<i>"smell her perfume,

<i>"Feel her soft curved breasts

1951
02:57:54,351 --> 02:57:57,388
<i>"And, when he looked up,
meet her look above him"</i>

1952
02:57:57,871 --> 02:58:02,740
<i>"and then he would close his eyes
and feel he! Warm deep look"</i>

1953

<i>"and her soft lustful smile."</i>

1954

<i>"And then she would stroke
his hair softly downwards..."</i>

1955
02:58:11,791 --> 02:58:13,429
<i>"downwards..."</i>

1956
02:58:43,671 --> 02:58:46,549
<i>In Munch's diaries
appear these words:</i>

1957
02:58:47,151 --> 02:58:48,903
<i>"I greeted."</i>

1958
02:58:49,031 --> 02:58:51,499
<i>"The girl friend laughed a little."</i>

1959
02:58:51,671 --> 02:58:54,105
<i>"The pale one smiled a bit, too."</i>

1960
02:58:54,431 --> 02:58:57,150
<i>"May I introduce myself? Painter."</i>

1961
02:58:57,471 --> 02:59:00,543
<i>"I take the liberty...
I want to paint you."</i>

1962
02:59:01,671 --> 02:59:05,346
<i>"I bought half a bottle of port

rather satisfied with myself."</i>

2112
03:11:53,751 --> 03:11:56,743
<i>"I felt I had got a small revenge."</i>

2113
03:12:00,431 --> 03:12:02,661
<i>"A lady dressed in black."</i>

2114
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:05,949
<i>"He quickly walked up
the street after her."</i>

2115
03:12:06,071 --> 03:12:10,781
<i>"He started to run, ran like mad,
pushing people away."</i>

2116
03:12:11,351 --> 03:12:16,061
<i>"He stopped, short of breath.
He was ashamed, running like that."</i>

2117
03:12:16,351 --> 03:12:18,990
<i>"Fool. It wasn't her after all."</i>

2118
03:12:22,671 --> 03:12:25,504
<i>"At times the blood ran
dawn the sheets."</i>

2119
03:12:26,151 --> 03:12:29,587
<i>"His father was on his knees
in front of the bed praying."</i>

2120
03:12:29,711 --> 03:12:33,750
<i>"His hands stretched upward.
His voice husky from crying."</i>

2121
03:12:34,071 --> 03:12:36,949
<i>“Lord, I beg you.
I demand from you.</i>

2122
03:12:37,071 --> 03:12:39,904
<i>"'Don't let him die today.
He is not prepared.</i>

2123
03:12:40,071 --> 03:12:43,029
<i>"'I beg you, have mercy on us.
Let him live.</i>

2124
03:12:43,151 --> 03:12:46,780
<i>"'He will always serve you.
He has promised me that. "'.</i>

2125
03:13:00,191 --> 03:13:03,024
Can't you stay?
It's so lovely here.

2126
03:13:03,751 --> 03:13:07,107
- No, I can't.
- Don't you want to?

2127
03:13:08,751 --> 03:13:10,025
No.

2128
03:13:11,871 --> 03:13:15,022
How strange you are.
Not like others.

2129
03:13:19,151 --> 03:13:22,188
He slept little that night.
His lips burned.

2130
03:13:24,231 --> 03:13:28,861
He pressed his hand against them.
He was back amongst the trees.

2131
03:13:30,111 --> 03:13:31,146
He felt again

2132
03:13:31,431 --> 03:13:33,467
how she gave way,

2133
03:13:33,831 --> 03:13:37,187
how everything disappeared

2134
03:13:37,831 --> 03:13:40,743
and the tickling
softness against his mouth.

2135
03:14:06,111 --> 03:14:08,545
How often have you sat at home

2136
03:14:09,151 --> 03:14:13,110
and waited for your wife,
listened for every step?

2137
03:14:15,631 --> 03:14:20,147
She said she was going
to meet a woman friend...

2138
03:14:20,311 --> 03:14:22,666
a woman friend she seldom met.

2139
03:14:24,871 --> 03:14:27,339
<i>October 1895.</i>

2140
03:14:27,671 --> 03:14:30,549
<i>The Blomqvist gallery in Kristiania.</i>

2141
03:14:31,111 --> 03:14:35,946
<i>Munch exhibits 40 works.
Amongst them, The Life Frieze.</i>

2142
03:14:36,071 --> 03:14:38,790
<i>The exhibition is heavily is attacked.</i>

2143
03:14:38,911 --> 03:14:43,905
<i>The newspaper Morgenbladet states:
"so much nonsense and ugliness...</i>"

2144
03:14:44,071 --> 03:14:48,542
<i>"dreadful... low and repulsive...
grimacing and confused..."</i>

2145
03:14:48,671 --> 03:14:51,469
<i>"crude and shrieking hideousness."</i>

2146
03:14:51,871 --> 03:14:53,589
<i>The newspaper Aftenposten</i>

2147
03:14:53,751 --> 03:14:55,742
<i>attacks The Life Frieze as being</i>

2148
03:14:56,031 --> 03:15:01,469
<i>"a number of sensual fantasies,
"the hallucinations of a sick mind. ".</i>

2149
03:15:01,871 --> 03:15:06,786
<i>A boycott of the building is called for
and the police are summoned.</i>

2150
03:15:07,751 --> 03:15:08,900
This is amongst

2151
03:15:09,071 --> 03:15:12,905
the worst I've seen.
I don't understand any of it.

2152
03:15:13,071 --> 03:15:14,504
The colours are so ugly.

2153
03:15:15,071 --> 03:15:17,585
Besides, it's highly immoral.

2154
03:15:17,911 --> 03:15:23,383
One almost has to sneak in
by the backdoor.

2155
03:15:23,951 --> 03:15:29,344
How can a young man who looks
so nice create things like this?

2156
03:15:29,751 --> 03:15:34,905
One can't take one's family along
and enjoy the art.

2157
03:15:35,391 --> 03:15:41,023
I don't advocate censorship
but why should this be exhibited?

2158
03:15:41,151 --> 03:15:42,948
Children might see them.

2159
03:15:45,431 --> 03:15:48,423
<i>Edvard Munch returns to Berlin.</i>

2160
03:15:49,191 --> 03:15:57,348
Abroad people will wonder
what sort of morals we have.

2161
03:15:57,631 --> 03:15:59,269
It's not just ugly.

2162
03:16:00,271 --> 03:16:02,227
He paints such unpleasant things

2163
03:16:02,351 --> 03:16:06,264
that one doesn't speak of,
at least my husband and me.

2164
03:16:06,791 --> 03:16:11,228
I regard this as something
which must come to an end.

2165
03:16:14,431 --> 03:16:17,389
<i>In late November,
Peter Andreas Munch</i>

2166
03:16:17,511 --> 03:16:21,060
<i>now married for six months,
writes to his family.</i>

2167
03:16:21,551 --> 03:16:24,349
<i>"I can't stand life anymore..."</i>

2168
03:16:25,511 --> 03:16:28,025
<i>and 3 weeks later is dead.</i>

2169
03:16:34,631 --> 03:16:37,703
<i>Many of Munch's contemporaries
now rally to his support</i>

2170
03:16:37,871 --> 03:16:40,021
<i>realizing that his art
is probing into</i>

2171
03:16:40,151 --> 03:16:44,064
<i>a new and revolutionary
understanding of the human psyche.</i>

2172
03:16:44,271 --> 03:16:49,026
Munch seeks peculiarity,
mystery in everything he sees.

2173
03:16:49,711 --> 03:16:54,831
He sees the world in wave-lines,
trees, shorelines,

2174
03:16:55,311 --> 03:16:57,666
female hair, trembling bodies.

2175
03:16:59,111 --> 03:17:01,500
Like no other Norwegian painter,

2176
03:17:01,791 --> 03:17:06,228
Munch aims at making
our innermost tremble.

2177
03:17:11,431 --> 03:17:14,104
<i>Working on the theme
of the staring, isolated faces</i>

2178
03:17:14,431 --> 03:17:17,070
<i>in his oil on canvas Anxiety.</i>

2179
03:17:17,351 --> 03:17:21,424
<i>Munch now turns to the final of the
graphic arts that he is to conquer:</i>

2180
03:17:21,831 --> 03:17:23,105
<i>woodcut.</i>

2181
03:17:23,431 --> 03:17:26,150
<i>Already he has seen the use
made by Paul Gauguin</i>

2182
03:17:26,431 --> 03:17:28,865
<i>of the grain and texture in wood</i>

2183
03:17:29,671 --> 03:17:32,549
<i>the stark and simple
outlines of the blocks</i>

2184
03:17:32,711 --> 03:17:34,429
<i>cut in Tahiti.</i>

2185
03:17:37,711 --> 03:17:39,064
<i>The Japanese use</i>

2186
03:17:39,431 --> 03:17:41,945
<i>of differently coloured
contours of wood.</i>

2187
03:17:42,431 --> 03:17:44,626
<i>The instant impact in the use</i>

2188
03:17:44,791 --> 03:17:46,668
<i>of primary white and black</i>

2189
03:17:46,871 --> 03:17:49,431
<i>by the Frenchman Paul Valloton.</i>

2190
03:17:53,551 --> 03:17:57,430
<i>In this field Munch perhaps
surpasses all his other work.</i>

2191
03:17:57,671 --> 03:18:00,902
<i>He invents a method of
cutting out individual pieces of wood</i>

2192
03:18:01,031 --> 03:18:03,784
<i>shaped to various contours
in the picture</i>

2193
03:18:04,031 --> 03:18:06,465
<i>inking the pieces
in their different colours</i>

2194
03:18:06,631 --> 03:18:08,462
<i>and then fitting them
back together again</i>

2195
03:18:08,551 --> 03:18:11,111
<i>like a jigsaw, ready for printing.</i>

2196
03:18:11,591 --> 03:18:13,627
<i>He uses the grain in the wood</i>

2197
03:18:13,751 --> 03:18:17,744
<i>and takes again the familiar themes
of the Frieze of Life</i>

2198
03:18:17,871 --> 03:18:21,546
<i>reducing them to
an essential force and simplicity</i>

2199
03:18:21,631 --> 03:18:25,101
<i>for which he has been searching
for 10 years.</i>

2200
03:18:36,551 --> 03:18:38,781
<i>Seeking for more effective ways
of spreading</i>

2201
03:18:38,911 --> 03:18:41,106
<i>his philosophy of life and death</i>

2202
03:18:42,071 --> 03:18:44,744
<i>constantly fighting against
what he sees as</i>

2203
03:18:44,911 --> 03:18:47,664
<i>the suppression of
his own personality.</i>

2204
03:18:47,831 --> 03:18:50,026
<i>Edvard Munch turns more and more</i>

2205
03:18:50,351 --> 03:18:53,149
<i>to graphic art
with its multiple prints.</i>

2206
03:18:53,471 --> 03:18:56,349
<i>Within one year
his graphic output has tripled</i>

2207
03:18:56,471 --> 03:19:00,100
<i>as he turns from dry-point
to etching to wood-cut</i>

2208
03:19:00,431 --> 03:19:03,867
<i>to lithography
in black and white and colour.</i>

2209
03:22:39,391 --> 03:22:43,066
<i>In a letter written by
the nurse of Peter Andreas Munch</i>

2210
03:22:43,751 --> 03:22:45,423
<i>were these words:</i>

2211
03:22:46,751 --> 03:22:50,380
<i>"He asked me to read a little
to him on the Friday afternoon."</i>

2212
03:22:50,511 --> 03:22:53,548
<i>"He wanted Christ's speech
from the summit."</i>

2213
03:22:54,391 --> 03:22:58,464
<i>"With each attack of suffocation
I had to give him a shot of naphtha."</i>

2214
03:22:58,631 --> 03:23:01,623
<i>"In the last attack three shots."</i>

2215
03:23:02,151 --> 03:23:06,906
<i>"On the Saturday night, we put him
in his bridegroom clothes."</i>

2216
03:23:09,471 --> 03:23:14,147
Your paper has mentioned
Munch's paintings as

2217
03:23:14,351 --> 03:23:18,390
"confused and inarticulate,
dreadful

2218
03:23:18,631 --> 03:23:20,747
or nauseating distortions."

2219
03:23:20,871 --> 03:23:21,701
Yes.

2220
03:23:22,711 --> 03:23:25,066
Isn't that rather strong language?

2221
03:23:25,231 --> 03:23:31,261
Yes, it is. What we feel
for Munch's painting is expressed

2222
03:23:31,391 --> 03:23:36,670
in a footnote I added
personally to our review:

2223
03:23:37,191 --> 03:23:43,141
"it is true the public is annoyed
by these disgusting works."

2224
03:23:44,031 --> 03:23:49,822
"How regrettable then that
such exhibitions draw full houses."

2225
03:23:50,191 --> 03:23:54,423
"An empty gallery would best
control these extravagances."

2226
03:23:56,271 --> 03:24:01,903
I agree with Aftenposten.
This is not art, it is dirt.

2227
03:24:33,431 --> 03:24:36,662
<i>For the next 14 years,
Edvard Munch is to lead a life</i>

2228
03:24:36,831 --> 03:24:39,789
<i>of increasing pain and isolation.</i>

2229
03:24:39,911 --> 03:24:45,144
<i>His illness, aggravated by smoking
and alcohol, is to grow worse.</i>

2230
03:24:45,591 --> 03:24:49,061
<i>He is tom by the themes
of jealousy and suffering</i>

2231
03:24:49,431 --> 03:24:51,342
<i>by the thought of his own death</i>

2232
03:24:51,511 --> 03:24:54,071
<i>and his descent into a literal Hell.</i>

2233
03:25:10,671 --> 03:25:13,822
<i>The conservative press is to
continue its attacks on his work</i>

2234
03:25:14,071 --> 03:25:17,950
<i>and other than for periods
spent at Åsgårdstrand</i>

<i>travelling endlessly
from one country to another.</i>

2238
03:25:28,071 --> 03:25:31,461
<i>He is to paint a major theme,
The Dance of Life</i>

2239

<i>in which the couples
do not see each other.</i>

2240
03:25:48,671 --> 03:25:50,502
Look at these streets.

2241
03:25:50,831 --> 03:25:53,664
Human creatures
set upon one another.

2242
03:25:53,871 --> 03:25:56,863
<i>Buses run</i> with
<i>countless</i> human <i>souls.</i>

2243
03:25:58,031 --> 03:26:02,229
They look indifferently on
the happy man, alone outside.

2244
03:26:44,951 --> 03:26:49,467
<i>Though most of his work is to deal with
the problems of human communication.</i>

2245
03:26:49,751 --> 03:26:53,346
<i>Munch is to try again
with two more relationships</i>

2246
03:26:53,511 --> 03:26:57,868
<i>one of which will result in
physical and psychic injury.</i>

2247
03:26:57,991 --> 03:27:01,825
<i>And following a nervous breakdown,
he will finally place himself</i>

2248
03:27:01,951 --> 03:27:07,025
<i>into a psychiatric clinic
in Copenhagen in 1908.</i>

2249
03:27:14,471 --> 03:27:17,508
<i>At the same time,
Munch is to be notified</i>

2250
03:27:17,671 --> 03:27:19,582
<i>that he has been made a Knight</i>

2251
03:27:19,751 --> 03:27:22,982
<i>of the Royal Norwegian Order
of St. Olav.</i>

2252
03:27:40,471 --> 03:27:42,780
Did you notice me much before?

2253
03:27:48,231 --> 03:27:50,267
Yes, I often looked at you.

2254
03:27:54,111 --> 03:27:55,988
I thought you looked like Christ.

2255
03:28:06,111 --> 03:28:07,590
Sit here.

2256
03:28:41,391 --> 03:28:45,304
We wish to thank the men, women and
