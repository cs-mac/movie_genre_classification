1
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:38,337
My father used to say that the
reason for living

2
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:43,108
was to get ready to stay dead a
long time.

3
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,914
Where Jewel?

4
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,785
I asked you where Jewel at?

5
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,225
Down at the barn, harnessing the
team.

6
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:45,564
Probably down there fooling with
that damn horse.

7
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,775
Come here, sir.

8
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,677
Come here.

9
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,685
Dinner time.

10
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,424
Come on.

11
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,429
Come on, eat it up.

12
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:30,402
Get that goddamn stuff out of
sight while you still got a
chance.

13
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,338
Pussel-gutted bastard.

14
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,746
Sweet son of a bitch.

15
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:20,819
What?

16
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,027
You ready?

17
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,795
Yeah, if you're all hitched up.

18
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:11,136
You wait. If she don't last till
you get back, she gonna be
disappointed.

19
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:17,042
I gave her my word we'd keep the
team here and ready, in case she
goes.

20
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,944
Ma ain't that sick.

21
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,078
That's right.

22
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,248
She been acting more herself
today than all week.

23
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,650
Yeah, well, you ought to know.

24
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,488
Been coming around here often
enough looking at her.

25
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,090
You and your folk all neighbor
like--

26
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,026
Shut up, Jewel.

27
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:40,031
If everybody wasn't burning hell
to get it done already, huh?

28
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:44,770
With Cash under that window all
day long!

29
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,471
Sawing...

30
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,873
and hammering...

31
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,875
It was her wish.

32
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,515
She wanted to know it were her
own blood sawed the boards and
drove the nails.

33
00:06:56,517 --> 00:07:00,051
Just like she want to go in our
own wagon.

34
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:04,923
We will be beholden to no man,
me and her.

35
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:10,662
It means three dollars. You want
us to go or not?

36
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,966
I'm a luckless man.

37
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,471
It fixing up to rain.

38
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,574
Be back by sundown.

39
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,479
Well...

40
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,984
Well, come on!

41
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,722
By sundown, you hear?

42
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:41,126
I would not keep her waiting!

43
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,744
What do you want, Darl?

44
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:36,548
She gonna die before we get
back.

45
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,751
Then why you going?

46
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,153
It means three dollars.

47
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:48,159
Why take Jewel? You know he will
never forgive you.

48
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,696
She'll want to get started right
off.

49
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,534
It's far enough to Jefferson at
best.

50
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,435
Well, the road's good now.

51
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:02,007
For now. We'll see once the rain
come.

52
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,245
Funny how things work. Addie's
people...

53
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,849
gotta be buried a day's hard
ride from here.

54
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:18,456
Shame you can't just go to your
folks' ground in New Hope not
but three miles away.

55
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:23,662
They'll be back in plenty of
time. I wouldn't worry none.

56
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:27,465
Might be won't be no needs to
rush no ways.

57
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,367
I hope it.

58
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,269
She's going.

59
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,005
Her mind is set on it.

60
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,711
The Lord giveth

61
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,814
The Lord giveth

62
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:52,057
What you got there, boy, a hog?
Where you find that?

63
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,725
Down at the bridge.

64
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,260
You aim to leave it there?

65
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,562
I aim to show it to Ma.

66
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,763
You clean that fish.

67
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,567
Can't Dewey Dell clean it?

68
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,469
You clean it.

69
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,104
How, Pa?

70
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,639
You clean it.

71
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,181
Go on now!

72
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,183
It's bigger than him.

73
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,221
Jewel!

74
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,231
Jewel!

75
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:40,605
Takes two people to make it...
one people to die.

76
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,507
You know she's gonna die, don't
you?

77
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,311
That's how the world will end.

78
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,948
Which two made you two?

79
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,752
She's gonna die, Jewel, your
mother.

80
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,355
Our mother.

81
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,327
Addie Bundren's gonna die.

82
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:11,169
Just... breathe easy.

83
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,889
Why didn't you call me sooner?

84
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:35,894
Well, it was just one thing and
then another.

85
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:40,231
That ere corn me and the boys
was hoping to get up with.

86
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:44,002
Dewey Dell was taking such good
care of her.

87
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:48,506
Folks was stopping by offering
to help and such.

88
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,475
I just...

89
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,010
Damnit, Anse.

90
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,417
She's a' going, is she?

91
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,757
I knowed it.

92
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,562
I knowed her mind was set on it.

93
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,030
Pa!

94
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,166
You better go quick.

95
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,046
Jewel!

96
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,031
Wheel's stuck in the ditch!

97
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,199
Damn!

98
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,536
It's Jewel she wants.

99
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:56,541
Why, Addie, him and Darl went to
make one more load.

100
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,844
They thought there was time,
that you would wait for them.

101
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,181
And that's three dollar and
all...

102
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,219
Ma. Ma!

103
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,324
Cash!!

104
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,827
Get it up. Get it up.

105
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,229
You got it? You got it?

106
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,132
A little more. A little more!

107
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,970
Hold on.

108
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:00,872
You're on?

109
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,774
Yeah, I think so.

110
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,676
All right, hold it.

111
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,412
All right. Get that bolt.

112
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,196
You know she dead, Jewel.

113
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,071
You know that, right? Addie
Bundren's dead?

114
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,975
Just shut up! Shut up!

115
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,878
Just shut your mouth!

116
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,103
She's gone.

117
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,072
She's taken and left us.

118
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,552
How nigh are you done?

119
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:29,060
I reckon you better get back at
it.

120
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,196
You're gonna have to do the best
you can

121
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:36,267
with them boys going off that-a-
way.

122
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,273
Go on now, put supper on.

123
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,643
We gotta keep our strength up.

124
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,025
God's will be done.

125
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,667
Now I can get them teeth.

126
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,504
You could do so much for me, if
<i>you just would.</i>

127
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,706
<i>If you just knew.</i>

128
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,809
<i>If you just would then I could</i>
<i>tell you...</i>

129
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:30,014
<i>and then nobody's have to know</i>
<i>it, except for you and me.</i>

130
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,516
<i>And Darl.</i>

131
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,526
You all right?

132
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:42,353
Where she gonna go? Do you think
she'll still go as far as town?

133
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,657
She went farther than town.

134
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,283
She's in upside down.

135
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:50,588
Told you she loved that dress.
Don't want it wrinkled.

136
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,499
I made it on the bevel.

137
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,635
One, there's more gripping
surface for the nails.

138
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:10,341
Two, there's twice the gripping
surface to each seam.

139
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:14,645
Three, the water will have to
seep in at a slant.

140
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,748
Water moves easiest up and down
than sideways.

141
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,253
Four, in a house were people are
upright two thirds of the
time...

142
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:26,090
the seams and joints are built
up and down...

143
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,492
because the stress is up and
down.

144
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:33,497
Five, in a bed where people lay
down all the time...

145
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:38,002
the joints and seams go sideways
because the stress is sideways.

146
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,771
Six, except.

147
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,640
Seven...

148
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:47,178
a human body is not like a
crosstie.

149
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,314
Eight, animal magnetism.

150
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:54,118
Nine, the animal magnetism of a
human body...

151
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,520
makes the stress come
slanting...

152
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,624
so a coffin is built on the
bevel.

153
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,959
Ten, if you look at an old grave
site...

154
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,296
you'll see where the earth is
sucked towards the bevel.

155
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,698
Eleven, while on a natural
hole...

156
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,502
it sinks toward the middle, the
stress being up and down.

157
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,605
Twelve, so I made it on a bevel.

158
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:19,410
Thirteen, it makes a neater job.

159
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,980
That river is up and rising.

160
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:27,985
It's already covered the highest
water mark on that bridge piling
that I've ever seen.

161
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,822
That bridge won't stand a whole
lot of water. Anybody told Anse?

162
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,925
I told him. He said he reckoned
them boys had already heard

163
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,561
and unloaded, and was on the way
back by now.

164
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,964
He better bury her at New Hope.

165
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,566
That bridge is old. I wouldn't
monkey with it.

166
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,670
Yeah, well his mind is set on
taking her to Jefferson.

167
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:48,072
Well, he had better get at it
soon.

168
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,708
It's been there quite a long
time, that there bridge.

169
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,277
The Lord kept it there, you
mean.

170
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,680
Peabody, you was the first guy
to cross it.

171
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,683
You was on the way over to our
house, see My sweetheart

172
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,018
give birth to our first son,
Jody.

173
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,322
If I would'a crossed it every
time she littered since

174
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,658
it'd be worn out long before
this.

175
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,430
The Lord giveth.

176
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,632
-The Lord giveth.

177
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,740
Where that rail run?

178
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,695
My mother is a fish.

179
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,541
His grace be upon this house!

180
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,443
Anse.

181
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:40,251
She going to a better place.

192
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,845
Hey, Jewel!

193
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,884
Look at them.

194
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,857
Goddamn you. Goddamn him!

195
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,636
I know your mother was Addie
Bundren, Jewel

196
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,838
<i>same as mine.</i>

197
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,842
But who was your father?

198
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,646
And as long as I can recall who
it isn't...

199
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,848
<i>but who it is.</i>

200
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,152
I still don't know.

201
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,699
It ain't gonna balance.

202
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:40,037
If you want it to tote and ride
on a balance...

203
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:46,010
Pick up your goddamn your thick-
nosed soul to hell and pick up!

204
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,345
- Easy, Jewel.

205
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,247
Jewel, I'm telling you!

206
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,149
She will not tote and ride--

207
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,984
Easy!

208
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,887
Come on! Come on!

209
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,457
Pick it up!

210
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,826
Watch the stairs!

211
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,895
No, pick up! Pick up your end!

212
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,130
Watch it!

213
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,331
Come on, Cash!

214
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,532
Watch it!

215
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,034
Let loose, Cash!

216
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,735
Watch it! Watch it!

217
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,938
Pick up! Pick up!

218
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,577
Watch it, Jewel!

219
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,128
She's backwards.

220
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:47,237
Jewel! You leave that horse
here, you hear me?

221
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:51,542
We all go in the wagon with your
Ma, like she wanted.

222
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:58,649
Not with you prancing around
like a darn circus animal on
that horse.

223
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,352
My mother's a fish.

224
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,256
Yeah. Jewel's mother's a horse.

225
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,360
And what's your Ma, Darl?

226
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:12,463
I ain't got one.

227
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,164
Why you got them tools?

228
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,968
'Cause I aim to stop off at
Tull's on the way home

229
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,037
and get that roof up on that
barn.

230
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,743
It ain't respectful. That's
deliberate flouting of her and
of me.

231
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,978
Where your sister?

232
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,786
What's that?

233
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,655
Mr. Tull's cakes.

234
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:40,257
Taking them to town, Pa.

235
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,959
It ain't right.

236
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:45,796
It's flouting of the dead.

237
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:50,100
And there's little enough for
you do to do for her.

238
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:54,605
What sprung hell from her own
flesh and blood.

239
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:59,243
Then go on. Leave him stay if he
wants to.

240
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,449
Pepper!

241
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:44,388
It's a hard country on man.

242
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,592
Nowhere in this sinful world

243
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,996
can a honest, hard-working man
profit.

244
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:56,700
It takes them that run the
stores in the towns...

245
00:28:56,702 --> 00:29:00,504
doing no sweating, doing no
sweating...

246
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,840
living off them that sweat.

247
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:07,878
It ain't the hard-working man,
the farmer.

248
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,216
Sometimes I wonder why I keep at
it.

249
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:15,986
It's because there's a reward
for us above...

250
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:19,823
where they can't take their
autos and such.

251
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,427
Everyone will be equal there.

252
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,730
And it will be taken from them
that have...

253
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:33,003
and give to them that have not
by the Lord.

254
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:37,040
But it seems like a long ways.

255
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,023
I told them it wasn't balanced.

256
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,425
They should'a let me put it on a
balance.

257
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:58,695
Yeah, maybe so, but we done
waited long enough.

258
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:02,099
Especially in this heat.

259
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,024
Hey! Jewel!

260
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,865
I don't expect you to have no
respect for me...

261
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:38,502
but with your own Ma not cold in
her coffin yet.

262
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,805
I don't know how many times I
have to tell you--

263
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,740
Jewel!

264
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,176
I don't know how many times I
told you...

265
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:50,681
it's doing such things makes
folks talk about you.

266
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,182
Come on!

267
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:09,266
Darl knew. He knew this and he
knew before.

268
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:15,505
He knew the first time me and
Lafe picked on down the row.

269
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:21,912
We'd picked on down the row, the
woods getting closer and closer

270
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:24,314
and the secret shade.

271
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:30,020
Picking on into the secret shade
with my sack and Lafe's sack.

272
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:33,624
Because I said, will I or won't
I when the sack was full?

273
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:38,161
'Cause I said, if the sack's
full when we get to the woods,
then it won't be me.

274
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,564
I said, if it don't mean for me
to do it

275
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:44,067
the sack will not be full and I
will turn up the next row.

276
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,838
But if the sack is full, then I
cannot help it.

277
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,843
And so it was, because I could
not help it.

278
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,378
He was in.

279
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:15,098
And then I saw Darl, and he
knew.

280
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,969
He said he knew without the
words

281
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:22,272
like he told me that Ma was
gonna die without words.

282
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,375
And I knew he knew 'cause he
said he knew with the words.

283
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:28,679
I would not have believed that
he had been there and saw us.

284
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,581
But he said he did know.

285
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:35,886
And I said, "Are you gonna tell
Pa? Are you gonna kill him?"

286
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:41,825
Without the words I said it. And
he said, "Why?" without the
words

287
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,895
Why not admit it?

288
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,830
You know it's true.

289
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:51,134
Even if it's just to yourself.

290
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,237
The relief you feel.

291
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,139
You needed her to die so that
you could

292
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,576
go to town and get it done.

293
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:14,391
And that's why I can talk to him
with knowing and hating

294
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,194
'cause he knows.

295
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:23,000
Couple of days now, it'll be
smelling.

296
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:32,042
You might tell Jewel that, he'd
like to hear it.

297
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:35,846
It ain't balanced for no long
ride neither.

298
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:39,249
You can tell him that, too.

299
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,031
We're going to use your bridge!

300
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,400
Bridge is out!

301
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,634
Louder!

302
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,337
The bridge is out!

303
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,342
We'll be all right.

304
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,362
How about use the one across at
Samson's?

305
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,596
Yeah.

306
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,432
That bridge is gone.

307
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,167
Like this?

308
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,769
Worse. It's gone entire.

309
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,671
What now?

310
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,373
I guess we ford here.

311
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,476
If it was just up, we could
drive across.

312
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:42,079
We could just drive right on
across it.

313
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,980
That's where the ford was.

314
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,282
That don't show nothing.

315
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,318
That could be a bar of quicksand
built up there.

316
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,220
Mr. Wheatfield crossed it.

317
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,622
On horseback. Two days ago.

318
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:55,225
It's raised five foot since
then.

319
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,127
Mr. Wheatfield crossed it.

320
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,662
If the bridge was just up.

321
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,298
But it's not, is it?

322
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,636
I bet you a careful fella could
walk across on those planks and
those logs.

323
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,039
Yeah, but you ain't gonna tote
nothing.

324
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,908
Likely you put a foot on that
mess, the whole thing go too.

325
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,847
I gave her my promised word in
the presence of the Lord.

326
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,117
I reckon it'll cross fine.

327
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,719
It probably start falling come
the night.

328
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,921
You can lay over a day.

329
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,624
You should get the hell back to
your own damn plowing.

330
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,861
Ain't nobody asked you to follow
us here.

331
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,529
Never meant no harm.

332
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,164
Why don't you shut up, Jewel.

333
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,833
Yeah, shut up, Jewel.

334
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,975
What you wanna do?

335
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:50,380
If the bridge was just up, we
could drive across it.

336
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:53,316
What you say, Cash?

337
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,723
Dewey Dell and Vardaman and
Pa...

338
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,292
they all better walk across on
foot.

339
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:06,263
He's right. Vernon can help
them.

340
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,468
Come on.

341
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,874
You go with them.

342
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:21,178
We'll go on down the ford, meet
you on the other side.

343
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,813
I don't advise it.

344
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:26,216
Come on, Vardaman.

345
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:29,319
I gave her my word!

346
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,455
It is sacred on me.

347
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:35,058
I know you begrudge it...

348
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,362
but she will bless you in
heaven.

349
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:44,367
This is fool's work. Y'all
should'a laid over a day.

350
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,205
Water's gonna go down, ain't
gonna rain no more.

351
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,607
Surely ain't gonna get no
higher.

352
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:56,846
It's the turning back. It ain't
no luck in turning back.

353
00:36:56,848 --> 00:37:02,319
I give her my word. She's a-
counting on it.

354
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,572
The dark current runs.

355
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,175
Talks up to us in a murmur...

356
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:28,078
become ceaseless and myriad.

357
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,082
Fading swirls move along the
surface for an instant...

358
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,484
silent, impermanent...

359
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,386
profoundly significant...

360
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:39,723
as though something just beneath
the surface...

361
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:42,125
huge and alive...

362
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,794
was waked for a moment.

363
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,533
I reckon we're still on the
road.

364
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,439
Tull taken and cut down those
two big white oaks.

365
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,042
I hear tell, at high water in
the old days...

366
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,878
people used to ford by those
trees.

367
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,814
If I'd suspicioned it, I coulda
come out here last week

368
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,617
and taken sight of it.

369
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,087
There's no way we coulda knowed.

370
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,823
What do you want me to do?

371
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,699
All right, I'm gonna go on
ahead...

372
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:26,836
and y'all just follow where I
am, okay?

373
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,842
I ain't gonna let nothing
happen to you. okay.

374
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:36,880
It's just you and me. I ain't
gonna let nothing happen to you.

375
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,848
Come on. Come on.

376
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,853
Come on. Come on now.

377
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,604
Guys! This way!

378
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,043
Guys, here! The ford is over
here!

379
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,085
This is it, Jewel! Right here!

380
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,120
Wait! Jewel, wait!

381
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,223
It ain't on a balance!

382
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:25,161
Well, then go back and walk on
the goddamn bridge, both you and
Darl! You let me on that!

383
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,597
Ride back and cross, too! Walk
across the bridge...

384
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,268
and meet us on the other bank
with the rope, and then Vernon
will take your horse!

385
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,170
- There's some loose logs!

386
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,872
- Yeah, you go to hell!

387
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,274
Take the rope around the other
bank!

388
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,778
Three ain't no better than two.
We got one to drive and one to
balance.

389
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,681
I don't care what we do just so
long as we do something!

390
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:47,083
Sitting here not doing a goddamn
thing!

391
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:51,488
Take the rope and meet us on the
other side! Can you do that
jewel?

392
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,258
You might as well hop off now
and go across the bridge, too,
if you want.

393
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,261
I'll stay. Might take two of us.

394
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,129
Watch yourself!

395
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:01,231
I'm on it! Come on!

396
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:05,402
Come on! Come on then, you can
come to me, all right?

397
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,770
Come on!

398
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,037
Watch it! Log!

399
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,006
Jewel! Let the rope go!

400
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,541
Go! Go!

401
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,101
I used to hear the dark land
talking God's love...

402
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,037
His beauty and His sin.

403
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,542
Hearing the dark voicelessness
in which words are deeds

404
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,512
and the other words that are not
deeds

405
00:41:55,514 --> 00:42:01,217
just the gaps in people's lack
coming down like the cries of
the

406
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:07,190
geese in the wild darkness in
the old terrible nights.

407
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:14,831
Anse had a word, too. Love, he
called it.

408
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:19,369
But I had been used to words for
a long time.

409
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:23,673
I knew that word was like the
others.

410
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:27,810
Just a shape to fill a lack.

411
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,226
When I knew that I had Cash...

412
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,129
I knew that life was terrible

413
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:50,700
and that this was the answer to
it.

414
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:55,004
That was when I learned that
words are no good.

415
00:42:55,006 --> 00:43:00,510
Words don't ever fit even what
they are trying to say at.

416
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:05,615
When he was borned, I knew
motherhood was invented by
someone

417
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:08,017
who had to have a word for it

418
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,620
Because the ones that had the
children...

419
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:15,625
didn't care if there was a word
for it or not.

420
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:21,898
Sometimes I would lay by him in
the dark...

421
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,604
hearing the dark land that was
now of my blood and flesh

422
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:31,207
and I would think, "Anse."

423
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,110
"Why Anse? Why is he Anse?"

424
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:38,615
And I would think about his name
until, after a while

425
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:41,918
I could see the word as a
shape...

426
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,153
a vessel.

427
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:48,658
I would watch him liquefy and
flow into it...

428
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,262
until the jar stood full and
motionless.

429
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,874
I told Cora one day...

430
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:09,879
that he was my cross, and he
would be my salvation.

431
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:14,017
He would save me from the water
and the fire.

432
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:18,221
Even though I had laid down my
life...

433
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:20,223
he would save me.

434
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:28,064
She told me it was sinful when
she realized how we were talking
about God.

435
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:33,603
But sin and love and fear are
just sounds

436
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:39,909
that people who have never
sinned nor loved nor feared,
have.

437
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:44,414
But what they never had, and
cannot have...

438
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:48,718
until they forget the words.

439
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,821
She wanted me to pray, ask for
forgiveness...

440
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:58,127
because to people to whom sin is
just a matter of words

441
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:03,266
to them, "salvation" is just
words, too.

442
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:13,042
I would think of him as dressed
in sin.

443
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:17,480
I would think of him as thinking
of me...

444
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:19,549
as dressed also in sin.

445
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,951
Even more beautiful...

446
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:27,290
because the garment he exchanged
for sin was sanctified.

447
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:36,165
I would think of the sin as
garments which we would remove.

448
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,936
And then it was over.

449
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,649
He gave me jewel.

450
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:57,220
and jewel was my salvation.

451
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,860
His grace be upon this house!

452
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,400
He got the saw, Cash!

453
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:49,872
I got the rule! Found the rule,
Cash!

454
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:52,542
He got your saw, Cash!

455
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,878
He got your saw!

456
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,404
I'm going to Armstid's.

457
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,106
give cash help.

458
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,953
After school was out and the
last one had left

459
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:41,524
with his dirty little snuffling
nose

460
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,126
instead of going home, I would
go down the hill

461
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:47,964
to the spring where I could be
quiet

462
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:50,166
and hate them.

463
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,904
I would have to look at them day
after day...

464
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:59,709
each with his and her sacred
selfish thought.

465
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:03,679
And I would look forward to the
times when they faulted

466
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:06,549
so I could whip them.

467
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:11,554
When the switch fell, I could
feel it upon my flesh.

468
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:16,292
When it welted and ridged it was
my blood that ran...

469
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:20,096
and I would think with each blow
of the switch:

470
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:22,398
Now you are aware of me!

471
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:28,304
Doc Peabody had gone down below
Inverness somewhere...

472
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:32,108
but Uncle Billy's coming. He's a
horse doctor.

473
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,411
But he's about the closer we
come now.

474
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,813
Well...

475
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:40,917
what y'all thinking?

476
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,656
In here, Uncle Billy.

477
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:03,072
What you been into now, boy?

478
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,414
All right, get me a chair and a
big glass of whiskey.

479
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:15,718
Lucky for him, that were the
same leg he broke last summer.

480
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,689
Me and you might got a different
notion of what's lucky.

481
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:21,657
I reckon I get your point.

482
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,059
But can you help him?

483
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:27,363
Well, men ain't so different
from a horse or a mule...

484
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,464
except maybe...

485
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:33,369
horse or a mule might have a
little more sense.

486
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,740
I want you to drink this.

487
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,244
All of it.

488
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:48,150
It's okay to holler, boy, if you
feel like you need to.

489
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,820
All right, need some help
holding him down.

490
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,889
Hold him down. Hold him still.

491
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:58,227
Hold him still. Put a bite on
him.

492
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:00,863
Bite on it. Put the rag in your
mouth and bite on it.

493
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:03,032
Bite. All right.

494
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,168
Is he all right?

495
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,628
He's all right.

496
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:38,200
I'm gonna need some help with
these splints while he's out.

497
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,158
You're welcome to the use of my
team.

498
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,928
I thank you, but she'll want to
go in ourn.

499
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,330
Well...

500
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:12,101
You might wanna think about
Snopes.

501
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:15,237
He's got three, four span.

502
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,840
Maybe one of them'd suit you.

503
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:20,943
He a close man to trade with.

504
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:22,478
Yeah

505
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:28,684
But I reckon I can talk him
around.

506
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,265
How does it taste, huh?

507
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,436
Go! Get outta here! Leave! Go!

508
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:24,940
Go! Go! Get outta here! Shoo!

509
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,676
Get off! Go! Shoo! Shoo!

510
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:31,814
Get out of here! Just go!

511
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,216
Git! Shoo!

512
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:38,354
Go! Go! shoo! Shoo!

513
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,024
Go! Leave my Mama alone! Go!

514
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:47,296
You've got to do something. It's
an outrage. He should be lawed
for treating her so.

515
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,899
He's getting her in the ground
best he can.

516
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:52,301
Dear Lord! That smell!

517
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:55,738
You have to do something.

518
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:08,284
Anse! Anse!

519
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,220
He's gone.

520
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,822
Where's Anse?

521
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:17,126
Done light out this morning
trade for a new team with
Snopes.

522
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:19,728
How'd he get there?

523
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,730
Jewel's horse.

524
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,836
I didn't think he'd ever let
nobody else touch that beast.

525
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,273
Never has.

526
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:37,680
I don't mean no offense, but...

527
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:41,817
smell, smell's getting pretty
bad.

528
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,322
I know.

529
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,060
Come on eat now.

530
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:53,462
You, too, Jewel.

531
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:56,365
Jewel, come on eat!

532
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,430
Pa's home!

533
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,769
Got us a team.

534
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,405
Got a team from Snopes?

535
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:41,410
I reckon Snopes ain't the only
fella in this town itching to
drive a trade.

536
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:46,115
A fella that just beat Snopes in
a trade ought to feel pretty
darn good.

537
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:49,018
What you give him, Anse?

538
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,522
I give him a chattel mortgage on
my seeder and cultivator.

539
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:57,326
That ain't worth more than $40.

540
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:59,928
I give other things.

541
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,331
What other things?

542
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,700
Other things.

543
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:08,270
That's what he was doing in
Cash's clothes last night.

544
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:13,709
You know he was planning to buy
that talking machine from
Suratt.

545
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,612
That's just $8.

546
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:20,749
That ain't enough to buy another
team.

547
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:27,556
Lord knows...

548
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:30,993
if there were ere a man.

549
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,938
And the horse.

550
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,444
What horse?

551
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:53,716
We give him the horse right
after we bury your mother.

552
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,822
You mean, you think you swapped
my horse?

553
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:01,123
My horse?

554
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,495
Five months hard work...

555
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:11,100
clear near 40 acres of Quick's
field to earn it.

556
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:21,009
For 15 year I ain't had a tooth
in my head.

557
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,711
Lord knows...

558
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:27,015
for 15 year He know that I ain't
had the victuals...

559
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:32,721
that He aimed for man to eat to
keep his strength up.

560
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,525
And me saving a nickel here and
a nickel there...

561
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:41,563
so my family wouldn't suffer it,
to buy them!

562
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:45,834
And I thought that if I could do
without eating...

563
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:49,171
my son could do without riding!

564
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:51,140
God knows I did!

565
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,028
Hell

566
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,777
Come on. Up!

567
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:44,359
Where's Jewel? We can't leave
without Jewel.

568
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:45,994
Jewel disappeared with his
horse.

569
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:50,299
Be the last time we see Jewel,
sure enough.

570
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:54,102
Maybe they get a postcard from
him down in Texas, I reckon.

571
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:58,640
Anse Bundren is an outrage
against decency.

572
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:03,212
I be darn if he ain't a sight.

573
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:18,627
How you feeling, Cash?

574
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,562
It don't bother none.

575
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:23,999
You want me to prop it up some?

576
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,111
You all right?

577
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,546
It's just on a bump...

578
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:40,649
it kinda grinds together a
little bit on a bump.

579
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:42,551
But it don't bother nothing.

580
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:46,355
Is it because Jewel's mother is
a horse, Darl?

581
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:47,623
Is that why he went away?

582
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,757
That's part of it.

583
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:51,393
Hey, Cash, you want me to
tighten this?

584
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,996
If you just would.

585
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:55,197
That hurt?

586
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,034
Maybe just put it back down.

587
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,235
Hurt?

588
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,638
It don't bother none.

589
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,506
You want Pa to slow down?

590
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:07,409
No. There's no point in slowing
down now.

591
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:10,512
It don't bother nothing.

592
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:13,615
I reckon we gotta get him some
medicine.

593
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:16,718
There ain't no way around it.

594
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,655
Just tell him to go on.

595
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:33,001
Them cakes is gonna be nice by
the time we get to Jefferson.

596
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:38,307
You best sell them in Mottson,
if you know what I'm saying.

597
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,877
When will we get to Mottson,
Darl?

598
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:46,882
Tomorrow. If this team don't
step itself to pieces.

599
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:50,686
I think Snopes fed them on
sawdust.

600
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:54,823
Why did he feed them on sawdust,
Darl?

601
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,127
Look.

602
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:38,927
I couldn't see. I couldn't feel.

603
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,196
I couldn't feel the bed under
me.

604
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:44,299
And I couldn't think of where I
was.

605
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:48,103
I couldn't think of my name. I
couldn't even think I am a
girl...

606
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:52,174
but I knew that something was.
but I couldn't even think of
time

607
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:58,980
Then, all of a sudden, I knew
that something was.

608
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:03,018
It was wind blowing over me.

609
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:07,989
I believe in God. I believe in
God.

610
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:12,227
I believe in God. I believe in
God.

611
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,629
God, I believe in God.

612
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:18,300
I believe in God. I believe in
God.

613
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:22,070
I believe in God.

614
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:48,230
Gonna hawl a little. Gonna hawl
a little.

615
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,966
Pepper! Pepper!

616
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:59,107
Dewey, make it quick.

617
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:14,790
Where you going? Where she
going?

618
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,637
What can I do for you?

619
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,341
You looking for some toilet
things, or is it medicine you
want?

620
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:35,010
That's it?

621
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:37,913
I'd rather go back there.

622
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,217
All right.

623
01:03:55,097 --> 01:04:01,503
What's the trouble? Tell me what
it is you want. I'm pretty busy.

624
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,205
It's a female trouble.

625
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:08,176
Is that all? Where's your Ma?
Haven't you got one?

626
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,579
She's out yonder in the wagon.

627
01:04:10,581 --> 01:04:14,382
Why don't you talk to her about
it before you take any medicine?

628
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:19,221
I mean, any woman would tell you
about it.

629
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:25,827
Are you too regular or not
regular enough?

630
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:29,631
Yes, I reckon so. Yes.

631
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:33,068
Well, which? Don't you know?

632
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,674
You want something to stop it,
is that it?

633
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:43,979
No. You see, it's already
stopped.

634
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:46,882
Oh, well, we--

635
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:52,320
You're not married, are you?

636
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:53,622
No.

637
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:59,527
Well, I don't have anything in
my store for you...

638
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:03,331
and I'd advise you to go home
and tell your Pa, if you have
one...

639
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:08,303
and let him make somebody buy
you a wedding license.

640
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:10,906
But I got the money to pay you.

641
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:13,308
A thousand dollars wouldn't be
enough in my store.

642
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:16,945
Ten cents wouldn't be enough.

643
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,220
Howdy.

644
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:28,156
Can I have a bag of cement?

645
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,394
That'll be 50 cents.

646
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,396
50 cents?

647
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,502
Could I have 10 cents worth?

648
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:43,271
10 cents--? For what?

649
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,976
My brother broke his leg.

650
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:49,144
- What?

651
01:05:49,146 --> 01:05:51,579
- You gotta get this wagon outta
here.

652
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:55,850
It's a public street! I reckon
we can stop to buy something
same as any other man.

653
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:59,888
We got the money to pay for it,
and there ain't any law--

654
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:02,290
I just want 10 cents worth.

655
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,626
I don't wanna break a sack.

656
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:08,630
Don't you know you'll cause that
boy to lose his leg?

657
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:12,467
You take him to the doctor.

658
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:19,841
I would like 10 cents worth of
cement.

659
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,309
Fine.

660
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,081
Just get that boy to a doctor.

661
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,483
You get this thing buried as
soon as you can.

662
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,920
Don't you know you're tempting
jail for Endangering the public
health?

663
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:34,022
We're doing the best we can.

664
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:37,993
We woulda set out to bury her
today, but had to wait for that
boy to bring the wagon back.

665
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:39,561
Shut up, Pa!

666
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:41,763
Sir, I'm sorry. We'll be gone in
a minute.

667
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:43,164
Get this man to a doctor.

668
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,301
Ain't got to worry about me.
I'm fine.

669
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:50,071
Hurry up, Dewey Dell! We done
lost too much time.

670
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:54,642
We ain't gonna discommode you no
more.

671
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,611
Pepper!

672
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,551
(indistinct)

673
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,632
Here a place.

674
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:57,072
Right here. Hold, mule. Hold,
mule.

675
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,842
We could get some water over
yonder.

676
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:05,146
Dewey Dell, you better go see
you can borrow a bucket.

677
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:11,853
Guess you had less luck than you
expected selling them cakes in
Mottson.

678
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:23,531
We better not try and lift him
down. We fix it here.

679
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,868
When we get to Jefferson,
tomorrow?

680
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,270
I could just last it out.

681
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,873
It'll be easier this way on you.

682
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,641
It won't rub together.

683
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:35,443
But I can last it out.

684
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,746
And we'll lose time if we stop
now.

685
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:41,850
We done bought the cement now.

686
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:45,653
Listen, I can last it out.

687
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:48,056
It's just one more day.

688
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:51,926
And it don't bother none. It
sets up so.

689
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:54,662
We done bought it now.

690
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,106
How's that look?

691
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:08,943
You don't wanna put too much
water in it...

692
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,845
or it won't work right.

693
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:12,380
How's that?

694
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:17,118
You know, maybe if you... y'all
could find some sand.

695
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,723
Vardaman, go on and get some
sand.

696
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,063
I can last it out...

697
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:32,200
if it's just one more day, you
know?

698
01:09:32,202 --> 01:09:35,603
'Cause it don't bother none.

699
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:43,745
All right.

700
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:47,982
Careful with that there.

701
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:50,418
Bring your leg out.

702
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,526
Just mind it so it don't get on
-

703
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:01,329
How's that feel?

704
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:03,231
It feels fine.

705
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:08,970
It feels cold and good on there.
It feels fine.

706
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:12,340
If it'll only help...

707
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,176
I ask your forgiveness.

708
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:19,847
I couldn't have foreseen it more
than you.

709
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,951
I feel fine.

710
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,558
All right?

711
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,695
I think it's gonna rain.

712
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,619
Look, there's Jewel!

713
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,383
Where that horse?

714
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:34,555
Delivered him to Snopes himself.

715
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,692
You did right.

716
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,440
This here sure got me tired.

717
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:56,778
Darl, if Snopes didn't feed them
mules on sawdust...

718
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:01,983
would they be able to make the
hill without us have to get out
and walk?

719
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,985
Maybe.

720
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:17,799
Dewey Dell, when we stop at
night in the barn, where do them
buzzards stay?

721
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:24,005
I asked Darl. He doesn't know
neither.

722
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:32,847
Tonight I'm gonna see where them
buzzards stay while we're in the
barn.

723
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,186
Where you going? Hate to
discommode you.

724
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:40,421
Well, no, sirs, ain't no
trouble.

725
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:44,225
But we wonder about that leg,
though.

726
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:47,128
How's that feeling, son?

727
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:54,569
It's getting a little bit hot
from being in the sun like that
all day.

728
01:12:57,172 --> 01:13:02,377
You want some water poured on
it? Maybe that'll ease it some.

729
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:05,446
I'd be obliged.

730
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:08,549
It's just from being in the sun
all day.

731
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:13,154
I ought to kept my mind on it to
kept it covered.

732
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,967
How's that feel?

733
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:32,874
I'm obliged. That feels fine.

734
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:37,412
Well, you folks...

735
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:41,682
you have a good night. We'll be
right inside if you need
anything else.

736
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:42,717
Fine.

737
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,521
Cash, see if you can get some
sleep.

738
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:50,625
Sure. Yeah, it feels fine.

739
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,035
I miss Ma.

740
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:03,037
Come here.

741
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,246
Put your head right down there.

742
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:14,215
Listen.

743
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:19,487
Can you hear?

744
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:24,225
Yeah?

745
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:25,460
I can hear her.

746
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:26,727
You hear?

747
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:33,234
What's she saying, Darl? Who's
she talking to?

748
01:14:33,236 --> 01:14:35,636
Talking to God.

749
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,773
She's calling on Him to help
her.

750
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:41,676
What she wanting to do?

751
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:47,582
She wants Him to hide her from
the sight of man.

752
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:51,719
Why does she want to get hid
away, Darl?

753
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,089
So she can lay down her life.

754
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:59,160
Why does she wanna lay down her
life?

755
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,832
Just listen.

756
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,571
Listen.

757
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,974
You can hear?

758
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,979
She's been calling out.

759
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:23,684
Ever since the river, she's been
calling out.

760
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,442
What are they doing, Dewey Dell?

761
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:50,845
They're bringing Ma on the barn.

762
01:15:50,847 --> 01:15:54,649
They don't wanna leave her
outdoors all night.

763
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:57,985
I can smell her. Can you smell
her, too?

764
01:15:57,987 --> 01:15:59,987
Hush.

765
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:34,989
I went looking to find where
them buzzards stay at night.

766
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:38,793
I saw something Dewey Dell told
me not tell nobody.

767
01:16:38,795 --> 01:16:42,430
It's not about Pa and it's not
about Cash...

768
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:45,700
and it's not about Jewel and
it's not about Dewey Dell...

769
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:49,103
and it's not about me.

770
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,608
Help! Fire! There's a fire!

771
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,010
Pa! Pa!

772
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,680
Let's get the mules!

773
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:36,517
Get the mules! Get the mules!

774
01:17:36,519 --> 01:17:38,719
Come on.

775
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,758
Look out!

776
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,370
Jewel! Jewel!

777
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:06,414
Jewel! Jewel!

778
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:15,456
Stop him! Jewel!

779
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:18,159
Stop him!

780
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,364
Where Darl?

781
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,369
Where Darl got to?

782
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:14,141
Your foot look funny, Cash.

783
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:19,914
I reckon we gonna have to bust
that off.

784
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,229
You take that off, gonna take
the hide, too.

785
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:37,865
Why in tarnation did you put it
on there?

786
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:40,267
I thought it might steady it
some.

787
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:43,571
Didn't anybody think to grease
his leg first?

788
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:46,774
I only aimed to help him.

789
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:49,443
It was Darl put it on.

790
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,948
Where is Darl?

791
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,084
Where is Darl?

792
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,103
Oh, God.

793
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:19,240
Be it best to leave it on.

794
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:27,414
You gonna keep the cat away,
Darl?

795
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:39,059
You needn't to cry. Jewel got
her out. You needn't to cry,
Darl.

796
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:44,064
If you could just travel out
into time, that would be nice.

797
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:49,870
It'd be nice if you could just
travel out into time.

798
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:57,478
Takes two people to make you.
and one people to die.

799
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:01,148
It's how the world will end.

800
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:04,018
Can you still hear her?

801
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,866
Hey, Darl, we close to
Jefferson?

802
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:21,068
Yeah.

803
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:25,105
Life was created in the valleys.

804
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,408
It was blew up on the hills on
the old terrors...

805
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:29,910
the old lusts and the old
despair.

806
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:35,516
That's why you must walk up the
hills, so you can ride down.

807
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:36,717
I gotta stop.

808
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,619
What for?

809
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,120
I gotta go to the bushes.

810
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,723
Can't you wait till we get to
town?

811
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:45,459
Stop! I gotta go to the bushes!

812
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,263
Hold, mule!

813
01:22:55,203 --> 01:23:00,541
Leave them cakes. We'll look
after them.

814
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:04,745
We gonna have to take him to the
doctor.

815
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:08,148
I reckon we just have to.

816
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,886
We ought to send word from
Gillespie's...

817
01:23:12,888 --> 01:23:15,789
have someone get that grave
ready.

818
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:20,327
I just never wanna be beholden
to none but her flesh and blood.

819
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:23,430
Who can't dig a damn hole in the
ground?

820
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:29,169
It ain't respectful talking that
way about your Ma's grave!

821
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:33,474
You just don't know what it is.

822
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:37,611
You never pure loved her, none
of you.

823
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:47,121
I thought I told you to leave
them clothes to home.

824
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:58,332
Pepper! Come on, mule.

825
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,536
How many more hills now, Darl?

826
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,238
Just one.

827
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:08,275
Next one goes all the way into
town.

828
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,281
Hold, mule!

829
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:54,188
I reckon we gotta slide it in
yonder.

830
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,524
They got...

831
01:24:57,526 --> 01:25:03,030
one or two Christians inside,
I'm betting.

832
01:25:03,032 --> 01:25:06,266
What we need is some shovels. We
can go to a hardware store.

833
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,168
That costs money!

834
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:11,138
You begrudge her it?

835
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:59,039
Skeet, there's a woman up front
that wants to see the doctor.

836
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:02,676
I said, "What doctor do you want
to see?", she said, the doctor
that works here.

837
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:07,114
When I told her there ain't any
doctor works here, she just
stood there, looking this way.

838
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:11,118
What kind of woman is it? Tell
her to go upstairs to Alford's
office.

839
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,020
- Country woman.

840
01:28:13,022 --> 01:28:14,821
- Send her to the courthouse.

841
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:18,025
Tell her all the doctors have
gone to Memphis to a barbers'
convention.

842
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:21,895
All right. She's just pretty
nice for a country girl.

843
01:28:21,897 --> 01:28:24,598
Wait. Wait.

844
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:41,048
What can I do for you?

845
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:42,949
Are you the doctor?

846
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:44,418
Sure.

847
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:48,755
Can we go back yonder?

848
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,895
Now...

849
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:57,297
madam...

850
01:28:57,299 --> 01:28:59,232
what is your trouble?

851
01:28:59,234 --> 01:29:03,537
It's a female trouble. I got the
money.

852
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:05,906
Have you got female trouble is
all?

853
01:29:05,908 --> 01:29:09,910
Or you want female trouble? If
this so, you've come to the
right doctor.

854
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:11,812
- No.

855
01:29:11,814 --> 01:29:13,513
No which?

856
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:16,950
I ain't had it. That's it.

857
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,853
I got the money.

858
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:29,096
You got something in your belly
you wished you didn't have.

859
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:38,305
'Course you realize I could be
put in the Penitentiary after
doing what you want?

860
01:29:38,307 --> 01:29:40,707
I would lose my license.

861
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:43,310
Then I'd have to go to work.

862
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:45,579
You realize that.

863
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:48,882
I ain't got but $10...

864
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:52,886
but I could bring the rest next
month, maybe.

865
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,088
Ten dollars.

866
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:58,892
You see, I can't put no price on
my knowledge and skill.

867
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:01,495
Certainly not for a little
poultry sawbuck.

868
01:30:01,497 --> 01:30:04,464
What do you want then?

869
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:11,171
You guess three times, then I'll
show you.

870
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:18,879
I got to do something.

871
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:36,930
You come back 10 o'clock
tonight, I give you the rest of
it.

872
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:38,632
Will it work?

873
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:42,769
Sure it'll work. If you come
back and get it.

874
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:08,595
Get on up outta there.

875
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:39,860
Fill it in.

876
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,565
Go on.

877
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,153
Darl Bundren?

878
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:16,263
Yeah.

879
01:32:16,265 --> 01:32:20,000
How does Gillespie know it was
Darl that done it?

880
01:32:20,002 --> 01:32:24,871
Vardaman swore he never told
nobody but me.

881
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:32,913
If Vardaman never told nobody
but you, how come they know it?

882
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:35,315
It don't matter.

883
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:38,385
What matters is Gillespie knows.

884
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:40,787
He'd suspicioned it sooner or
later.

885
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:43,924
I reckon it ain't no way around
it.

886
01:32:43,926 --> 01:32:47,727
We got to send him to Jackson.

887
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:50,830
It's either that or Gillespie
sue us.

888
01:32:50,832 --> 01:32:53,433
So you wanna fix him now?

889
01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:54,634
Fix him?

890
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:56,369
Yeah, catch him. Tie him up.

891
01:32:56,371 --> 01:33:01,575
Or you wanna wait till he sets
fire to the goddamn team and
wagon?

892
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:03,777
He's crazy!

893
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:12,786
That's 'cause Jewel was too hard
on him.

894
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:15,188
I thought about it more than
once...

895
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:18,491
before we crossed the river and
after...

896
01:33:18,493 --> 01:33:20,894
that it would be God's
blessing...

897
01:33:20,896 --> 01:33:23,496
if He'd taken her out of our
hands...

898
01:33:23,498 --> 01:33:27,100
and we got shut of her in some
clean way.

899
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:32,105
It seemed to me, when Jewel was
working to get her out in the
river...

900
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:36,443
he was going against God in a
way.

901
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:42,115
And when Darl seen that it
looked like one of us was gonna
have to do something...

902
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:47,854
well, I can almost believe that
he done right, in a way.

903
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:51,658
But that don't excuse burning
down a man's barn...

904
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:58,398
or endangering his stock, or
destroying his property.

905
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,202
I guess there ain't no excuse
for what Darl did...

906
01:34:02,204 --> 01:34:07,841
endangering that stock,
destroying his property.

907
01:34:07,843 --> 01:34:12,178
I reckon that's how a man's
crazy.

908
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:17,183
He can't see eye to eye with
other folks.

909
01:34:17,185 --> 01:34:20,286
And I suppose there ain't much
you can do...

910
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:25,792
except for what it is that most
folks says is right.

911
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:31,297
But it's a shame in a way.

912
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:40,140
Are you Darl Bundren?

913
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:45,145
You better come with us.

914
01:34:46,247 --> 01:34:48,948
Get off me! Cash!

915
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:51,785
- Cash!

916
01:34:51,787 --> 01:34:53,186
- You son of a bitch!

917
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:54,888
- Cash!

918
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,557
- All right. Dewey, let go of
him!

919
01:34:57,559 --> 01:34:59,993
Cash, I thought you woulda told
me.

920
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:04,030
I never thought you wouldn't
have told me.

921
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:05,331
Cash?

922
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:11,471
All right, all right, all right.

923
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:22,215
You can scratch at me all you
want.

924
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:28,822
Maybe, you see, if I'm gone...

925
01:35:28,824 --> 01:35:31,057
no one'll know.

926
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:37,664
Ain't gonna go away, just like
whatever you got in that box

927
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:40,400
ain't gonna make it go away.

928
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:44,971
And you...

929
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:53,747
What, you think the questions
are just gonna go away just
'cause I ain't here to ask them?

930
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:56,216
Darl...

931
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:59,285
Is this what you want?

932
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:03,323
Maybe it'll be better for you.

933
01:36:03,325 --> 01:36:06,559
It's quiet down there without
all the bothering.

934
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:08,962
Is that what you think I am?

935
01:36:08,964 --> 01:36:11,364
It'll be better for you, Darl.

936
01:36:11,366 --> 01:36:13,066
Better? Better?

937
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:15,668
It's quiet down there, yeah.

938
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:18,772
Is that what you think I am?

939
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:21,841
It'll be better for you.

940
01:36:21,843 --> 01:36:23,676
Maybe it'll be better.

941
01:36:23,678 --> 01:36:26,379
Maybe. Maybe!

942
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,501
Vardaman, come here.

943
01:37:47,928 --> 01:37:51,764
It was getting right
noticeable...

944
01:37:51,766 --> 01:37:54,901
the smell, that is.

945
01:37:54,903 --> 01:37:59,005
We didn't have no time to waste.

946
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:03,710
It don't bother none.

947
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:06,079
Don't you lie there and tell me
that.

948
01:38:06,081 --> 01:38:08,481
You with all that time on a
wagon...

949
01:38:08,483 --> 01:38:14,921
with no springs and a broken
leg, and it don't bother you.

950
01:38:14,923 --> 01:38:17,123
Well...

951
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:21,160
It don't bother much.

952
01:38:21,162 --> 01:38:26,199
You mean, it don't bother Anse
much.

953
01:38:26,201 --> 01:38:29,335
Why don't he just take you over
to the nearest sawmill...

954
01:38:29,337 --> 01:38:33,840
and put your leg in a saw? That
woulda cured it.

955
01:38:33,842 --> 01:38:36,042
And you all coulda taken...

956
01:38:36,044 --> 01:38:42,949
Anse over to the saw, stuck his
head in there and cured the
whole family.

957
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:47,954
Son, this toe is gangrenous.

958
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:21,521
Get it off, Doc! Take it! Go!
Go!

959
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,880
You wait out here.

960
01:39:47,882 --> 01:39:49,082
Why can't I come in?

961
01:39:49,084 --> 01:39:50,984
I wanna come in, too.

962
01:39:50,986 --> 01:39:52,318
You wait out here.

963
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
All right.

964
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:17,577
You want something?

965
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:19,612
A banana.

966
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:27,220
Where is it?

967
01:40:31,992 --> 01:40:33,192
There it is.

968
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,595
And you're sure it'll work?

969
01:40:35,597 --> 01:40:41,601
Sure. As long as you take the
rest of the treatment.

970
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,737
Where do I take it?

971
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,709
Let me show you.

972
01:40:58,986 --> 01:41:01,387
That's what you want.

973
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:03,990
That's what you came back for?

974
01:41:03,992 --> 01:41:07,360
That's what you came back for.

975
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:13,366
Take that little seed out. Take
the little acorn that you got
in.

976
01:41:13,368 --> 01:41:17,437
Yeah, that's what you came back
for.

977
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:22,442
I'm gonna fix you.

978
01:41:26,146 --> 01:41:30,450
My brother, they say he went
crazy.

979
01:41:30,452 --> 01:41:33,586
But he went to Jackson, too.

980
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:38,591
Jackson is further away than
crazy.

981
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:43,796
He had to get on a train to go
to Jackson.

982
01:41:43,798 --> 01:41:47,433
I've not been on a train.

983
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:50,837
But Darl has been on a train.

984
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:53,840
Darl.

985
01:41:53,842 --> 01:41:56,542
Darl is my brother.

986
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:12,792
Why do I laugh?

987
01:42:13,894 --> 01:42:17,029
Why do you laugh, Darl?

988
01:42:17,031 --> 01:42:20,099
Is it because you hate the sound
of laughter?

989
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:23,202
Is that why you laughing, Darl?

990
01:42:23,204 --> 01:42:26,539
Is it because your mother is a
fish?

991
01:42:26,541 --> 01:42:28,207
A horse?

992
01:42:28,209 --> 01:42:31,144
Is it because you no longer have
a mother?

993
01:42:31,146 --> 01:42:37,517
Because you hear the dark lands
speaking of God and His beauty
and His sin?

994
01:42:37,519 --> 01:42:39,919
Because we use each other with
words...

995
01:42:39,921 --> 01:42:44,824
<i>like spiders hanging by their</i>
<i>mouths from the rafters...</i>

996
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:49,295
swinging and twisting and never
<i>touching.</i>

997
01:43:58,365 --> 01:44:00,566
He got them teeth.

998
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:15,348
Who's that?

999
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:18,451
That there is Cash.

1000
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:20,853
That there is Jewel.

1001
01:44:20,855 --> 01:44:24,991
That Vardaman, and that's Dewey
Dell.

1002
01:44:26,793 --> 01:44:29,495
Meet Mrs. Bundren.

1003
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:22,682
Pepper.

1004
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:28,387
It's gonna be a little.
