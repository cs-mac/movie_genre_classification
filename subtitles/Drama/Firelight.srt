2
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,080
Sit down, dear.

3
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,160
This one is Swiss
by nationality.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
Two years employment
here in London as a governess--

5
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,960
piano, drawing, French,
of course.

6
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,680
- How old are you, dear?
- Twenty-two.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,160
- Are you in good health?
- Yes.

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,400
- Are both your parents still living?
- My mother is dead.

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,840
What was the cause
ofyour mother's death, dear?

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,840
She died in childbirth.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,240
- Ask her to stand up.
- Stand up, dear.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,840
Turn around.

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,240
All the way.

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,240
Ask her what the money's for.

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,560
Her father's in debt,
it seems.

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,760
Does she have any other income,
any other way of making money?

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,160
Sit down, dear.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,720
The gentleman asks, do you have no other
way to raise the sum that you need?

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,600
Does the gentleman
have any suggestions?

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,320
My dear, you're very pretty.
You could marry, you know.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,400
Yes, I could
sell myself for life.

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,240
The gentleman's needs, as I understand
it, are of a shorter duration.

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,360
Has she done this before?

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,560
- The gentleman asks--
- Can the gentleman not ask for himself?

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,280
You're not to know who he is, my dear.
No one is to know.

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,200
He need not tell me his name.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,200
I'd like to hear his voice.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,801
What can you tell from a voice?

29
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,161
A little.

30
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:35,921
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

31
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,921
No, never.

32
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,481
Will you do it?

33
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,161
Of course.
Why else am I here?

34
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,801
Shall I look further?

35
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,001
No, this is the one.

36
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:49,482
I hope you don't mind. I didn't want
to be seen entering the room with you.

37
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:59,402
- I'm afraid I can't introduce
myself, as you know.
- Yes.

38
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:04,082
- Did you have a smooth crossing?
- For the most part.

39
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:07,802
- Is the hotel to your liking?
- I have no complaints.

40
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,802
Please.

41
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:15,282
It's of the utmost importance that
we're not seen together in public...

42
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:17,562
over these next few days.

43
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:24,242
I have a reputation to protect,
not just for myself, but for others.

44
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:36,562
Do you understand?

45
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:38,282
Yes.

46
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:41,802
We'll meet together each evening
after dinner here in your room.

47
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,802
As you wish.

48
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:47,682
Are we to--

49
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,762
to meet this evening?

50
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:53,762
Yes.

51
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:55,962
We only have three evenings.

52
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,682
When are we to begin?

53
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,882
I thought you might like
a little time to accustom yourself.

54
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:07,762
I have accustomed myself.

55
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:09,762
I'm ready now.

56
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,602
The fire gives more light
than one expects.

57
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,602
Does it trouble you?

58
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:36,762
No.

59
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,482
Will this do?

60
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:09,683
Yes.

61
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:29,763
Perhaps you think
I'm no better than him.

62
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:34,683
I think nothing.

63
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:38,723
You thinkwhat we're doing
is wrong?

64
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,083
You at least...

65
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:49,963
are doing it for someone else.

66
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:55,123
I, too, have a duty
to someone else.

67
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:01,203
Then, sir, since neither of us
are here for our own pleasure...

68
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:04,963
perhaps what we do
isn't so very wrong.

69
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:47,643
I don't want to know your name.
I don't want to know anything about you.

70
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:15,403
Aren't you afraid
to be seen with me?

71
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:17,523
There's no one to see.

72
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:21,003
I like it here.

73
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,803
Just sea and sky and--

74
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:25,803
And nothing.

75
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,723
I like it.

76
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:32,404
- Makes me want to shout.
- Then shout.

77
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,004
No, it's not so easy.

78
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,844
You're very--

79
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:13,164
I didn't expect it
to be like this.

80
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:18,524
What did you expect?

81
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:23,844
Last night...

82
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,444
I thought--

83
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:34,604
For a moment I thought that--

84
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:38,284
You thought that I liked it?

85
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:42,924
Did you?

86
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,084
No.

87
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:55,324
But I could.

88
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:24,484
Oh, I wish--

89
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:27,484
What do you wish?

90
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,924
I wish I could shout.

91
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:11,524
So, Mrs Jago will see to everything
when the time comes.

92
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,124
Yes, I know it all.

93
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:17,204
We made an arrangement.
I accept it.

94
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,124
You won't want to be seen
disembarking in my company.

95
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:25,124
Uh, no.

96
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:31,564
Goodbye, then.

97
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:14,925
Over soon, my dear.

98
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,925
- It's a little girl.
- Is she all there?

99
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:43,365
Oh, yes, she's beautiful.

100
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:47,245
Best to take her away at once.

101
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:52,885
There, my pet.
All over now.

102
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,765
I don't even know your name.

103
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:34,765
Happy birthday, darling.

104
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:41,045
I don't forget you.

105
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,445
You are ready?
Madames, messieurs.

106
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,245
Give me your bodies,
give me your souls.

107
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,965
Make a window with your legs.

108
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,925
Move from the waist.

109
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:08,925
Ladies, trust your gentlemen.

110
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:13,085
In the polka,
faith is the virtue that saves.

111
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,086
Shame on you, Mr Godwin.
Not dancing?

112
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:18,966
You'll have to excuse me, Mrs Hurst.
I'm afraid I don't know the steps.

113
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:23,246
None of us know the steps, Mr Godwin.
That's the fun of it. We learn together.

114
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:27,166
As you can see,
I'm not dressed for dancing.

115
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:32,526
- Jenny, I want you. I shall have you.
- Oh!

116
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,886
- Seen enough?
- You have to admit it's quite a sight.

117
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,886
Quite a cost too.

118
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:48,926
There's the old monster.

119
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:53,966
- Want to meet him?
- Surely.

120
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:57,086
The lady with him
isn't exactly his wife.

121
00:19:57,206 --> 00:20:01,726
- You don't exactly surprise me.
- Just the latest in a long line.

122
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,966
- Father, I'd like to introduce you to--
- You're not dressed, Charles.

123
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:12,646
- Go and get dressed.
- Father.

124
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:18,166
- You're a blot, boy.
- Father, may I introduce to you
Mr John Taylor of Ohio?

125
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:22,006
My father, Lord Clare.
Miss Holland.

126
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:26,446
And what brings you
all the way from Ohio, sir?

127
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:31,446
Your son and I hope
to do business together.

128
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,326
- What business?
- I'm a sheep farmer.

129
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:37,606
A sheep farmer.

130
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,886
Get dressed, Charles, or get out.
There's a good fellow.

131
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,246
I wouldn't have missed that
for the world.

132
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:51,966
I wish I could laugh.

133
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:55,286
But my father's London life
all has to be paid for.

134
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:58,046
We don't live like this
down in the country.

135
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,206
The boy's not normal.
Don't ask me why.

136
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,766
Don't be hard on him,Jimmy.

137
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:06,486
When you think of his poorwife.

138
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:08,646
Damn it, Molly,
that was ten years ago.

139
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:13,486
You'd think he'd have found some
comfort of a female variety by now,
but he won't do it.

140
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,846
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure. The boy's not normal.

141
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:19,966
Brought this fellow
over from Paris, you know.

142
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:22,526
First polka in London.

143
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,886
Come on, Molly.
Let's hop.

144
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:30,126
- You'd be the new governess.
- Yes.

145
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:32,846
Know about the child,
do you, miss?

146
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:34,846
I know what I've been told.

147
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:37,847
Left in a basket on the steps
of the Ram Inn.

148
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:39,847
They tell you that?

149
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,327
- No.
- No.

150
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:46,207
They don't tell them that.

151
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:49,447
I don't suppose you could
put something on the fire, could you?

152
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:53,887
Can't bend, miss.
Wig falls off.

153
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:07,287
Please to come with me, miss.

154
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:09,687
You'll be the fourth
this year, miss.

155
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:13,047
- The fourth governess?
- They don't stay.

156
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:15,367
Miss Louisa sees to that.

157
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:17,367
Louisa?

158
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,287
The governess' room.

159
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,647
Thomas will bring your trunk up
when he has time.

160
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:30,727
Twenty-five pounds a year,
is it, your pay?

161
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:32,727
Cook gets 30.

162
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,127
Schoolroom this way.

163
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:39,647
We don't get many like you
at Selcombe, miss.

164
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,807
- Like what?
- Foreigners, miss.

165
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:43,847
We're all English here.

166
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,047
Schoolroom.

167
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,927
Know about Miss Louisa,
do you, miss?

168
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:57,407
- She was left in a basket
on the steps of the Ram Inn.
- Don't you believe it.

169
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:00,487
Master bought her from a gypsy
for half a crown.

170
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:07,607
Thinks she's quite a little lady,
but she don't fool me.

171
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,607
Where is she now?

172
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:13,327
I wouldn't know, miss.
Maybe the gypsies have took her back.

173
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,687
Excuse me. Where would I find
Miss Louisa, please?

174
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,687
Oh, she'll be in her lake house.

175
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:26,927
She's always hiding in there.

176
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,608
Who are you?

177
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:41,328
Miss Laurier, your new governess.

178
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:53,208
You're not English, are you?

179
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:56,328
- No.
- Do you speak English?

180
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,088
Yes.

181
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:09,328
Then bugger away, lady.

182
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:20,848
I see you found your way
to Louisa's lake house.

183
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:24,688
- Yes.
- And she ran away from you, I suppose?

184
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:29,408
- Yes.
- That's what she does.

185
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:34,368
I'm afraid her father's not very strict
with her, as you'll discover.

186
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:37,688
Mr Godwin is not at home?

187
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:40,888
He's in town at present.
We expect him back tomorrow.

188
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:42,928
- Mrs Godwin?
- Oh, no.

189
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:45,688
No.

190
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:50,168
No. I'm not Mrs Godwin.

191
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:53,248
My sister, Amelia, married Charles.

192
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:56,248
So, she is Mrs Godwin.

193
00:27:56,368 --> 00:28:01,128
But soon after her marriage, she had
a serious accident, a riding accident.

194
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:03,448
Charles had no one
to run the house for him.

195
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:05,928
So I came.
Thankyou.

196
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:11,808
And, uh, Mrs Godwin?

197
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:15,888
Amy didn't die.

198
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,768
Her life is over,
but she lives on.

199
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,728
And here we are,
Charles and I...

200
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:28,488
and Amy and Louisa.

201
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:19,769
We're home!

202
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:31,529
Did you have a pleasant journey?

203
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:35,049
John Taylor, this is my sister-in-law,
Miss Skelton.

204
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,489
- Mr Taylor, welcome.
- Miss Skelton.

205
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:42,169
There was no need foryou to walk down,
John. The carriage would've brought you.

206
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:45,529
- I'm not an old man yet, Charles.
- Ellen, will you help Louisa
with her cloak?

207
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,529
- I was waiting foryou.
- Would you take MrTaylor's coat?

208
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:50,569
John, this is a man you have to meet.
Mr Ames, my farmer.

209
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:54,049
- Mr Taylor.
- Mr Ames.

210
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,929
Do you have any experience
with Southdowns, sir?

211
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:09,129
- Not yet. We run merinos.
- Ah, wait till you
bring in the Southdowns.

212
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:11,049
There's no heartier breed
in existence.

213
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:14,089
- We have a new governess, Charles.
- Another one?

214
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:17,609
Send Miss Laurier down to meet Master.
Thomas, will you come with me?

215
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:19,809
Look at this girl.

216
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,489
She's so frightening, all the
governesses run from her squealing.

217
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:26,329
How do you do that, Louisa? Hmm?

218
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:31,769
- I don't want a governess.
- You don't want a governess.

219
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:33,649
- Did you miss me?
- No.

220
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:37,289
You must give me some breeding tips,
Mr Ames. I mean to win prizes.

221
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:40,489
Mr Godwin's your man.
He's our master breeder.

222
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:46,209
You have to be careful,John.
This breeding business can become
something of an obsession.

223
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:49,729
It's nothing less than
the endless pursuit of perfection.

224
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:54,969
How close do you reckon you've got?
To perfection, I mean.

225
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:59,129
The Selcombe flock
is as good as you'll find, sir.

226
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:01,249
That's what I hear.

227
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:03,809
What's your secret?

228
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,649
Ah, here's the new governess.

229
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:11,049
Uh, this is my brother-in-law,
Mr Godwin. Miss Laurier.

230
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,049
Mr Godwin.

231
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:21,169
Miss Laurier is from Switzerland,
but she's been employed
in England for many years.

232
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:25,209
I see.

233
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,329
I'm sure MrTaylor needs a drink.
I know I do.

234
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:50,849
You must leave at once.
What are you doing? And what on earth
possessed you to come here?

235
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:54,489
It's taken me seven years to trace
my child. Don't ask me to leave her now.

236
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:57,249
We had an agreement.
You had your money.

237
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:01,529
I didn't know how it would be
when she was born. All I heard was
her cry. I've never forgotten it.

238
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:04,289
- You were paid to forget.
- I tried.

239
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:06,409
You tried?

240
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:09,649
- I'd give you back
your money if I could.
- I don't want the money.

241
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,009
It wasn't for me.
It was for my-- It was for my father.

242
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:17,449
- He was in prison and--
- I don't want to hear this. I just--

243
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,849
I wanted an heir. I wanted a child.
Is that so wrong?

244
00:32:23,969 --> 00:32:27,009
I swear to you, no one will ever learn
the truth from me, not even Louisa.

245
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:30,329
Not even Louisa, not even your own
daughter. You couldn't live with that.

246
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,289
I have no choice.
I have no home of my own.

247
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,809
- I must be governess to her or nothing.
- She hates governesses.

248
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:38,689
She needs me.
That's enough.

249
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:41,370
No. No. It's impossible,
the whole thing. You must go.

250
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,730
And there's the end to it.

251
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,010
Ah, yes. Because you have
to put the paddles up.

252
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,810
We'll have to get another governess,
Connie. Miss Laurier can't stay.

253
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,490
Why?

254
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,890
Louisa doesn't like her.

255
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,250
Oh, Charles.
Louisa doesn't like any governess.

256
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,650
Can't a man choose who's
to educate his own daughter?

257
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,290
- Do you wish her to be
dismissed without a character?
- No.

258
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,730
Well, then, she must be given
at least a month's notice.

259
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,330
A month?
Can't she just be paid?

260
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,130
Governesses make their homes
with their employers.

261
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,690
She can't leave until
she's found a new situation.

262
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,730
A month.
A month is an eternity.

263
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,970
-Does she really have no home but this?
-That's why governesses are governesses.

264
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,250
What happens to them when they
aren't wanted as governesses any more?

265
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,450
I really don't know.

266
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,290
All these huge rooms, and we live
our lives within three feet of the fire.

267
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,090
Would you come with me, please?

268
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,210
You're to have one month's notice.

269
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,530
- You said you'd swear to tell no one.
- Yes.

270
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,970
- Oh.
- Thankyou, Hannah.

271
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,330
- Have I time for my tea, sir?
- Yes.

272
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,210
- I'll stay till you return.
- Thankyou, sir.

273
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,090
Amy, I've brought
someone to see you.

274
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,050
This is Miss Laurier.
Please.

275
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,650
This is my wife, Amelia.

276
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,930
Mrs Godwin.

277
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,290
I tell Amy everything.

278
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,690
She knows Louisa's my daughter.

279
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,050
But I promised her that
I'll never shame her before the world.

280
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,530
No one else knows but you.

281
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,490
- Does she understand what we say?
- I choose to believe that she does.

282
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,810
If there's any pity in you
for my wife's wasted life...

283
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,090
swear that you'll keep our secret.

284
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,570
I swear.

285
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,970
Now leave us.

286
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:54,091
Good morning, Louisa.

287
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:11,291
- Do you know your ABC?
- Do you know your ABC?

288
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,611
This is "L" for Louisa.

289
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:28,011
This is "L" for Louisa.

290
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:32,011
Don't go.
We have work to do.

291
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:36,411
Don't go.
We have work to do.

292
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:45,411
- You're poor, I suppose.
- Yes.

293
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,291
I don't have to do what you say.

294
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,371
- No.
- You got to hoist them off.

295
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:05,891
- Bugger away, lady. Bugger away.
- Gently now.

296
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:07,731
- Come on.
- You see why?

297
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:10,211
Frankly, I don't.
They all look good to me.

298
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,371
You've a superb flock here.

299
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:16,291
Well, I should have. I've been breeding
the imperfections out for 1 5 years.

300
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:18,611
This one's a perfect breeding ewe.

301
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:21,451
See how the chine runs straight
from the nape of the neck
to the sitting of the tail.

302
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:25,491
Good wide hips, straight forelegs,
plenty ofwool between the ears.

303
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:28,731
Look into her eyes--
sweet, gentle disposition.

304
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,971
She'll feed well,
fatten well and lamb well.

305
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,971
- Go on.
- Good morning, Miss Laurier.

306
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:38,131
- Mr Taylor.
- Have you come to admire
the Southdowns too?

307
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:42,771
No, sir. I've come
for Mr Godwin's instructions.

308
00:38:42,891 --> 00:38:44,891
Don't you fight, now. Oh.

309
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:47,931
- Well?
- Am I to teach Miss Louisa, sir...

310
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,291
if even only for one month?

311
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:54,131
- Yes.
- Then I must be able to keep her
in the schoolroom.

312
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:56,491
What forms of discipline
am I permitted to use?

313
00:38:56,611 --> 00:39:00,931
None. If her lessons
give her no pleasure,
why should she endure them? No.

314
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:07,091
She'll find out soon enough
what a hard world we live in.

315
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:11,131
For these few short years that she's
under my care, I want her to be happy.

316
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:15,451
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

317
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:21,291
Steady.

318
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:26,012
- No.
- Fair enough, now?

319
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:30,052
A bit and turn around. Come on.
Turn around. Yeah. That's it.

320
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:32,572
Let me out! I want my pa!
Let me out!

321
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,772
Come on! You gotta let me out!
Let me out!

322
00:39:34,892 --> 00:39:37,652
I want my pa!
Come on! I want my pa!

323
00:39:37,772 --> 00:39:40,252
Let me out now!
I want my pa!

324
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:43,132
- Let me out!
- After you've done your lessons.

325
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:51,412
Let me out! I want my pa! Just let me
out now! I want him! Hey! Let me out!

326
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:05,772
- What's that?
- Uh, Miss Louisa, sir, being educated.

327
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:07,772
I hate you!

328
00:40:11,932 --> 00:40:14,532
No, I'm never-- never!

329
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:18,052
Papa!

330
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:22,172
- Open the door.
- Papa! Papa!

331
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:25,652
Miss Laurier,
open this door at once!

332
00:40:32,332 --> 00:40:34,132
What do you thinkyou're doing?
Open the door!

333
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:36,132
No, sir.

334
00:40:38,612 --> 00:40:42,332
Please, Papa.
Come here, please!

335
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:44,452
I will not have you
treat my daughter like this.

336
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,652
- Would you have her grow up
ignorant and friendless?
- I'll not have her imprisoned.

337
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:51,332
She cares for no one but you,
and so no one cares for her.

338
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,372
- Give me the key.
- She is unhappy and lonely.

339
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:57,212
She doesn't know who she is
or what she is to do or why.

340
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:12,892
Papa, help me!
Papa, I want you!

341
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,132
I can help her.
I know I can.

342
00:41:17,652 --> 00:41:19,772
But first she has to be taught
to obey me.

343
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:25,252
Ifyou harm so much
as one hair on her head--

344
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:28,212
Do you think I, of all people,
would ever hurt her?

345
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:34,052
I'll make you a promise.

346
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:37,092
Whatever I do to Louisa,
I'll do to myself.

347
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:45,092
You want her to love you.
I want her to be loved.

348
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,012
She won't have you forever.

349
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,052
Louisa?

350
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:08,092
Louisa, I'll see you
when your lessons are over.

351
00:42:09,012 --> 00:42:12,692
All right, darling?
Louisa?

352
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:15,612
I love you.

353
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:35,892
- Lunch, miss.
- Thankyou, Ellen. Put it on the table.

354
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:42,172
- Will that be all, miss?
- Yes. Thankyou, Ellen.

355
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,813
Do you want your lunch?

356
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:06,253
One.

357
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,373
Two.

358
00:43:15,253 --> 00:43:18,253
Ifyou won't eat,
then neitherwill I.

359
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:29,893
- I'd say you're lucky to have her.
- Oh? Why?

360
00:43:30,013 --> 00:43:32,813
She's got pride in herself.
Doesn't back down.

361
00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:38,893
And she's lovely.

362
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:41,613
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.

363
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:45,333
Miss Laurier is here to teach Louisa.
She leaves at the end of the month.

364
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,853
So you won't mind
if I speak to her?

365
00:43:49,973 --> 00:43:51,973
What do you mean,
speak to her?

366
00:43:52,093 --> 00:43:56,373
Well, she doesn't seem
to have a home of her own.

367
00:43:56,493 --> 00:44:00,613
- Do you mean to employ her?
- Not exactly.

368
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:04,293
- I was thinking of marriage.
- Marriage?

369
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:09,133
I could do a lot worse.

370
00:44:12,093 --> 00:44:16,093
I leave tomorrow.
I don't have that much time.

371
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:18,653
Well, you'd better
ask her then.

372
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:24,933
- I'm cold.
- So am I.

373
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:29,773
- I hate you.
- Hate me ifyou want,
but you must obey me.

374
00:44:29,893 --> 00:44:32,053
I won't.
I'll die first.

375
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:34,853
Hmm. How will you die?

376
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,173
I'll drown myself in the lake.

377
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:41,373
- How will you make your body
stay underwater?
- It just will.

378
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:44,333
No, it won't.
Bodies float.

379
00:44:45,493 --> 00:44:49,093
- You could put stones in your pockets.
Do you have any pockets?
- Don't talk to me.

380
00:44:49,213 --> 00:44:52,053
Oryou could get a good, strong bag
and fill it with pebbles.

381
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:56,213
- I said, don't talk to me.
- What do you do in the lake house?

382
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:02,333
- Ifyou come near it,
I'll kill you. I'll murderyou.
- How?

383
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:05,853
With a knife.
I'll stab you in the heart.

384
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:09,333
- Yes, that would do it.
- It would. You'd be dead.

385
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:12,413
- You'd have to bury me.
- I won't. I'll just leave you.

386
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:14,613
I'd rot. I'd smell.

387
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,613
Serve you right.

388
00:45:23,813 --> 00:45:27,053
What are these
stupid lessons anyway?

389
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:30,653
Louisa...

390
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:33,173
Ioves Papa.

391
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:39,453
Louisa loves grass.

392
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:43,093
Louisa...

393
00:45:45,093 --> 00:45:48,173
eats grass.

394
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:53,333
Sheep eat grass.

395
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:15,734
"Papa loves sheep."

396
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:19,534
You see, it's not hard.

397
00:46:23,854 --> 00:46:27,494
- Do you know about firelight?
- What about it?

398
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:31,374
It's a kind of magic.

399
00:46:32,694 --> 00:46:36,414
Firelight makes time stand still.

400
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:38,534
When you put out the lamps...

401
00:46:38,654 --> 00:46:42,094
and sit in the firelight's glow...

402
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:44,894
there aren't any rules any more.

403
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:57,054
You can do what you want,
say what you want...

404
00:46:57,174 --> 00:46:59,134
be what you want.

405
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:04,734
And when the lamps are lit again,
time starts again.

406
00:47:06,294 --> 00:47:09,774
And everything you said
or did is forgotten--

407
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:12,254
more than forgotten.

408
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:15,334
It never happened.

409
00:47:16,854 --> 00:47:19,414
- I can do what I want?
- Yes.

410
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:23,734
- I want to go.
- Then go.

411
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:28,174
It's been unlocked since lunch time.

412
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:03,374
All right?

413
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:07,294
To a famous victory.

414
00:48:07,414 --> 00:48:10,014
Don't say that.
Louisa's too young to be defeated.

415
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:13,134
Oh, well.
Then we shall drink to you.

416
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:15,894
- To Miss Laurier.
- Miss Laurier.

417
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:23,974
Governess after governess has tried
to control Louisa and failed.

418
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:27,894
Only Miss Laurier has realized
that first she must control Charles.

419
00:48:28,014 --> 00:48:31,374
Yes. But look at him.
He's not at all grateful.

420
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,894
I understand you'll be leaving
in a month.

421
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:44,614
Where do you go?

422
00:48:44,734 --> 00:48:47,414
Another situation.

423
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:50,774
- Then what?
- I don't understand.

424
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,694
Well, the years go by,
you're no longer required, then what?

425
00:48:55,654 --> 00:48:57,894
Do you return to Switzerland?

426
00:49:00,694 --> 00:49:03,814
I can't see into the future.

427
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:06,614
Some say the future
is what you make it.

428
00:49:08,054 --> 00:49:10,814
Well, in-- in America,
certainly.

429
00:49:10,934 --> 00:49:14,174
In America.
That's what I mean.

430
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:16,174
In America.

431
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:40,015
Good night, darling.

432
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:46,175
We've begun now.

433
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:13,815
You asked to see me?

434
00:50:13,935 --> 00:50:17,975
Yes. I wanted a moment alone
with you before I go.

435
00:50:18,095 --> 00:50:20,375
Please, have a seat.

436
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:26,935
Miss Laurier,
I won't waste your time.

437
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:33,135
I'm a single man
with 5,000 acres to my name.

438
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:36,215
Ifyou would consider
a life in America...

439
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:38,895
I would be proud
to take you there...

440
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,855
as my wife.

441
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:46,095
You pay me a very
great compliment, sir.

442
00:50:48,055 --> 00:50:50,415
But the answer's no.

443
00:50:50,535 --> 00:50:52,615
I'm afraid so.

444
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:58,575
Well.
You don't know till you ask.

445
00:50:59,815 --> 00:51:01,935
You're not too disappointed,
I think.

446
00:51:04,175 --> 00:51:08,095
Well, I hardly know you,
so I can't make out I'll not
be able to live without you...

447
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:13,535
but, well, a man can get his hopes up
pretty high pretty quick.

448
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:16,815
I'm sorry.

449
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:19,695
Just so I know--

450
00:51:20,735 --> 00:51:24,095
Guess I'll be doing something
like this again one of these days.

451
00:51:26,095 --> 00:51:29,175
Is it anything I can fix...

452
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:33,535
Iike my dress or how I talk?

453
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:35,775
No, Mr Taylor.

454
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:38,375
Any lady would be fortunate
to be courted by you.

455
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:41,895
Any lady but you.

456
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:58,695
Louisa, darling, please.
You promised me.

457
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:04,535
- Louisa, I really can't bear this.
- That's why she does it.

458
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,655
Damnation, can't I feel
for my own child?

459
00:52:07,775 --> 00:52:10,255
Feel for her, Mr Godwin,
but don't pity her.

460
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:13,255
Louisa, let go. Please.

461
00:52:18,295 --> 00:52:20,335
Go, then.
Ifyou want to go, go.

462
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:30,455
- Will you be all right, darling?
- You don't care,
so what does it matter?

463
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:44,495
Now, it's just you and me.
Shall we start our lessons?

464
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:50,775
I don't have to do what you say.
You're just a servant.

465
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:52,776
That's enough! Be silent.

466
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:57,056
You will obey me,
whetheryou want to or not.

467
00:52:57,176 --> 00:53:00,456
You will obey me because, poor as I am,
I am placed in authority overyou.

468
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:04,536
You will not speak disrespectfully
to me or raise your voice to me.

469
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:07,496
Servant. Servant. Servant.

470
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:09,576
Servant. Servant. Servant.

471
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:11,616
Servant! Servant! Servant!

472
00:53:11,736 --> 00:53:14,816
Servant! Servant! Servant! Servant!

473
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:25,496
I'm not a servant.
I'm a prisoner.

474
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:27,976
So will you be when you grow up.

475
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:33,056
The day you come of age,
the gates will close around you
because you are a woman!

476
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,376
Ifyou marry, everything you own will
become the property ofyour husband.

477
00:53:36,496 --> 00:53:40,496
Ifyou don't marry, every profession
will be closed to you but one...

478
00:53:40,616 --> 00:53:44,416
and that one is a life
of loneliness and humiliation.

479
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:46,776
They lockyou up, Louisa!

480
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:49,136
But there's one door they can't lock.

481
00:53:49,256 --> 00:53:51,816
They can't imprison your mind...

482
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:54,136
and that's why I want you
to learn to read.

483
00:53:54,256 --> 00:53:56,576
I want you to have your own life.

484
00:54:00,376 --> 00:54:03,096
Write and tell me when the Southdowns
start winning all the prizes.

485
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:06,056
- Come and see foryourself.
- Maybe I will.

486
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,416
Best grazing in the world.
Twenty dollars an acre. Think about it.

487
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:14,296
Did you find time
for that other business?

488
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:17,216
- She turned me down.
- She turned you down?

489
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:19,336
Mm. I guess there's somebody else.

490
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:22,656
Lucky fellow is all I can say.

491
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:25,096
- Bye, Charles.
- Bye,John.

492
00:55:02,776 --> 00:55:04,656
Don't go.

493
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:10,576
Constance will be down directly.

494
00:55:10,696 --> 00:55:12,576
As you wish.

495
00:55:27,176 --> 00:55:31,296
Mr Taylor tells me he made you an offer
and, uh, you refused him.

496
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:33,296
Yes.

497
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:36,816
For Louisa's sake, I presume.

498
00:55:38,496 --> 00:55:40,376
Yes.

499
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:48,256
The fire gives more light
than one expects, doesn't it?

500
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,136
Yes.

501
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:06,776
No lamps lit?
What's Jane thinking of?

502
00:56:24,857 --> 00:56:27,497
I don't know how much
you want to know.

503
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:38,377
I remember her.

504
00:56:42,497 --> 00:56:44,377
The firelight.

505
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:48,977
I remember her...

506
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:55,137
too much.

507
00:57:41,777 --> 00:57:43,657
"Bee."

508
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:47,177
"Tree."

509
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:50,177
"Eye."

510
00:57:50,297 --> 00:57:52,177
"See."

511
00:57:55,057 --> 00:57:57,457
"Pig."

512
00:57:57,577 --> 00:58:01,857
"Dig." "Wig."
This is stupid.

513
00:58:06,537 --> 00:58:08,537
- "Bad."
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:58:11,217 --> 00:58:13,177
"Sad."

515
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:18,097
- "Happy."
- Hmm-mm.

516
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:20,297
- I suppose it's "glad."
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:58:24,497 --> 00:58:26,777
- "Mad."
- Yes.

518
00:58:38,857 --> 00:58:40,817
When I was young,
I had no mother.

519
00:58:42,697 --> 00:58:44,577
She died just after I was born.

520
00:58:46,457 --> 00:58:48,377
I loved my father very much...

521
00:58:49,497 --> 00:58:51,897
but what I wanted most
was a mother.

522
00:59:02,737 --> 00:59:04,697
The sick lady's
not my real mother.

523
00:59:07,457 --> 00:59:11,097
- Yes, I know.
- My real mother's not sick.

524
00:59:12,217 --> 00:59:14,617
Where is she?

525
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:16,697
It's a secret.

526
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:23,097
- Do you ever see her?
- Of course. Every day.

527
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:25,097
What do you do with her?

528
00:59:27,337 --> 00:59:29,297
Just be with her.

529
01:00:10,418 --> 01:00:12,778
Miss Laurier. "See."

530
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:17,818
How do you know she doesn't just read
the pictures rather than the words?

531
01:00:17,938 --> 01:00:20,818
- She does.
- Oh, yes? That's not really reading.

532
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,258
No, it's only pretending...

533
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:26,658
but after a while,
the pretence becomes a reality.

534
01:00:27,778 --> 01:00:29,858
I see.

535
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:39,018
Louisa tells me you have
some story about firelight.

536
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:40,978
Yes.

537
01:00:41,098 --> 01:00:43,458
I tell her firelight
is a magic time...

538
01:00:43,578 --> 01:00:45,458
when time stands still.

539
01:00:45,578 --> 01:00:47,778
Why'd you tell her that?

540
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:50,218
I find it helps.

541
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:53,018
A time with no rules
at the end of the day.

542
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,618
I must askyou to help me.

543
01:01:04,618 --> 01:01:06,938
How?

544
01:01:07,058 --> 01:01:10,538
There was a time-- it was a short time--
when we were close, you and I.

545
01:01:13,218 --> 01:01:15,338
- Yes?
- Do you remember it?

546
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:18,418
Yes.

547
01:01:22,898 --> 01:01:25,978
Just tell me that time is over
and can never come again.

548
01:01:30,258 --> 01:01:32,218
You don't answer.

549
01:01:39,218 --> 01:01:41,258
What happens when time stands still?

550
01:01:43,578 --> 01:01:46,178
The firelight.

551
01:01:46,298 --> 01:01:48,258
You can do what you want...

552
01:01:49,378 --> 01:01:51,938
say what you want...

553
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:54,018
be what you want.

554
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:02,218
When the lamps are lit again...

555
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:04,738
time starts again, but...

556
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:07,858
everything you said or did
is forgotten.

557
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,858
More than forgotten.

558
01:02:11,538 --> 01:02:13,498
Never happened.

559
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:38,378
Oh.

560
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,619
- Thankyou.
- Oh, God, I hate the country!

561
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:49,059
It's always so damn cold.
Come on, Molly, into the mausoleum.

562
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:50,539
- Hello, Connie.
- Hello.

563
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:53,059
Terrible journey.
The roads get worse every year.

564
01:04:53,179 --> 01:04:56,099
How are you?
Jimmy, who are all these people?

565
01:04:56,219 --> 01:04:58,699
Fiddlers.

566
01:04:58,819 --> 01:05:01,899
You, more coal on the fire
before I freeze to death!

567
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:05,299
Come on in, Manzini.
Herd your fellows in.

568
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:07,979
We can't have a dance without music,
Connie. Everyone knows that.

569
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:09,859
- Dance?
- Fire!

570
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:12,939
Can't bend, milord.
Wig falls off.

571
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:16,099
- Father.
- Yes, yes. Here I am.

572
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:18,939
- Hello there, little missy.
- Who are all these people?

573
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:21,619
Christmas cheer.
What is it about this house?

574
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:23,699
The moment I walk in,
I want to kill myself.

575
01:05:25,819 --> 01:05:27,699
Damn it, boy,
don't preach at me.

576
01:05:27,819 --> 01:05:29,979
You do realize we have to sell
one of the farms?

577
01:05:30,099 --> 01:05:32,859
Never sell land, Charles.
The one sensible thing
my father ever said to me.

578
01:05:32,979 --> 01:05:35,819
Why borrow money if all you mean
is to give it back?

579
01:05:35,939 --> 01:05:37,819
Where's Molly?
She can't still be dressing.

580
01:05:37,939 --> 01:05:40,179
- Are there any more charges
on the estate?
- Well, what do I know?

581
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:42,179
I'm not a bank clerk.
I just live my life.

582
01:05:42,299 --> 01:05:45,019
All for the sake of a few short years
of passing pleasure.

583
01:05:45,139 --> 01:05:48,619
Passing pleasures are all we have, boy.
All we have between us and the grave.

584
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:51,539
- Hello. Who are you?
- This is Miss Laurier.

585
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:54,779
This is, uh, my father,
Lord Clare.

586
01:05:54,899 --> 01:05:57,459
Miss Laurier
is Louisa's governess.

587
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:00,299
Never had governesses like you
in my day. What are you, French?

588
01:06:00,419 --> 01:06:02,819
No, I'm from Switzerland.

589
01:06:02,939 --> 01:06:06,579
Sacrifice your life ifyou want,
Charles. I mean to enjoy mine.

590
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:09,179
Miss Laurier, is it?
Do you polka?

591
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,980
Well done, Charles.
She's lovely.

592
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,500
- What?
- Your Swiss governess.

593
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,780
Oh. Yes.
She's an excellent teacher.

594
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,460
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

595
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,700
- Connie?
- Yes, yes.

596
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,300
What do you say
to a quick turn around the room?

597
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,540
Why not.

598
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,100
Oh! Oh, Lord Clare,
are you all right?

599
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,260
- Of course I'm all right.
- I'm so sorry. Was it me?

600
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,340
I'll see to him, Miss Laurier.
Please don't trouble yourself.

601
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,700
Look, I tell you, I'm all right.
I want to dance, damn it.

602
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,780
Why didn't you say?

603
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,940
I never thought I'd get you
onto a dance floor, Charles.

604
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,340
There's a first time
for everything.

605
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,900
Oh!

606
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,940
You sent for me, sir?

607
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,581
Well, are you or aren't you?

608
01:09:41,701 --> 01:09:44,981
- Am I what?
- Diddling Charles.

609
01:09:47,221 --> 01:09:49,581
Molly says you are.

610
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:52,261
She can usually spot
these things, you know.

611
01:09:52,381 --> 01:09:54,781
You judge everyone
by yourself, sir?

612
01:09:57,141 --> 01:09:59,021
Well, at least you understand
what I'm talking about.

613
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:01,021
You're not gonna sue him
or anything, are you?

614
01:10:02,701 --> 01:10:04,741
- No.
- And you're wrong, missy.

615
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:09,701
I don't judge everyone by myself,
least of all Charles.

616
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,261
I know he's not like me
'cause he's just like my father.

617
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:17,181
The old bastard
never thought much of me.

618
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:21,061
Duty this, duty that.

619
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:25,541
And now Charles.

620
01:10:28,181 --> 01:10:31,181
Odd to have your own son
acting like your father, you know.

621
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:36,821
He must have been a child once.

622
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,581
But of course
he was a child once.

623
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:45,181
Well, you're right there.

624
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:50,501
When he was a little fellow.
I'd forgotten that.

625
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:56,301
You know, when Charles was about
1 6 years old, he stood up before me
and he said...

626
01:10:56,421 --> 01:11:00,541
"Father, I can't respect a man
who lives only for his own pleasure."

627
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:03,821
- You know what I replied?
- What?

628
01:11:03,941 --> 01:11:06,101
"My boy, you've no right to speak
to your father like that...

629
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:08,941
until you've got yourself
well and truly fucked."

630
01:11:09,941 --> 01:11:13,101
Well... now he has.

631
01:11:19,701 --> 01:11:21,581
Good foryou, missy.

632
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:24,341
Good foryou.

633
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:30,101
And you're right, of course.

634
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:34,501
He's my boy.

635
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:46,061
- She pretends she has a mother there.
- I know. We're all pretending.

636
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:52,461
When you come into a room,
I pretend that I haven't noticed you.

637
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:56,861
And then I look, and there's
nothing in the world but you.

638
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:02,381
Sometimes I think,
"Why don't we just go away?"

639
01:13:03,942 --> 01:13:06,502
You, me, Louisa.
Would you come with me?

640
01:13:08,262 --> 01:13:10,662
Why ask?
It's only pretending.

641
01:13:10,782 --> 01:13:14,142
- You can't leave.
- I don't think I can bear it.

642
01:13:14,262 --> 01:13:18,062
You have your duty to your estate,
to your family, to your wife.

643
01:13:18,182 --> 01:13:20,862
How can you be so calm?

644
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:22,862
Not calm.

645
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:31,262
Stay with me tonight.

646
01:13:31,382 --> 01:13:33,342
All night.

647
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:45,382
Louisa!

648
01:14:46,622 --> 01:14:48,742
Come back!
It's not safe!

649
01:14:51,662 --> 01:14:53,542
Louisa, don't leave me!

650
01:16:04,462 --> 01:16:06,742
Sleep, darling. Sleep.

651
01:16:38,623 --> 01:16:40,583
I'll never leave you.

652
01:16:41,743 --> 01:16:43,703
Never.

653
01:17:31,743 --> 01:17:33,703
They're making an inventory.

654
01:17:35,423 --> 01:17:38,263
Charles left for town at first light.

655
01:17:38,383 --> 01:17:40,703
Mr Dodds tells me
the estate is to be sold.

656
01:17:47,623 --> 01:17:49,663
I wonder what will become of us all.

657
01:17:51,663 --> 01:17:55,063
Who knows?
Maybe it's for the best.

658
01:17:57,223 --> 01:18:00,223
Sometimes this house
feels like a prison.

659
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,303
Mr Godwin loves it very much.

660
01:18:03,503 --> 01:18:05,383
Yes, he did once.

661
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:09,943
But the house died
the day Amy...

662
01:18:11,143 --> 01:18:13,223
didn't die.

663
01:18:14,863 --> 01:18:16,823
I wish she had died.

664
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,903
Does that shockyou?

665
01:18:21,343 --> 01:18:23,223
No.

666
01:18:25,463 --> 01:18:29,463
There's a law, of course,
that forbids a man...

667
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:31,743
from marrying
his deceased wife's sister.

668
01:18:33,423 --> 01:18:36,143
But it's an absurd law,
so easily evaded.

669
01:18:36,263 --> 01:18:39,583
You think if Mrs Godwin were to die,
you and Mr Godwin would marry?

670
01:18:45,623 --> 01:18:48,543
I don't pretend he loves me
as he loved Amy.

671
01:18:51,743 --> 01:18:53,703
But ten years is a long time.

672
01:18:56,903 --> 01:18:58,783
We've grown older together.

673
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:01,863
There's a kind of closeness
in that.

674
01:19:15,063 --> 01:19:17,383
"Fire"?

675
01:19:24,823 --> 01:19:26,703
"God."

676
01:19:32,783 --> 01:19:35,703
- "Hat."
- What's that word?

677
01:19:35,823 --> 01:19:38,943
- Hat.
- How do you know?

678
01:19:39,063 --> 01:19:40,983
Because of the picture.

679
01:19:46,063 --> 01:19:48,064
How do I know?

680
01:20:35,144 --> 01:20:37,704
- Charles, you're back.
- Hello, Connie.

681
01:20:37,824 --> 01:20:41,504
- Is everything going to be all right?
- No.

682
01:20:41,624 --> 01:20:43,584
Nothing's going to be all right.

683
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,064
Are there so very many debts?

684
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:53,144
Yes.

685
01:20:54,704 --> 01:20:57,624
Yes, the damage
is well and truly done.

686
01:20:57,744 --> 01:20:59,704
The estate will have to go.

687
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:04,184
Oh, Charles.

688
01:21:05,584 --> 01:21:07,664
I'm so sorry.

689
01:21:07,784 --> 01:21:10,424
But it's not right.
Something should be done.

690
01:21:10,544 --> 01:21:13,264
No, it's not right...

691
01:21:13,384 --> 01:21:15,744
but nothing will be done.

692
01:21:20,784 --> 01:21:22,744
What will become of us?

693
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,424
Who knows?

694
01:21:51,704 --> 01:21:53,664
It's a cold night, Amy.

695
01:21:55,064 --> 01:21:56,944
Bitter cold.

696
01:21:58,064 --> 01:22:00,384
I've often thought that this is
a kind of prison foryou...

697
01:22:03,864 --> 01:22:07,744
and that ifyou could speak,
you'd ask me to--

698
01:22:13,384 --> 01:22:15,344
You'd ask me to let you go.

699
01:22:17,664 --> 01:22:19,624
I have to know that you want it.

700
01:22:31,824 --> 01:22:33,784
Show me what you want, Amy.

701
01:22:40,384 --> 01:22:42,344
Show me what you want.

702
01:24:06,905 --> 01:24:09,945
Lord, from you we come,
to you we must return.

703
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:19,025
Take my beloved wife.

704
01:25:11,105 --> 01:25:13,825
Sometime in the night, I'd say.

705
01:25:13,945 --> 01:25:15,905
It was a very cold night.

706
01:25:19,305 --> 01:25:21,385
I understand
that the fire had gone out.

707
01:25:23,225 --> 01:25:25,185
Yes.

708
01:25:25,305 --> 01:25:27,865
That was unfortunate.

709
01:25:27,985 --> 01:25:30,625
It wasn't me, sir.
I swear on the Good Book.

710
01:25:30,745 --> 01:25:32,625
Nobody's blaming you, Hannah.

711
01:25:34,385 --> 01:25:36,345
It's been ten years.

712
01:25:37,865 --> 01:25:41,265
- At least now she's at peace.
- Indeed.

713
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:46,505
Indeed.

714
01:25:51,265 --> 01:25:53,145
I think we should leave.

715
01:26:37,186 --> 01:26:40,346
- You haven't eaten.
- No, I--

716
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:46,506
Are you all right?

717
01:26:46,626 --> 01:26:49,186
Am I all right?
Yes, I think so.

718
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:57,546
I loved Amy dearly...

719
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:02,026
but I know--

720
01:27:04,706 --> 01:27:06,666
I know that this is for the best.

721
01:27:10,506 --> 01:27:12,986
You really believe that?

722
01:27:14,306 --> 01:27:15,986
Yes, I do.

723
01:27:20,346 --> 01:27:22,786
Dear Connie.

724
01:27:22,906 --> 01:27:25,906
You've been good to me
all these years.

725
01:27:28,706 --> 01:27:31,386
And you've been good to me,
Charles.

726
01:27:31,506 --> 01:27:34,386
So much is changing.
What's to become of us all?

727
01:27:37,066 --> 01:27:39,026
As your friend Mr Taylor said...

728
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:43,066
"The future's what we make it."

729
01:27:43,786 --> 01:27:45,346
Hmm.

730
01:28:06,146 --> 01:28:08,146
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't speak.

731
01:28:09,386 --> 01:28:11,266
I...

732
01:28:12,786 --> 01:28:15,386
- didn't mean--
- Well, it's just a mistake, that's all.

733
01:28:20,146 --> 01:28:22,306
Uh, sorry to have disturbed you.

734
01:28:27,826 --> 01:28:29,786
Connie.

735
01:28:32,466 --> 01:28:34,386
Yes, Charles?

736
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:44,146
You know how much
I loved her, don't you?

737
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:48,386
Yes, Charles, I do.

738
01:28:56,626 --> 01:29:00,106
"Behold, I show you a mystery.

739
01:29:01,746 --> 01:29:05,866
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed...

740
01:29:05,986 --> 01:29:09,306
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye...

741
01:29:09,426 --> 01:29:11,386
at the last trump.

742
01:29:12,506 --> 01:29:14,386
For the trumpet shall sound...

743
01:29:14,506 --> 01:29:17,746
and the dead shall be raised
incorruptible...

744
01:29:17,866 --> 01:29:20,426
and we shall be changed.

745
01:29:20,506 --> 01:29:24,426
For this corruptible
must put on incorruption...

746
01:29:24,546 --> 01:29:29,746
and this mortal
must put on immortality.

747
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:33,506
So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption...

748
01:29:33,626 --> 01:29:37,026
and this mortal shall have
put on immortality...

749
01:29:37,146 --> 01:29:41,866
then shall be brought to pass
the saying that is written...

750
01:29:41,986 --> 01:29:45,226
Death is swallowed up
in victory.

751
01:29:46,426 --> 01:29:49,746
O death, where is thy sting?

752
01:29:49,866 --> 01:29:53,427
O grave, where is thy victory?"

753
01:30:19,187 --> 01:30:21,067
Does he love you?

754
01:30:24,107 --> 01:30:26,067
Yes.

755
01:30:28,547 --> 01:30:30,907
Do you love him?

756
01:30:31,027 --> 01:30:32,907
Yes.

757
01:30:36,147 --> 01:30:38,387
I would have made him happy.

758
01:30:43,227 --> 01:30:45,467
Love him for me too.

759
01:31:12,627 --> 01:31:14,307
Was it you?

760
01:31:17,267 --> 01:31:19,267
Yes.

761
01:31:55,387 --> 01:31:57,347
but I'll never know.

762
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,227
I must live with that.

763
01:32:07,267 --> 01:32:09,227
As must I.

764
01:32:10,427 --> 01:32:12,507
- You? You've done nothing.
- Nothing?

765
01:32:16,387 --> 01:32:18,667
I've wanted you and Louisa...

766
01:32:18,787 --> 01:32:21,947
with all my mind and heart and will
for seven long years.

767
01:32:23,827 --> 01:32:25,507
It seems to me that my desire...

768
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:27,987
has destroyed everything
that stood in its way:

769
01:32:28,907 --> 01:32:31,867
your wife, your home, your world.

770
01:32:33,787 --> 01:32:36,027
I never knew there was
so much power in desire.

771
01:32:38,347 --> 01:32:41,627
And if it was so...
are you sorry?

772
01:32:42,547 --> 01:32:43,827
No.

773
01:32:53,427 --> 01:32:55,387
Then we deserve each other.

774
01:33:01,107 --> 01:33:03,107
May God have mercy on us.

775
01:34:09,668 --> 01:34:12,228
Why did you give me away?

776
01:34:15,388 --> 01:34:18,708
I didn't.
I sold you.

777
01:34:32,148 --> 01:34:34,068
How much for?

778
01:34:35,468 --> 01:34:37,708
500 pounds.

779
01:34:38,988 --> 01:34:42,708
- Is that a lot?
- It's a fortune.

780
01:34:54,508 --> 01:34:56,468
I'm glad it was a lot.

781
01:35:08,028 --> 01:35:09,948
