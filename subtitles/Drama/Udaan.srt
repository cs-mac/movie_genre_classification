1
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,240
Not so fast.

2
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,508
Come on.

3
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,733
Climb Fatso, climb.

4
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,143
Don't fall on us or we'll die.

5
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,672
I'm slipping.

6
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,477
Put your foot here.

7
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,142
Now go.

8
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,347
Go on you cow...

9
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,159
Careful.

10
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,174
Easy...

11
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,242
Fatso, you eat too much.

12
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,250
I got tired giving him a leg up.

13
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,183
You're no less...

14
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,448
Did you see yourself?

15
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,786
At least I did it on my own.

16
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,519
He almost crushed us.

17
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,393
Did you see his legs
dangling in mid-air?

18
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,722
I'm hungry...

19
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,733
Forget it Fatso. We're already late.

20
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,739
Thanks to this idiot,
I've started pronouncing it

21
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,275
'Filum' instead of film.

22
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,537
Walk on the side.

23
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,737
Four tickets please...

24
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,612
Quickly, give me your money.

25
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,815
- Here...
- Twenty...

26
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,476
My twenty...

27
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,213
- You?
- Don't have any...

28
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,221
You're so cheap...

29
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,615
Why are you always like this?

30
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,215
Keeps eating, that's why...

31
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,350
Lets go, quick...

32
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,224
Hurry hurry...

33
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,221
It's just started.

34
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,432
Look at those...

35
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,770
Here Fatso.

36
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,785
This is a grape...

37
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,248
A very ripe grape...

38
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,253
Her name is 'Desire'.

39
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,256
And she desires...

40
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:29,993
A young and handsome man...

41
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,328
Look at that...

42
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,872
Who will love her...

43
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,539
And enjoy the juice of this grape.

44
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,696
What a beauty...

45
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,294
- Look behind...
- Why?

46
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,429
There's another movie going on.

47
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,302
Where's your wife?

48
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,437
Uncle!

49
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,911
Excuse me.

50
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,446
Yes?

51
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,517
You are very beautiful...

52
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,853
- Oh shit!
- What?

53
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,724
It's Mr. Rathod. The Moustache.

54
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,323
Run! It's the Moustache.

55
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,333
Bengali get up.

56
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,336
Look who it is...

57
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,664
Stop!

58
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,333
Run Fatso! Run fast.

59
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,868
Stop!

60
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,343
Come on, fast!

61
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,538
Stop! Benoy...

62
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,605
Benoy... Rohan...

63
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,617
What was Moustache doing there?

64
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,349
Watching the movie, what else?

65
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,754
Did he recognize us?

66
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,349
He was calling you
by your name, idiot!

67
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,757
Benoy... Benoy...

68
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,420
Oh shit! He has a bike.

69
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,361
Should've punctured the tyres.

70
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,762
Why didn't you think of that before?

71
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,357
What if he complains?

72
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,762
If we reach school before
him he can't do anything.

73
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,965
Run. Come on, run Manu...

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,564
This time we're dead.

75
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,768
Don't think too much...

76
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:22,509
- What happened?
- Lets see...

77
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,040
Don't...

78
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,384
He twisted his ankle.

79
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,044
And no one here to
straighten it out.

80
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,452
Shut up Bengali.

81
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,923
You guys carry on.
I'll get back on my own.

82
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,721
How? Will you fly?

83
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,455
Moustache will get you expelled.

84
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,724
And he'll throw you a parade?

85
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,590
Come on, lift him up.

86
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,462
Walk slowly...

87
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,004
Slowly...

88
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,536
Gently...

89
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,947
Oh shit!

90
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,082
Run!

91
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,421
Come on. Hurry!

92
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,418
Benoy... Do something...

93
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,486
Fatso lift his leg...

94
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,429
Hurry, you fat cow.

95
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,433
Run run run.

96
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,570
See you at school!

97
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,509
He's gone...

98
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,071
What did you do, Junior?

99
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,013
Didn't finish my tasks.

100
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,542
That's it?

101
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,744
They sent you to Heady for that?

102
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,815
And what did you do?

103
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,148
Went to town for a film last night.

104
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,549
Then?

105
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,486
He broke his leg.

106
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,618
So?

107
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,094
Our luck ran out...

108
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,555
Now?

109
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,023
Don't know...

110
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,493
You got caught?

111
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,098
No. We're here to kiss Heady.

112
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,032
What will your father do?

113
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,777
Break whatever bones I have left.

114
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,837
My father will send me to
my grandmother in Singur...

115
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,507
to study in a government school...

116
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,845
if it still exists...

117
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,786
My father will be reading the news...

118
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,788
He'll ask, "You're home?"

119
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,057
I'll say, "Yes, it's vacation time".

120
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,524
He'll ask, "When do you go back?"

121
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:48,651
I'll say, "When they phone."

122
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,053
So?

123
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,596
We don't have a phone at home.

124
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,924
And you?

125
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,126
Rohan...

126
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,529
The boy is asking what
Your father will do.

127
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,137
No idea...

128
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,611
I haven't seen him for eight years.

129
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,075
Why?

130
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,035
What was the name?

131
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,104
Whose name sir?

132
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,974
Name of the film.

133
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,648
Rohan?

134
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,650
Sir?

135
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,187
Kanti Shah's "Grapes."

136
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,660
Last year you left
all the taps running...

137
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,001
We had to evacuate the whole hostel.

138
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,598
No sir, that was two years ago...

139
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,666
Last year it was the fans...

140
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,137
Sorry sir.

141
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,613
I just spoke to your father Muninder.

142
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,740
We got a phone at home?

143
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,943
Shut up!

144
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,018
What did my father say?

145
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,613
He's coming to get you himself.

146
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,218
He's going to kill me sir.

147
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,887
Please... One last chance... Please...

148
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,827
Stand straight!

149
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,022
Yes.

150
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,227
This is the third
time you've been caught.

151
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,897
Your parents have been informed.

152
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,634
They're waiting for you at home.

153
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,971
You are expelled.

154
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,035
No Sir, please Sir.

155
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,637
Dismissed! All of you!

156
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,179
Rohan...

157
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,248
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,858
Excuse me sir?

159
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,663
Please ask Mr.
Rathod who the lady was?

160
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,671
The one whom he had his hand
in her blouse.

161
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,198
Please sir.

162
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,204
Where's Rohan?

163
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,206
There he is...

164
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,249
Scared?

165
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,323
We have to leave someday...

166
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,930
Couldn't stay in school forever...

167
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,069
Want to hear a poem?

168
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,472
Sure...

169
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,747
Tiny scattered moments,

170
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,755
Sprinkled on the garden of memories.

171
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,953
Strolling, bare foot, on them,

172
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,890
It feels we've wandered too far...

173
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,027
Now we can't remember,
where we left our shoes.

174
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,164
Our heels were soft when we got here.

175
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,032
They still feel tender,

176
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,831
And they will remain fragile,

177
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,166
Till those bittersweet memories,

178
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,769
Keep tingling them.

179
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,174
True, we've forgotten,

180
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,775
Where we left our shoes...

181
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,256
But now it seems, we
don't need them anymore.

182
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,332
Liked it?

183
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,873
Did you understand it?

184
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,165
We should've watched
the whole film...

185
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,903
Come to Bombay.

186
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,447
I'll show you
Paris Hilton's sex tape.

187
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,389
I'll miss you guys...

188
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,931
We too, pal.

189
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,933
Okay, then...

190
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,937
Take care...

191
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,065
You look after yourself.

192
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,267
You too.

193
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,008
Take care, man.

194
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,240
Take him home carefully, Moustache.

195
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,317
Does your wife know about the woman
whose blouse you had your hand in?

196
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,445
Idiot...

197
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,314
What?

198
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,649
Go.

199
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:36,928
The beauty has vanished.

200
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:46,344
Like smoke into thin air.

201
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:56,949
Then, we were lost in our dreams,

202
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:07,488
Now we face the unknown.

203
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,637
Is life over?

204
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:27,516
Or is it about to begin?

205
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,252
Is this nightfall?

206
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:37,387
Or is it a new dawn?

207
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,193
Is life over?

208
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:47,004
Or is it about to begin?

209
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:51,008
Is this nightfall?

210
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:55,536
Or is it a new dawn?

211
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:02,614
Will the future bring comfort?

212
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:14,023
Or will bring us to a crossroad?

213
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:23,634
Who knows what lies ahead...

214
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:10,350
Train is coming on Platform No. 2.

215
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,354
That's my bed.

216
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:56,839
Who is he?

217
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,841
Your brother.

218
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,384
My brother?

219
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,516
After your mother died...

220
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,922
I got married again.

221
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,054
It didn't work out...

222
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,385
Move...

223
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,346
Get up.

224
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,473
This is my bed.

225
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,350
Get up or I'll whack you so hard that
you'll go to the bathroom and cry.

226
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,745
Get up!

227
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,569
Come here.

228
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,374
This is my cupboard.

229
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:11,388
Listen pipsqueak. This cupboard
was mine before you were born...

230
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:16,393
Now that I'm back, this cupboard,
this table, this bed...

231
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,395
Everything is mine.
Nothing is yours.

232
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,592
What is your name?

233
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,723
Arjun.

234
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,048
Go and get him.

235
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,867
Sir is calling you.

236
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,136
Sir?

237
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,811
You call Papa 'Sir'?

238
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,880
Tell 'Sir' that I'm coming.

239
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,503
I'm coming.

240
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,904
Sir is getting angry.

241
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,521
Next time you'll have no hair left.

242
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,939
Little brother...

243
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,074
Big Brother...

244
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,617
Coming. Coming.

245
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,813
You're slow...

246
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,556
Good evening Uncle.

247
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,682
Here...

248
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,084
Here also...

249
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,562
And who is this?

250
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,090
As big as your uncle...

251
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,225
Hello.

252
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,964
His voice broke...

253
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,830
Good evening Auntie.

254
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,964
Good evening.

255
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,633
He is so handsome!

256
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,108
Handsome my ass.

257
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,110
Good evening to Auntie,

258
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,976
and only a 'hello' for me?

259
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,572
Well done...

260
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,178
Where is my hug?

261
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,713
Good to see you.

262
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,848
Listen...

263
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,586
Heard you were a bad boy at school...

264
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,986
Who was she?

265
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,121
Nobody.

266
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,597
I went to see a film with friends.

267
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,860
- At Rivoli?
- Yes.

268
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,799
We used to see lots of films there.

269
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,264
Good one?

270
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,602
- Don't know. We had to run back.
- Why

271
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,599
our warden was there.

272
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,733
Who?

273
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,868
Rathod.

274
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,206
- Big moustache.
- Yes.

275
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,940
Who made him a warden?

276
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,675
He used to be a peon.

277
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,614
Not him... His son.

278
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,618
He has a moustache too?

279
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,744
Yes.

280
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,686
Come in. Our moustache is watching.

281
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,218
So big man,

282
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,217
what now?

283
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,624
- College.
- College!

284
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,822
Everyone goes to college.

285
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,691
What will you study?

286
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,892
Arts, Literature.

287
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,161
Why not science?

288
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,702
I want to be a writer.

289
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,828
Wow!

290
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,030
What will you write?

291
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,769
Poems, novels, stories, or jokes?

292
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,901
Everything.

293
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,035
Nothing.

294
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,640
He'll write nothing.

295
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,849
He will study engineering
and work in my factory.

296
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:41,254
He wants to study literature.

297
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,055
What's wrong with that?

298
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:47,189
Writers are respected these days.

299
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,926
Respect won't feed him...

300
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,659
Writers only grow
their hair like girls,

301
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,670
wear a kurta, carry a bag...

302
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,672
And think they're brilliant.

303
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,731
But they're not.

304
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,669
Then they die. Either from hunger,

305
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,945
or as frustrated alcoholics.

306
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:10,885
If he lives in my house,
he has to obey my rules.

307
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,021
I don't want to work in a factory.

308
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,149
Did I ask for your opinion? Hmm?

309
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,820
Did anyone?

310
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,689
What are you staring at?

311
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,698
I'll whack you so hard your
eyes will fall into your plate.

312
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,965
Lower your eyes and eat your food.

313
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,108
See how cheeky he is Jimmy?

314
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,111
What would our father have done,

315
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,712
if we had behaved like this?

316
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,315
He would've melted our bones
along with steel in the furnace.

317
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,860
And if we'd been kicked out
of the best school in lndia...

318
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,788
Do you know what he would have done?

319
00:28:55,133 --> 00:29:01,732
We'd be out on the streets
till we proved our worth.

320
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,072
If you don't behave yourself,

321
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,803
I'll treat you the same way.

322
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:11,008
At least your father would not have
met you only once in eight years...

323
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:14,943
No, no...

324
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,077
He's just a child...

325
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,815
Child? He's insolent.

326
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:18,947
Let me go...

327
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,081
Hardly has a moustache..

328
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,752
And talks back to his father.

329
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,761
I'm talking to you...

330
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,824
How dare you...

331
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,765
Stop, stop... You'll kill him.

332
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,827
Let him go...

333
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,313
Enough.

334
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,208
Why do you talk to him like that?

335
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,802
He doesn't understand any other way.

336
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,876
He brought you into this world.

337
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,008
Mummy did that...

338
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,013
He is your father.

339
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,881
What kind of a father is he?

340
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,085
He abandoned me for eight years...

341
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:33,092
One letter a year which
sounded like the news on TV.

342
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,822
"Everything is fine here.
I got your results..."

343
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,095
"You could do better."

344
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,104
I had even forgotten his face...

345
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,037
I saw him at the station
and wondered who he was...

346
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,837
I'm his son, not a
fixed deposit in a bank.

347
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,244
I'll rather clean toilets all my life,
than to work for him.

348
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,521
Come on, get up.

349
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:18,271
Every father wants his son to
grow up to be just like himself.

350
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,939
Give him a chance.

351
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,075
He might understand.

352
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,210
I know that you'll do
whatever it is you want...

353
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,083
But first stand on your feet.

354
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:39,890
Then be whatever you want to
be; write or clean toilets.

355
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,292
Come...

356
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,633
The food's getting cold...

357
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,901
Come. For my sake...

358
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,238
You can't deny a fat man his food...

359
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,180
I'm starving.

360
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,927
Bring Arjun upstairs.

361
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,946
Arjun get up.

362
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,082
Arjun get up.

363
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,964
Let's get some facts straight...

364
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,364
This is my house...

365
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,968
If you stay here, you will
have to live by my rules.

366
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,104
First rule...

367
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,382
Call me Sir as Arjun does.

368
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,381
What did you call
your seniors at school?

369
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,989
Sir.

370
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,327
What happened at Jimmy's
should never happen again.

371
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,061
You will never...

372
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,004
Ever misbehave with me again...

373
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,998
You will not raise your voice...

374
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,005
And you will only do as I say.

375
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,138
Understood?

376
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,082
Okay.

377
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,209
The word is 'Yes'.

378
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes.

379
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,214
Yes what?

380
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,419
Yes Sir.

381
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:58,024
Give up your dreams of
becoming a writer.

382
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,299
It will not happen.

383
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,367
Stop flying.

384
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,433
Keep your feet on the ground.

385
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,436
Do you understand me?

386
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,505
Yes Sir.

387
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,640
You will come to the factory
with me from tomorrow onwards.

388
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:17,182
You'll work there till lunch and
then leave for the engineering college.

389
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,050
Thanks to your school record,

390
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,257
I've had to beg a
lot of favours for you.

391
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,058
If you let me down again...

392
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,332
I'll slit your throat.

393
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,195
Do you understand?

394
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,619
Did Sir shout at you?

395
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,617
He always shouts at me.

396
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,487
or beats me.

397
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:19,981
Be down in five minutes.

398
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:21,375
Arjun.

399
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,997
I'll show you the sights
of Jamshedpur while we jog.

400
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:40,599
When we return, we will
race from there to here.

401
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,597
But I don't want to race.

402
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,531
Has anyone asked you?

403
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:46,400
Lets go.

404
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,478
And you?

405
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,417
I can't run.

406
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,082
Why?

407
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,463
- Chotu.
- Brother...

408
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:48,069
Got your son running too?

409
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:49,605
Run Rohan run.

410
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:51,072
Come on! Catch up!

411
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:52,199
Shall I come too?

412
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,601
I'm coming...

413
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,204
Run.

414
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:37,715
You know who this is?

415
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,189
Sumant Moolgaonkar!

416
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,385
He made this park.

417
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,470
Come on...

418
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,601
Lets go.

419
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,473
Come on...

420
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,149
J.N. Tata.

421
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,149
J.R.D. Tata.

422
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,350
JUSCo.

423
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,159
P.N. Bose.

424
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,358
St. George's Church.

425
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,225
Come on.

426
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,246
Timing?

427
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,721
Forty one minutes.

428
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,716
Good.

429
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,322
Disgraceful!

430
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,740
Disgraceful!

431
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,333
Listen.

432
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,735
Study well.

433
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:17,870
I don't want to get any complaints.

434
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,006
Okay Sir.

435
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,512
This is my son Rohan.

436
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:02,586
He's been at Bishop Cotton School.

437
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,921
He will be joining us from today...

438
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:13,594
Let's hope he'll
work as hard as we do.

439
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:16,736
And be a good co-worker.

440
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:22,344
He is my son, but only at home.
Not here.

441
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:28,340
If anyone has a complaint
about him...

442
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,550
Please feel free to voice it.

443
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,413
Understood?

444
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:34,617
Now get to your work.

445
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,356
Come Mr. Rao.

446
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:37,751
You too.

447
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,358
Mr. Rao is the manager here.

448
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,957
He will brief you about your work.

449
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,494
He is older than you.

450
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,897
Shall we?

451
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:51,765
Just a moment...

452
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,906
Best of luck.

453
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,652
An engineer always faces the task

454
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,059
of describing shapes
of objects on paper.

455
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,796
The paper, through which an
engineer conveys the details

456
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:27,667
of a machine or object is
called Engineering Drawing.

457
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:32,134
In order to present the exact
size and shape of the object,

458
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,610
The lines are drawn perpendicular
to the planes of the paper

459
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,480
from various angles of the object,
giving an image on the paper.

460
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,747
These are called
orthographic projections.

461
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:46,487
In the figure 10.1,

462
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:51,016
all three sides,
that is front, side, top...

463
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:52,686
Can be seen together.

464
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:56,031
When the projections are
parallel to one another...

465
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,897
and also perpendicular
to the picture plane,

466
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:04,096
the projection thus forming a plane
is called orthographic projection.

467
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:08,035
When a surface, front, side or top...

468
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,037
of the object is to
be depicted separately,

469
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,844
it is drawn in the
true shape and proportion,

470
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:18,120
by assuming the object
placed in a particular position,

471
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,919
where only the surface
to be drawn is visible.

472
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:25,526
The projection is the representation
of the shape of an object.

473
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:28,587
on a plane or surface...

474
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:37,931
Don't you know that
style is taxed in college?

475
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:39,802
Now you know...

476
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:41,938
Will you cut your hair now?

477
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,546
What shall we do with him?

478
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:45,672
Sit-ups.

479
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,546
Fifty sit-ups.

480
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,082
Go down. All the way.

481
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,211
Stand.

482
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:53,617
Who's counting? My father?

483
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,089
He asked you to sit, not shit.

484
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,617
What are you laughing at?

485
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:27,116
You can't escape me now!

486
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,919
I'm big, you're small,

487
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,586
I'm stronger and I have a gun.

488
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:33,652
How will you kill me?

489
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:19,373
Put it on my account.

490
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:27,978
Come on. Lay out the food.

491
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,902
Why don't we keep a cook?

492
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:57,270
Will you pay?

493
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:02,274
And a maid for Arjun...

494
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,410
Yes, you can keep one.

495
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:05,754
When you earn, you can keep one.

496
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:09,753
Maid, cook, whatever...

497
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:13,423
There's a recession on.

498
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,323
Do you understand what that means?
Recession?

499
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:20,302
Go. Call Arjun.

500
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,103
Sir is calling you for dinner.

501
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,113
He's coming.

502
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:42,495
Yes!

503
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,608
Rum and coke.

504
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:48,435
I remember, I had chased him..

505
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:58,104
Do you know my name?

506
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:00,373
No.

507
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,242
Mishter Apu.

508
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,511
Mister Apu.

509
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:05,645
Mishter.

510
00:52:06,055 --> 00:52:07,113
Mister...

511
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,058
- Mishter...!
- Mishter...

511
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,058
- Apu.
- Apu.

512
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,724
We are your seniors.
You know that means, don't you?

513
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,623
Yes.

514
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:22,160
Then you also know that a senior
can do anything to a junior as he likes.

515
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,398
What shall we do with him?

516
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:27,400
Sing a song?

517
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,069
What the fuck fatso!

518
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,138
You always make people sing.

519
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,449
He makes everyone sing.

520
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,077
You want to make it to lndian ldol?

521
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,345
Why do you keep asking me?

522
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,479
Ask him. He never says anything.

523
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:40,681
Okay. You.
What shall we do with him?

524
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,351
What will you do?

525
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:47,153
You understand sit-ups?

526
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,688
No

527
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:50,757
Look, like this...

528
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,126
Sit down and then up...

529
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,103
Sing a song on sit-ups.

530
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,571
Shut up, fatty...

531
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,109
Do it. Sit and then up...

532
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:03,436
Hands on your ears...

533
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,476
Sit and then up.

534
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:08,344
Please sing. Sing a song on sit up.

535
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:09,776
I know you know a song.

536
00:53:10,486 --> 00:53:13,717
You're sitting so quietly,
there's something on your mind...

537
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,258
It's our first meeting,
it's our first meeting...

538
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:25,464
Well sung...

539
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:27,397
- You making fun of me?
- No...

540
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:30,128
- Are you making fun of me?
- Fun? I'm not making fun...

541
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,071
In front of this boy.

542
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:34,268
No man, you sang well...

543
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:35,402
He laughed at me.

544
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:37,806
Don't laugh.

545
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:39,375
You're making fun of me fatso.

546
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,349
No I'm not.

547
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:43,146
He always does this.

548
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,277
Why are you getting angry?

549
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,219
Who have you come to bully?

550
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,257
Him or me?

551
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:49,682
Let it go.

552
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:50,817
No, I won't...

553
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,417
Don't listen to fatso. He's mad.

554
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,690
- If he's mad, he shouldn't be here.
- Calm down.

555
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,289
Will you like it if I made
fun of you in front of the boy?

556
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,425
Listen to me...

557
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,436
- What did I say...
- Let it go man.

558
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,096
Let it go man. We're friends.

559
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:05,373
Let it go. Let's drink.

560
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:07,306
You can't afford to buy booze.

561
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,368
You live off this guy.
How will you buy me booze?

562
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:11,777
How can I live off him?
He wears shorts.

563
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,110
Listen to that.

564
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,543
You just eat all day fatso.

565
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:18,178
You shut up. Let's drink.

566
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,778
Who's buying drinks?

567
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,118
He is.

568
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:26,184
- Which school were you in?
- Bishop Cotton.

569
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:27,854
Bishaap.

570
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:30,529
- Where is it?
- Shimla.

571
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:33,201
You must feel cold then?

572
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,327
Here?

573
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:36,262
From the hills aren't you?

574
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,343
You know what fatso's father does?

575
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,469
What?

576
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,412
He sells panties & bras.

577
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:47,546
Sits on a stool all day...

578
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,551
With bras and panties.

579
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,814
My friends and
I always wanted to do that.

580
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:55,722
Lingerie shop!

581
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,225
Cheers to Lingerie Shops!

582
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,351
Cheers!

583
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,487
To fatso. Who never gets the joke.

584
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,621
Cheers!

585
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,564
Now that you've left school..

586
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:09,602
Your dad must be breathing fire...

587
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:11,297
He must be saying...

588
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:15,505
No more studies. Waste of time.
Join family business.

589
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:17,904
How do you know that?

590
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,340
All small town fathers are alike.

591
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:24,910
Family business...

592
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:26,386
Very good, very good...

593
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,718
Dream business...

594
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,257
Very bad, very bad...

595
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:32,653
What's your dream business?

596
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:35,489
I want to be a writer.

597
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:37,390
Writer!

598
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,593
Javed Akhtar.

599
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,931
- Written something?
- Yes.

600
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,664
Let's hear it...

601
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,847
He'll eat every strand of your hair.

602
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:55,750
If you let him,
he'll eat all the days of the year.

603
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:59,521
He'll eat the food of
a starving man,

604
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:02,721
and the last wishes of a dying man.

605
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:05,390
He'll eat Laloo's children,

606
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:07,292
and the Naxal core.

607
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:09,224
He'll eat the fun of youth,

608
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:10,765
and the warmth of old age...

609
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,436
He'll eat the life of
a woman with no shame,

610
00:56:14,837 --> 00:56:16,304
and if given a chance...

611
00:56:17,306 --> 00:56:18,432
He'll eat all your thoughts as well.

612
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,238
Even a tortoise is faster,
fatso master...

613
00:56:25,314 --> 00:56:28,772
He is a gas-blaster,
fatso master...

614
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:32,252
Fatso master is a total disaster...

615
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:35,381
Total Disaster is fatso master.

616
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:38,890
Speaks from his ass, fatso master.

617
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:41,930
Drinks only Fosters, fatso master.

618
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,627
Equals a hundred elephants,
fatso master.

619
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:49,259
Stomach or equator? Fatso master.

620
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:52,796
Larger than extra large,
fatso master.

621
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,935
Original loo breaker,
fatso master.

622
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:59,675
The Titanic's anchor,
fatso master.

623
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,639
Disgraceful.

624
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:57,890
Let's go.

625
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:04,052
Careful with the steps.
Don't fall.

626
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,184
Okay. Okay.

627
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,594
Leave me, I'm fine...

628
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,189
Wrong side...

629
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,791
No... You sit here. He'll drive.

630
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,527
Who'll drive? Rohan will.

631
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:19,131
Yes, he'll drive, you go to sleep

632
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,266
Him?

633
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,171
You sleep, he'll drive.

634
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:26,214
No, I'll drive.

635
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:30,150
Please sit. Let Rohan drive.

636
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,618
You go to sleep.

637
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,211
- He can drive?
- Of course he can.

638
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:36,616
Please go to sleep.

639
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,605
When did you learn to drive?

640
01:01:51,907 --> 01:01:59,034
When I was at Bishop Cotton, I drove
Mr. Pasli's car during the holidays.

641
01:02:05,654 --> 01:02:08,316
What else don't I know about you?

642
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:13,185
Speak up!

643
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,988
Do you smoke?

644
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,124
No.

645
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:19,992
Alcohol?

646
01:02:20,669 --> 01:02:21,727
No.

647
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:24,332
Must have a girlfriend?

648
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:25,665
Have not.

649
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,241
Have you had sex?

650
01:02:35,684 --> 01:02:36,742
No.

651
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:39,084
No sex!?

652
01:02:39,154 --> 01:02:40,621
No! Go to sleep.

653
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:41,747
Lower your voice.

654
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,016
Idiot...

655
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:45,818
Hasn't even had sex yet.

656
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,806
I had so many plans for you...

657
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:37,668
To send you to England
to become a engineer...

658
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:41,215
But you've ruined everything.

659
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,244
Which college will take you?

660
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,319
Will any college take you?

661
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:55,296
Will they? No!

662
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:58,197
Can't even take a little pain eh?

663
01:03:58,767 --> 01:03:59,825
Not even this much?

664
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,428
Idiot.

665
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:07,002
You're not a boy. You're a girl.

666
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:15,442
You look like a girl too.

667
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,184
Just like your mother.

668
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,021
She loved you very much.

669
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:30,357
More than me...

670
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,059
Understood?

671
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,465
Get lost.

672
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,809
I came to see you at school...

673
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:54,822
Met your principal too.

674
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,426
You were playing football...

675
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:03,262
You looked so happy,
I didn't want to disturb you...

676
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,496
And besides...

677
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,497
I had nothing nice to say.

678
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,471
Idiot girl!

679
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,937
Haven't even had sex...

680
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:21,907
Leave me alone!

681
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,381
I'm okay now.

682
01:05:27,122 --> 01:05:28,180
Girl!

683
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:45,097
What?

684
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,537
He was the original drunkard.

685
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,076
Drunk all day long.

686
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:54,540
The first thing
he did every morning.

687
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,310
Eat booze. Drink booze. Piss booze.

688
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,822
Sold my mother's
wedding necklace for a drink.

689
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,553
He'd curse and beat
her when she protested.

690
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:11,057
My sister and I could only watch.

691
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:15,426
One day, I came home and
he was beating her again.

692
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:17,837
My mother isn't a
bag of dirty laundry.

693
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,568
I got pissed off...

694
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:23,110
I became a hero and
caught him by the collar.

695
01:06:23,178 --> 01:06:26,579
"Enough of your drama!" I shouted.

696
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,518
And threw him out of the house.

697
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:33,313
Told him never to look back.

698
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:38,926
Then I slammed the door shut
and turned towards my mother.

699
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,923
I thought she would embrace me.

700
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:44,330
But I got a tight slap instead.

701
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:52,032
Then she led that moron back in...

702
01:06:54,943 --> 01:06:59,471
And she said, "Whatever happens, he
is my husband and you're his son."

703
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:06,315
I became an orphan that day.

704
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,148
Left home...

705
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:12,625
But I didn't leave Jamshedpur.

706
01:07:12,694 --> 01:07:13,956
My biggest mistake.

707
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:28,399
Fatso, before all this
heartache kills me, let's fight...

708
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,502
- No man.
- Come on, fatso.

709
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,479
- Let it go. It's been ages.

710
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,981
No, Apu. Apu sit.
Apu, don't go.

711
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:37,485
Apu wait.
Apu, Apu...

712
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:40,653
- Apu..
- I've been playing this since childhood.

713
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,648
Who the hell is this?

714
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:46,186
This isn't carrom son. Go play Ludo.

715
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:48,487
What's he doing?

716
01:07:48,997 --> 01:07:52,660
Don't ask.

717
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:54,059
This isn't carrom son.

718
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:56,464
Really? Is it that funny?

719
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:57,663
Shall I make you cry instead?

720
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,064
What did you say? Make me cry?

721
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:01,541
Yes. I'll make you cry.

722
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,469
Where do you stay?

723
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:05,012
- Wait, wait...
- What did you say?

724
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,138
I'll make you cry.

725
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:07,540
- You'll make me cry?
- Yes.

726
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:08,981
- Do you know who I am?
- Who are you?

727
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,951
- Don't you recognize me?
- Who are you?

728
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:12,953
- Don't you recognize me?
- Who are you?

729
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:16,286
- Are you new here?
- Are you?

730
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,019
Why are you wasting your
time with this mad man?

731
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,253
See how he's talking to me!

732
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,386
Who are you?

733
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:21,690
I'm Aseem Khettry's son.

734
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:23,025
Sure you're not his driver's son?

735
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:24,156
And now you're dead!

736
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,997
- You!
- Hey, let go off him!

737
01:08:28,303 --> 01:08:30,100
- You scoundrel!
- Stop.

738
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:47,054
Messing with Khettry's son?

739
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:48,316
Go play carrom, idiot.

740
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,994
- Stop!
- Take this.

741
01:08:56,498 --> 01:08:59,194
Fatso, he's calling the police.
Let's get out quick.

742
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:07,469
Lets go.

743
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,638
Wait.

744
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:13,579
No, no, no...

745
01:09:17,085 --> 01:09:18,143
Let's get out.

746
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:31,624
Come on, Shiv...

747
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:45,374
Run, fatso!

748
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:53,580
Open the door, quick.

749
01:09:57,392 --> 01:09:58,723
Open the door.

750
01:10:00,128 --> 01:10:02,187
Quick, open, open, open...

751
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:15,274
Get lost! Blow me!
You fuckers! Get lost!

752
01:10:27,155 --> 01:10:28,213
What did you tell him?

753
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,658
I said, "Look son..."

754
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:33,558
"Play pool with me
instead of these fools."

755
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:36,824
"I can pot the ball without a stick."

756
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,326
You're lying.

757
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,460
No, I swear.

758
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:42,764
Then he told me to get lost...

759
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:47,172
So I said, "This is why
you're here putting balls in..."

760
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,676
"And your wife does the
same at home with other men."

761
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,704
- You never said that...
- He's lying...

762
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,147
I really did say it.

763
01:10:55,617 --> 01:10:58,848
Then he kept staring at me.
So I said, "What are you looking at?"

764
01:10:59,187 --> 01:11:03,590
"Want to see your wife's tattoo?
It's across both cheeks of my ass."

765
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:05,851
You said that?

766
01:11:05,927 --> 01:11:09,192
Balls, you said that. Fuck off.

767
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:10,789
I really did!

768
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,134
But it was fun...

769
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:18,667
Fatso doesn't believe me, eh?

770
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:22,335
Apu, don't. Stop it.

771
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,145
- Hey it's raining.
- Rain!

772
01:11:27,215 --> 01:11:31,879
Filled with the joy of life.

773
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:41,560
Bursting with delight.

774
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:47,161
We never asked for this moment...

775
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:49,226
We stole it.

776
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:53,505
This is how we will live...

777
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:38,477
If we had ran faster,
we wouldn't have been expelled.

778
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:40,612
Rohan?

779
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:41,747
No, it's the Moustache.

780
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:43,581
Look behind you.
I'm standing there with my bike.

781
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:45,951
Rohan, how are you?

782
01:12:46,561 --> 01:12:47,619
Manu...

783
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,688
How are you?

784
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,790
I'm good.
Why are you awake this late?

785
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,631
Jamshedpur has a new disco?

786
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,968
No man. I sneaked out
to drink with some friends.

787
01:12:58,306 --> 01:12:59,967
Grown up already?

788
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,900
Oh shut up.
We got into a fight as well.

789
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:06,312
Beat up two guys. Had a blast.

790
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:07,906
You're mad...

791
01:13:08,316 --> 01:13:09,408
Totally mad.

792
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:11,376
You okay?

793
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:12,511
Totally fine.

794
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,315
How's your father?

795
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:16,550
Not father. Call him "Sir".

796
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:20,886
Makes me work at his factory
and study engineering at the college...

797
01:13:20,962 --> 01:13:22,862
Says I should study.
There's a recession on...

798
01:13:23,331 --> 01:13:24,389
Do you know what recession means?

799
01:13:24,866 --> 01:13:26,493
I don't know what it means.

800
01:13:27,602 --> 01:13:32,335
Even if I fail all my exams,
he can't do anything.

801
01:13:32,874 --> 01:13:33,932
He can't do shit...

802
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:38,711
I also have a younger half-brother.

803
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:42,412
A six-year old brother who
I didn't even know existed.

804
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,010
Are you okay?

805
01:13:45,353 --> 01:13:48,880
I'm fine. I really am.
Meet the new town drunk.

806
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,326
Enough about me.
How are Vikram and Benoy?

807
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:53,952
Everyone is fine...

808
01:13:54,629 --> 01:13:58,030
Vikram's Dad has a new restaurant.
Vikram is working there.

809
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:01,932
Benoy's in art school.
He's changed completely.

810
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:06,602
Wears a kurta, quotes Tagore.
Shows a new girl his room everyday.

811
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,033
Why? Is it a special room?

812
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,800
Yes... It has a bed...

813
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,041
And you?

814
01:14:16,117 --> 01:14:17,914
I'm fine. Looking for work.

815
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,852
Dad still ignores me
and reads his news...

816
01:14:21,389 --> 01:14:26,622
And mom sulks as if mom caught dad
watching the Kanti Shah's "Grapes".

817
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,397
- Are you happy?
- I am...

818
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,526
- And you?
- Me too...

819
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,060
You sure?

820
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:37,062
I'm sure...

821
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:39,805
I miss you guys a lot.

822
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,934
Come to Bombay.
Tell your father...

823
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:45,411
... that we'll take care of everything.
Even you'll have fun.

824
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,745
I will come. For sure.

825
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,951
Listen, I don't have much money,
I'll call you some other time.

826
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,355
Tell Vikram and Benoy
that I said "Hi", okay?

827
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:57,424
I will... and you take care...

828
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:58,550
I will.

829
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,356
- And keep calling...
- I will...

830
01:15:00,428 --> 01:15:01,656
Okay, bye...

831
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:15,909
- Chotu.
- Brother...

832
01:16:14,502 --> 01:16:16,163
Bhairav Singh

833
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:19,062
I am coming to get you...

834
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,502
Do you understand recession?

835
01:16:24,045 --> 01:16:25,512
Disgraceful.

836
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,205
Was this picnic your idea?

837
01:16:58,546 --> 01:17:01,071
Your father isn't as bad
as you make him out to be.

838
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,784
I just don't get him.
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

839
01:17:07,555 --> 01:17:09,750
Spoken like a true writer...

840
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:12,087
I'm not talking like a writer...

841
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:16,160
Your mother would have been
proud if she were alive today.

842
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,563
She always wanted you
to be a writer.

843
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,094
- Really?
- Yes.

844
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,627
She never told your father,
but she told me...

845
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:30,510
How she would have loved that line...
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

846
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:37,845
Sometimes a demon,
sometimes a lamb.

847
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,581
Stop it!

848
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:53,132
I have an idea...

849
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:55,192
What is it?

850
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,037
Let's hear one of Rohan's poems...

851
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:05,743
He's written a full-length novel...

852
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:10,275
I'm not asking you to
change your mind...

853
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:14,218
Listen to it.
If you don't like it, don't applaud.

854
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,886
Come on, big man.
Go for it.

855
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:29,226
If you could see past the shore,
you would know what I am thinking.

856
01:18:30,171 --> 01:18:34,904
If you could hear the waves,
you would know what I am thinking.

857
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:40,845
Remove your veil of obstinacy,
and look beyond the window.

858
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:46,311
If you could see through convention,
you would know what I am thinking.

859
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:52,617
If you had faith in yourself as I do,
you could walk with me a while...

860
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:58,155
If you could see the colours as I do,
you could walk with me a while.

861
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,600
If you want to touch the sky as I do,

862
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:03,899
then your desires would come true.

863
01:19:04,672 --> 01:19:09,336
Then, in my next life,
we could fly together a while.

864
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:18,210
Forget it.

865
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,619
Only a woman's magazine will publish it...

866
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:22,986
...or someone will drop a
coin in your begging bowl.

867
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:12,664
Hello.

868
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,768
Please... Sit...

869
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,470
Hello.

870
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:19,604
- How are you?
- Please, have a seat.

871
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,738
How was the journey?

872
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:23,050
Okay, our flight got a bit delayed.

873
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,143
I made these for you to read.

874
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:54,844
They're good...

875
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,745
I'm glad you came today.

876
01:20:58,786 --> 01:21:00,117
I'm off to Kolkata tomorrow...

877
01:21:00,588 --> 01:21:03,182
Let me show you the workshop.

878
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:05,049
Sure.

879
01:21:10,598 --> 01:21:11,656
Hello?

880
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:13,199
- Is that Mr. Singh?
- Yes?

881
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:16,901
I'm Mrs Batra here,
Principal of Arjun's school.

882
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:18,529
Yes Mrs Batra, tell me.

883
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:21,734
There's been another problem with
your son, Arjun, this morning...

884
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:25,512
You know? We'd like you to come here
and take him back home today.

885
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:29,739
I'm in a meeting right now.
Can I come after lunch?

886
01:21:30,017 --> 01:21:32,815
No Mr. Singh. This is an
extremely serious problem.

887
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:33,979
I know Mrs. Batra but...

888
01:21:35,089 --> 01:21:36,852
Keep him in your office for some time.

889
01:21:36,924 --> 01:21:38,482
Mr. Singh please understand.

890
01:21:38,559 --> 01:21:40,823
I cannot allow Arjun to
remain in school today.

891
01:21:41,829 --> 01:21:44,093
Okay, I'm coming.

892
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:45,223
In half an hour?

893
01:21:45,299 --> 01:21:46,630
Yes Mrs. Batra. I'm coming right now.

894
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:47,759
Thank you, Mr. Singh.

895
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:55,235
I'm sorry, but I have to
rush to my son's school.

896
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:58,909
He's been unwell
recently and it got worse today.

897
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,848
But Mr. Rao will show
you around the workshop.

898
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:05,579
No problem. We'll come back tomorrow.

899
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:07,917
We have other factories to see today.

900
01:22:08,055 --> 01:22:11,752
But I told you, I have to be in
Kolkata tomorrow. I've committed it.

901
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,252
I am sorry. We can't stay any longer.

902
01:22:15,129 --> 01:22:18,155
Anyway. We'll meet again.
Some other time?

903
01:22:18,866 --> 01:22:19,924
Okay...

904
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:21,192
Let's go.

905
01:22:51,632 --> 01:22:52,690
What happened?

906
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:53,958
Get in the car.

907
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,178
What happened?

908
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:16,750
His blood pressure is very low.

909
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,158
Seems like he's had a bad fall.

910
01:23:19,927 --> 01:23:21,224
There could be internal bleeding.

911
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,964
I'll have to check. We'll keep him
under observation for a few days.

912
01:23:25,032 --> 01:23:26,090
How many days?

913
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:27,725
Four to five days.

914
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:28,860
Four to five days?

915
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:31,962
Don't worry. He'll
be fine. Don't worry.

916
01:23:32,873 --> 01:23:33,931
Thank you.

917
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:38,670
How did it happen?

918
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:40,271
Fell down the stairs.

919
01:23:41,682 --> 01:23:42,740
How?

920
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,675
How should I know? He just fell.

921
01:23:49,957 --> 01:23:51,356
You go home. I'll stay here.

922
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:53,751
I'm also staying.

923
01:23:58,299 --> 01:23:59,357
What happened to your results?

924
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:02,364
- I passed.
- Marks?

925
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:05,763
- They're good.
- Good.

926
01:24:14,248 --> 01:24:15,840
I'm going to Kolkata for three days.

927
01:24:17,985 --> 01:24:20,886
If all goes well,
I'll return with a few contracts.

928
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:23,889
You stay here with Arjun.

929
01:24:24,191 --> 01:24:26,716
And don't leave him alone, okay?

930
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:27,852
Yes Sir.

931
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,258
And...

932
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:36,861
No need to inform Uncle and Auntie.

933
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:41,406
I've told them that both of
you are going with me, okay?

934
01:24:41,742 --> 01:24:42,800
Yes Sir.

935
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,204
Fine.

936
01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:57,081
Have you eaten?

937
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:05,764
Sir has gone to Kolkata.

938
01:25:08,302 --> 01:25:09,360
Aren't you happy?

939
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:18,970
What happened yesterday?

940
01:25:48,008 --> 01:25:49,066
For you.

941
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:57,809
And these...

942
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,477
If you feel like reading.

943
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:10,362
This has my poems and stories.

944
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:12,089
Would you like to hear some?

945
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:17,428
Hello Arjun.

946
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:20,299
Are you feeling well today?

947
01:26:21,008 --> 01:26:22,066
Good.

948
01:26:28,048 --> 01:26:29,310
Could you change his clothes?

949
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:30,850
- Yes.
- Thank you.

950
01:26:35,389 --> 01:26:36,447
What is it?

951
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:06,878
What now?

952
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:10,874
Lunch was to be served by 12:30!
Its 1:00 p.m now!

953
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,885
Please don't shout.
It's bad for you.

954
01:28:12,953 --> 01:28:14,181
Yes I know.

955
01:28:14,488 --> 01:28:15,887
I can get a heart attack.

956
01:28:15,956 --> 01:28:18,049
But what if I die of hunger before that?

957
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:20,184
I'll go and get your food now.

958
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:21,890
Get it fast...

959
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:24,624
Corpses don't eat.

960
01:28:29,503 --> 01:28:30,629
Why don't you laugh?

961
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:33,232
I am 80 years old...

962
01:28:34,241 --> 01:28:35,640
Grandfather of six.

963
01:28:36,143 --> 01:28:37,440
Great grandfather of two...

964
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:38,970
Can't I shout?

965
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:40,972
Laugh.

966
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:42,974
Laugh.

967
01:28:58,365 --> 01:28:59,423
Would you like to listen to a poem?

968
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:11,602
Chandu's Cycle.

969
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:14,947
Chandu's cycle was
just like Chandu...

970
01:29:15,549 --> 01:29:18,416
As it moved, it crickered and
crankered, just like Chandu.

971
01:29:19,286 --> 01:29:22,346
The handle was as light
as Chandu's slender hand.

972
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,983
The pedals were as thin
as Chandu's spindle legs.

973
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:29,953
The seat was as broad
as Chandu's huge buttocks.

974
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,963
The carrier was as small
as Chandu's short career.

975
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:36,093
Yet, it was Chandu's true friend.

976
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,003
It was always loyal to Chandu.

977
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:42,500
It took Chandu's heavy weight with ease.

978
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:46,513
One day the cycle broke down.

979
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:48,972
Seeing a bull charging at him,

980
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,414
Chandu dropped it hard.

981
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,977
When Monty Mechanic
could not save the cycle,

982
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:57,988
Chandu's father sold
it to a scrap dealer.

983
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:01,986
Chandu drowned himself in his books.

984
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:05,098
Like he had an old dream to fulfill.

985
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,132
Later, when Chandu grew up,

986
01:30:07,534 --> 01:30:09,001
He used his very first salary...

987
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:12,998
And got himself a new cycle...

988
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:15,066
But...

989
01:30:15,242 --> 01:30:16,300
But?

990
01:30:16,543 --> 01:30:20,001
This cycle too was
just like Chandu...

991
01:30:20,347 --> 01:30:23,009
It still crickered and
crankered as it moved around.

992
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:25,017
It's seat was...

993
01:30:25,085 --> 01:30:27,144
As broad as Chandu's huge buttocks.

994
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:29,015
The carrier was as small...

995
01:30:29,089 --> 01:30:31,023
as Chandu's short career.

996
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:35,086
You wrote that?

997
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:38,026
- Yes
- Wow...

998
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:39,757
Very good.

999
01:30:40,634 --> 01:30:42,033
Very inspiring!

1000
01:30:42,269 --> 01:30:44,703
- Thank you.
- Keep writing like this, son.

1001
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:46,770
Keep writing.

1002
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:50,702
Write.

1003
01:30:59,653 --> 01:31:02,645
How many friends do
you have in school?

1004
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,118
Seven.

1005
01:31:07,194 --> 01:31:08,252
Their names?

1006
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:09,520
Apurva,

1007
01:31:10,064 --> 01:31:11,463
Sunny, Raju,

1008
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:13,056
Batuk, Kunal...

1009
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,234
Kunal..., Kunal...,

1010
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:16,360
Veer.

1011
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:18,129
And?

1012
01:31:18,338 --> 01:31:19,396
And...

1013
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:21,665
That's only six.

1014
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:25,272
And one more...

1015
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:27,605
Tushar.

1016
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,413
You have so many friends.

1017
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:31,278
I have only three.

1018
01:31:32,619 --> 01:31:34,143
What was your mother like?

1019
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,455
My mother was very nice.

1020
01:31:38,692 --> 01:31:40,159
She loved me a lot.

1021
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,323
She smelled wonderful,

1022
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,091
when I'd cuddle up to sleep.

1023
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:46,096
Just like a mother.

1024
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,170
I don't know what
my mother was like.

1025
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,102
Do you know her?

1026
01:31:53,707 --> 01:31:54,765
No.

1027
01:32:02,449 --> 01:32:03,507
Mr Poet...

1028
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,348
Why don't you ever laugh?

1029
01:32:08,722 --> 01:32:09,780
Yes.

1030
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,121
Look at you now. You look so good.

1031
01:32:13,727 --> 01:32:15,126
When do we hear something new?

1032
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:16,487
Tonight?

1033
01:32:16,663 --> 01:32:17,721
In the night?

1034
01:32:18,465 --> 01:32:19,727
Do you also write at night?

1035
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:21,192
Sometimes.

1036
01:32:21,268 --> 01:32:22,394
Beware of the night...

1037
01:32:23,203 --> 01:32:24,261
You see...

1038
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:26,129
The day destroys the night.

1039
01:32:26,473 --> 01:32:27,735
Night divides the day.

1040
01:32:28,308 --> 01:32:29,366
Try to run.

1041
01:32:29,676 --> 01:32:30,734
Try to hide...

1042
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:32,277
Break on through to the other side.

1043
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:38,150
This is the true
story of three friends...

1044
01:32:38,418 --> 01:32:41,148
Muninder, Benoy and Rohit.

1045
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:45,151
The kingdom where they lived,

1046
01:32:45,225 --> 01:32:47,159
would choose the smartest boys
for training.

1047
01:32:47,494 --> 01:32:51,760
Years later, they would join
the King's prestigious army.

1048
01:32:52,432 --> 01:32:56,163
But nobody really knew what
went on inside the castle.

1049
01:32:56,703 --> 01:33:00,161
Their parents didn't know
that the King's evil minister,

1050
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,607
was brain-washing the kids
and turning them into robots.

1051
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:05,173
Is it a true story?

1052
01:33:05,245 --> 01:33:06,303
Yes.

1053
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:09,178
The wicked man's name was Rathod.

1054
01:33:09,249 --> 01:33:10,307
Rathod!

1055
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:11,578
Yes, Rathod.

1056
01:34:15,782 --> 01:34:17,875
Vikreet and Benoy were
with the full Robot Army...

1057
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:20,243
Muninder and the kids
were due any minute now...

1058
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:23,546
Rohit was worried.
They hadn't come yet.

1059
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:28,257
He turned around. And froze.
A terrified look came into his eyes.

1060
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:30,920
He saw someone
coming through the tunnel.

1061
01:34:31,598 --> 01:34:33,395
Someone was coming from the tunnel...

1062
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,593
Who was coming?

1063
01:34:38,505 --> 01:34:39,938
Who was it?

1064
01:34:45,879 --> 01:34:47,904
- We'll finish tomorrow...
- Now!

1065
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:55,747
34 in Chemistry.

1066
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:59,418
20 in Physics. 15 in Maths.

1067
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:02,285
You told me you passed.

1068
01:35:03,897 --> 01:35:07,958
Is this a joke to you?

1069
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:12,304
I thought you'd finally
become serious about your studies.

1070
01:35:12,372 --> 01:35:16,832
You're narrating
stories to half-dead people.

1071
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:19,309
Just to hear them tell you
what a good writer you are?

1072
01:35:20,314 --> 01:35:21,372
What are you staring at?

1073
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:23,374
Lower your eyes.

1074
01:35:24,718 --> 01:35:26,982
If this wasn't a hospital,
I would skin you right now.

1075
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:31,314
I'm not going to
forget this in a hurry.

1076
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:36,562
Come home. I'll make
sure I get an answer.

1077
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:45,335
What did Sir say?

1078
01:35:45,472 --> 01:35:48,339
Sir said that he will send
me to the hospital as well.

1079
01:35:48,475 --> 01:35:49,533
Why?

1080
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:51,536
Because I failed my exams.

1081
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:55,344
So you'll go back to
boarding school?

1082
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:56,940
No. Why?

1083
01:35:57,017 --> 01:36:01,647
Sir said if I don't pass,
he'll send me to a boarding school.

1084
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:20,764
What happened that day?

1085
01:37:22,102 --> 01:37:23,433
Sir hit me.

1086
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:26,497
Why?

1087
01:37:26,573 --> 01:37:31,033
Two boys were teasing me at school.
I broke one's teeth.

1088
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:34,505
Did he beat you a lot?

1089
01:37:34,581 --> 01:37:36,446
He beat me with a belt.

1090
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:33,030
Shall we go?

1091
01:38:48,188 --> 01:38:49,519
How old are you?

1092
01:38:57,697 --> 01:38:59,221
I'm asking you something.

1093
01:39:00,133 --> 01:39:01,191
How old are you?

1094
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:04,595
Seventeen.

1095
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:06,597
Seventeen...

1096
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:09,138
And you still don't use your brain.

1097
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:13,542
When will you start?
After you turn forty?

1098
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:20,611
Why did you fail?

1099
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:23,280
I didn't study.

1100
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:24,615
Why not?

1101
01:39:24,858 --> 01:39:26,621
I don't understand engineering.

1102
01:39:27,093 --> 01:39:28,958
You didn't try hard enough.

1103
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:30,621
- I did.
- Shut up!

1104
01:39:32,198 --> 01:39:33,256
Bloody failure.

1105
01:39:40,073 --> 01:39:41,870
When you weren't studying,
what were you doing?

1106
01:39:43,577 --> 01:39:44,669
I sit by the river.

1107
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:47,104
What did you do there?

1108
01:39:51,751 --> 01:39:54,311
What did you do there?
Smoke cigarettes?

1109
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:57,948
Yes.

1110
01:39:59,759 --> 01:40:00,817
When did you start smoking?

1111
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:02,653
In school.

1112
01:40:03,763 --> 01:40:06,231
So why did you lie earlier?

1113
01:40:21,147 --> 01:40:22,205
Light it.

1114
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,611
I'm not joking. Light it.

1115
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,238
Smoke it....

1116
01:41:46,232 --> 01:41:47,893
What other lies have you told me?

1117
01:41:52,772 --> 01:41:57,232
Lying is a weakness. It's cowardice.

1118
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:02,244
A liar is a spineless person.

1119
01:42:03,783 --> 01:42:07,116
A person doesn't have the balls to
say what he really believes.

1120
01:42:08,855 --> 01:42:10,254
You're a coward.

1121
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,187
Do you have the
balls to hear the truth?

1122
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:15,189
I ask the questions here.

1123
01:42:15,328 --> 01:42:18,263
I said I want to be a writer.
Did you listen?

1124
01:42:18,465 --> 01:42:21,923
You knew that I'm a good writer.
Everyone likes my writing...

1125
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:25,937
I don't. And I will
not discuss it anymore.

1126
01:42:26,339 --> 01:42:28,739
How often have you lied to me?

1127
01:42:28,808 --> 01:42:30,139
Every time you
couldn't digest the truth

1128
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:32,474
And where is your spine?

1129
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:35,738
You lied as well. You said
that Arjun fell down the stairs.

1130
01:42:36,015 --> 01:42:37,482
He didn't fall down the stairs.

1131
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:39,816
I knew that you beat
him with your belt.

1132
01:42:39,886 --> 01:42:42,013
I lost a contract that
worth a lot because of him.

1133
01:42:42,288 --> 01:42:45,348
He should understand
the consequences.

1134
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:47,016
- By hitting him?
- It was a mistake.

1135
01:42:47,093 --> 01:42:48,151
By sending him to hospital?

1136
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:51,493
I didn't want to send him to the hospital.
I said it was a mistake.

1137
01:42:51,564 --> 01:42:54,362
I didn't want to hit him.
I apologized to him.

1138
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:59,098
Well done, Sir.
Scar the child for life, scare him to death...

1139
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:02,374
And then apologise.
Your father would have been proud.

1140
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:08,771
I said it happened by mistake,
I didn't want to hit him...

1141
01:43:09,382 --> 01:43:10,440
Did I tell you?

1142
01:43:12,185 --> 01:43:13,243
Sir?

1143
01:43:13,386 --> 01:43:14,444
What?

1144
01:43:14,854 --> 01:43:16,446
Won't you apologise to me now?

1145
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:17,848
You!

1146
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:36,393
Good morning.

1147
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:38,528
Good morning, Sir.

1148
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:41,869
Arjun get up.

1149
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:45,344
I know you're awake.

1150
01:44:46,946 --> 01:44:48,004
Get up.

1151
01:44:54,888 --> 01:44:56,879
I'm here to apologize...

1152
01:44:58,558 --> 01:44:59,616
Forgive me.

1153
01:45:01,227 --> 01:45:04,889
There's too much work and
then there's the two of you.

1154
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:06,964
I get frustrated.

1155
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:10,433
I get angry, and then...

1156
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,907
I thought a lot last night.

1157
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:21,244
I have done a lot for both of you.

1158
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:25,917
But it was never enough.

1159
01:45:26,986 --> 01:45:28,248
And it never will be.

1160
01:45:31,257 --> 01:45:34,124
Rohan, since you don't want to study,

1161
01:45:34,994 --> 01:45:37,929
there's no need to study any more.

1162
01:45:39,332 --> 01:45:42,529
You start work full-time
at the factory today.

1163
01:45:43,536 --> 01:45:45,936
You will reach one hour
earlier before the others...

1164
01:45:47,006 --> 01:45:50,999
and you leave two hours
after they leave. Okay?

1165
01:45:53,012 --> 01:45:54,070
Arjun.

1166
01:45:55,014 --> 01:45:56,538
I have spoken to the principal.

1167
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,675
A new semester starts in two weeks.

1168
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:04,882
You're going to boarding school.
To study and live there.

1169
01:46:06,225 --> 01:46:07,283
Okay?

1170
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:17,694
I've decided to marry again.
For myself.

1171
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:21,301
I get very lonely.

1172
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:26,110
And now that both of you won't
be here, it will get worse...

1173
01:46:28,247 --> 01:46:29,305
Okay?

1174
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:38,986
Okay.

1175
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:47,525
You're getting married?

1176
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:49,459
Yes.

1177
01:46:50,603 --> 01:46:51,661
To whom?

1178
01:46:52,338 --> 01:46:53,396
Somebody.

1179
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:55,599
And Rohan? Arjun?

1180
01:46:56,142 --> 01:47:01,341
They're insolent.
I will always be their enemy.

1181
01:47:01,547 --> 01:47:03,742
But they're your children.

1182
01:47:04,017 --> 01:47:05,484
You're sending Arjun
to boarding school?

1183
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:06,609
He's only six years old...

1184
01:47:06,686 --> 01:47:09,018
I was six when dad sent me...

1185
01:47:09,422 --> 01:47:11,287
But Arjun isn't like you.

1186
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:14,488
Then he'll become like me.
Forget all this...

1187
01:47:15,161 --> 01:47:17,356
You want a drink?

1188
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:19,089
No.

1189
01:47:24,437 --> 01:47:27,031
Please think about what you're doing.

1190
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,571
I have thought about it...

1191
01:47:29,709 --> 01:47:31,233
I took this decision after thinking.

1192
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:37,716
If it's too much for you,
we can take care of Arjun.

1193
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:43,050
What did you say?

1194
01:47:48,194 --> 01:47:49,252
What do you mean by too much?

1195
01:47:49,662 --> 01:47:51,061
I mean...

1196
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:53,257
What do you mean by too much?

1197
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,463
We can bring him up.
Take care of him. Send him to school.

1198
01:47:57,737 --> 01:47:59,466
- We have no children...
- Arjun is my son.

1199
01:48:00,139 --> 01:48:02,073
And I'm not in the
business of selling children.

1200
01:48:02,141 --> 01:48:03,472
Why take this the wrong way?

1201
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:06,410
- All I'm saying is, if it's too hard...
- What are you saying?

1202
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,073
It isn't my fault that
you didn't have children.

1203
01:48:09,148 --> 01:48:12,481
Adopting Arjun won't cure
your infertility, will it?

1204
01:48:13,152 --> 01:48:14,414
That's not fair

1205
01:48:14,487 --> 01:48:15,545
Not fair?

1206
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:17,818
You want to tell me what's fair?

1207
01:48:19,826 --> 01:48:21,157
Get lost...

1208
01:48:24,430 --> 01:48:26,159
What is your problem?

1209
01:48:28,101 --> 01:48:30,433
Why can't you ever see anyone happy?

1210
01:48:30,503 --> 01:48:31,561
I'm tired.

1211
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:34,103
I'm tired of making everyone happy!

1212
01:48:34,173 --> 01:48:36,698
First Father, then you!
Now these two! I can't take it!

1213
01:48:36,776 --> 01:48:39,643
- Have you ever given him one chance?
- One chance?

1214
01:48:40,379 --> 01:48:43,314
I put everything into his education!
He got kicked out!

1215
01:48:43,382 --> 01:48:46,112
I begged for his admission into College!
He failed!

1216
01:48:46,185 --> 01:48:47,243
What else has he ever done?

1217
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,720
- He's written a novel.
- He's written shit!

1218
01:48:50,323 --> 01:48:51,847
Stop encouraging him!

1219
01:48:52,525 --> 01:48:55,585
Stop living your
unfulfilled dreams through my son!

1220
01:48:56,529 --> 01:48:58,190
I don't want him to become like you!

1221
01:48:58,598 --> 01:48:59,656
Like me?

1222
01:48:59,799 --> 01:49:02,131
Look at yourself...!

1223
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:05,804
Big fat bloody loser.

1224
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:11,674
What are you looking at? Get out!

1225
01:49:31,898 --> 01:49:33,160
Uncle.

1226
01:49:33,232 --> 01:49:35,166
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

1227
01:49:35,234 --> 01:49:37,498
- Take me with you.
- No, no, no, no...

1228
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:39,231
- Please Uncle.
- You have to stay here.

1229
01:49:39,305 --> 01:49:40,636
Arjun needs you.

1230
01:49:40,706 --> 01:49:41,832
He's going to boarding school.

1231
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:44,775
He'll need you when he gets back.

1232
01:49:45,444 --> 01:49:46,843
You're his only friend.

1233
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:49,245
- Please Uncle.
- Come on Rohan.

1234
01:49:49,315 --> 01:49:50,646
Don't do this to me right now.

1235
01:49:50,716 --> 01:49:54,311
- Please Uncle. Please Uncle...
- Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me right now.

1236
01:49:55,188 --> 01:49:56,246
Uncle!

1237
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:17,807
No Papa... No Papa...

1238
01:50:18,411 --> 01:50:21,278
Papa no. Please...
Papa no. Please...

1239
01:50:21,547 --> 01:50:23,674
Sir, please no...

1240
01:50:52,578 --> 01:51:03,921
Against the rising waves your
boat is helpless and tired.

1241
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:14,992
Living one gasp at a time...
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1242
01:51:15,534 --> 01:51:26,001
Though the currents are against you...

1243
01:51:26,078 --> 01:51:29,275
It's time to make a difference.

1244
01:51:55,741 --> 01:51:59,837
Hoist the sail with courage...

1245
01:51:59,912 --> 01:52:06,750
This is all about your pride.

1246
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:12,656
Shout ahoy and push ahead.

1247
01:52:12,725 --> 01:52:18,459
This is all about your pride.

1248
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:24,060
Conquer. Raise the victory flag,

1249
01:52:24,136 --> 01:52:29,335
It's time to do or die.

1250
01:52:29,909 --> 01:52:32,844
Fly and reach for the sun...

1251
01:52:32,912 --> 01:52:41,081
Leave behind the darkness.

1252
01:52:44,557 --> 01:52:46,354
This is my son Rohan.

1253
01:52:46,492 --> 01:52:48,551
Rohan, this is Madhavi.

1254
01:52:48,828 --> 01:52:50,489
Hi Rohan. It's nice to meet you.

1255
01:52:50,763 --> 01:52:51,821
Hello.

1256
01:52:52,631 --> 01:52:54,030
And this is her daughter Richa.

1257
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,761
Richa, say hello...

1258
01:52:55,901 --> 01:52:56,959
Hello.

1259
01:52:59,772 --> 01:53:01,103
Go wash up.

1260
01:53:01,907 --> 01:53:02,965
Come on.

1261
01:53:09,582 --> 01:53:21,392
Powerful storms will shake you...

1262
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:26,523
If you surrender to a whirIpool...

1263
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:32,663
What good is your might?

1264
01:53:32,738 --> 01:53:35,571
Let the light
in your heart overcome

1265
01:53:35,641 --> 01:53:38,405
Break away from the night...

1266
01:53:38,477 --> 01:53:43,574
Master the tides...

1267
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:49,077
So that the seas may salute you.

1268
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:52,420
Happy birthday to you.

1269
01:53:52,558 --> 01:53:53,650
You're 18 years old now.

1270
01:53:54,827 --> 01:53:56,556
You've become a man,
which is why I'm giving this to you.

1271
01:53:57,563 --> 01:53:59,155
This was my grandfather's watch.

1272
01:54:01,033 --> 01:54:03,024
He gave it to my father,
who then gave it to me

1273
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:05,935
when I turned 18.

1274
01:54:08,507 --> 01:54:10,804
See to it that you continue this tradition.

1275
01:54:18,517 --> 01:54:21,452
Living one gasp at a time...

1276
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:26,787
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1277
01:54:29,962 --> 01:54:32,522
Do you think you're the
only one who has problems?

1278
01:54:32,998 --> 01:54:35,125
Are we all sitting on a lotus flower?

1279
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:40,161
You don't have the balls
to stand up to your father.

1280
01:54:40,873 --> 01:54:46,072
So you just sit here with us,
drink, write and cry like a girl.

1281
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:52,076
Though the currents are against you...

1282
01:54:52,151 --> 01:54:54,915
It's time to make a difference.

1283
01:54:55,087 --> 01:55:01,492
We're having a blast in Bombay.
Remember Vikram's papa's restaurant?

1284
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,627
Vikram convinced him to
let him run it for a month.

1285
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:11,030
Uncle agreed. So Benoy and
I went to help. And guess what?

1286
01:55:11,504 --> 01:55:13,699
Profits doubled in our first month!

1287
01:55:13,772 --> 01:55:14,830
Really?

1288
01:55:14,907 --> 01:55:18,502
Really, it's great. The restaurant
is ours. Uncle retired.

1289
01:55:18,777 --> 01:55:21,712
We work and eat goodies all day.

1290
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:24,512
Girls are actually talking to us.

1291
01:55:24,917 --> 01:55:27,511
Benoy got laid!

1292
01:55:27,586 --> 01:55:30,851
His girlfriend hangs
with us all day...

1293
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:33,725
If you were here you'd be so happy.

1294
01:55:33,926 --> 01:55:35,723
Come to Bombay.

1295
01:55:36,862 --> 01:55:37,920
Hello.

1296
01:55:38,664 --> 01:55:39,722
Rohan?

1297
01:55:40,132 --> 01:55:41,724
Rohan, are you there?

1298
01:55:42,067 --> 01:55:45,867
Listen, I have to go,
I'll call later.

1299
01:55:45,938 --> 01:55:49,203
Wait, talk to Benoy and Vikram...

1300
01:55:49,942 --> 01:55:51,933
AYE, ROHAN!!!!

1301
01:58:12,751 --> 01:58:14,412
He was so drunk.

1302
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:16,749
That he couldn't even stand straight.

1303
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:19,148
The car?

1304
01:58:20,693 --> 01:58:21,751
Buy a new one.

1305
01:58:22,695 --> 01:58:23,753
Where?

1306
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,891
Not him. The car.

1307
02:00:04,129 --> 02:00:05,187
When do you leave
for boarding school?

1308
02:00:05,998 --> 02:00:07,056
Tomorrow.

1309
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:08,858
Good luck.

1310
02:01:09,995 --> 02:01:11,053
Where are you going?

1311
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,188
I'm leaving home.

1312
02:01:15,267 --> 02:01:18,532
Why? Are you unhappy
with my marriage?

1313
02:01:18,604 --> 02:01:21,402
No. Not at all. I'm delighted.

1314
02:01:22,474 --> 02:01:24,066
You will now have someone else to
share your frustrations with,

1315
02:01:24,476 --> 02:01:26,137
and Arjun won't need to
go to the hospital again.

1316
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:30,139
Excuse me.

1317
02:01:33,552 --> 02:01:34,610
Rohan.

1318
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:36,883
Rohan.

1319
02:01:58,377 --> 02:01:59,901
You fucker...!

1320
02:04:31,164 --> 02:04:32,222
I'm going to Bombay.

1321
02:04:37,037 --> 02:04:38,095
What will you do there?

1322
02:04:39,773 --> 02:04:41,570
I'll work in Vikram's restaurant.

1323
02:04:43,777 --> 02:04:47,110
I'll write. I'll clean toilets.

1324
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:49,046
But I won't ever come back.

1325
02:10:05,832 --> 02:10:13,295
Though our feet be chained,
our dreams will always float free.

1326
02:10:15,108 --> 02:10:22,981
Even the tender sprouts break
through the mighty earth.

1327
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:32,851
Hopeful hearts can hold no fear....

1328
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:43,861
when they listen to their inner voice.

1329
02:10:46,005 --> 02:10:47,063
Hi.

1330
02:10:50,476 --> 02:10:51,875
Sir's gone to get an autorickshaw.

1331
02:10:51,944 --> 02:10:53,002
Let him go.

1332
02:10:53,346 --> 02:10:54,404
You're coming with me.

1333
02:10:55,281 --> 02:10:56,873
Sir asked me to wait here.

1334
02:10:57,083 --> 02:11:01,884
Forget what Sir said.
Do you want to go to boarding school? No?

1335
02:11:02,555 --> 02:11:04,887
Then you will come with me wherever I go.

1336
02:11:09,495 --> 02:11:10,553
I'll be back in a moment.

1337
02:11:19,906 --> 02:11:24,502
How do you cage the morning rays?

1338
02:11:24,577 --> 02:11:29,173
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1339
02:11:29,382 --> 02:11:34,183
Just as soon as the birds grow wings,

1340
02:11:34,253 --> 02:11:38,917
They soar high up in the sky.

1341
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:43,587
How do you cage the morning rays?

1342
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:48,333
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1343
02:11:49,936 --> 02:11:50,994
Ready?

1344
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:53,334
Just as soon as the birds grow wings,

1345
02:11:53,539 --> 02:11:58,408
They soar high up in the sky.

1346
02:12:17,363 --> 02:12:22,164
Freedom...

1347
02:12:22,368 --> 02:12:26,304
Freedom...

1348
02:12:26,973 --> 02:12:36,177
Can never be asked for.

1349
02:12:36,582 --> 02:12:41,383
Freedom...

1350
02:12:41,587 --> 02:12:45,182
Freedom...

1351
02:12:46,259 --> 02:12:55,998
Seize it and live forever free.

1352
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:05,268
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1353
02:13:05,411 --> 02:13:10,212
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1354
02:13:10,349 --> 02:13:15,150
They soar high up in the sky.

1355
02:13:16,022 --> 02:13:18,013
I'm taking Arjun with me.

1356
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:20,020
If I leave him here he will become

1357
02:13:20,293 --> 02:13:22,090
another version of you.

1358
02:13:22,428 --> 02:13:26,296
One of you is enough for this world.

1359
02:13:27,033 --> 02:13:31,436
You will never understand
why this happened.

1360
02:13:32,171 --> 02:13:38,576
Because it's a word you've
never known or experienced...

1361
02:13:39,512 --> 02:13:40,570
Love.

1362
02:13:41,781 --> 02:13:46,047
Please don't try to find us.
If you come within a 100 kilometers of us,

1363
02:13:46,252 --> 02:13:49,244
the police will know that you beat Arjun.

1364
02:13:49,655 --> 02:13:53,056
Legally, it's a criminal offence.

1365
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:57,052
Arjun can be a lot
more than just your slave.

1366
02:13:57,396 --> 02:14:00,058
He needs a family, not a cage.

1367
02:14:00,466 --> 02:14:04,527
He needs a future, which I will make
sure he gets, whatever the cost...

1368
02:14:05,204 --> 02:14:09,470
Congratulations on your new wife,
Your new daughter, your new life.

1369
02:14:10,076 --> 02:14:12,135
Your son, Rohan.

1370
02:14:13,145 --> 02:14:22,281
Is life over?
Or has it about to begin?

1371
02:14:23,422 --> 02:14:32,091
Is this nightfall?
Or is it a new dawn?

1372
02:14:32,498 --> 02:14:38,095
Will the future bring comfort?

1373
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:48,505
Or will it bring us to a crossroad?

1374
02:14:50,516 --> 02:14:58,446
Who knows what lies ahead...

1375
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:10,000
