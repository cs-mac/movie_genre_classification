1
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,875
In the beginning, there was nothing.

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,790
- Wilderness.
- Worse than wilderness.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,312
Endless raw acreage,
the land infested with crocodiles.

4
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,193
- Alligators.
- Alligators, crocodiles...

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,148
For retirement bungalows,
that's not a selling point.

6
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,392
Mosquitoes that would strip you
to the bones.

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,633
- Swampland.
- That was 10¢ an acre. This was worse.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,917
The name means in Seminole:
"Don't go there."

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,354
But we bought it.

10
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,432
Because we knew.
You weren't selling land.

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,474
I mean, what's land?
A patch of dirt, a tree. Who cares?

12
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,870
Farmers care.

13
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,753
Farmers.

14
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,789
Farmers are for TV ads. People
with tractors, amber waves of grain.

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,951
They shoot it all in Canada.

16
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,114
I'm talking about certified accountants
with a fixed pension and a nest egg...

17
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,915
...who don't wanna spend
their golden years in slush.

18
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,719
Dreams are what you sell.
A concept.

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,912
You sell sunshine,
you sell orange groves...

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,516
...you sell gentle breezes
wafting through the palms.

21
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,513
- There were palm trees?
- In the brochures.

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,831
- Stately ones.
- When they came down and saw it?

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,028
As long as the dredge stayed ahead
of the buyers, we were in like Flynn.

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,510
This was the end of the earth.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,719
This was the land populated
by white people who ate catfish.

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,795
Almost overnight,
out of the muck and the mangroves...

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,712
...we created this.

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,952
Golf courses.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,476
Nature on a leash.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,154
Ahoy. It's that time of year again.

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,318
The Delrona Chamber of Commerce
invites you...

32
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,191
...to the Buccaneer Days festivities
at the Plantation Island Marina.

33
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,113
Live music,
and plenty of booty for kids.

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,115
Plans for the treasure hunt can be
attained at the Delrona Beach Mall...

35
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,593
- Sure this place is okay?
- What do you mean?

36
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,958
- Black people go in here?
- If they're desperate to pee, they do.

37
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,476
- But your mother's is...
- I need to go before then.

38
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,834
Relax.

39
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,071
Take the register,
I gotta get back to the motel.

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,117
- Your husband called.
- Ex.

41
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,713
He says he needs to see you.

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,873
Next time, tell him to take
a long walk off a short pier.

43
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,197
- Smoking or non?
- Could I use your bathroom?

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,670
- It's straight back to the right.
- Thank you.

45
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,672
Buzzards.

46
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,077
Excuse me.

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,479
Hi, there. You been helped yet?

48
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,791
No, my wife's just using
the facilities.

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,833
- You need a room?
- Pardon?

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,355
You've been gawking at the motel.

51
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,830
We have a few vacancies,
but it'll fill up soon.

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,231
- I was looking the property over.
- The property?

53
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,197
The whole strip, actually.

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,069
If you're from the County,
we had our sign moved back.

55
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,513
I was just trying to imagine what it
would look like without buildings.

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,673
- Kind of mentally undressing it?
- You could say that.

57
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,118
- You work for that Plantation outfit?
- Yes. I'm supervising the expansion...

58
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,272
They don't have enough
of this coast already?

59
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,273
It's just a study,
a what-if kind of thing.

60
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,675
What if I told you my daddy would
never sell to Plantation Estates?

61
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,671
I'll be happy to pass it on.
I'm Jack Meadows.

62
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,718
- You're a developer.
- A landscape architect.

63
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,078
I help them decide what they want,
push some dirt around...

64
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,394
They wanted my opinion
on the whole shoreline here, actually.

65
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,313
- So how's it look?
- What?

66
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,835
Without anything on it?

67
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,029
It looks terrific.

68
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,078
HQ says that'll be where we establish our beachhead.
Then we'll take the rest of it.

69
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,435
The other side has this end locked up
and they're infiltrating Lincoln Beach.

70
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,832
- We're not opposing?
- Zoned residential, hostile population.

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,472
It's a minefield. Whereas right here
is the soft underbelly of the island.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,391
You make the frontal assault,
I go behind the lines.

73
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,076
- Is somebody on the inside?
- Working on it.

74
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,399
Shit.

75
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,918
Shock and outrage this morning as Delrona Beach
residents awoke to a senseless act of vandalism.

76
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,358
The Freebooter, the centrepiece
of the Buccaneer Days parade...

77
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,192
...was burnt beyond repair...

78
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,912
This is a disaster. It's always
the lead float in the parade.

79
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,791
Same kid set a fire some years back
in a crab shack on Lincoln Beach.

80
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,033
This is so not in the spirit
of the celebration.

81
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,879
Where do you want me to haul it?

82
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,551
Hello!

83
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,678
Hello?

84
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,551
- Dr. Lloyd.
- Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Pierce.

85
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,358
You're always welcome.

86
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,150
I'm rounding up folks for this
County Commission meeting tonight.

87
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,077
- I know it's very short notice, but...
- I'd like to help, but I feel poorly.

88
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,074
Oh, my! Would you look at this.

89
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,679
It's that boy
poor Mrs. Stokes took in.

90
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,276
- He's in trouble again?
- First her girl went wild...

91
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,399
...and run off to God knows where.
And now this.

92
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,754
Some people.

93
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,471
I'm worried about them sneaking
through this public-domain business...

94
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,551
...without us making a showing.

95
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,951
If we can field just
even a dozen residents...

96
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,271
Wasn't it settled
when they took the cemetery?

97
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,673
- I'm afraid it won't stop there.
- Now, who's this coming to call?

98
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,796
It seems kind of deserted.

99
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,078
Yeah, well, you know,
most people come on the weekends.

100
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,874
- Do I look okay?
- Relax. This is gonna be fine.

101
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,471
You don't know her.

102
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,159
Hi.

103
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,632
Is Mrs. Stokes here?

104
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,670
I have no idea.

105
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,356
Well, well. Desiree.

106
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,269
Never thought I'd live
to see you back here.

107
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,272
Hello, Mama.

108
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,559
My Lord.

109
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,991
You did get a handsome one,
didn't you?

110
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,190
Good luck moving this shit. It's like
three inches of soil, then solid limestone.

111
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,990
More work, more pay.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

112
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,675
- They wanted this one saved.
- Is that right?

113
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,314
What do you think, chief?
That thing gonna make it?

114
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,040
It's part of Mr. Meadows' concept.

115
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,399
The chief's concept is everything
that's not flat gets that way, fast.

116
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,160
Plantation sold this lot
with the tree.

117
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,155
When you crackers head back to Georgia,
there better goddamn still be one.

118
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,278
Used to be this was all Exley family.

119
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,273
Hasn't nothing been planted here
in 100 years.

120
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,910
We wanna satisfy the homeowner's
desire for privacy...

121
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,789
...with the convenience
and the socializing opportunities...

122
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,599
...provided by the village concept.

123
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,548
It doesn't look like much now,
but when Jack's finished...

124
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,359
- What goes here?
- Our main drainage basin.

125
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,078
- It's a lake.
- A lake?

126
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,119
It'll be 14 feet deep.
What we dig out will form a hill.

127
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,078
- We're gonna make deluxe homes on top of it.
- Deluxe?

128
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,795
With all the amenities:
A river view, the lake.

129
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,238
- Elevation.
- Damn! These bugs gonna be here too?

130
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,235
Anaesthesiologist.

131
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,554
If there's a surgical procedure,
I render the patient unconscious.

132
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,792
You knock people out with gas?

133
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,996
That's pretty much it.

134
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,597
- I'd be afraid not to wake up.
- A lot of people feel that way.

135
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,912
- Reggie's the head of his department.
- Is that right?

136
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,313
And at such a prestigious hospital.
I'll have to tell that to Dr. Lloyd.

137
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,349
- Dr. Lloyd still coming down?
- He lives here now.

138
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,876
His Etta Mae passed some years ago.

139
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,078
You wouldn't have heard that,
would you?

140
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,032
- She doesn't write, she doesn't call.
- Mama.

141
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,954
Girl caught the first thing smoking
and never looked back.

142
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,749
I took the bus, Mama. Not the train.

143
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,796
It's an expression.

144
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,870
Terrell? Go run this gravy through
the microwave again. It's gone cold.

145
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,513
- And who is that?
- Your cousin, Sidney Wilkins' son.

146
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,070
Sidney that married Athena Hines.

147
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,277
Well, why isn't he with them?

148
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,391
She doesn't write, she doesn't call.

149
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,036
I'm surprised she even let on
she got married.

150
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,193
Her own mother doesn't
get invited to the wedding.

151
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,478
It was a civil service, Mama.
It wasn't in church.

152
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,277
- But it's legal?
- It's legal, it's official. Don't worry.

153
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,513
Something they do up there.
What is it?

154
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,113
Boston.

155
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,829
Somehow, I've never been
north of Washington, D.C.

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,072
You'll just have to come visit us.

157
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,268
When Terrell's out of school,
maybe we'll do that.

158
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,119
How about that, Terrell?
You like to see Boston?

159
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,830
The proposed boundary for Delrona Beach
will incorporate this area in yellow...

160
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,835
...including Lincoln Beach all the way
to the Exley Plantation track.

161
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,479
Excuse me.

162
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,714
If you want to make a motion, wait
till Commissioner Pinkney's finished.

163
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,429
- I want to register a protest.
- In regard to what?

164
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,672
This meeting was not
properly advertised.

165
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,956
We met all the legal requirements.

166
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,557
You purposely chose a time when our people
would be unable to attend.

167
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,950
"Our people" means the residents of Lincoln Beach?

168
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,999
You know very well many of us
are only here on weekends.

169
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,151
Many are only summer people.

170
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,677
That doesn't deny us the right
to object to this expropriation.

171
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,992
- Incorporation.
- You've already conspired to
take away a third of our area.

172
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,674
You know that was
a private transaction...

173
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,310
...between Exley Plantation Estates
Planned Community...

174
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,994
...and the individual property owners.

175
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,995
This commission didn't know about it
until the plans were submitted.

176
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,392
If you hadn't already secretly approved it,
they wouldn't have gone ahead.

177
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,076
As spokesman for the Exley Corporation,
I object to the implication...

178
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,472
- It has historic significance to us...
- We made several offers to...

179
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,270
A history that this commission
has consistently ignored!

180
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,034
You let them take away our cemetery.

181
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,718
Dr. Lloyd, we're talking about very old business.
If you dislike the current agenda...

182
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,952
We don't wanna be a part of the
town of Delrona Beach...

183
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,636
...and they've made it clear they
don't want anything to do with us.

184
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,510
If beachfront prices hadn't risen,
there'd be no interest in merging...

185
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,595
- The concept of eminent domain...
- Is used to undermine our well-being!

186
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,638
Gentlemen, if we're going
to have a debate...

187
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,476
...I'm going to have to ask you
to follow procedure.

188
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,714
- I'm thinking of going out there again.
- Out where?

189
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,279
Tour.

190
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,878
Golfing?

191
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,195
It's kind of a syndicate.
A couple of dentists, a Buick dealer.

192
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,069
They wanna sponsor me
for a percentage of my winnings.

193
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,789
- How much can you make?
- First you have to qualify.

194
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,636
Then it just depends on where you
stand at the end of each tournament.

195
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,950
You did this before?

196
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,429
I tried a couple of years back.
It was fine till I got on the green.

197
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,079
You know...

198
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,310
...little case of the yips.

199
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,118
It's an adrenaline thing.

200
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,559
You're in the middle of the back swing
of your putt, you tighten up and...

201
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,674
Yip.

202
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,071
Something like that.

203
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,950
And you had them bad?

204
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,953
Killer drive,
beautiful approach shot...

205
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,669
...and I just couldn't get
the damn thing in the hole.

206
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,674
That would seriously cut
into your winnings, wouldn't it?

207
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,076
- It's better now?
- I won't know until I get out there.

208
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,198
I can always sink them in practice.

209
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,794
So you'll be travelling a lot.

210
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,076
That's the life.

211
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,395
Are there, like, groupies?

212
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,673
I suppose. If you win.

213
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,876
I never could understand
wanting to watch it.

214
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,948
You know? It's like
those fishing shows on TV.

215
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,475
Does that make you feel bad?

216
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,117
I don't watch people wait on tables
or run the check-in desk.

217
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,271
Right, you don't.

218
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,273
Yip.

219
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,269
- This is too weird.
- Is it what you remember?

220
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,560
It's my room, yeah,
but that boy's been living in here.

221
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,397
We got some serious testosterone
working here. Now, he's what, exactly?

222
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,916
His daddy is my cousin.
Grew up kind of wild.

223
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,877
He's living here because...?

224
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,989
She wants me to drive them downtown
for some kind of hearing tomorrow.

225
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,314
- He's in trouble?
- She's not giving up any information.

226
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,038
Punish me a bit.

227
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,079
- For being gone so long.
- For everything.

228
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,430
She's the one who asked you
to come down, made the first move.

229
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,670
It's too weird.

230
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,791
You can hear the ocean.

231
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,670
I always loved that.

232
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,159
Hey, Lucky.

233
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,396
- They changed all the facades.
- Nobody but tourists shop here now.

234
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,156
- Where do the regular folks go?
- There's a shuttle bus to the mall.

235
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,880
It's just in here.

236
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,272
- This won't take but an hour or so.
- You hope.

237
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,118
Terrell just needs to talk
with somebody.

238
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,477
We'll call you back home
when it's over.

239
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,068
Prettiest beach on the Atlantic coast.

240
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,272
It is pretty.

241
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,514
If you want to help save it, we're
protesting at the groundbreaking.

242
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,832
- I'm just visiting.
- They won't know the difference.

243
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,515
So this is like an ecological thing?

244
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,878
We're trying to save
an endangered species.

245
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,872
Us.

246
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,432
I heard about this place
when I was a kid.

247
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,875
Forties, fifties...

248
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,876
...Lincoln Beach was it.

249
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,199
Only oceanfront in three counties
we were allowed to step onto.

250
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,990
Black folks, I'm talking about
the pillars of the community...

251
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,676
...got together and bought this land,
built the houses.

252
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,150
You'd drive through a couple hundred
miles of redneck sheriffs...

253
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,030
...park your ride on the boardwalk,
step out and just breathe.

254
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,671
Over there was Henry's Lounge.
That place used to jump.

255
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,710
- So, what happened?
- Civil rights happened. Progress.

256
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,713
Used to be you were black,
you'd buy black.

257
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,512
Jim Crow days, you needed a shoeshine,
wanted a taxi to the train station...

258
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,877
...you wanted some ribs,
a fish sandwich...

259
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,794
...chances are a black man
owned the place you got it in.

260
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,873
Now, the drive-thrus serve anybody.

261
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,712
But who owns them?

262
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,478
Not us.

263
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,359
All our people do is wear paper hats
and dip out them fries.

264
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,674
Only thing we got left are
funeral parlours and barbershops.

265
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,477
But now we can do anything.

266
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,475
Them that can get over do fine.

267
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,792
Them that can't are
in a world of trouble.

268
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,558
Tell the judge what you told me.

269
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,719
I said I'm sorry for what I did.
I wasn't thinking right.

270
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,793
You know that sorry won't cut it
in this case, don't you?

271
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,154
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,596
You're still on probation
for a previous offence...

273
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,435
...yet you deliberately
committed this act of vandalism.

274
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,797
Do you have any explanation
for your actions?

275
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,154
No, ma'am.

276
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,519
When somebody destroys something
that stands as a symbol for people...

277
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,678
...that's desecration.
- It's a wooden pirate.

278
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,628
An icon in this community, nonetheless.

279
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,516
You're almost old enough, given
your record, to be tried as an adult.

280
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:54,471
You have two strikes against you.
A third, and there will be...

281
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,714
Mrs. Stokes has assured us she'll
maintain control of the situation.

282
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,917
We'd be satisfied,
barring further incidents...

283
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,870
...with an order for counselling,
or possibly community service.

284
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,032
That's very generous of you.

285
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,151
So, young man,
what's it gonna be?

286
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,238
Loretta.

287
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,273
Well...

288
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,519
Look at you.

289
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,834
- Mama said you were still in Delrona.
- Haven't moved an inch.

290
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,990
I saw you on a TV commercial.

291
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,035
I told my kids I went to school with you,
but they didn't believe me.

292
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,879
- You got kids?
- Three of them.

293
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,235
They're getting big.

294
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,871
- It's the first you've been back since...
- I came back for the service...

295
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,395
...when my father passed.

296
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,669
- But I only stayed for a day.
- That's a good while ago, your father.

297
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,908
Kind of slow for you down here.

298
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,593
Look, I...

299
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,630
- I kind of wanted to apologize.
- For what?

300
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,999
For Carter.

301
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,430
That's another lifetime
you're talking about. 25 years.

302
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,677
We were friends.
I shouldn't have gone after him.

303
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,273
But you did.

304
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,434
- You always did what you wanted to.
- I didn't do it to hurt you.

305
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,633
- Ancient history.
- So Carter still in town?

306
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,992
He's inside sleeping.
Works nights at the box factory.

307
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,796
- You got married?
- After a while, yeah.

308
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,398
- When you left town...
- When I was sent away.

309
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,030
Everybody thought it was Carter
got you pregnant.

310
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,079
It wasn't.

311
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,439
That's what he's saying nowadays.

312
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,349
I guess I wasn't too worried
about the rumours.

313
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,559
- Made your exit and didn't look back.
- Some drama, huh?

314
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,116
Girl, we ate that shit up.

315
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,397
I had to listen to everybody
run you down...

316
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,111
...being the tragic ex-girlfriend and all.

317
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,310
- Like that was gonna make me feel better.
- And Carter?

318
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,392
- Carter ran around acting the daddy.
- Really?

319
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:05,237
Better you knock your girl up than to
have people think somebody else did it.

320
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,031
But it all turned out fine, didn't it?

321
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,635
I suppose I could've done worse.

322
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,356
So you're the one who finally
snagged Desiree Stokes?

323
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,272
I'm the one.

324
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,638
- That girl drew men like flies.
- I can imagine.

325
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,792
- Elton Lloyd.
- Reginald Perry.

326
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,157
We're staying at her mother's
for a few days.

327
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,831
A wonderful woman, Eunice.
A true Christian.

328
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,388
Now her nephew, is it?

329
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,311
Her nephew's son.

330
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,076
Young Terrell.

331
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,118
I blame it on the drugs.
It's a pestilence.

332
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,556
Something happened with his...?

333
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,475
- Eunice didn't tell you?
- She and Desiree haven't been...

334
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,118
- lf you need to ask, you don't deserve to know.
- Seems to be the attitude.

335
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,750
Terrell's father was going
through a rough stretch.

336
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,878
He had separated from his wife.

337
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,431
He came over one day
high on who knows what.

338
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,594
They had a screaming argument,
he had a weapon.

339
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,074
He shot that woman dead,
then turned the gun on himself.

340
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,074
Horrible thing to witness.

341
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,791
- Terrell must have been 6, maybe 7.
- He saw it?

342
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,030
He sat with the bodies for two days
before somebody came over and found him.

343
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,150
It's a pestilence.

344
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,913
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Y'all know where Buster's Place is?

345
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,710
Buster's Place is long gone, brother.
Nothing there now.

346
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,632
You sure?

347
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,516
I know you.

348
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,513
- I don't think so.
- Sure, I do.

349
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,353
You used to be the Florida Flash.

350
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,115
In my day, life was simpler.

351
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,798
You knew where you stood.

352
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,031
A man was left to make his own way
in the world.

353
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,197
You didn't have none of these
pressure groups, advocate groups...

354
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,229
...special-interest groups
handicapping the race.

355
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,671
It went to the smartest,
the strongest, the swiftest.

356
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,557
If a man could carve out
something for himself...

357
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,792
...he knowed he'd earned it.

358
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,433
No whooping crane.

359
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,388
Spotted owl.

360
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,798
The Florida gator.

361
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,115
The coloured man, the white man,
the Spanish.

362
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,875
They all started out from scratch.

363
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,749
If you couldn't survive the course,
it was tough titty.

364
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,230
Nowadays, what they got?

365
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,236
It ain't natural.

366
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,636
They got us so zoned.
Regulated.

367
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,157
Politically corrected and
environmentally sensitised...

368
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,633
...to the point where it's only
multi-internationals with 12 lawyers...

369
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,315
...waiting like buzzards
for something to litigate...

370
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,473
...that can afford to put one brick
on top of another.

371
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:02,709
The little guy, no matter how much
grit or imagination he brings to it...

372
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,796
...ain't got a chance. They got him
tied down so he can't hardly breathe.

373
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,988
You smoke a damn cigarette, they
make you feel like a baby-strangler.

374
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,035
Where's it all gonna end?
I don't want to know.

375
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,152
But if they expect my cooperation,
they're just shit out of luck.

376
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,997
The reason I hang on to this old bag of
bones is to spite the sons of bitches.

377
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,676
They made me put into Social Security
for 50 years.

378
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,517
I ain't giving up the ghost till I spend
every damn penny of it.

379
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,032
- Which one are you?
- Gwendolyn.

380
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,548
- You think I'm full of crap, don't you?
- It's time for your insulin, Mr. Temple.

381
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,795
There's an opening here
that could close up quick.

382
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,078
- My father is the owner.
- I understand he's currently indisposed.

383
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,152
He's legally blind, if that's what you mean.

384
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,677
The black folks on Lincoln Beach have
contacted the Historical Register.

385
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,273
That's their business.

386
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,150
Draw that kind of attention,
environmentalists come in on their heels.

387
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,231
They're pesky little buggers.

388
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,632
Then you won't be able to sell
your property for what it's worth.

389
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,633
- What's it worth?
- Not much at the moment.

390
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,476
And since the resort condos have come in,
your taxes have jumped 30%.

391
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,236
- Small businesses are being squeezed.
- Tell me about it.

392
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,911
We realize this is a big decision,
one of the oldest businesses left...

393
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,868
...going back generations.
- You're not from the Plantation?

394
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,918
- Some men were here.
- Did they make an offer?

395
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,117
- Sniffing around, I guess.
- They're relentless.

396
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,555
And you're not?

397
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,555
The Exley Plantation is only for the
elite. What we have in mind is more...

398
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,475
...democratic. Something for everybody.
- Stores, burger chains, T-shirts?

399
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,110
- Retail outlets would be part of it...
- 123 empty?

400
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,155
- Should be. Your husband called.
- I don't need to talk to him.

401
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,916
You want to develop here, you need
the County Commission in your pocket.

402
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,997
We can work something out.

403
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:30,594
Testing, one, two, three.
This is a mike check. One, two, three.

404
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,119
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Delrona Beach's...

405
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,034
...annual Buccaneer Days.

406
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,195
Earl. Earl!

407
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,508
- Steve. I'll be right with you.
- I got those signatures.

408
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,195
Just give me a minute.

409
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,837
In the afternoon,
when school was out...

410
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,357
...and the last one had left
with his dirty little snuffling nose...

411
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,991
...instead of going home, I would go
down the hill to the spring...

412
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,199
...where I could be quiet
and hate them.

413
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,510
It would be quiet there then...

414
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,629
...with the water bubbling up and away
and the sun slanting in the trees...

415
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,557
...and the quiet smelling of damp
and rotting leaves and new earth.

416
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,235
Especially in the early spring.
For it was worse then.

417
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,871
I could remember my father used to say
that the reason for living...

418
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,797
...was to get ready to stay dead
a good long time.

419
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,636
And when I would have to look at them
day after day...

420
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,032
...each with his and her
secret and selfish thought...

421
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,637
...and blood strange to each other
and strange to mine.

422
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,349
And to think that this
was the only way...

423
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,512
...I could stay dead.

424
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,708
I would hate my father
for planting me.

425
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,394
And then I go on from there.

426
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,028
The important thing is...

427
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,876
...to freeze yourself
in an interesting...

428
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,716
...but comfortable position.
Jaime, you're about to fall over.

429
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,799
We'll resume tomorrow.
You should be off book by then.

430
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,919
I thank you all very much
for your work today.

431
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,677
- It is you, isn't it?
- Hello, Miss Delia.

432
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,394
It's really you.

433
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,155
It is so wonderful to see you.

434
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,357
My mother told me
you were still running this.

435
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,750
They'll have to drag me off.

436
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,471
Several members of the local press
have suggested that very thing.

437
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,755
These are my special group.
Young people with difficulties.

438
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,480
- What's the play?
- As I Lay Dying.

439
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,509
Rather loosely adapted, but I don't
believe Mr. Faulkner would object.

440
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,675
- The scene of your many triumphs.
- I let you down.

441
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,153
- Whatever do you mean?
- When I left. I was the lead.

442
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,472
Well, we did have to make
a few adjustments.

443
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,949
But the show must go on.

444
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,190
You played it?

445
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,399
Having a queen of Egypt
considerably older than her Antony...

446
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,393
...was very provocative.

447
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,951
I got to do it once when I got
to New York. In the Park.

448
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,874
I played the handmaiden
who gives her the asp.

449
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,631
I'm sure you were wonderful.
And now?

450
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,874
I trust you're still sharing
your talent with the public?

451
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,272
I do industrials. Representing things.

452
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,396
I do a lot of auto shows.

453
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,590
A temporary engagement in the world
of commerce. You're still so young.

454
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,435
I had my chance, Miss Delia.
It just didn't happen.

455
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,909
I must say, my youthful aspirations
had nothing to do...

456
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,789
...with becoming the Sarah Bernardt
of Delrona Beach.

457
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,394
We adjust.

458
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,709
You would've been stunning
as Cleopatra.

459
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,348
I was starting to show.

460
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,351
I played Juliet...

461
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,991
...when I was five-months pregnant
with my twins.

462
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,550
Hello there, come on in.

463
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,550
- You remember my mother?
- Mrs. Temple.

464
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,312
So nice to see you.

465
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,596
And this is my... This is Terrell.
Terrell is...

466
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,514
- It's sort of a favour.
- Whatever I can do.

467
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,628
The social worker down
at the courthouse recommended you...

468
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,076
...because you have a program...
- For community service.

469
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,314
I can always use another volunteer.
Do you have any acting experience?

470
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,713
- No, ma'am.
- But he knows how to use tools.

471
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,192
Anything you can think of,
Terrell can put it together.

472
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,433
Then you can do me a great service,
Terrell.

473
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,239
My character, Addie Bundren,
is deceased.

474
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,188
In the second act, I rise from the dead
for my soliloquy...

475
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,832
...but the local funeral parlour
has nothing suitably rustic.

476
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,237
Do you think you could you build me
a coffin?

477
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,398
"We hereby claim sovereignty
over this island...

478
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,553
...in the name of his majesty,
Philip el Segundo of Spain.

479
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,554
Furthermore, this tribunal declares
the mulatto, Calavera...

480
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,714
...otherwise known as Captain Skull,
guilty of piracy on the high seas...

481
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,795
...a crime against God and nature, and
sentence him to be cast into the sea...

482
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,230
...there to perish by drowning."

483
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,472
Does the condemned have
a final statement?

484
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,632
A curse on the lot of you.

485
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,519
Up the Jolly Roger!

486
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,395
Thus was the black flag
of the buccaneer...

487
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,711
...replaced by that
of Imperial Spain...

488
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,474
...one of many reversals of fortune...

489
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,758
...that mark the colourful history
of our community.

490
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,232
We'd like to thank Presto Pools
for the equipment, and remind you...

491
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,349
...that the annual Treasure Hunt
will begin tomorrow at the Delrona Mall.

492
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,356
Entrants should meet
at the Piercing Pagoda at 10:00.

493
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,552
- Guess who I met earlier?
- You're not telling people I'm back?

494
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,473
I didn't recognize him without the helmet.

495
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,189
But you remember a football player
named Flash Phillips?

496
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,354
Every step we take is on someone else's toes.

497
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,798
This town expects me to work miracles
with a handful of volunteers.

498
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,829
This bunch from Lincoln Beach say
they're gonna picket our groundbreaking.

499
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,836
- They complain about parking...
- The whole point is to be away from that.

500
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,279
- This afternoon was embarrassing.
- What? No! I thought it went fine.

501
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,477
- For a Chamber of Commerce thing.
- Nobody came.

502
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,235
- Turnout was terrific.
- Something isn't clicking.

503
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,871
I worked this one place,
they had the blessing of the fleet.

504
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,433
A bishop in his hat,
boats all dolled up. What a draw.

505
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,160
- I can't do religious here.
- True.

506
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,678
And what's our fleet? A bunch
of charter boats and day sailers.

507
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,833
- You got history to burn.
- People hate history.

508
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,551
You got Indians, pirates,
Spanish gold, that plantation thing.

509
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,234
Mass murder, rape, slavery.

510
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,235
So Disneyfy it a little, and they'll
come back. All you need is a hook.

511
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,791
I once worked this place in Wisconsin.
It was all built on wurst.

512
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,714
- Wurst?
- Weisswurst, Bratwurst, Knackwurst.

513
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,713
Bavarian people.
Lots of strudel shops...

514
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,350
...and service people
in leather shorts and dirndls.

515
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,035
- And this worked?
- The beer got them in the mood.

516
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,113
- Free liquor.
- I like a woman in a dirndl.

517
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,637
I hired this guy to be an attraction.
He used to be a big Seminole.

518
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,079
- Indian?
- Not the Seminoles! The Seminoles.

519
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,673
The football team?

520
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,594
Of course. What would I want
with a real Indian?

521
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,231
He used to be a big deal. Hung out
at Lincoln Beach, drove a Mustang...

522
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,315
- A local hero! That's good.
- I just hope he shows up.

523
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,909
- What's his favourite thing to eat?
- Small children.

524
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,634
Is he alive?

525
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,791
- Can't hardly say.
- Why show a dead alligator?

526
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,675
Did you pay anything to look at him?
Then don't complain.

527
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,630
- He was the last of the Mohicans.
- No, they were already extinct.

528
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,270
He was a Shawnee or Pawnee.
Here's Billy, he'll know.

529
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,352
- Chief!
- Yo, asshole.

530
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,149
What kind of Indian was that guy
on Daniel Boone?

531
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,835
- He was Jewish.
- I don't mean the actor, the character.

532
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,834
- How should I know?
- Aren't you a full-blooded whatever?

533
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,549
- Creek.
- Regular Creek or shit creek?

534
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,473
- So where was Daniel Boone?
- In the woods.

535
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,872
More specific than that.
Can't you tell by Indian lore?

536
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,237
- Lore?
- You know, like the trees or something?

537
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,678
- What the hell do I know about trees?
- Didn't your ancestors...?

538
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,389
My parents sold lawn ornaments
to stupid white people.

539
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,236
- You're shitting me.
- Get you a good deal on ceramic ducks.

540
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,713
- I couldn't really pin her down.
- But you planted the idea in her head?

541
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,996
She said it was her father's decision.

542
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,709
Last thing we need is to deal
with some old gomer.

543
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,916
- The mother?
- No, she's a flake.

544
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,958
She runs a theatre group,
finds homes for retired greyhounds.

545
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,634
She never set foot in the restaurant.

546
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,315
She won't be any help,
but she won't get in the way.

547
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,679
- So we're back to the daughter.
- The old man ran the show 24-7.

548
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,311
The daughter, she's paying four people
to handle the same load.

549
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,234
- She wants a life.
- Her rack rate is too low for that.

550
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,517
- The restaurant.
- The restaurant's a wash.

551
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,549
You know the money a successful
franchise could make in that spot?

552
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,078
- All she's doing is taking up space.
- Now she's taking up space at the bar.

553
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,556
You see?
This is not a dedicated professional.

554
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,871
You're not having another of those?

555
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,753
- Saw Steve at the pirate thing today.
- They hang him?

556
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,598
Walked the plank.

557
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,639
- He said he needs to talk to you.
- Why doesn't he come by the motel?

558
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,672
Maybe due to the restraining order?
You had him arrested in the parking lot.

559
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,435
- He was drunk as a skunk.
- He's club soda and lime now.

560
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:03,311
- Why do you always wanna defend him?
- I'm not. I'm just saying he's on the wagon.

561
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,673
- Your golf pro was in the other night.
- Not my golf pro.

562
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,356
He's 10 years younger than me.
Besides, he's going on tour.

563
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,080
Like Tiger Woods on TV?

564
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,949
I don't think he'll get as much
air time as Tiger.

565
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,274
- Did he ask you to go with him?
- It didn't come up.

566
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,832
You want to?

567
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,392
A guy over there has been
checking you out.

568
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,279
Be still, my beating heart.

569
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,677
- What's he look like?
- Not bad.

570
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,877
- Tattoos?
- None visible.

571
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,635
Shirt say "Go Gators"
or "Stomp 'em, Seminoles"?

572
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,076
- It doesn't say anything.
- Obviously not my type.

573
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,918
He's cute.

574
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:07,319
I'm gonna turn around only to see what
falls under your definition of cute.

575
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,433
If you're at 12:00,
he's about 3:30.

576
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,028
Trying to imagine what it would be
like without us crackers?

577
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,351
- You're everywhere.
- Small island.

578
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,236
I didn't mean to be intrusive before.
I thought they'd contacted you.

579
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,554
Don't worry about it. There's days I imagine
it all blowing away in a hurricane.

580
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,832
- Must be a lot of work being a hotelier.
- Motelier. And we got the restaurant.

581
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,709
- I hated working there as a kid.
- And now?

582
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,395
I got three girls working for me
hate it as much as I do.

583
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,916
- Why do you...?
- Poetic justice. What are you drinking?

584
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,635
- Draft. How about you?
- Shots. Tequila.

585
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,110
If you're gonna drink,
why fuck around?

586
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,715
You're from up north.

587
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,917
They say everybody here is
from somewhere else.

588
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,471
- Not me. I'm sixth generation. At least.
- That's impressive.

589
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,156
You go back that far, your people were
planters, slaves or fugitives.

590
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,309
Yours were...?

591
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,790
I don't know what they were running
from, but this is where they stopped.

592
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,556
- I'm from Newport, Rhode Island.
- With the yachts and big estates?

593
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,473
My dad took care of the lawns.

594
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,913
- So you've never left the island?
- Sure, I left all right.

595
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,311
- You're looking at a Weeki Wachee girl.
- What?

596
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,315
It's a show.
It's been running since the late '40s.

597
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,990
- You acted?
- Performed. You do it underwater.

598
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,038
Let's have a contest.

599
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,397
You do it to me.

600
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,797
This isn't the guy I meant.

601
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,833
You win.

602
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,749
I could hold it twice as long
if I hadn't been drinking.

603
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,596
The important thing is to keep a smile,
even with water down your nose.

604
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,469
- How long did you work there?
- Three years.

605
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,076
And then I met my ex.

606
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,110
- He had this band. Skeeter Meter.
- Like a rock band?

607
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,353
They were big around Tampa.
You listen to the Allman Brothers?

608
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,308
Lynyrd Skynyrd?
Then you've heard Skeeter Meter.

609
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,633
He was Greek and good-Iooking.

610
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,031
His daddy was a sponge diver
before they died out.

611
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,834
- What did they die of?
- Boredom.

612
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,955
Hanging on to some rock,
soaking up whatever rolls over you.

613
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,671
- Almost as bad as Delrona Beach.
- There's a lot of changes happening.

614
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,037
Things might pick up.

615
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,474
Don't hold your breath.

616
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,792
They used to say folks around here
only worshipped three people:

617
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,873
The father, the son
and the Florida Flash.

618
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,318
The day he got hurt, I must have
run the replay 100 times.

619
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,358
He stopped coming up here.
Left school.

620
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,432
So you were
one of the adoring masses?

621
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,035
I was in high school, he was on
national TV. What do you think?

622
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,190
That's some heavy story about Terrell.

623
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,839
A big responsibility she's taken on,
a kid like that.

624
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,309
- So can you help him?
- Me?

625
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,270
- What am I, a shrink?
- I mean help him build this thing.

626
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,797
Carpentry and adolescent psychology,
two things I know nothing about.

627
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,714
Try, okay? For me.

628
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,279
I'll do what I can.

629
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,318
- Maybe we'll head back on Monday.
- We just got here.

630
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,510
I don't want to get sucked in to any
of this. I don't like who I am down here.

631
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,676
And I don't trust my mother.

632
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,559
Is that you, Elton?

633
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,910
I'm amazed at how little sleep
I need these days.

634
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,197
You've got restless feet.
Always have.

635
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,950
Sorry I couldn't be there
for you at the meeting.

636
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,669
You had your emergency.
How'd the hearing go?

637
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,039
He's still on probation.
He has to do community service.

638
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,192
Could have been much worse.

639
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,074
We can fall so quickly.

640
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,549
It's just a stumble, not a fall.

641
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,509
If you could just go and get it
and hand it to them.

642
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,834
- Nobody handed us anything.
- Of course they did.

643
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,391
People fought their whole lives
to keep their heads above water.

644
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,472
We got to start on dry land.

645
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,231
- So Desiree's back?
- Visiting. She's not back.

646
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,479
Hurricane Desiree.

647
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,435
The nights I sat here wondering
where that girl could be.

648
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,229
We used to come out here and neck
when I was in high school.

649
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,278
Then they had these lights in.

650
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,438
Security.

651
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,032
It's more like birth control.

652
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,989
- You do golf courses?
- Design them? No, that's a specialty.

653
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,756
- Do you play it?
- Golf? No.

654
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,673
I gotta tell you...

655
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,758
...sex with me when I'm this drunk
is like being at the dentist.

656
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,999
- The dentist?
- When they shoot you up with Novocain.

657
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,951
You can tell something's going on
in there but you don't know what it is.

658
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,238
- I understand.
- So forget it.

659
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,311
It wouldn't cross my mind.

660
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,879
Tomorrow I won't even remember
I kissed you.

661
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,077
I'll come by and remind you.

662
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,152
Do that.

663
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:23,078
- You honestly don't golf?
- Never took it up.

664
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,719
Good.

665
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,237
The important thing is
to keep that smile on your face...

666
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,912
...even if you're drowning.

667
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,468
- The polar icecap is melting.
- This is news?

668
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,351
They say with this global warming,
the icecap, Antarctica could melt.

669
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,310
- And the oceans get 20 feet higher.
- It's good we live on the 2nd floor.

670
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,836
Here it will be a wading pool
all the way to Orlando.

671
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,155
The problem started with the invention
of the internal combustion engine.

672
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,517
That and air conditioning.

673
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,794
They say every day another species
goes extinct. It's tragic.

674
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,988
Who needs a lizard the size of a van?
If those things came back today...

675
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,913
...people wouldn't be so thrilled.

676
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,354
- Sam! What are we playing for?
- $10.00 a side...

677
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,718
...fifty dollars for the match,
and throw away your worst hole.

678
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,919
- This might be the one.
- My grandparents were peasants.

679
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,278
They came from a country where
they used Jews for target practice.

680
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,878
They only ever ate beets or turnips.
We brought my tante over here.

681
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,429
She wouldn't go to the park.
She said:

682
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,229
"Next time I look at grass,
it should be growing over my body."

683
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,678
- I like to watch that Jungle Channel.
- Animals eating animals.

684
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,355
- It's educational.
- For a wolverine, possibly.

685
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,958
"How to hibernate in three easy lessons."
For human beings, what good is that?

686
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,112
When was the last time
you stalked a creature?

687
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,035
- I go duck-hunting with my son.
- I forgot. You people shoot birds.

688
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,191
Shooting is not the point.

689
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,911
You're out there when the sun comes up,
surrounded by nature.

690
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,957
Nature is overrated.

691
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,518
But we'll miss it when it's gone.

692
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,433
Scotty?

693
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,874
- Sorry to distract you.
- No, I need it.

694
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,715
Come closer.
Come on down into the trap.

695
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:26,319
Where I'm headed, you don't play
in a vacuum. TV camera, a gallery.

696
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,199
Everybody's right on top of you.

697
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,034
Try to keep that distance.

698
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,959
Are you okay?

699
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,113
Yes. I thought we should,
like, make it official.

700
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,636
What?

701
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,598
Breaking up.

702
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,192
You're going off on your tour and all.

703
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,669
Yeah.

704
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,279
Win one tournament, you make more
than a year working here.

705
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,591
- It's not the money.
- It's not?

706
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:20,039
It's this thing that I do. Better than
almost anybody else on earth.

707
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,318
If I don't take another whack
at the highest level...

708
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,278
It's the purest thing that...

709
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,913
Pretty stupid, huh? Talking
about golf like it's important.

710
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,432
It isn't stupid at all,
you really love it.

711
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,268
You just don't love me.

712
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,994
Buster's Place.

713
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:03,110
- How long's it been like this?
- All messed up? Couple of years.

714
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,232
- There was a fire.
- Nobody's fixed it up?

715
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,996
The people it belonged to
didn't come back.

716
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,189
- So you have, like, a crew?
- On a boat?

717
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,035
- Guys you hang with.
- No.

718
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,512
So what are you into?
Interested in.

719
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,278
Stuff.

720
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,756
Like sports? Music?

721
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,798
I guess.

722
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,316
You think we got enough?

723
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,068
Never built a coffin before.

724
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,836
It used to be five yards
in a cloud of dust.

725
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,310
No mouth guards,
no face guards.

726
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,950
The helmet was a leather strap
to hold the brain in...

727
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,069
...in case you got cracked
on the skull. What is it now?

728
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,552
Technology? Hormones?

729
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,713
Bunch of coloured boys flipping
a ball around the field.

730
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,590
Women in the locker room?
That ain't gridiron.

731
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,230
- What are they doing?
- Did you say something?

732
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,110
- What are women doing in the locker room?
- Talking to the players.

733
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,352
They must find it very distracting.

734
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,354
They're too worried about
their stock portfolios to notice.

735
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,149
It's a wonder they know what
a handoff is.

736
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,198
- How do you know they're coloured?
- Who?

737
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,637
The boys flipping the ball.
You can't see the TV.

738
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,554
When do you hear of a white boy
called Deshon?

739
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,877
Carlotta will be here for dinner.
I have rehearsal...

740
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,117
...and then an Audubon meeting.

741
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,840
You and your birds.

742
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,676
They start clearing the Plantation
Estates expansion next week...

743
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,718
...at the old Exley property.
- Lincoln Beach?

744
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,677
Not anymore.

745
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,628
There's a bird colony
we're concerned about.

746
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,270
The coloured folks think
there's a curse on that land.

747
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,318
I'm sure it has seen
its share of misery.

748
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,799
Hey, Mama.

749
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,516
Hey, Daddy.

750
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,672
- Trouble at the motel?
- Everything's fine.

751
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,118
- Then why aren't you there?
- We got a day manager. Rosellen.

752
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:41,434
- Those people steal you blind.
- She's got it under control.

753
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,317
Are these new ones?

754
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,120
I can't remember
when you were here last.

755
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,159
- They all look alike to me.
- The place full up?

756
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,551
- Yes. Celebration.
- How about the restaurant?

757
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,988
Keeping us hopping.

758
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,913
- Gotta make it while it's there.
- I know.

759
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,392
- Steven was calling for you.
- He knows I don't live here.

760
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,795
- It was nice talking to him.
- He's got a screw loose. Deep-sea diving.

761
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,276
- That was his father.
- Puts pressure on the brain.

762
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,035
Steve's put pressure on his brain,
but not by diving.

763
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,159
He said he's turning over
a new leaf. I certainly hope so.

764
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,438
- He had such promise.
- When did Steve ever have promise?

765
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,996
When he had his group
and you were with the circus.

766
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,873
It wasn't a circus.
We stayed in one place.

767
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,516
When you were performing
in the aquarium.

768
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:44,198
- You both were so hopeful.
- Well, we grew up.

769
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:50,117
Daddy? There was a fella from
a development company over yesterday.

770
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,914
You give him the boot?

771
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:58,473
I was thinking this might be
a good time, if you ever wanted to sell.

772
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,916
And watch them turn the beach
into a strip mall?

773
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:08,194
- It's not exactly pristine at the moment.
- You help keep the place running?

774
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,318
- I have not.
- Then hold your peace.

775
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,156
- She's worried about those birds.
- It's a severely compromised habitat.

776
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,632
- The sandhill cranes have forsaken us.
- Good.

777
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,554
If they don't know better than to fly
someplace accommodating...

778
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,109
...then they deserve what they get.

779
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:32,673
Now your sea gull, that's like people.
They'll fight over every scrap they get.

780
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,233
- Your father is a strict Darwinian.
- She throws her education against me.

781
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,188
Anyway, this developer...

782
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,791
- I told him you weren't interested.
- You can bet on that one.

783
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,437
Get in there! Come on!
Get in there!

784
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,390
They give you specs for this thing?
Like dimensions?

785
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,591
- There's a picture in the book.
- If she's gonna get into it...

786
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,556
This doesn't give us
the measurements.

787
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,278
- You're taller than her.
- Right.

788
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,989
Better cut some holes
so she can breathe.

789
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,191
- Halt! Who goes there?
- Don't shoot. It's your ex-wife.

790
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:39,878
- I'm on guard duty.
- Maple said you needed to see me.

791
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:44,352
- Pretend you're just a tourist.
- Steve, come on.

792
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,640
I'm serious. We got an inspector
coming by to review the unit.

793
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,192
- Nice uniform.
- I hate playing a Yankee.

794
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:12,673
- You're Greek, for chrissake.
- I was born down here.

795
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,753
- So, what's the latest crisis?
- No crisis.

796
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:22,153
Just wondering how you were
making out. Seriously.

797
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,393
I found inner peace.
What's the angle?

798
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,950
I heard about something.
I'd like to cut you in.

799
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,476
- Not interested.
- It's once in a lifetime.

800
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,076
- So was our marriage. Once was enough.
- Hear me out.

801
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:41,870
If you don't want to be a co-investor,
we can work out a reasonable rate...

802
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:48,036
- You want to borrow money from me?
- I could get in on something big.

803
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,909
Tell me, what do we not have
on this island?

804
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,115
Let's see. An opera house.

805
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,352
A ski resort. A good Thai restaurant.

806
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:05,595
- Are you familiar with water slides?
- Them plastic chute things?

807
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,399
You slide down it
in your bathing suit?

808
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,633
- We don't have one.
- I knew I was culturally disadvantaged.

809
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,990
Know how much those things make?

810
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,038
- A: You'll never get a permit.
- Don't be so sure.

811
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,432
B: I don't have any money
to throw at half-assed propositions.

812
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,434
- I heard you're about to come into some.
- Is that so?

813
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:31,230
My sources inform me you've been
approached by some big developers.

814
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,552
They don't know diddly.
Besides, C: Even if I did have money...

815
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:42,114
...I'd run it through the leaf shredder
before I gave a nickel of it to you.

816
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,469
I heard your golfer's decided
to take a walk.

817
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,236
He didn't ask you to come along
on the tour, did he?

818
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,678
Do you have any other business
with me? I'm seriously hung-over...

819
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,071
...I gotta get back...
- This is the real deal...

820
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,356
It's just another scam.

821
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,311
Like your band, like the mail order
iguana business, the treasure hunt...

822
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:11,359
- Skeeter Meter rocked!
- But you didn't care about the music.

823
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,432
You just wanted to be famous
and get laid.

824
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,276
You know why you're stuck running
that flophouse? You got no vision.

825
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,558
You think I'd loan you money
after all you put me through?

826
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,958
That's all over and done with.
You can't live in the past.

827
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:48,230
The endangered American alligator's made
a big comeback in the last 20 years...

828
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,598
...spreading out through the swamps
and waste canals of Florida.

829
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,276
You got a three-foot mud puddle,
you got a two-foot gator in it.

830
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:07,109
We don't know much about the Timucua
until the advent of the Spanish...

831
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,676
I've got some bad news and some
good news from our retail sponsors.

832
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,997
I asked if you could keep
your outfits...

833
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:45,078
Flash Phillips! I used to watch you
leave them tacklers grabbing the wind.

834
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,518
How you doing? Baby, this is
Flash Phillips, the Heisman guy.

835
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,514
- I didn't win the...
- Only because they popped your knee.

836
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,473
- Nice of you.
- Would've made a decent pro...

837
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,631
...you put on some muscle.

838
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,712
- Are you local?
- We live down Lincoln Beach.

839
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:07,113
I'm hosting a barbecue where
Henry's Lounge used to be. Drop by.

840
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,559
- More of this Pirate Days hustle?
- No. I'm gonna be your neighbour.

841
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,789
Hey, baby!
The Florida Flash is moving in.

842
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,631
- Hi. Flash Phillips.
- I know.

843
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,751
And you are?

844
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,633
Desiree.

845
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,432
Damn!

846
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,233
- Are you still living here?
- I'm visiting my mother.

847
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:45,235
Stokes, right? She has this house
on Carver Street facing the beach.

848
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:51,191
- Right. You running for office?
- I just like to know my neighbours.

849
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:57,196
- So how you been doing?
- Great, lately. There was some...

850
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:03,114
Well, when I got hurt,
I got lost there a little bit, you know?

851
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,748
- I left...
- I remember.

852
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,637
You look terrific. Have I seen you
on TV? You look familiar.

853
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,874
- I ought to look familiar.
- No, I mean the adult you.

854
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:23,112
I do instructional videos,
infomercials.

855
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:29,116
- Damn! You were just a little-bitty girl.
- I was their age.

856
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,274
- No! I'd have been in jail.
- I was 15 when I won this contest.

857
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:39,673
- We got together right after that.
- Yeah, well...

858
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,228
I was pretty young myself.

859
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,995
Listen, I'm having
this barbecue tomorrow.

860
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,153
Yeah, where Henry's Lounge
used to be?

861
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,959
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

862
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:00,717
We will start the eveningwear
segment of the contest in a moment.

863
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:06,671
I'd like to thank our participating
retailers here at the mall.

864
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,638
It's me.

865
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,679
Earl.

866
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,397
We should talk again.

867
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,754
I explained what I can do
and what I can't.

868
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,589
Okay, 9:00.

869
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,636
Same place?

870
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,397
We had quite a little society
in Jacksonville at the time.

871
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,599
Young ladies were presented
when they were 16.

872
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:47,630
Often, there'd be a piano recital,
then a formal dance.

873
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,990
This is my sister at her cotillion.

874
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,396
Are there pictures of yours?

875
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:08,313
By the time my turn came along,
it was...

876
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,677
My father had suffered
a financial reversal.

877
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,597
As did many of the other
important people in the community.

878
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,797
Here we are at the beach.

879
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,760
In so many other ways
we were on the outside, looking in.

880
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,230
But this was ours.

881
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,473
They all went down to check out
the titty bars in Jacksonville.

882
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,395
They're all right.
They're just guys.

883
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,999
We start clearing Monday.

884
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,793
Doesn't the teacher
make allowances for that?

885
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:10,598
Tell her I flunked it too.
No, don't tell her that.

886
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,518
Tell her I'll work with her on it
when I get home.

887
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,991
We go to Alabama after this,
then there's a break.

888
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,672
I miss you too.

889
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,233
Think about me, all right?

890
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,874
- It's yellow with a black tip.
- Skeeter Meter!

891
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,955
- Your T-shirt.
- Right. You remember them?

892
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,716
- I was them. Lead guitar and vocals.
- Right, you dressed in lizard skin.

893
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,192
Iguana.
Are you with them construction guys?

894
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:01,520
- We're clearing this site.
- Did you ever build a water slide?

895
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,868
What the hell.

896
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,073
Seafood's a good bet.

897
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,557
We guarantee
it's only been thawed out once.

898
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,070
- How'd you end up here?
- I skipped dinner with some buyers.

899
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,516
- I'm not much of a salesman.
- You move dirt around.

900
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,674
- There's some drainage issues too.
- Now I'm really impressed.

901
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,435
Somebody told me you're a big name
in land architecture.

902
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,715
I guess.

903
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:57,113
- Did you go to school for it?
- I went to business school. Came out...

904
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,149
...and I made a lot of money
buying and selling companies.

905
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,548
- It was nice while it lasted.
- You didn't like it?

906
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,599
My boss went to jail.
It was a musical-chairs kind of thing.

907
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:14,275
The music stopped,
he was in a compromising position...

908
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,591
So you went back to lawns?

909
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,438
There's this guy.
Frederick Law Olmsted.

910
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,871
The one who designed Central Park
in New York.

911
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,917
- Right.
- It was on Jeopardy.

912
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,913
"Famous parks and monuments."

913
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,312
Well, he's kind of the granddaddy
of what I do.

914
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:41,316
You take land that's wild and
inaccessible and you refine it.

915
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,508
You showcase the natural beauty,
you accentuate the topography...

916
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,558
...you create a space for everybody...

917
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,998
...rich, poor, in-between,
where they can come together.

918
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:59,359
So we're all invited
to Exley Plantation for a fish fry?

919
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,832
The populist part of it has fallen away.
But you know what I mean.

920
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,319
No, I do.

921
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:13,394
Do you remember on the golf course...?

922
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,709
Something about being out there
with some guy I hardly knew?

923
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,629
You get Sundays off?

924
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:35,398
- Are you sure you can pull this off?
- They'll listen to me.

925
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,831
The old college try isn't gonna do it
for us. We need results.

926
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,039
- I swing two more votes, it's done.
- It can't be too obvious.

927
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,910
It won't be. But you're on your own,
water management.

928
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:55,232
That's just technical stuff.
It's these anti-growth people.

929
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,109
Can't have too much noise
when the rezoning comes up.

930
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:04,195
- There will always be a few die-hards.
- I understand.

931
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,919
The usual format for this is to open an
account offshore. Does that work for you?

932
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,478
- It needs to be cash.
- Cash?

933
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,788
Hundred-dollar bills. New ones.

934
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,918
We have been a naughty boy,
haven't we?

935
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:34,595
Hi! I'm here to introduce you to
an exciting new grilling system...

936
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:38,389
...that will revolutionize the way
you feed your family.

937
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,951
This is not just another gadget,
but a scientific breakthrough...

938
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,112
...pioneered by certified
health professionals.

939
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,193
I don't know about you,
but the mess of grilling...

940
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,396
Desiree.

941
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,155
Amen.

942
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:11,230
A member of the community
has a word for us today.

943
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:17,635
It is my hope that you'll give your
heart and your mind to his thoughts.

944
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,075
Dr. Lloyd.

945
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,074
Thank you, Reverend Sutcliff.

946
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,518
Good morning.

947
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,315
The matter I came to discuss...

948
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,438
...is not exactly religious...

949
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,230
...but it is a matter of the spirit.

950
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,913
My name is Marly Temple.
I'm visiting Jack Meadows.

951
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,196
Is this where they put you up?

952
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,876
This is one of the few unsold units.
I'm trying to figure out why.

953
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,076
I haven't been in here since
your outfit took it over. It's pretty.

954
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,988
Thanks.

955
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,436
Before, unless you were
hunting armadillos...

956
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:33,234
- So you decide what trees live and die?
- That's part of it.

957
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,156
- That's kind of like being God.
- Do you remember the last hurricane?

958
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,230
- Elmo.
- That's God. I'm just a hired hand.

959
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:48,713
Last year, a majorette breathed so
much exhaust she nearly passed out.

960
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,270
So if you see the spacing
getting too cramped...

961
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,318
...get on down there
and direct traffic.

962
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,598
Honey, I'll be riding
with the Fire Department.

963
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,832
Can you drop the car off
at the high school...

964
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,596
...and get somebody to give you
a ride downtown? You're an angel.

965
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:13,716
Where is the driver
of the Tropical Paradise float?

966
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,269
We can't move anything.
Where is he?

967
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:32,151
They were bombing around town in a car
they'd borrowed without asking.

968
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:36,472
This officer went after them.
He was new on the force...

969
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:41,430
...otherwise he would have just
called my daddy.

970
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:47,152
- They were trying to get away?
- They hit the causeway doing 90.

971
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:51,836
Then they saw patrol cars
waiting down at the other end.

972
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,515
They did a 180 like
out of a Burt Reynolds movie.

973
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,831
- They flipped.
- Yeah.

974
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,870
The divers couldn't remember
which one was driving...

975
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:08,033
...because they were identical.
Dickie and Danny.

976
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,993
- Were they younger or older than you?
- Three years older.

977
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:21,517
They played sports,
honour roll, the whole deal.

978
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,791
Must have been tough
on your parents.

979
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,997
My daddy never expected much
of me, but the twins...

980
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:41,236
I'll bet they were laughing
till the minute they hit the water.

981
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,788
Excuse me.

982
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,759
- We saw your mermaid.
- This is it, isn't it?

983
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:36,358
- If you`re not done burying the treasure...
- We could come back.

984
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,434
I wish you had gotten to know him.

985
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,513
He was strong.
He didn't talk about it much...

986
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:57,073
...but you could tell he'd been
through a lot of things.

987
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,913
And all these other people?

988
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,356
This goes back to when the island
was a cotton plantation.

989
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,308
They buried the slaves here
when they wore them out.

990
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,916
Leave off with that, Mama!

991
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,640
They don't belong in here.

992
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,191
It's bad enough we've got to pass
through all their security...

993
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,238
...to visit our dead.

994
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,358
And they gotta throw this trash
in here.

995
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,796
I don't think they mean to.

996
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,435
It's a resting place.

997
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,319
Not a playpen.

998
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,673
My daddy's people come out of the
turpentine camps and pulp mills.

999
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,389
Hired hands, mostly.
Couldn't read or write.

1000
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,394
So having his own business...

1001
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,757
Thing is, it's his dream, not mine.

1002
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,878
- And it ain't my mother's.
- She doesn't work there?

1003
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,795
She'll drive six blocks out of her way
so as not to have to look at it.

1004
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,480
Her own daddy was a minister...

1005
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:11,349
...so she feels like she was raised
for a higher calling.

1006
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,318
Community theatre.

1007
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:19,873
Last year, she starred in Mother Courage.
The year before that it was Electra.

1008
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:25,119
People come to see what
the crazy lady is gonna do next.

1009
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:31,276
- You wanted to be an actress?
- Hell, no. Oceanographer.

1010
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,192
My friends called me
Jacqueline Cousteau.

1011
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:41,195
- But you didn't...?
- Shit happens. A lot happened to me.

1012
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:56,553
- You like what you do, don't you?
- The actual work, yeah. The politics...

1013
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:02,875
- People fighting over land.
- I tend to get there after the dust settles.

1014
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,350
- And home is?
- Head office is in La Jolla.

1015
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,035
- California?
- Yeah.

1016
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,317
But I just go from job to job
these days.

1017
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,198
No family?

1018
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,511
An ex and two kids. They live
in Connecticut with their...

1019
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,753
She's remarried.

1020
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:35,957
This guy I know is going on that
PGA tour. Different town every week...

1021
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:41,399
...maid makes your bed. Hang out in the
hotel bars, check out the local talent.

1022
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,279
Living the dream.

1023
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,157
I saw a manatee in here once.

1024
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,154
Big, naked-Iooking thing.
Like a fat lady in a bathhouse.

1025
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:56,790
I felt guilty for watching.

1026
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:02,799
They planned on building all along here.
One of those assisted-living deals.

1027
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:07,272
- But the feds snapped it up first.
- That wasn't my company.

1028
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,318
I didn't say it was.

1029
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,317
There are a lot of misconceptions.

1030
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,395
Sure, most outfits, it's all scorched
earth and put up some high-rise.

1031
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:24,588
Yeah. People hear "motel," they figure
I'm running a hot-sheets operation.

1032
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,992
- For trysts?
- Yeah, trysts.

1033
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:37,519
Don't put so much muscle into it,
we're not in a hurry.

1034
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:45,474
First of all, we'd like to congratulate
the folks...

1035
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:50,270
...who got to our treasure first,
Mr. And Mrs. Morley Crandall...

1036
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,115
...of Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

1037
01:32:55,480 --> 01:33:00,474
Now, our newly crowned pirate
queen, Donna-Jean Stamper...

1038
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,757
...will do the honours.

1039
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:17,036
My Lord. That is a genuine diamonique
necklace from Kweskin Jewellers...

1040
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,317
...at the Citrus Highway
Shopping Centre.

1041
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:26,077
And here's $500 won'th of gift
certificates from our local merchants.

1042
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:31,314
Donna-Jean, help Mrs. Crandall on
with some of that beautiful jewellery.

1043
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,350
Doesn't she look pretty?

1044
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:58,671
We used to come here Saturday nights
after the games. Wild times.

1045
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,594
Take them local girls
up in the dunes.

1046
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,273
Those were the days.

1047
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:07,318
I still remember your run
against Georgia Tech.

1048
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:12,508
- Orange Bowl. My freshman year.
- You just flattened that safety.

1049
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:17,754
- You go to State?
- No, I was up north. High school.

1050
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,197
I played the same position,
had the same number.

1051
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:25,511
- Number 23.
- Left my chin strap hanging like you.

1052
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,918
- Drove my coach crazy.
- Where did you play college?

1053
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:35,356
My grades dipped some,
so my parents had me hit the books.

1054
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,717
Then in college...

1055
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,351
My high school grades was too low
to do any dipping.

1056
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,355
- So you moving in?
- Buster's Place there.

1057
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,752
The folks weren't paying their taxes,
I took over the payments.

1058
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:59,358
- Then I picked up a few more lots.
- Speculation.

1059
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,629
More like preservation.
This place was part of my growing up.

1060
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:10,396
I don't want it to fall to pieces.
We got plenty of empty buildings.

1061
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:16,115
- You still got them hands.
- Yeah.

1062
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,634
I don't get to church much anymore.

1063
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:26,828
Sundays when I'm down there,
I go visit Etta Mae.

1064
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,191
We saw Daddy today.

1065
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,511
Yeah, he was one of a kind,
your father.

1066
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:41,357
The old breed.
Businessman. Race man.

1067
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,517
We'd go into Jacksonville,
people would say:

1068
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:54,673
"You're Mr. Stokes' daughter."

1069
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,955
Then they'd all fuss over me.

1070
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:04,433
Yeah, we didn't have politicians,
we had men like your father.

1071
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,229
He carried some weight in that city.

1072
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,951
It got to where I could hardly breathe
when I was near him.

1073
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,714
That man loved you to death.

1074
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,589
I only felt his eyes on me.
Judging me.

1075
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:29,832
It's hard to live up to
what's come before us.

1076
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,270
One way or the other.

1077
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:43,757
I don't suppose I could get you to
come to this protest rally tomorrow?

1078
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,310
I burned my bridges here
a long time ago.

1079
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,359
Eunice wants you to have her place
once she's gone.

1080
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:00,309
That's too far ahead
for me to think about.

1081
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,799
Maybe.

1082
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:03,314
- Which one did you play?
- I had a solo number.

1083
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:09,112
- "Siren of the Deep."
- I'll bet you were something.

1084
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,671
I hated to come up. It was like
I was meant to live down there.

1085
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,958
You're soaring, you know.
Weightless.

1086
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,997
I still do the routine in my dreams.

1087
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:27,632
- It's good you live by the ocean.
- I don't swim anymore.

1088
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:31,679
When you leave the job,
they make you hand in your tail fin.

1089
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,308
I haven't been in the water for years.

1090
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:03,632
- You married, Lee?
- I was.

1091
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:08,715
- Kids?
- Two. I don't see enough of them.

1092
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:14,398
Their mother moved to Miami
to marry some Cuban guy.

1093
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,155
I'm really glad
that I found you again.

1094
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,078
There's something I've been thinking
about.

1095
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,789
Something I need to talk to you about.

1096
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,952
Here we are.

1097
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:33,159
It's about your mother's property.

1098
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,671
You don't want to wait too long
before making plans.

1099
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,990
- For my mother?
- I worry...

1100
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:46,756
...that you try to hold on
to that house till it's too late.

1101
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,319
Too late for what?

1102
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:52,473
All these new resorts
and timesharing outfits in Delrona...

1103
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:55,393
...have sent property taxes
through the roof.

1104
01:39:55,600 --> 01:40:01,436
We're offering people a chance to sell
before they're taxed out.

1105
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,113
We?

1106
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:06,630
I'm putting together
a small group of investors.

1107
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,874
If your mother were willing to sell,
terms might even be more favourable.

1108
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:15,350
- You'd pay her more?
- Sure.

1109
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:21,152
It's in the spirit of the thing.
She's been here from the beginning.

1110
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:34,149
No big pressure.
Just think about it.

1111
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,799
Sure.

1112
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:43,916
- So you and straight arrow...?
- Reggie.

1113
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,829
- You...?
- Just married.

1114
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,752
He seems like a real nice guy.

1115
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,238
He is.

1116
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:24,074
- Totally clueless!
- I know.

1117
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:32,274
People just think it's there,
like Thanksgiving or Christmas.

1118
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:39,550
They don't realize how difficult it is
to invent a tradition.

1119
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,269
- You do it so well.
- But at the end of the day...

1120
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,116
...is there acknowledgement?
Is there so much as a "thank you"?

1121
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:53,479
Not a peep.
I might as well be their mother!

1122
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:57,679
It's an important role.
If you weren't there...

1123
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:03,312
And the time involved,
my God.

1124
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:07,678
- And now I neglect you.
- No...

1125
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:15,192
What have you been up to, anyway?
I've hardly seen you.

1126
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,876
The usual.

1127
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,839
You're my rock.

1128
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:33,996
- You know that, don't you?
- Sure.

1129
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,799
Even during all that bad stretch...

1130
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,873
...when you had
your gambling problem...

1131
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:46,160
...I always knew it wasn't
gonna last forever, because...

1132
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:50,193
You are my rock.

1133
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,879
And I count on you.

1134
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,548
I thought the parade went
awful well this year.

1135
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,998
Did you really?

1136
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:13,795
- You said the guy's name was Lee.
- Lee Otis.

1137
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,428
Lee Otis "Flash" Phillips.

1138
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,878
- I'm sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about.

1139
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,235
I should have told you more.

1140
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:34,911
What? That he was a celebrity?
That he used to be famous?

1141
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:39,835
- You're not jealous?
- I didn't know you then.

1142
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:44,037
If I had, you would have
completely ignored me.

1143
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:48,113
I could never compete with
Mr. Heisman Trophy.

1144
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,872
Come on.

1145
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:53,669
Now you're with a guy that
puts people to sleep for a living.

1146
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,955
Stop.

1147
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:08,798
- Does he even know?
- I don't think so.

1148
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,155
You gonna tell him?

1149
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,471
Is there any point?

1150
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:19,794
- I don't know. If the baby had lived...
- Then everything would be different.

1151
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,757
But it's not.

1152
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:39,593
How are you doing with Terrell?

1153
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:43,673
Kid's pretty good with a claw hammer
and a handsaw.

1154
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:49,913
If this were 1925,
he'd have a future.

1155
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,756
Idiot.

1156
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:48,078
Come on, dogs!

1157
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,152
Daddy!

1158
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,913
- Is that you, Marly?
- You need any help?

1159
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,036
No.

1160
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:07,398
I can still see light. Shapes.

1161
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:11,269
- You on your way to work?
- Sort of.

1162
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:16,955
I used to see the dawn
come up every day.

1163
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,476
Only the shrimpers got up earlier.

1164
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:24,235
Remember Clarence Green?
Used to work in the kitchen.

1165
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:28,075
He'd be back there.
I'd come in, "Morning, Clarence."

1166
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:30,629
"Morning, Mr. Furman," he'd say.

1167
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,590
- They don't call you like that no more.
- Not for a long time, Daddy.

1168
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,036
I said that if integration comes...

1169
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:42,192
...I was gonna close up.

1170
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:47,229
One day, there it is. Four of them.
Young, polite. Sitting in a booth...

1171
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:51,951
...waiting for my girls to serve them.

1172
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:56,109
Clarence was in the back
trembling like a leaf.

1173
01:46:56,280 --> 01:47:01,513
Didn't know how I was gonna react.
I said, "What do you think, Clarence?"

1174
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:04,752
He said, "Well, Mr. Furman...

1175
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:10,677
...I reckon if you serve them this
one time, they ain't coming back."

1176
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:15,118
"How's that?" I said.
"Excuse me for saying it, Mr. Furman.

1177
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:19,319
But the food is a lot better
down at Buster's Place."

1178
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:25,672
You spend a lot of time worrying
about a day coming.

1179
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,400
Then when it does,
it ain't so bad.

1180
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,074
I can't do it anymore.

1181
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:37,793
- Developers been getting to you?
- No, it's not them.

1182
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,869
You spend so much time worrying
about the damn swamp buzzard...

1183
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:47,790
- Snail kite.
- You know who's endangered?

1184
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:52,192
- The small businessman.
- I know. But it's me.

1185
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:55,557
I hate going in there.

1186
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,592
People used to come
to Plantation Island...

1187
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:04,719
...and ask where they could
stay and get a good meal.

1188
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,238
"Furman Temple," they'd tell them.
"He'll take care of you."

1189
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:14,473
I know, Daddy.
But what should I do?

1190
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,796
- Get the best price you can.
- I can't be the one...

1191
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,592
It's all yours, darling.

1192
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:26,435
You're a sensible girl.
You always have been...

1193
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:31,037
...if you don't count marrying
that musician. You'll figure it out.

1194
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,792
I'm sorry.

1195
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,994
I've already been out in the world,
done my damage. Now it's your turn.

1196
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:41,116
Come on, dogs!

1197
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,590
You're supposed to be retired,
not running around!

1198
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:00,076
Hi.

1199
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:07,079
"Score big savings with our
all-American sales team."

1200
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,431
- You work here.
- Some of the time.

1201
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:16,598
- What's the problem?
- Who are you buying property for?

1202
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:21,038
- It's mine. My name's on it.
- No, who are you buying it for?

1203
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,509
Whose money do you use
to buy it?

1204
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,034
Okay.

1205
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,190
These people own a lot of things.

1206
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:38,229
- Businesses, real estate.
- They own Exley Plantation?

1207
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:41,557
Technically, yeah.
But if it...

1208
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:46,840
If it came to the point where
they took it over, it'd be different.

1209
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,231
- More modest-income units.
- Which you would sell?

1210
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,915
- That's the deal.
- What do you get for tricking people?

1211
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:58,517
I'm not tricking anybody. They don't
wanna sell, they don't have to.

1212
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:03,595
They do wanna sell, they get
a decent price. Who do you work for?

1213
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:09,392
- That's different.
- Life moves on. Shit gets bought and sold.

1214
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,675
A handful of people run
the whole deal. The rest of us...

1215
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,877
...do what they say
and get paid for it.

1216
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,755
You got out of that neighbourhood
as soon as you could.

1217
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:27,233
I left because I was 15,
and I was pregnant.

1218
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:35,115
That's right.

1219
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:43,116
- You never let me know.
- What would you have done?

1220
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,952
Back then?

1221
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,276
My life was falling apart.
I wouldn't have been much help.

1222
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:55,513
- And you had other girls.
- Yeah.

1223
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,473
When I started to show...

1224
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:06,758
...my mom and dad sent me
to my Aunt Thelma's in Macon.

1225
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:11,152
Then I lost the baby.
And I just kept going.

1226
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:14,676
- You lost the baby?
- A little boy.

1227
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,718
I was going to name him Lee.

1228
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,275
How did you...?

1229
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:25,319
- How did you get by on your own?
- I lied a lot.

1230
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:27,710
I lied about my age,
my experience.

1231
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,271
I hooked up with anybody who was
likely to do me some good.

1232
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:37,719
- You ever have kids after?
- No, I can't.

1233
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,519
There were complications.
I was so young.

1234
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,954
You must be pretty mad at me.

1235
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:50,229
A 19-year-old football player. He
thinks he has the world in his pocket.

1236
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,278
I'd like to smack his oversized head.

1237
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:57,234
Not much of him left to smack.

1238
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:00,838
I was who I was too.

1239
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:04,915
But if we had brought somebody
in the world...

1240
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:15,519
My mama is not gonna sell
her house.

1241
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,315
Hello? Anyone here?

1242
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:45,474
- Who's there?
- Terrell Wilkins.

1243
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:49,633
- Who's Terrell Wilkins?
- We brought over Miss Delia's box.

1244
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,799
- You can leave it on the front step.
- It's kind of big.

1245
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:59,236
We had to borrow a pickup
to bring it over.

1246
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,712
- What kind of a box is it?
- It's a coffin. Made out of pinewood.

1247
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:07,668
- She's getting ready to plant me under.
- It's for a play.

1248
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:14,077
How old are you? You don't sound like
you could be driving a pickup truck.

1249
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,391
- My daddy brought it over.
- He a carpenter?

1250
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:20,637
He works at the hospital.
An anaesthesiologist.

1251
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,230
- He gives people the gas?
- Yes, sir.

1252
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:28,278
- How old are you?
- 13.

1253
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:31,278
You over at the junior high?

1254
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:37,793
Do they still have a picture of
two boys holding basketballs?

1255
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:42,272
- They look the same?
- They was my boys.

1256
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:49,716
Dickie and Danny.
They set them some records.

1257
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,669
Of course, it was segregated then.
It's a whole new game now.

1258
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:59,469
- You from Delrona or from Lincoln Beach?
- Lincoln.

1259
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:04,509
You got a nice spot on the water?
Do you get out there and swim?

1260
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,470
- No.
- You don't know how...

1261
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:11,349
...or don't you get around to it?
- There's an undertow.

1262
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:16,640
Of course there is.
There's always gonna be one of those.

1263
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:22,229
The trick is, you don't try to fight it.

1264
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:27,629
You swim parallel to the shore
till the pressure eases up.

1265
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,630
You struggle with that whole,
wide ocean and you're a goner.

1266
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,270
No matter how strong you are...

1267
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,718
...no matter how much grit you got...

1268
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:46,750
...you try to take it head on,
it'll pull you under.

1269
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,598
Miss Delia?

1270
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:56,955
She's off,
selling away my whole life.

1271
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:09,190
Leave that pine box on the lawn. Give
the neighbours something to buzz about.

1272
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,271
Terrell Wilkins!

1273
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:20,069
You can't live on no beach
and be afraid of the water.

1274
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:34,434
- Marly tells me you're an actress.
- More of an impresario these days.

1275
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:38,275
Of course, Marly flirted
with her own theatrical life.

1276
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:44,436
She portrayed a mermaid in a roadside
attraction. Very successfully.

1277
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:49,515
- We should talk money.
- I'm glad you folks have come around.

1278
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:54,196
Whenever there's an economic shift,
somebody gets left holding the bag.

1279
01:55:54,360 --> 01:56:00,356
- Stuck with their property.
- After it's been dramatically devalued.

1280
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:03,512
If you'd waited any longer,
I'd hate to think...

1281
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:08,708
Just what are your
development plans, Mr. Forrester?

1282
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,872
That's not really my end
of the business...

1283
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:17,751
...but I assume that the whole
beachfront area will undergo...

1284
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:21,117
...some sort of change...

1285
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:27,389
...that would have negatively impacted on
your ability to continue to do business.

1286
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:32,395
- So our development board...
- Out of the goodness of their heart?

1287
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,109
We prefer not to destroy anything
when we come in...

1288
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:39,795
...whether it be an ecosystem
or a small business.

1289
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:44,795
That's extremely charitable of you.
However, in view of the fact...

1290
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:47,269
...that we have no crystal ball...

1291
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:51,592
...to inform us on the scope
of your group's future activities...

1292
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:56,117
...I think some sort of continuing
participation would be in order.

1293
01:56:56,280 --> 01:57:00,114
On top of your very generous
initial offer, of course.

1294
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:04,990
- Continuing?
- An escalator clause.

1295
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,555
I'm not really sure what...

1296
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:13,395
Let's say in five years
you've transformed our beachfront...

1297
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:19,715
...into one of those cash-generating
monstrosities that grace the coast.

1298
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:24,118
We would receive a gross percentage
of the proceeds from rentals.

1299
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:29,877
Or adjusted gross, if you will,
depending on our ability to audit.

1300
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,316
Don't gape at me, darling.

1301
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:38,792
I've operated a nonprofit theatre
for 25 years.

1302
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:45,431
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.
- I imagine you will. Cheryl?

1303
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,910
Bring Mr. Forrester
a slice of your key lime pie.

1304
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,753
I'm told it's exceptional.

1305
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:58,554
Hey, Mama.
What you cooking?

1306
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:03,032
- Lunch.
- You used to always fry your own.

1307
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:06,030
When I was a girl...

1308
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:11,354
...we pulled the feathers off
and threw the feet in a pot for soup.

1309
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:16,630
- Don't do that anymore, either.
- That's too bad.

1310
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:19,912
When you left here,
you couldn't boil water.

1311
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:26,153
- Casserole too?
- I'm taking that to Mrs. Pierce.

1312
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:30,677
- She hasn't been feeling well.
- You buried the hatchet with her?

1313
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:34,753
No! But she's my neighbour.

1314
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:45,073
If anybody comes to talk to you
about selling this house...

1315
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:50,434
- I put all the property in your name.
- But you're still alive.

1316
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:58,351
You've got yourself
a really good man there. Responsible.

1317
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:03,592
You mean unlike me?

1318
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:18,591
- We can't change how things went...
- Growing up here...

1319
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:23,550
The way everybody looked up to
you and Daddy. I had to be perfect.

1320
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:26,871
- Nobody expected that.
- Of course they did.

1321
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:31,795
- When I went off, everybody knew it.
- Nobody knew about that.

1322
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,310
Everybody knows everything here.
If you didn't know...

1323
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:41,316
...you didn't want to. How could I come
back here and look people in the eye?

1324
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:45,189
- Your family was here.
- Daddy ran away from his family.

1325
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:49,712
He lived in a sharecropper's shack,
and he was nearly full-grown.

1326
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:54,232
- He was the same age as me.
- He was a man. Times were different.

1327
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:59,030
Both of you had these ideas about
what a decent person was...

1328
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:02,312
You broke your father's heart.

1329
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:06,439
When you sent me away,
you broke mine.

1330
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:35,118
Your father worked so hard...

1331
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:40,718
...to maintain a degree
of respectability.

1332
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:46,034
Everybody was watching him.
White people, black people.

1333
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,111
And there I go...

1334
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:52,558
...showing my colour.
Isn't that what they used to call it?

1335
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:58,158
I thought it would be better for you,
for all of us.

1336
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,869
Young girls get pregnant
and have babies every day.

1337
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:07,239
We were trying to put an end to that.
We were hoping for a better life.

1338
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:11,030
- Moving up.
- Taking care of ourselves.

1339
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,873
Taking care of each other.

1340
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:22,274
Talking isn't going to change
what's been done, is it?

1341
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,840
How are you doing, Mama?

1342
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,398
Dr. Lloyd...

1343
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:36,870
I will live until I die.

1344
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:46,958
If anything should happen...

1345
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:51,113
...and you're worried about money
to take care of Terrell...

1346
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:55,353
Baby, what good is money...

1347
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,114
...gonna do for Terrell?

1348
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:16,149
Stop Plantation now!
Stop Plantation now!

1349
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:25,035
I'm with Exley!

1350
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:31,238
It's just the same bunch
of malcontents.

1351
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,710
We'll frame them out,
get footage of the machinery.

1352
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:38,668
- The chanting?
- Don't worry, we won't run the sound.

1353
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:04,873
- We got bones, boss.
- They used to raise cattle here.

1354
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:08,316
- Don't look like no cow to me.
- A fuckload of them.

1355
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:11,199
They've been dead a long time.

1356
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:17,035
Everybody, I have to ask you
all to leave the premises...

1357
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,839
...while we continue
this investigation.

1358
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:23,112
Tell me that's not an arrowhead.

1359
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:26,955
They say the only bad Indian
is a dead Indian.

1360
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:29,190
Please, back it up.

1361
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:33,069
Archaeologists say the find is
of enormous importance.

1362
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:37,597
The remains, almost definitely
the first Native American inabitants...

1363
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,990
...of Plantation Island.

1364
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:44,233
The site seems to be a well
or cistern of some sort.

1365
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:48,552
We've discovered quite a few
crucifixes amongst the bones.

1366
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:54,955
Based on the forensic examination, I'd
say we're dealing with a mass burial...

1367
02:04:56,160 --> 02:05:00,358
- This mean you're out of here?
- Hi.

1368
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:05,389
When you turn over a rock,
you never know what you'll find.

1369
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:11,157
- I've been shut down by fish, birds...
- Never by people?

1370
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:13,788
Not by dead ones.

1371
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:23,078
So where to now?

1372
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:28,712
They're flying me to a site
on Vieques Island. Tomorrow.

1373
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:34,753
Puerto Rico.

1374
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:46,875
So kind of bad timing, huh?
With us?

1375
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:48,792
Yeah.

1376
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:04,158
You have fun down there.

1377
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:31,678
It's bright daylight outside,
you don't need the flash.

1378
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:35,355
Terrell, get in the picture.
Come on.

1379
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:38,193
Stand in between us, Terrell.

1380
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:41,318
That's it. Smile now!

1381
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:48,195
- That's gonna be a nice one.
- I'm serious about those grades.

1382
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:53,388
- I'll send you a copy when he gets them.
- You hear that? There's no escape.

1383
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:12,199
- Take as much time as you need.
- Thanks.

1384
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:14,513
Before it was land, it was gold.
That was the dream.

1385
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:17,353
To be richer than kings.

1386
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:21,149
Ponce de Leon wanders ashore
and runs into a native...

1387
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:27,475
...wearing a three-pound gold necklace.
He says, "Where did you get that?"

1388
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:32,395
The native demonstrates in sign
language, "I picked it off the ground."

1389
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:37,156
Soon, the place is lousy with Spanish.
They killed off entire tribes...

1390
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:41,359
...forcing them to look for the stuff.
Where there was a Spaniard...

1391
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,512
...there were six Indians
sweating their asses off...

1392
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,955
...but not one nugget
did they find.

1393
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:51,557
- So where'd the native guy get it?
- He picked it off the beach.

1394
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:55,269
It washed ashore from
Spanish galleons that sank here.

1395
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:59,149
The metal came from Bolivia, Peru.
Where they had mines...

1396
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:02,392
...and an inexhaustible supply
of Indians to work.

1397
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:06,798
- Chasing after their own treasure.
- Chasing the dream.

1398
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:11,909
What do we have today to strike it
rich like that? Transform your life?

1399
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:16,073
Hap Gordon won the Florida Lottery.
Where you scratch the card.

1400
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:22,076
- It lacks poetry.
- In Lauderdale, I had a metal detector.

1401
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:25,676
- Worked the beaches every morning.
- And?

1402
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:30,034
Mostly tabs from beer cans.

1403
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:33,351
We live in impoverished times.

1404
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,479
Young people dream of appearing
on quiz shows, dating models...

1405
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:40,950
- That's something.
- Compared to pieces of eight?

1406
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:45,113
There's no mystery anymore.
There are footprints on the moon.

1407
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:48,590
They say there might be gold
on the moon.

1408
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:50,716
Now there's a thought.

1409
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,031
Prospecting in outer space.

1410
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:04,550
But what will we do for Indians?
