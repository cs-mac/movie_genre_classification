1
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,824
- Where are they?
- Still at it.

2
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,066
I hear they broke the bed!

3
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,623
They didn't mean to.

4
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,742
It could be true, anything's possible.

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,146
Got a light?

6
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,342
Don't tell anyone, they'll kill you.

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,985
Erbao's tractor was in a smash-up.

8
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,543
It was in Longwangkou.

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,105
The corpse is still lying there,
you know.

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,625
When was it?

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,385
Day before yesterday.

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,581
Now the Peasant Culture Group...

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,709
...from Fenyang will perform...

14
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,142
...Train Heading for Shaoshan.

15
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,261
"A southbound train...

16
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,066
"...races across the sunny land

17
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,741
"It's heading for Shaoshan!

18
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,981
"Chairman Mao's hometown!

19
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,701
"Look, here they come!"

20
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,747
Wheels flying, whistle blowing

21
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,659
Train heading for Shaoshan!

22
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,067
Over mountains, across rivers...

23
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,943
Towards the radiant sun

24
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,540
Towards the radiant sun

25
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,341
"Comrades, next stop Shaoshan

26
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,020
"Chairman Mao's hometown

27
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,141
"Really?

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,663
"Miss...

29
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,180
"How much longer to Shaoshan?

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,666
"Forty minutes, sir

31
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,946
"See, this gentleman
finds the train too slow

32
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,708
"Young folk, don't you know..."

33
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,343
Learn from Dazhai Commune

34
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,665
Where poor farmers
raised the red flag

35
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,783
They united in action

36
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,428
Fearless and practical,
they acted as one

37
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,947
Everyone on board?

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,508
Roll call.

39
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,068
- Li Hongyun?
- Yes.

40
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,180
Yao Eryong?

41
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,268
Yin Ruijuan?

42
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,148
Wen Xuefeng?

43
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,342
Zhang Jun?

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,067
Zhang Jun?

45
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,865
- Where were you?
- Toilet.

46
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,507
Shangli Hongli?

47
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,589
Li Yang?

48
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,269
Yuan Fenglin?

49
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,267
Guo Xiaoyan?

50
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,823
Wu Jingming?

51
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,383
Cui Mingliang?

52
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,149
Cui Mingliang?

53
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,864
Lu Jinghuan?

54
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,389
Wang Xiaoling?

55
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,069
Zhang Xiaohong?

56
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,301
Zhong Ping?

57
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,108
Sun Lijuan?

58
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,426
Song Yongping?

59
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,268
- Cui Mingliang?
- In the toilet.

60
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,868
Slackers hog the toilet.

61
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,789
He's not a slacker!

62
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,225
Driver Xue, sound the horn.

63
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,460
- Zhang Jun, your trousers?
- Wearing them!

64
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,422
It's really cold!

65
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,542
- No, the other pair.
- Performance over?

66
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,185
Of course! I'm on the bus!

67
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,506
Are you?

68
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,987
- Aren't I?
- No discipline!

69
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,867
- Everyone was waiting!
- Are you in charge?

70
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,345
You understand collectivism?

71
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,748
Give me a break! I'm not that late.

72
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,140
- I didn't spoil the show.
- Didn't you?

73
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,988
You think you were okay?

74
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,306
- What do you think?
- I'm not bad.

75
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,023
What the hell were
those train sounds?

76
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,299
I don't know how a train sounds!

77
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,262
Never taken a train?

78
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,030
Even if you've never tasted pork,
you must have seen a pig!

79
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,583
I've only heard one!

80
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,306
Seen The Train Driver's Son?

81
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,466
Seen Railway Guerrillas?

82
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,946
I'm not a train driver's son.

83
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,625
Forget it, Mingliang.

84
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,979
Finished?

85
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,505
Let's move.

86
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,692
Ready yet, Mum?

87
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,371
Can't you make yourself useful?

88
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,056
More chores?
Have you asked Brother?

89
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,776
Who's older, you or him?

90
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,332
You should have had him first then.

91
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,737
Shouldn't have had you at all!

92
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,856
We're different!
I'm an art worker, I use my brain.

93
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,930
Really? Here, you follow orders.

94
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,773
Then I'll stop coming home.

95
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,609
Yes, society needs you, live outside!

96
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,251
- If you won't feed me, the Party will.
- Get out!

97
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,852
He slashed girls' trousers
with a razor.

98
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,973
He used to cut the girls too,
until he got more skilful.

99
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,057
Then the girls didn't notice...

100
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,898
...until they got home.

101
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,931
- Pretty bad.
- Your trousers, Zhang Jun.

102
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,769
The bottoms are so wide!
I could sweep the streets with them!

103
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,134
Didn't you see this boiling?

104
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,015
Where did you get those bellbottoms?

105
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,734
My Auntie got them in Guangzhou.

106
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,935
Your Auntie bought them for you?

107
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,094
They're trendy in the big cities,
you know.

108
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,773
Then you should go and live there!

109
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,015
I would if I could!

110
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,689
Mum, you should liberate
your thoughts!

111
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,050
You should try self-criticism!

112
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,048
Watch out they don't lock you all up.

113
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,974
Men need to let off steam!

114
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,854
No legwarmers? Catch your death, then.

115
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,413
Come on!

116
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,052
- Want a pair, Eryong?
- And get my legs cut?

117
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,535
Who'd want to do that, idiot?

118
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,450
Come on, help unload the logs.

119
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,139
Okay.

120
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,732
Your hat.

121
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,775
Hey!

122
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,409
- What are those trousers?
- Bellbottoms.

123
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,735
What?

124
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,976
Bellbottom trousers.

125
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,735
- Can you squat in them?
- Of course.

126
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,851
Show me.

127
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,259
Squat.

128
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,099
- See?
- Okay.

129
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,894
People can work in those trousers?

130
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,299
I'm an art worker, no manual work.

131
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,739
You sound more like
a capitalist roader.

132
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,489
I can't talk to you.

133
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,891
What's the time?

134
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,251
See, there they are.

135
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,775
Really?

136
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,609
Them? That Cui Mingliang
looks like a real idiot.

137
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,611
Why not teach him a lesson?

138
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,653
- Go on!
- I don't dare.

139
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,009
I do.

140
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,500
What time do you call this?

141
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,015
Sorry, my watch stopped.

142
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,573
Not smart enough?

143
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,895
Stupid!

144
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,409
- What are those trousers?
- Same as his.

145
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,971
Imitating others like a kid!

146
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,692
- They're in fashion.
- One good turn...

147
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,413
It's starting, it'll be sold out!

148
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,497
Buy the tickets!

149
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,134
Quick!

150
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,251
Go on!

151
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,812
Go on!

152
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,217
I'm a rambler

153
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,249
I'm a rambler

154
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,698
A rambler's fate is sad

155
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,091
I'm a rambler

156
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,817
I'm a rambler

157
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,257
I won't disguise who I am

158
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,938
I'm a rambler

159
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,892
Yin Ruijuan of the Cultural Team!

160
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,779
Someone wants you outside!

161
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,211
Yin Ruijuan of the Cultural Team!

162
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,854
Someone wants you outside!

163
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,375
Dad!

164
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,173
- Why are you here?
- I'm not with a crowd.

165
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,496
- Who are you with?
- Zhong Ping.

166
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,374
- Learn from good people!
- What do you mean?

167
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,698
Face the wall!

168
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,498
You're easily led,
always seeing foreign movies.

169
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,928
Cui Mingliang!

170
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,530
Sir.

171
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,731
You're seeing this film too.

172
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,972
Why have you come out?

173
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,614
- I have a report to write.
- Really?

174
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,173
I have to go.

175
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,178
You can write reports?

176
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,133
- Go back and watch it.
- No, I don't want to.

177
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,373
Then don't be late.

178
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,932
I don't believe him.

179
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,569
Wearing glasses
doesn't mean he can write!

180
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,010
He just blindly follows others!

181
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,292
Of course I'm judging by appearance!

182
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,697
I see hundreds at the station
every day.

183
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,778
I know a bad guy when I see one.

184
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,699
Coincidence!

185
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,970
No, I saw you.

186
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,368
I saw you too.

187
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,059
My father would too, let's go down.

188
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,808
Haven't you been with Zhong Ping?

189
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,651
Why should I have been?

190
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,332
Zhang Jun's family doesn't know yet?

191
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,458
They should by now.

192
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,095
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

193
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,413
Zhong Ping's family
seems to like Zhang Jun.

194
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,690
He ate at their place last night.

195
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,570
Your father goes too far sometimes.

196
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,018
- What do you mean?
- He's like a KGB man.

197
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,928
Don't say that, he is my dad.

198
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,852
Since Mum died, he's worried about me.

199
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,489
But he's like a military dictator!

200
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,539
Don't say that.

201
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,850
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Working.

202
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,376
Auntie wants me
to meet a man tomorrow.

203
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,258
A prospective husband?

204
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,416
They arrange the whole thing.

205
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,730
That's nice, to have it arranged.

206
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,688
Auntie says he's a dentist.

207
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,773
Great, a university graduate!

208
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,450
- Why are you so happy?
- Am I?

209
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,866
Where is Ulan Bator?

210
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,548
Capital of Outer Mongolia.

211
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,428
Where's Outer Mongolia?

212
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,459
Up north, past Inner Mongolia.

213
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,061
And further north?

214
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,182
USSR.

215
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,301
And further north?

216
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,867
The sea, I guess.

217
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,302
And further north?

218
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,820
What the fuck are you on about?

219
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,146
Further north is here, Fenyang.

220
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,784
18, Wujia Lane... Zhang Jun's house.

221
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,186
So we're all north of the sea.

222
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,220
"Romance... romance...

223
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,261
"What is romance?

224
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:10,308
"My soul is like a willow in March

225
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,387
"Romance... romance...

226
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,060
"What is romance?

227
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,746
"Who loves not romance?

228
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,622
"My thoughts ripen like fruit
in autumn"

229
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,465
You use this ruler for fighting?

230
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,426
Comics? How old are you?

231
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,944
Camelia? What's this Camelia?

232
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,061
She sells camelias.

233
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,703
"Through Marguerite's sad demise,
the book reveals...

234
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,946
"...the ugly face of capitalism
and the fact of moral hypocrisy.

235
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,583
"Marguerite has humble origins.

236
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,785
"To survive, she prostitutes herself
on the streets of Paris..."

237
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,901
Paris! Prostitute!

238
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,939
Eat!

239
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,509
Let him be, don't look for him.

240
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,860
"Slightly out of focus...
Slightly out of focus..."

241
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,829
Are you crazy?

242
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,543
Losing your temper?

243
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,502
Thinking about that dentist?

244
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,782
We could beat him up!

245
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,902
Smash out his teeth so badly...

246
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,907
...even he couldn't fix them!

247
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,263
Good plan?

248
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,340
I've been looking for you!

249
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,029
I told you we'd get haircuts!

250
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,746
Not you... Cui, you should watch
TV this evening.

251
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,224
I'm waiting for a haircut.

252
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,990
I see, very impressive!

253
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,465
Yin Ruijuan!

254
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,063
Let's go.

255
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,546
- What's on?
- Daredevil Garrison, I think.

256
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,899
Daredevil Garrison?

257
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,988
- Supposed to be good.
- War film?

258
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,988
Come on, Zhang Jun.

259
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,509
You weren't asking me.

260
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,223
Shut up and come along.

261
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,465
Quick!

262
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,785
Come!

263
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,744
Cui Mingliang!

264
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,427
Come on, Eryong.

265
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,349
Are you sick?

266
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,947
Still taking the works bus home?

267
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,547
- Any plans tonight?
- Yes.

268
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,544
- You had a perm.
- Yes.

269
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,183
Looks good!

270
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,148
I'll be going, then.

271
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,708
- You go ahead!
- Okay.

272
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,828
Go on, Xu is waiting for us.

273
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,067
You were taking your time with her.

274
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,828
I had to let her finish.

275
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,298
Plenty to say to her, but not to me.

276
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,104
- We see each other every day!
- So?

277
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,218
Come on.

278
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,464
You're angry again.

279
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,342
No, I'm not.

280
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,348
What's upsetting you?

281
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,703
You are... all your socialising
with girls.

282
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,104
We all have pasts, you know.

283
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,902
Is that wrong?

284
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,463
Didn't someone say you should love
a person completely...

285
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,310
...including his past?

286
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,264
- Who said that?
- Who?

287
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,940
A friend... Pushkin.

288
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,910
He thinks I should love
that girl Han too?

289
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,066
Maybe you can leave that to me.

290
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,862
I'll beat you to death!

291
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,224
We'll meet again in twenty years

292
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,228
How beautiful
our great Motherland will be

293
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,149
The sky is new, the earth is new

294
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,625
City and village alike will glow

295
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,186
Young friends,
this spring will be yours

296
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,699
Yours and mine

297
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,425
The new generation of the 1980s!

298
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:23,422
The new generation of the 1980s!

299
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,625
We'll meet again in twenty years...

300
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,788
With 8 or 9 wives
and hordes of kids!

301
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,821
Settle down, everyone.

302
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,823
We need to talk.

303
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,780
Zhang Jun, stand up.

304
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,305
Sing us "Young Friends Gather".

305
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,258
I'm no vocalist.

306
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,540
Never mind, sing it.

307
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,346
Young friends gathering today

308
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,508
Rowing little boats
in the bright spring...

309
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,779
That's enough!

310
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,343
Quiet!

311
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,141
What were you singing in the truck?

312
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,619
I wasn't leading it.

313
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,264
No? I heard you!

314
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,825
You were the loudest.

315
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,464
What was it?

316
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,149
Is this a punishment?

317
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,706
Calm down, our priority is unity!

318
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,062
Unity?

319
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,469
I heard it was you.

320
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,865
- I don't know.
- Don't know?

321
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,983
- Who else then?
- Don't know.

322
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,945
Me.

323
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,382
You again?

324
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,666
Okay, sing it for us.

325
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,024
We'll meet again in twenty years

326
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,380
With 8 or 9 wives
and hordes of kids

327
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,743
Stop! What are you singing?

328
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,586
When is twenty years from now?

329
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,184
2000.

330
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,383
Where will our country be by then?

331
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,023
The 4 Modernisations: Industry,
Agriculture, Defence and Science.

332
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,702
And what are your goals?

333
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,738
Several wives, hordes of kids?

334
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,580
We practice monogamy.

335
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,542
Several wives?

336
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,504
Like landowners before Liberation?

337
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,820
You think you could handle that?

338
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,382
And hordes of kids?

339
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,743
We practice family planning...
heard of birth control?

340
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,583
It's just a song.

341
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,266
Where's your discipline?

342
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,150
Yes, there's the Open Door policy.

343
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,946
But reforms are still needed.

344
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,064
Think about it.

345
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,908
Okay, I'll reform.

346
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,744
"Long live birth control!

347
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,465
"One child's enough!

348
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,585
"Long live birth control!

349
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,670
"One child's enough!"

350
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,059
Come on in.

351
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,660
- What's wrong?
- Forget it.

352
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,823
Don't want a perm after all?

353
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,300
It'll look good.

354
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,625
What if it doesn't?

355
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,106
It will! Do it for me!

356
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,699
Come on, if Han dares to...

357
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,947
- Say that again!
- No, no.

358
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,701
- Anybody there?
- No.

359
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,943
Boss, where are you from?

360
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,664
- The south.
- Where?

361
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,269
Wenzhou.

362
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,868
Far from Guangzhou?

363
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,504
Around 400 km.

364
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,063
That far!

365
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,223
You want to go south?

366
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,386
Yeah, my Auntie lives there.

367
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,104
- It's nice there.
- Really?

368
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,268
Can you turn it off now?

369
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,267
7 or 8 minutes more.

370
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,586
Be patient, perms take time.

371
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,702
- I don't want curls.
- It'll look great.

372
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,109
Really.

373
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,149
You'll look just like that poster.

374
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,059
Quiet!

375
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,104
The agenda is programme reform.

376
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,146
We'll introduce some pop music.

377
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,741
We've invited someone from town
to guide us.

378
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:49,346
Maybe some of you don't like it.

379
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,387
But it's been popular in the cities
for a while

380
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,384
and there have been
heated debates there.

381
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,746
My feeling is...

382
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,865
...pop music is relaxing and...

383
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,429
What?

384
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,229
Nothing.

385
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:29,501
I see Zhong Ping has a perm.

386
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,940
Very up-to-date.

387
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,664
She looks like a Spanish girl!

388
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,782
She could dance flamenco!

389
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,545
It would look great!

390
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:43,821
The 5th National Assembly
announces the rehabilitation...

391
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,099
...of Comrade Liu Shaoqi.

392
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,588
The Party resolves to return
to the bases of Mao Zedong Thought.

393
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,944
Under the flag
of Mao Zedong Thought,

394
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,069
onward to final victory!

395
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:07,789
Honour to Comrade Liu Shaoqi!

396
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,949
"Following the same trail,
leading to the tree...

397
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:20,268
"The morning sun lights my face
and the leafy branches

398
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,382
"Dear companion, dear tree!

399
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,267
"Spring stream on the border

400
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,826
"Clear and pure

401
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,427
"Songs of the border...

402
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:41,023
"...warm the heart...

403
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,102
"The harbour nights...

404
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,019
"...are so peaceful

405
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,700
"Waves gently rock the battleship"

406
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,145
Zhong Ping!

407
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,345
You know who's being charged?

408
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,705
- Who?
- Piggy.

409
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,140
- What did he get?
- Death penalty!

410
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,628
His mother must be sad.

411
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,588
Serves him right!
One less scumbag, who cares?

412
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,707
- Many watching?
- Lots.

413
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,423
It was packed.

414
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,827
I was just passing by.

415
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,902
Nearly finished?

416
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,427
- Too big?
- About right.

417
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,586
I taught you to cross-stitch!

418
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,623
It's too hard to do.

419
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,822
This is out of fashion, you know.

420
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,942
Never mind.

421
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,106
I'm always wrong.

422
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,102
Did you see him die?

423
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,140
No.

424
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,623
I don't know where they do it.

425
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,739
The police shoot them from behind.

426
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,545
Their brains must splash out...

427
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,423
Don't! It's gross!

428
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,666
Everyone watches.

429
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,587
What's up?

430
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,146
You're smoking?

431
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,386
- No thanks.
- Try one.

432
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,029
Won't your father be angry?

433
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,948
He's out at work.

434
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,260
- Okay?
- Fine.

435
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,028
Are you choking?

436
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,188
I think Lai has a crush on you.

437
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,979
Me? He fancies you!

438
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,589
No way!

439
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,342
Lai is very choosy.

440
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,629
Yes, but that post-office girl
dumped him.

441
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,422
Who dumped who?

442
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,708
She dumped him!

443
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,424
- I didn't know.
- Six months ago!

444
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,699
No-one's better than Zhang Jun.

445
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,505
Think so?

446
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,901
Then you can have him.

447
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,585
I wouldn't dare.

448
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,389
What do you think he's doing now?

449
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,301
Probably thinking of you.

450
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,943
Not necessarily.

451
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,306
I'm not thinking of him!

452
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,225
You have tears in your eyes!

453
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,784
That's smoke.

454
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,859
You've made up your eyebrows!

455
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,789
For Zhang Jun? It looks awful!

456
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,749
No it doesn't.

457
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,349
It's the latest style.

458
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,859
- Awful!
- No, it's not.

459
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,585
Don't do mine!

460
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,463
Stop it! It looks awful.

461
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,785
Shut up!

462
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,823
- Mine look awful?
- Yes!

463
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,419
Take care!

464
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,468
Will you shut up?

465
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,622
This will make you look
so fashionable.

466
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,707
Who cares? That's enough.

467
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,346
Don't move! Just a moment...

468
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,269
Hang on...

469
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,745
Wait till I've finished.

470
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,588
It hurts! Mind your cigarette!

471
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,499
Been with her all afternoon?

472
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,745
Just chatting.

473
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,100
About me?

474
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,868
A bit.

475
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,139
Saying what?

476
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,544
Good things.

477
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,028
That's fine.

478
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,902
Zhong Ping's been strange lately.

479
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,780
Why? Because of Zhang Jun?

480
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,548
Don't think so.

481
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,781
She'll be okay.

482
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,623
What do you know?

483
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,265
- What don't I know?
- You think you know it all.

484
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,903
Someone asked me yesterday...

485
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,830
...whether you're my girlfriend.

486
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,063
Are you?

487
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,905
Why are people so nosy?

488
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,109
I want to know too.

489
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,309
I don't know.

490
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,064
Oh, there's some post for you.

491
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,220
For me?

492
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,341
By the window.

493
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,303
Mingliang: The outside world
is great! Zhang Jun, in Guangzhou

494
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,426
We're so happy on vacation

495
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,829
in the countryside with friends

496
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,467
Light rain is falling...

497
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:50,906
I, Zhang Di, am always asked...

498
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:56,138
...if Taiwan girls are better than
Singapore girls

499
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,225
Mingliang!

500
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,468
Stop! Foreign devil!

501
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:07,304
- Doing well now?
- When did you get back?

502
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,499
This afternoon.

503
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,905
So soon?

504
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,619
You bought a tape player?

505
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,707
- Who's that?
- Zhang Di.

506
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,429
Who?

507
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,143
He's very popular.

508
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,103
More than Teresa Teng.

509
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,824
Let me see.

510
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,858
How's the big, wide world?

511
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,065
Pretty good.

512
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,022
Come on, tell me about it.

513
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,828
Everyone's busy all day.

514
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,179
Zhang Jun!

515
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,142
You're back!

516
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,541
How are you doing?

517
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,500
How's southern food?

518
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,469
Okay... the food here's better.

519
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,709
Zhong Ping!

520
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,746
Can I hear it?

521
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,942
How do you open it?

522
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,029
Careful, don't break it!

523
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,069
The sandstorm blows, but we sing on

524
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:57,748
We friends have no cares
in the world

525
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,467
Our cattle and horses are strong

526
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,628
We sit proud in the saddle

527
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:11,426
We warm the world with our light!

528
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,422
Gen... Gen... Genghis Khan

529
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:27,589
Nothing can stop me,
know where I'm going...

530
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,499
An electric alarm might be better.

531
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:07,065
It's not to keep out villains.

532
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,942
Who's a villain?

533
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,382
We had a thief once.

534
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,189
He must have been hungry,
he took two eggs.

535
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,629
It takes all sorts.

536
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,102
It's so hot!

537
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,823
Where is happiness?

538
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,906
Cui Mingliang, what's upset you?

539
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,783
Who says I'm upset?

540
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,629
Yin Ruijuan.

541
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,903
- What did she say?
- She says you're sick.

542
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,589
Why doesn't she tell me?

543
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,468
She doesn't dare.

544
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,025
- Why not?
- Because you're sick!

545
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,948
Can't you act normal?

546
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,822
I'm normal enough.

547
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:58,502
Calm down and talk to me!
Anyhow, she's a girl.

548
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,988
- It's useless.
- Idiot!

549
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,621
Talk to her then.

550
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,787
You've upset her, don't you care?

551
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,588
Hi, Uncle!

552
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,986
- Visiting?
- A washing machine?

553
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,943
- Just bought it.
- We'll bring our washing over!

554
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:25,066
Seize the moment, talk to her.

555
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:46,186
In all this time, I've never really
thought of you as my boyfriend.

556
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:56,741
I was taken aback
when you brought it up the other day.

557
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,309
You didn't notice.

558
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,861
I've been thinking...

559
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,538
I feel... we're not a good match.

560
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,781
And my dad doesn't like you.

561
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,027
I didn't dare to tell you before.

562
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,339
Of course,
Dad's not the main problem.

563
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:38,263
It's me who feels
we're not a good match.

564
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:49,021
Incompatible.

565
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,103
We can still see each other...

566
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,551
You're right,
but you know what's wrong?

567
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,952
You're saying it too late.

568
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,911
Cui Mingliang...

569
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:17,839
Bus 27 to Songjiachuan...

570
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,599
...is ready to depart.

571
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,327
Wen isn't stupid, is he?

572
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,405
He made his own TV in two days.

573
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,000
Why is ours taking so long?

574
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,088
No money this month,
I bought a guitar.

575
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,399
What's up?

576
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,880
Cui Wanlin, come inside!

577
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,883
What is it?

578
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,521
I'll say this in front of our sons.

579
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,724
You took that from my bag?

580
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:01,002
Who did you buy this for?

581
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,729
Erbo wants it for his wife.

582
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:11,242
You never buy anything for us
on your trips!

583
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,284
But you never forget that bitch!

584
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,606
Mum, let him explain.

585
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,368
I won't listen.

586
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,288
It's not your business.

587
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:28,405
Father, I'm 24,
I know as much as you do.

588
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:32,042
- Are you rebelling?
- What if I am?

589
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,297
I have a little secret

590
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,054
I want to tell you

591
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:12,770
It's something buried in my heart

592
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,730
Here it comes!

593
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,448
Don't miss!

594
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,534
Let's leave.

595
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,572
How can I face them?

596
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,772
Scared?

597
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,850
If you are, let's leave.

598
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:25,170
Let's talk it over with our parents.

599
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,855
Be serious.

600
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,775
Chief, you were stationed here?

601
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,574
That's right, I was here for years.

602
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,817
Close by, in a place
for all of us lot from the city.

603
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,419
It's not bad here.

604
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:05,535
Yes, quite prosperous,
you can tell from this hospital.

605
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:11,140
Thanks a lot, Dr Liang.

606
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,895
Too much trouble.

607
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,058
Don't say anything,
you're almost family.

608
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,298
So, we're ready.

609
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,608
Let's do it then.

610
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:41,251
What's wrong?
Don't give me a headache.

611
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,171
Chief, what do you think of
privatisation?

612
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,699
I'm not sure yet.

613
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,372
To be frank, it's very simple.

614
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:57,972
If you have money,
you can privatise.

615
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,889
Everything's yours:
the actors, the equipment...

616
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:03,689
Good business!

617
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,697
If I do it, you'll be mine!

618
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:11,450
Maybe not...
but are you considering it?

619
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,052
Most team members are.

620
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:19,015
Don't miss your chance.

621
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:23,058
Many have longed for this chance.

622
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,378
Mr Xu, your friend's girl says
she doesn't want it.

623
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,056
I'm scared.

624
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,617
Of course I'm scared.

625
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,299
No abortion.

626
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,617
I don't want it any more.

627
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,378
Then what do you want?

628
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,772
Go on in!

629
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,618
Fuck you!

630
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:20,898
To celebrate the 35th Anniversary of
the People's Republic of China...

631
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:26,209
...the armed forces will salute
Deng Xiaoping in march-past...

632
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:04,060
We must resolve
the privatisation issue today.

633
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:10,935
The terms on offer are attractive.

634
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:18,098
Better than many other communes,
you can check for yourselves.

635
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,892
The asking price isn't that high.

636
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,131
So what do you all think?

637
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,898
Li Hongyun! Just smoking?

638
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,012
This has been pending for months.

639
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:42,818
If you still hesitate,
what hope is there for reform?

640
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,216
My wife won't agree!
It's like the Sino-British Talks...

641
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,940
Your wife's become an Iron Lady?

642
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,779
Inflexible!

643
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:59,379
Don't criticise his wife! Li Yang,
what are your thoughts?

644
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,540
You're always harassing me about this.

645
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,493
Why are you so quiet now?

646
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,691
The key thing is the money.

647
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,700
I can't raise that much.

648
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:18,010
It's not all that much.

649
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,013
The commune knows you're not rich.

650
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:26,370
Chief, you're so keen
to get rid of us.

651
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,617
To sell us out!

652
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,971
How could I bear to do that?

653
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,330
I'm selling my own job here!

654
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,771
Okay, I'll help you out,
I'll accept the offer.

655
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,413
Really, Song?

656
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,134
What a relief!

657
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:05,094
Are you going to follow Song?

658
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,775
He'll be our leader.

659
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,496
And you'll be his advisor.

660
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,975
- Are you leaving?
- Aren't you?

661
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,978
No, my father is ill.

662
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,535
Zhang Jun, stop playing.

663
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,938
I'm staying.

664
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,093
I'm waiting for you!

665
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,772
I'd rather open a store.

666
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,572
Zhong Ping...

667
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,609
- I'll teach you mahjong.
- Don't.

668
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,290
- I'm playing for you.
- Stop!

669
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,649
Zhang Jun, stop playing!

670
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,579
Stop shouting, just play.

671
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:55,178
- What's with you?
- Mind your business.

672
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,254
Just play.

673
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,291
Your turn.

674
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,819
Nine!

675
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,571
Zhang Jun!

676
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,494
Very close...

677
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,338
...very far.

678
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,055
Just wait a bit.

679
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,937
We're almost done.

680
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:11,733
- Do me a favour.
- What is it?

681
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,775
I promised to say goodbye
but I can't.

682
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,258
Tell them not to wait for me.

683
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,612
Unload it all there.

684
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,133
Can you imitate a rooster's crow?

685
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,019
Just copy me, okay?

686
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,170
Zhang Jun, come and eat!

687
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,459
What is it?

688
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,179
Any water?

689
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,655
- Why?
- To wash my hands.

690
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,418
Really?

691
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,576
Sanming, water.

692
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,328
Thanks.

693
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:44,057
A bit more.

694
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,339
Me too.

695
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,059
Cousin...

696
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,299
I'm Sanming.

697
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:31,413
Sanming, I didn't recognise you!

698
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,736
You have a moustache now!

699
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:37,137
It's been a while!

700
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,491
I was about to go looking for you!

701
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,059
How's your mother?

702
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,612
I'll go see her after we've eaten.

703
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,378
Tell her we're coming, okay?

704
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,657
I'll eat first.

705
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,894
No, either the girl won't
have him...

706
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,456
...or we won't have her.

707
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,015
Sanming will have a hard life.

708
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,691
He'll need a good wife.

709
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,495
No-one stupid or handicapped.

710
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,210
He'll work in the coalmine.

711
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:33,088
Wenying is still studying.

712
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:37,055
That's good, but it costs too much.

713
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,809
And it's getting more expensive!

714
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:45,418
Sanming alone can't earn enough.

715
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:49,890
She'll have to come back, to work.

716
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,456
Pity, she's studied for 2 years.

717
01:14:53,660 --> 01:15:00,259
Right... I'll keep going here
for as long as I can...

718
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,612
We'll save up to keep her there.

719
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,373
But if we fail,
she'll have to come home.

720
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,251
She's still young.

721
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,218
She should study.

722
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:26,016
The only work here is
in the fields and down the mine.

723
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:31,214
She'd do better in education.

724
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,729
But we're almost starving here.
