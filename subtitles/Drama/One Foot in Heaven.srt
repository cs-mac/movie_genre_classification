God help her,
He's a terrible cross to the poor woman,

What would he know?

Ma, Ma, Christy picked up the chalk,

There's something in that,

Nah, don't be gettin' notions

He'll play in that all day now,

00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,910
He can go out with the other boys now,

- What's that?
- That's her thing,

134
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,190
You put your thing in there
for a half an hour and you get a baby,

135
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,190
If you do it for an hour you get twins,

My cousin's a twin,

Are you deaf? Come in for your tea!

142
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,270
- Hide it under Christy,
- Are yis all deaf?

143
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,910
I've been calling you for 20 minutes
to come in for your tea,

144
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,710
- It's OK, Mam, we'll take him in,
- Well, take him in now,

145
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,310
It's been on the table

See?

147
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,710
Why won't he go to bed?

148
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,110
He loves that oul' chariot,

149
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,150
Come on, get him up,
I want to go and have a pint,

150
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,710
Come on, Christy,
It's way past your bedtime,

It's nearly closin' time,

152
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,790
Now, son, you know
you can never get out of hell,

153
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,670
You can get out of purgatory,
but you can never get out of hell,

154
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,030
Do you know that?

155
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,110
Do you?

156
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,350
Mrs Brown?

157
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,510
I don't think you should
bring him to the altar just yet,

158
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,710
You've been very helpful, Father,

159
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:18,230
Do you know about All Souls' Night?
Did I ever tell you about that?

160

It's a really special night, Every time
you light a candle on All Souls' Night,

161
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,230
and you have to say five Our Fathers
and five Hail Marys and five Glory Be's,

162
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,030
and then a soul flies up
out of the flames of purgatory

163
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,630
and goes straight up to heaven,

164
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,390
Say some prayers
for the poor souls in purgatory,

165

He's been like that for three days, I don't
know what's wrong, he won't talk to me,

474
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:43,590
Go on up and see him, Go on,

475
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,550
<i>(knocking)</i>

476
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,790
I've brought you a present,

477
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,990
Thanks,

478
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,070
There's a speech in there
I'd love you to look at,

479
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,990
<i>It's "To be, or not to be", Hamlet.</i>

480
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,990
I wish you'd stop
feeling sorry for yourself,

481
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,550
You know, I don't want
to be a failure either,

482
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,630
Will you have a look at it for me?

483
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,710
Maybe,

484
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:52,350
<i>(Christy) To be...</i>

485
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,390
or not to be...

486
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:05,070
To be, or not to be,

487
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,030
that is the question,

488
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:12,270
To be, or not...

489
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,750
<i>(Christy continues, unclear)</i>

490
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:23,390
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

491
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,350
<i>(Christy continues)</i>

492
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:32,870
To be, or not to be,

493
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,070
that is the question,

494
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,270
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

495
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,030
to have to fuckin' suffer listenin' to that...

496
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,230
He's in love with this girl Eileen,

497
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,590
Well, so long as he's gettin' better,

498
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,910
Could get hurt, Paddy,

499
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,470
A broken body's nothin'
to a broken heart,

500
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:22,550
<i>- (knocking)
- Yeah,</i>

501
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,710
Eileen, How's it goin'?

502
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,910
Very, very well,

503
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,270
- I've got some news for you,
- What?

504
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,230
Well, remember I told you
about Peter and his gallery?

505
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,110
Well, he's offered you
an exhibition of your own,

506
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,110
What do you think about that?

507
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,470
- I think you're brilliant,
- Yeah,

508
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,350
I'm only as brilliant as my patients,

509
00:58:55,070 --> 00:59:02,910
<i>(Christy),,consummation devoutly
to be wish'd, To die, to sleep...</i>

510
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,230
...to sleep, perchance to dream...

511
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,870
- Is that our Christy up there?
- What?

512
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:20,190
Does that sound like our Christy?

513
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,750
Sounds a lot better,

514
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,430
Not to me, it doesn't,

515
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:32,230
Are ya mad, woman? You can
understand your child for the first time,

516
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:37,190
- I always understood him,
- Ah, well, nobody else ever did,

517
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,790
At least he can function now,

518
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:45,190
There's somethin' in that voice that...
that disturbs me,

519
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,870
What do you mean?

520
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,110
Too much hope in it,

521
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,150
What?

522
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,670
There's too much hope in it,

523
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,790
"...fly to others that we know not of?"

524
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:09,230
"Thus conscience
doth make cowards of us all..."

525
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,030
- "And thus the native hue..."
- "And thus the native hue of resolution

526
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,390
is sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought,

527
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:21,190
and enterprises of great pitch
and moment with this regard

528
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:25,030
their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action,"

529
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,550
What do you think about Hamlet?

530
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:31,270
A cripple, Can't act,

531
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,430
- He did in the end,
- Too late,

532
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,830
Eileen...

533
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,590
I like you very much,

534
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:52,030
And I like you, Christy,
You've the heart of a poet,

535
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,990
No...

536
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,710
Well...

537
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,670
What?

538
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,350
Nothin',

539
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,190
I'd better go,

540
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,910
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you,

541
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:31,710
It gives me great pleasure to open this
exhibition of the work of Christy Brown,

542
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,590
A lot of people say that Christy
is a great crippled painter,

543
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:41,630
- I think that's an insult to Christy,
- That's right,

544
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:44,390
Christy is simply a great painter, full stop,

545
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:49,990
He has struggled with his material,
as every painter must do,

546
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:52,430
to bring it under control,

547
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:56,550
If you look around the walls today,

548
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,910
you'll see the forces
that shaped Christy Brown,

549
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:03,030
His mother,

550
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,790
His father, His brothers and sisters,

551
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,790
And the lady who brought him
to public recognition, Dr Eileen Cole,

552
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,070
Yes!

553
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,390
What do you think...

554
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:30,710
There's only two kinds of painting:

555
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,350
religious and the circus,

556
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,310
<i>(laughter)</i>

557
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,310
Give us a drink,

558
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,030
You know, on each side of the mouth...

559
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,310
There you are,

560
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,590
And you've had enough to drink,
D'you hear me?

561
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:15,550
I'm all right, I'm goin' for a meal, Ma,
Are you comin'?

562
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:19,590
No, no, I'm... I'll take your father home,
He's not feeling well,

563
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:23,430
There's no pints, you mean,
It's good wine, tell him,

564
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:27,830
Your father never drank anything but pints
in his life, No, I'll take him home,

565
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:31,510
- You gettin' a taxi?
- Eileen's givin' us a lift,

566
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,510
Right,

567
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:35,430
- I'll see ya later, Mam,
- I'll see ya later,

568
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:41,110
I think Mulcahy is a great painter,

569
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,790
Inside, Soul,

570
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:46,190
You see? I agree with Christy,

571
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:50,230
No, He's too uncontrolled for me,

572
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:54,870
Ah, Let Christy try the wine,

573
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:08,030
<i>Intro ibo ad altare Dei.</i>

574
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,630
- What's he saying?
- The Latin mass,

575
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:16,790
I thought it was James Joyce,
The wine's A1 ,

576
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:21,310
- Can you tell us which year it is, Christy?
- I'm not that sophisticated,

577
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,270
Not yet,

578
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,510
I love you, Eileen,

579
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:49,830
- And I love you, Christy,
- No, I really love you,

580
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,150
I love you all,

581
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,550
- That's good,
- I even love Peter,

582
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,390
<i>(laughter)</i>

583
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:15,190
Well, I'm glad you like Peter, because
we're going to get married in six months,

584
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,110
Well, Christy, what do you think of that?

585
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,230
<i>(loudly) Con...</i>

586

lations, Peter and Eileen,

592
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,510
on the wonder...

593
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:09,670
wonderful news,

594
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:26,310
I'm glad you taught me how to speak...
so I could say that, Eileen,

595
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,670
Thanks, Christy,

596
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:38,990
Well, where were we then?

597
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,630
- Discussing Mulcahy,
- Mulcahy is empty,

598
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:46,470
- I thought you said he was full of soul,
- I said he was empty, Whiskey!

599
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:51,310
Take it easy, Christy,

600
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:57,430
You're not my mother,

601
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,350
Never forget that,

602
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:22,470
<i>And you know, I know what age that is,</i>

603
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,470
That's ten-year-old,

604
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:30,790
Same age as me,

605
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,910
- Don't give him any more,
- Pour,

606
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:37,390
- Take that whiskey from him, Tony,
- Touch it, and I'll kick you

607
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:44,550
in the only part of your anatomy
that's animated,

608
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,350
Stop it,

609
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:58,670
Why did you say you loved me?

610
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:03,390
- Because I do love you,
- Ah, you mean platonic love,

611
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:10,150
I've had nothing but platonic love
all me life,

612
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:14,030
Do you know what I say? Fuck Plato!

613
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:20,350
Fuck all love that is not
100 percent commitment!

614
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,470
Pour,

615
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:37,510
- I can't let you go any further,
- Let's discuss nature,

616
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,790
- Christy...
- What are you going to do about it, Peter?

617
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:45,630
You're a nice man,
What are you going to do about it?

618
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,470
Peter, sit down,

619
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:51,830
I'm gonna wheel you
out of this restaurant,

620
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:58,070
Wheel out the cripple! Wheel out...

621
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,790
Stop, Stop it,

622
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:03,270
Where's the feckin' brake
on this stupid thing?!

623
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,590
Stop it! Stop it!

624
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,310
Stop it, you bastard, stop it!

625
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:25,950
Sharon!

626
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:29,470
Sharon? Come on in
for your tea, will ya?

627
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:34,590
Sharon, come in now
for your tea, please, Come on,

628
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,790
All right, all right, Ma,

629
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:14,990
Get up, Christy,

630
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:19,270
You've got a hangover,
that's all that's wrong with ya,

631
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:27,710
You get more like your father every day,

632
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:32,190
All hard on the outside
and putty on the inside,

633
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:36,510
<i>It's in here battles are won,</i>

634
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:43,150
Not in the pub, pretending
to be a big fella in front of the lads,

635
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,790
Right, if you've given up, I haven't,

636
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,190
What do you think you're doin', Mam?

637
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:50,830
Buildin' a room for ya,

638
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,630
Don't be mad,

639
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:58,270
Maybe if you have a room of your own,
you might start paintin' again,

640
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:10,430
You have me heart broken, Christy Brown,

641
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:14,790
<i>Sometimes I think you are me heart,</i>

642
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:20,550
Look, if I could give you my legs,
I would gladly take yours,

643
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,950
What's wrong with you, Christy?

644
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,670
I'm sorry, Mam,

645
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,870
What in the name of God
is goin' on here?

646
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:52,350
Christy and me is buildin' a room,

647
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:55,710
- Yis are buildin' a room?
- Yeah,

648
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,830
Will ya have a look at this?

649
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:08,630
Ah, Christy, you may be a great painter,
but you'll never be a brickie,

650
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,990
Fair play to ya, missus,

651
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:15,710
Right, lads, You bring in some
more bricks, mix up a bit of muck,

652
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:21,390
Bring me in me level, will ya? Brown
and Son contractors are on the job,

653
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:26,630
Here, you start there, I'll start here, and
by the time you have three courses up

654
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:30,350
- I'll be finished and havin' me tea,
- Not at all!

655
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,230
Water, More water,

656
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:38,030
I'm not beaten yet, bejasus!

657
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:46,510
Listen, Brian, boys, listen to me,
Let your father win, He needs it,

658
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:50,790
Here, Take it easy, Father, will ya?

659
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:51,830
<i>(Paddy laughs)</i>

660
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:53,790
Take it easy!

661
01:14:54,790 --> 01:15:00,030
Sure I was never able to take it easy,
And you, of all people, ought to know that,

662
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,830
Right, lads?

663
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:06,270
That's her finished,

664
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:12,510
They've a long way to go
to be a better man than their father,

665
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:27,110
Well, Christy, that's the nearest
he'll ever come to sayin' he loves you,

666
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:42,030
I'm parched, I'm going to make a nice
cup of tea, and I have a cherry cake here,

667
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:44,030
Oh, Christy!

668
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:50,350
I'll just put the kettle on and get
the cherry log, and we'll be away,

669
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:55,990
Ah, come on, who's in there?
Those kids, their tomfoolery!

670
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:59,270
- What's happening?
- Ah, come on, let me in!

671
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:01,990
What's goin' on?

672
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,790
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Christy!
- What?

673
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:08,150
Your father's lying on the floor
and I can't open the door,

674
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,630
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Paddy!
Christy, I can't open the door!

675
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:24,070
- Get out the way, Mam,
- I can't open the door, Oh, Jesus...

676
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,630
Push, Christy, push!

677
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:39,630
Paddy? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
Paddy!

678
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,630
<i>(sobs)</i>

679
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:49,910
Seven pounds five shillings and sixpence
he owed, missus,

680
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:55,790
And whenever there was
a bit of a scrimmage

681
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,830
I was the toughest of all

682
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:02,990
Sure I was the toughest of all

683
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:06,510
Fair play to ya, Christy,

684
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:11,230
- Drinks for everyone,
- Take it easy, Christy,

685
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:15,110
Get some drinks in, Get one
for Sadie, shut the oul' bitch up,

686
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:17,670
Fair play to ya,
Your oul' fella will never be dead,

687
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,230
How's me ma going to survive?

688
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:23,910
Don't be worryin' about that,
We'll be all right,

689
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:29,590
Terry, will ya tell us
about when you and me oul' fella

690
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:33,030
carried the foreman
up the ladder, will ya?

691
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,430
- Later,
- Yeah...

692
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:45,350
Give us a song, somebody,
for Jesus' sake! Tom, give us a song,

693
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:48,550
Christy... Sing Paddy's favorite
for me, would ya?

694
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:50,510
All right, yeah,

695
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:59,630
It was down the glen one Easter morn

696
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,950
To a city fair rode I

697
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:10,270
There armored lines of marching men

698
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,630
In squadrons passed me by

699
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:15,070
Will somebody shut him up?

700
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:17,710
No fife did hum

701
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:24,990
No battle drum did sound its loud tattoo

702
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:29,310
And the Angelus bell
o'er the Liffey's swell

703
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:34,670
- You'll have to keep it down a bit, lads,
- Rang out in the foggy dew

704
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:40,590
- He was singin' that for his father,
- His father was nothin' but a mouth,

705
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,910
Like all the Browns,

706
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:49,190
All right, lads, take it easy,

707
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,510
In respect for Da,

708
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:04,430
I don't fight cripples,

709
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:12,990
Wreck the pub!

710
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,030
Come on!

711
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:25,310
Somebody get the till!
Get the till, get the money!

712
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:28,710
Get the till!

713
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:37,550
Drinks are on the house!

714
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,270
That's great, Christy,

715
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:55,270
- No, it's not,
- Why not?

716
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:58,430
It's not there, I've no eye,

717
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:02,430
- What?
- I'm not a painter,

718
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:07,670
I think it's brilliant, It's the image of Da,

719
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:18,150
- Poor Tom, what?
- Yeah,

720
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:24,110
"All is nothing,
Therefore nothing must end,"

721
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:28,150
- What's all this, Christy?
- Nothing,

722
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:30,270
Sorry I asked,

723
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,590
Benny, would you help us?

724
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:42,910
- Doin' what?
- Writin',

725
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,590
Yeah, Writin' what?

726
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:48,830
Me own story,

727
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:52,430
Yeah, Course I will,

728
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:59,750
Don't worry, Christy, the book is... great,

729
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:02,590
Well, it's not bad,

730
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:05,510
Do you know what I was going to call it?

731
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:08,870
<i>- What?
- The Reminiscences...</i>

732
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:12,710
Reminiscences?

733
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:15,630
<i>... of a Mental Defective.</i>

734
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:21,590
- That's a terrible title,
- It was my blue period,

735
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,510
And you typed all of it with your left foot?

736
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,950
I didn't do it with me nose,

737
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:36,870
- I really wanted to finish it,
- You'll hear it later,

738
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:39,590
I have an appointment, I told you,

739
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,870
Is he good-lookin'?

740
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:45,790
- Who?
- Your appointment,

741
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:49,670
Yeah, in his own way, he's nice,

742
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:55,310
Oh, it doesn't matter to me,
You can meet who you like,

743
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:58,910
But is he, now?

744
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:01,670
- What?
- Is he good-lookin'?

745
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:06,790
Yeah,

746
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:12,270
Are you in love with him?

747
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:23,390
You're very bloody nosy, Christy Brown,

748
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:25,590
I was only askin',

749
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:32,270
Would you like a drink?

750
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:35,030
- I'm workin', I can't,
- Later,

751
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,550
- I have a date, I told ya,
- Yeah, I forgot,

752
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:55,310
- You're a fast worker, aren't ya?
- Read your book,

753
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:10,470
I can't with you starin' at me,

754
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:13,110
I'll look away,

755
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,390
Oh, God...

756
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:32,190
- She's very pretty, isn't she?
- Prettier than that bloody picture,

757
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,870
Who's in there?

758
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:43,550
Ma, are you in?

759
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,630
Go on, then,

760
01:23:57,230 --> 01:24:00,030
Jesus! £800, Christy,

761
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:06,830
That was scrumptious, Ma, Like you,

762
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:11,270
I fancy somethin' sweet now,
What have you for dessert, Mam?

763
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:14,310
- Mam, what have you for dessert?
- Dessert?!

764
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:18,870
Kids, kids, do you not fancy
a drop of ice cream now?

765
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:22,750
- Yeah, ice cream, Mam!
- Yeah, Mam, get some ice cream,

766
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,750
Some raspberry ripple,
No, get us some Neapolitan,

767
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,470
All right!

768
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:32,510
- All right, all right, yeah,
- The pink and green stuff,

769
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:37,350
But just this once, mind, I've more things
to spend me money on than ice cream,

770
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,350
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, what's this?!

771
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,550
- What's this?
- Christy's money,

772
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:01,670
Bring it out and count it,

773
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:05,550
£800,

774
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:12,390
That's more money than your poor father
ever earned in a whole year,

775
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,350
I can't take it,

776
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:19,030
It's for you, It's yours,

777
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,950
I can't take it, son,

778
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:28,590
Da was a bricklayer, Ma, and I'm a writer,

779
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:30,990
I know it's mad money,

780
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:34,830
I want you to have it,

781
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:39,430
What would I do with it?

782
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:45,510
Well, for a start, get yourself a dress
and a new pair of shoes,

783
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:49,550
Will ya?

784
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:02,150
Christy? You have a visitor,

785
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:10,350
You look well,

786
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:14,150
- So do you,
- Thank you,

787
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,150
Sit down,

788
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:26,910
- Look, I won't stay very long,
- Stay as long as you like,

789
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,430
I need to ask you a favor,

790
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:33,430
What?

791
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:36,350
A benefit,

792
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:40,190
- Where?
- Lord Castlewelland's,

793
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:43,270
Him?! He's mad,

794
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,670
- Posh,
- Filthy rich,

795
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:55,910
Look, I know you don't like appearing
in public, but... it's for a good cause,

796
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,910
For the cripples,

797
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:04,310
- For the cripples,
- Yeah, I'll try to behave meself,

798
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:10,750
- You sure it won't upset you too much?
- So I'll anesthetize meself,

799
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:14,150
No, Not too much,

800
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:18,510

- Yeah,

804
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:05,710
What do you think? Too much self-pity?

805
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:10,750
No, I think he's a lovely man,
and not in the least sentimental,

806
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:13,670
Mary, do you really think so?

807
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,670
Yeah,

808
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:20,150

- Certainly,

<i>So you'd go out with me?</i>

811

I want to introduce you
to one of the brav...

813
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:35,910
Well, no, no, quite the bravest chap
I've ever come across,

814
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:40,350
Yes, well, now when
Christy Brown was born

815
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:43,590
the doctors told his mother
that... just no good...

816
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:48,510
<i>- Stay with us for a couple of hours,
- (speaker),,a vegetable for all of his life,</i>

817
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:53,550
But Bridget Brown,
she wouldn't take that, oh, no,

818
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,710
Would you go out with me tonight?

819
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:59,590
I told you, Christy, I have an appointment,

820
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:03,150
And so we have with us here tonight...

821
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,710
Are ya in love with him?

822

What?

823
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:14,310
I asked ya did ya love him, Mary?

824

<i>(speaker),,introduce to you
Christy Brown, man of genius,</i>

825
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,950
- Mary,
- Christy,

826
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:26,350
Mary, I asked you a question, Do ya?

827
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:30,270
- It's none of your business,
- So you won't answer me?

828
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:33,590
- Why should I?
- What are you afraid of?

829
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:37,630
You imagine that people are afraid of ya,
I'm not afraid of ya, OK?

830
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:41,870
- You're afraid of yourself,
- Aw, come on, Look, just...

831
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:44,470
- You're afraid of me,
- We can't talk about this now,

832
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:47,390
Why can't we talk now?
Now is a good enough time for me,

833
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:50,950
- I'll see you again sometime,
- I've heard that before, Mary,

834
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:54,870
Why is it always "some fuckin' time"?
Mary, stay,

835
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:59,550
Stay!

<i>(inaudible)</i>

840
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:06,270
I must say, I'm honored to be asked to
give voice to the words of Christy Brown,

841
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:14,750
"I was born in the Rotunda Hospital,
on June 5th, 1932,"

842
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:22,950
"There were 22 children in all,
of which 13 survived,"

843
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:29,190
<i>"It would not be true to say
that I am no longer lonely. "</i>

844
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:31,230
<i>"I have made myself articulate</i>

845
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:33,670
<i>and understood to people
in many parts of the world,</i>

846
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:38,830
<i>and this is something we all wish to do
whether we're crippled or not. "</i>

847
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,590
"Yet, like everyone else,

848
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:45,790
I am acutely conscious sometimes
of my own isolation,

849
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:49,070
even in the midst of people,

850
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:53,830
and I often give up hope of ever being
able to really communicate with them,"

851
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:56,070
Sheila, what's the matter with Christy?

852
01:31:56,150 --> 01:32:00,510
"...that every writer or artist must
experience in the creative mood

853
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:03,190
if he is to create anything at all,"

854
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:07,750
"It's like a black cloud
sweeping down on me unexpectedly,

855
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:12,830
cutting me off from others,
a sort of deaf-muteness,"

856
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:23,870
"I lay back in my chair while my old
left foot beat time to a new rhythm,"

857
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:28,790
"Now I could relax
and enjoy myself completely,"

858
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,910
"I was at peace,"

859
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,670
"Happy,"

860
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,750

- No,

You're mad, Christy! It's great,

867

- Be careful,
- Ah, you're not me Da, Tom,

Joyce's Tower down there,

To Dublin? Why?

888
