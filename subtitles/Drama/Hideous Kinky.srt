- No, darling. Not till morning.

- Merry Christmas!
- No, darling! Not in Morocco, it isn't.

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,840
Every week, a new set of men.

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,680
Prostitutes.

33
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,520
Do you think so? Where did you learn that?!

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,320
THEY SHOUT IN ARABIC

35
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
It's arrived.

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,240
THEY CHEER

37
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
What's this?

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,640

43
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,400
Another joke?

44
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
- TRUMPET
- Italian truffles?

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Urgh! How gross. Oh, well, at least they're edible.

46
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,680

Mum?

48
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,120
- What do you think?
- Too big.

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,280
- Mum, it's the wrong parcel.
- No, it's addressed! It's definitely for us.

50
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,760
- It's the bloody Mandy and that boy.
- Mum, where's our presents?
- Kensington, if theirs are here!

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,360

THEY LAUGH

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,480
- What's the point, Mum?
- Everyone has to work.
- But nobody wants dolls.

63
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
SHE SIGHS

64
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,960
- Mum, can we have rice pudding?
- When your father's cheque comes.

65
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,840
- Sure, Father Christmas.
- Don't we want to go home, Mum?
- London's cold.

66
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,880
Cold and sad.

67
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,240
- No camel. No Abdul the jellybean.
- No scorpions.
- Can't we go home?

68
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,320
No, Lucy, not yet. Not by a long way.

69
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,160
- Eat your truffle paste, darling.
- It tastes like mud.
- It's a delicacy.

70
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,160
- Bea, when you grow up, do you want to be a shepherd?
- I don't think so.

71
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,200
What then?

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,200
I'd like to be normal. Go on - "Once upon a time..."

73
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,880
Once upon a time, there was a big house, all alone in a desert.

74
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,800
It had 100 rooms.

75
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,440
They were all empty. No-one had lived there for lifetimes.

76
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,520
But in the last room, where it was all dark, lived a spooky carpet.

77
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,760
Years and years passed and the carpet lived on the floor.

78
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,320
It was lonely and grumpy and no-one came - only ants and a few birds.

79
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,080
And scorpions lived under it!

80
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
And then?

81
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,800
- Then?
- Someone died.

82
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,280
DRUMS AND CHANTING

Dolls. Interested? Not interested?

85
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,960
Dolls?

86
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,760
- Mum, look!
- What, Lucy?

87
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
- Careful! What?
- Look!

88
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,920
This is my mum.

89
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Hello.

90
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,680
- Bilal al Hamal.
- Julia. Um...

91
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,320
THEY TALK IN ARABIC

92
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,440
- Sorry, I'm learning.
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes.

93
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,080
Thank you.

94
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,200
# Hamal, Hamal al Bilal... #

95

- Are you on holiday?
- No, we live here.
- # ..Bilal al Hamal. #

# Things, things

99
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,200
# Oh-oh. #

100
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,720
Hey!

101
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,280
Kids' father's a poet, right?

102
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,000
- In London.
- That's cool. This is Frank.

103
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
From Frankfurt.

104
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,080
Hi!

105
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,480
- Hi.
- Frank brought 300 trips from Frankfurt, didn't he?

106
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,080
Right there in his backpack. He laid 'em on an entire village.

107
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,840
Hippies, freaks,

108
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Moroccans, man, woman and child.

109
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,080
LSD pure - 300 tabs. Man, woman...

110
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,240
- < Julia!
- Eva, hi!

111
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,400
Hey, Eva.

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,520
Eva!

113
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,040
- How are you?
- Fine.

114
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
See you, lady.

115
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,960
EVA: This is what happens when you come to Morocco for a good time -

116
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,200
- you get married and join the Sufis.
- This is wonderful.

117
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
This is what you were asking about.

118
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,200
The greatest living Sufi.

119
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,520
Sheikh Ben Jalil.

120
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,240
SHE SIGHS

121
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,920
- Did he give it to you?
- Yes, sort of.

122
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,000
- He must have tiny feet.
- The most elegant of old men.

123
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,120
A great teacher and a true saint.

124
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,240
- In a school?
- Yes. The school of the annihilation of the ego.

125
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,680
To find the god within thee.

126
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,000
Will you show me what he taught you? I'd love to know.

127
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,400
I'd be no good. You'll have to go yourself.

128
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,520
In fact, Julia, I think you must.

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,080
Are we going to Algeria, Mum, to see the Sufi?

130
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:19,280
- I'd love to. Wouldn't you? We'll have to make some money first.
- Make money? That's all right then.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,640

HE SINGS IN ARABIC

134
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,640
HE MAKES A GUTTURAL SOUND

135
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,280
But what does all that mean?

136
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,240
It means, um, "I'm all right. I'm fine. I'm OK, I'm OK."

137
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,360
THEY EXCLAIM IN ARABIC

138
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,440
The road is dark. Hidden danger.

139
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,800
Loss makes you careless. A wanderer.

140
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,240
A hanged man. The world turned upside down.

141
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,400
A sacrifice.

142
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,640
A sacrifice?

143
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
EXPLOSION

144
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,720

HE SHOUTS IN ARABIC

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,520
THEY TALK ANIMATEDLY IN ARABIC

148
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,640
- Bea? Lucy?!
- BOTH: Mum?

149
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Welcome to my house. These are my brothers - all 40 of them.

150
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,640
# Well, I'm so tired of crying but I'm out

151
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,160
# On the road again

152
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,960
# I'm on the road again

153

# Well, I'm so tired of crying but I'm out

# I'm on the road again... #

156
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,120
Hideous kinky!

157
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,440
Hideous kinky!

158
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,360
Oh!

159
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,120
Are you pleased to see me?

160
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,640
JULIA LAUGHS

161
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,520
Hello, darling! Where did you spring from?

162
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,400
Ouch!

163
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,160
They work you like animals.

164
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,600
It is nothing, Julia.

165
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,240
Sit.

166
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,280
Their father. He is a bad man?

167
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,920
No!

168
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,480
- Not bad. Just kind of forgetful.
- So he's a hippy?

169
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Not exactly.

170
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,400
He's a writer and a poet.

171
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,720
- He's quite famous.
- But you left him.

172
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,000
Rather than share him, yes, I did.

173
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,400
- He has other wives?
- Not wives, exactly.

174
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,120
I need things for myself, Bilal, and I need things for them.

175
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,720
Things?

176
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,560
Things. A different life - different from before.

177
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,800
Lucy's made up a song. Do you want to hear it?

178
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,880
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Or maybe for money.
- Oh, good. Very good.

179
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,760
But I know how to make money.

180
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,520
That is how we make money!

181
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,080
CHEERING

182
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,640
Look what we can do.

183
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,760
- Ow!
- Look what she can do.

184
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,800
- Whose is the best somersault?
- Mind, Bea!
- OK!

185
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,320
Watch me, Bilal.

186
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,280
- Yes, but...
- Anyone could do that.

187
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,920
Stop!

188
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,960
- You ready?
- Yeah.

189
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,400
Ow! Ow! Ow!

190
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,640
- OK, I know I need to work on it a little bit.
- Yeah.

191
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,120
- Bilal?
- What?
- If you said something, would it always be the truth?

192
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,480
What?! Yes, always.

193
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,320
- And if you promised to do something, would you always do it?
- Of course.

194
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,680
Bilal?

195
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,800
(Are you my daddy now?)

196
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,880
Bilal is going to sing us a song.

197
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,600
- Am I?
- But in the English way.
- You have to go in the wardrobe.

198
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,000
- You can't stop till we tell you.
- Yeah, go on!

199
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
- Please!
- Go on.
- That will be so nice.
- OK.

200
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,040
- Please! I love songs.
- OK.

201
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,040
OK.

202
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,400
Go on! Thank you, Bilal.

203
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,520
OK, you can start now.

204
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,560
HE SINGS IN ARABIC

205
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,680
- THEY LAUGH
- Shh-shh-shh!

206
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,720
HE CARRIES ON SINGING

207
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,600
RHYTHMIC TAMBOURINE-PLAYING AND CHANTING

208
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,840
Look!

209
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,200
PACE QUICKENS

210
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,320
SHE MOANS

211
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,160
SHE MOANS

212
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,640
BOTH: Mum!

213
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,480
Bea?

214
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,880
You haven't been making Lucy promise things again, have you?

215
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,840
Like?

216
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,120
Like promising not to speak to her mummy?

217
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,720
You know...

218
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,880
Daughters are often embarrassed by their mummies. I remember mine.

219
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,920
She put on lipstick on the bus!

220
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,640
Mum, Bea has to say something.

221
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,080
- I have to go to school.
- You don't have to do anything.

222
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,320
- No, I have to go to school.
- Well, you can then.

223
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,720
No, I can't. I need a satchel, a white shirt and a white skirt, none of which I have, so you see?

224
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,960
- Tomorrow, we'll go to the bank. If your father's cheque has come...
- What if it hasn't?

225
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,680
- We'll go the next day.
- If it still hasn't?
- We'll manage.
- It won't arrive.

226
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,040
- No.
- It won't - he's forgotten about us!

227
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,440
Hasn't he?!

228
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,320
- Bea? Lucy?
- What?

229
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,160
- We've got a job. For a Berber poet. I'm a translator.
- Hooray!

230
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,640
We're gonna make money!

231
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,960
- Oh, this word's in Berber.
- SHE SPEAKS IN BERBER

232
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,720
Oh, no. No. That is impossible - not in English, not even in French.

233
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,320
Oh, go on. Try.

234
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,200
OK, it's like a...like a river? A great river?

235
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,240
- No, no, it's like a boat.
- Huh?
- Two boats.

236
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,440
- Two homeless boats?
- Two homeless boats.

237
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,880
Two homeless boats!

238
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,920
THEY LAUGH

239
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,560
- Mum, this one's still got bits in.
- Give it back.

240
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,840
­ LAUGHTER

241
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,360
- Bea!
- Hi, Lucy!
- Hi, Bea!

242
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,080
So? How was your first day at school?

243
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,040
- Well, a little girl wet herself.
- And?

244
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,280
The teacher took her to the front of the class and beat her...

245
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,320
and beat her with a cane until she stopped crying.

246
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,760
Then she beat her again and the cane broke.

247
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,880
- My God! You can't go back there!
- Why not?

248
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,240
Of course I can.

249
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,840
Only joking!

250
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,760
"An Arab peasant looks at the moon.

251
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,280
"'Do you know me? Surely not.

252
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:13,720
"'Then how have I offended you that you'd go a million miles just to plant your flag on my dreams?'

253
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:20,320
"Listen, America. I, the poet, Ben Abdul Jalil Noar Edin, make this petition.

254
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,240
"I don't have much say in the matter, but just a word, America.

255
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,600
"I read my soul by the light of her face.

256

"She will never again so brightly shine,

"or rise singing in the morning, brushing stars from her hair.

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,160
"So you spared no expense, seducer.

259
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,200
"But for both our sakes, my enemy, send her back to me! This I plead.

HE SPEAKS ARABIC

263
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,240
Ben Abdul Jalil thanks you. May he have the typewriter back?

264
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,000
Of course, but I've only done ten poems.

265
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,080
< THEY SPEAK IN ARABIC

266
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,600
Yes, ten poems. He says, "A life cannot wish for more."

267
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,240
Oh.

268
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,480
Mum, what did he mean - only ten poems?

269
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,720
I'm afraid, Lucy, it means we're out of work.

270
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,720
- The bank is closed.
- Please will you look again?

271
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,560
- There must have been a mistake.
- There is no money here for you.

272
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,320
Tomorrow.

273
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,480
Merci. Merci beaucoup. Au revoir. Bonne journee.

274
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,240
SHE SPEAKS AGITATEDLY IN ARABIC

275
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,160
Je ne comprends pas. What are you doing?

276
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,200
Qu'est-ce-que vous faites?

277
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,960
Please don't do that!

­ LAUGHTER

279
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,600
Hey! That's my towel!

280
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,880
Fuck!

281
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,320
THEY ARGUE IN ARABIC

282
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,360
JEERING FROM THE CROWD

283
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,560
Julia, what is wrong?

284
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,880
Julia?

285
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,760
Nothing.

286
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,760
- We have no money.
- No money?
- Absolutely none. Not even for the rent.

287
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,520
- How can you have no money?!
- Meaning?

288
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,440
- I only mean you are English.
- Do you think I sell dolls for fun?

289
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,880
No, but it's money for the pocket. Julia?

290
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,720
Many English don't have any money, you know. Most of them, in fact.

291
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,240
- Uh?
- Just because I'm English doesn't mean...
- No problem.

292
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,240
So what's the problem?

293
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,080
HE SIGHS

294
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,200
HE SPEAKS IN ARABIC

295
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
What?

296
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,920
I left my job.

297
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,960
There are...two women. No, three women.

298
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,120
- And a journey.
- A journey? How original(!)

299
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,080
- Something's bad.
- What kind of bad?

300
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,160
Ten US dollars?

301
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,600
- Get lost!
- You must help me to tell you. It is most important.

302
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,680
So maybe you should tell the police.

303
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,160
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing could possibly be that bad.

304
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,800
Please.

305
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
Well?

306
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,280
- You will never have a husband.
- That bad, huh?

307
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,080
- No husband?
- Sorry, but you should know.

308
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,920
You complete loser.

309
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,320
Have you seen my pink trousers? Bilal isn't wearing them, is he?

310
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,960
- I don't think so.
- That's strange.

- Stop her, Bea!

314

- No, Mum!
- Stop, Mum, please stop! I know what you're gonna do!

315
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,200
- I'm not going to do anything.
- No!
- Mum, stop! Mum!

316
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,880
- Stop, Mum!
- Come out!

317
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,080
- Don't do it!
- It doesn't matter.

318

Come out! Those are my trousers!

Good. Very good. You really are the little Arab girl, uh?

335
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,440
Would the schoolgirl like a vacancy?

336
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,960
- Bilal means holiday.
- But why? I'll fall behind.

337
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,360

- Will you think about it?

338
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,080
- Hmm?
- In Bilal's village.

339
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,640
I'll think about it.

340
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,040

"..And every wife adds trouble to trouble."

364

"..Life passes and youth is spent."

366

MURMURS OF APPROVAL

On the side of the hill.

374
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,120
- To fill the eyes, it is important.
- Mm.

375

This is your village, Bilal.

We've just arrived.

382

No.

383
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,760
I don't have a village anywhere.

Papiers?

390
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,560
Papiers, Madame?

< English?

392
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,600
- Yes.
- And this is your husband?

393
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,880
Yes, she's my wife.

394

- Mum's going to become a Sufi.
- And what do Sufis do?

402
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,320
They live in a mosque,

403
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,960
they pray all day, and they never go out.

404
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,680
- Well, she can't cos she's married to Bilal.
- Mum's married to our dad.

405
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,200
- You just don't remember!
- No, Bilal told me so on the bus.

406
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,560
Liar!

407
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,280

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,640
Bea!

409
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,040
- Hey! Oh! Julia! What are you doing?
- I could swim and swim.

410
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,800
Maybe I could reach the other side.

411
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,760
- Until you drown, you mean?
- Fine, it just doesn't scare me any more.

412
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,080
The annihilation of the ego.

413
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,720
- Huh?
- The death of the body.

414
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,400
How can you talk like that?

415
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,760
How can you people talk like that?

416
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,960
Hi, girls.

417
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,680
- It is from the hotel.
- The hotel?!
- Have you been there?

418
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
Yes.

419
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,880
I had a job...with horses.

420
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,440
- Can we go there for a ride?
- It is nothing. Useless plastic.

421
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,360
- Please!
- Please!
- NO!

422
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,000
OK?

423
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,840
I said no!

424
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,640
It is a bad place!

425
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,640
That's the last of it.

426
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,040
- We've got to reprovide.
- I suppose someone has to.

427
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,880
# You can say the sun is shining if you really want to

428
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,920
# I can see the moon and it seems so clear

429
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,280
# You can take the road that takes you to the stars now

430

# I can take a road that'll see me through

431
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,000
# I can take a road that'll see me through... #

432
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,800
- Mum, where's Bilal?
- He's gone to find food.

433
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,440
- We'll have lunch when he gets back from the hotel.
- If he comes back.

434
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,120
What do you mean, darling?

435
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,560
Well, he's gone a bit potty, hasn't he?

436
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,440
# You can take the road that takes you to the stars now

437
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,760
# I can take a road that'll see me through

438
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,040
# I can take a road that'll see me through

439
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,960
# I can take a road that'll see me through. #

440
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,200
- Mum, will we still have a garden?
- Hmm.

441
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,400
- And mashed potatoes every night.
- Hmm?

442
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,040
- And will you still want to have two little girls?
- What?!

443
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,880
When?

444
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,520
- When you become a Sufi.
- Oh.

445
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,960
Oi! >

446

Sardines. 46 tins.

448
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
- Is that it?
- And two cigarettes?

449
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,920
VOMITING >

450

Oh.

452
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,720
Rub your tummies, rub your tummies.

453
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,760
- You have to go back?
- To Marrakech, yes.

454
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,600
THE GIRLS WHIMPER

455
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,080
I know, I know. Rub your tummies and bring up some more.

BILAL SHOUTS IN ARABIC

457
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,560
OK, this man's called Mohammed

458
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,920
and he will drive you to Marrakech.

459
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,760
- Isn't Bilal coming? Aren't you coming, Bilal?
- No, there is work in Agadir.
- Come on, girls.

460
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,200
- But aren't you coming with us?
- No, that is no longer part of the plan.

461
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,560
Look!

462
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,120
Learn and work is the only secret, OK?

463
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,040
- We will meet soon, God willing.
- Inshallah.
- Yes, inshallah.

464
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,600
Now, go, go, go, go!

465
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,600
What did he say?

466
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,240
Bilal?

467
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,840
Bye, Bilal!

468
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,880
THE GIRLS SHOUT IN ARABIC

469
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,160
Hey, hey! Now, what should I call you, hmm?

470
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,800
The English Girls or the Arab Girls?

471
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,640
No matter. Shall we have tea?

472
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,600
Er, Jean-Louis Santoni. BOTH: Mum!

473
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,080
I remember your husband. I knew him in, er, the '60s. Quite a dandy.

474
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,640
- Does he still wear those gold waistcoats?
- Probably.

475
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,760
And those little tight, black, elegant shoes?

476
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,120
Too small for him, with pointed toes.

477
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,720
I'm sure he does. And despicable red socks, full of goat's cheese.

478
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,320
- Do you ever see him?
- London is such a big place.

479
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:54,840
It's booming - full of raincoats, pragmatists, optimists, bank accounts, wives.

480
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:01,080
- Which is why you're here.
- Which is exactly why I am here. And you?

481
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,000
- Something similar.
- I have a house nearby.

482
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,520
- You must come and visit.
- Oh, Mum, could we?

483
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,560
- Please, Mum.
- Oh, we'll see.

484
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,640
We have to go now.

485
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,200
Here is my card. I have many spare rooms.

486
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,000
- Look at that one!
- They're making funny noises.

487
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,640
Come on.

488
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:37,960
- Mum, shall we write to Bilal?
- Well, he'll have to write first because I don't know where he is.

489
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,680
So he knows where we are?

490
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,200
No.

491
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:49,560
If he doesn't know where WE are and we don't know where HE is, he won't be able to write, will he?

492
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,600
- He probably doesn't want to write.
- Don't we have an address, Mum?

493
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,680
SHE SOBS

494
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,360
I'm sorry, Mum.

495
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,080
Mum, don't cry.

496
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,920
KNOCKING

497
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:16,360
- Bonjour, Madame.
- Bonjour.
- Puis-je vous aider?
- Je cherches Mr Santoni.

498
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,560
(If she begs for money, I'll kill her. I'll kill her.)

499
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,600
Hello?

500
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,960
Ah, Julia.

501
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,720
I'm afraid you missed quite an average party. Come, come in.

502
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,760
This is Charlotte. And this is Monsieur Ben Said.

503
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,560
CHARLOTTE: Do excuse the mess.

504
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,240
- Can I help?
- I'm not sure if that would be an improvement.

505
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,200
- On the contrary - how sweet.
- I'm Bea.

506
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,160
# Jean-Louis Santoni, Jean-Louis Santoni, Jean-Louis Santoni. #

507
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,600
ITALIAN ACCENT: # Jean-Louis Santoni. #

508
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,840
HIGH-PITCHED: # Jean-Louis Santoni. #

509
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,440
DRAWL: # Jean-Louis Santoni. #

510
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,360
Oh! My God! Why are you hiding?

511
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,800
Not actually hiding, we're sort of exploring.

512
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:40,680
- Hideous Kinky!
- Hideous Kin...
- Bea! How long have you been in Morocco?

513
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,200
About a year.

514
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,040
Tell all.

515
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,080
Father Christmas!

516
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,160
CHARLOTTE: Mussolini!

517
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,600
- Billy Bunter. No! Your father!
- Sheikh Ben Jalil.

518
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,280
- What?!
- That's where Mum's going.

519
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,080
Isn't it, Mum?

520
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,800
The Sufis. And do you know what to expect of these Sufis?

521
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,000
- Knowledge, I hope. Some kind of guidance.
- Let me tell you.

522
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,440
To start with, sitting around on cushions, a great deal of illogic,

523
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,840
and even a greater deal more incense.

524
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:34,240
Days of fasting, interminable amounts of prayer, and a personal visit from God.

525
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,920
That's our country's tragedy - this escapism.

526
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,240
I'm not escaping anything. I want to understand the truth.

527
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,280
You think the truth will just come and curl up on your lap like a cat?

528
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,440
Be warned. They're quite, quite dangerous to the mind, these Asian frauds.

529
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,480
- They wouldn't be allowed in Europe.
- But Europe lacks this inner world.

530
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,160
The world is simply the world for present duties or passing pleasures.

531
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,440
- What's so great about passing pleasures?
- They're more amusing.

532
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,480
Oh, sure! Which is fine, you know.

533
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,760
You know, it's fine for children, like cornflakes!

534
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,520
SANTONI: Julia, ignore Ben Said - he works for the tax department.

535
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,760
- Actually, Ben Said IS the tax department.
- Oh(!)

536
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,000
- Mum, it still itches.
- Oh, Lucy, don't scratch.

537
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,480
I bought this in the medina, but it won't open.

538
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,560
Charlotte.

539
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,120
Man's work.

540
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,440
- Ben.
- Hmm?

541
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,120
HE CALLS IN ARABIC

542
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,600
I command you to open this tin.

543
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,640
Oh!

544
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,640
- Look, Charlotte, it's boot polish.
- Wretched country.

545
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,840
My God!

546
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,520
You look grotesque!

547
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,040
THEY SHOUT IN ARABIC

548
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,480
You know, that language will land those children in trouble.

549
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,520
- You need discipline, Julia.
- I had plenty of that in my childhood.

550
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,800
- I can't say it did me any good.
- I'd probably say the same, unfortunately.

551
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,920
- Shouldn't you go home?
- To a one-room flat?
- It's better than here!

552
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,760
Or home in the evening with them rigid from child-minders and TV?

553
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,440
- 14 working hours a day for nothing?
- But...

554
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,840
- Charlotte, you just don't know about these things.
- Of course.

555
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,640
Children are a gift, but you don't have the right to put them in danger.

556
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,560
I beg your pardon?

557
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:19,840
- You can't drag them round Morocco in the company of escaped criminals.
- What the bloody hell do you mean?!

558
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,640
Bea?

559
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,160
Bea, what have you been saying?

560
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,040
So why did he lie? So how come the policeman knew his face?

561
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,360
- Whose face? Bilal?
- So what about Fatima? What about his wife?

562
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:44,200
- What wife?!
- How come we had to go to Agadir and hide at the lake?

563
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,160
- That was just a holiday.
- Yeah, on the run!

564
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,080
- Does that mean Bilal can't come and stay with us?
- Lucy! God forbid!

565
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,080
PASSIONATE OPERA MUSIC PLAYS

566
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,520
Thump, thump! Its fingers travelled the world, strangling its victims.

567
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,320
It was the Black Hand.

568
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:28,920
The Black Hand left one clue on the necks of its victims - a sooty print of its thumb.

569
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,640
She ran and ran, but she couldn't escape.

570
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,320
No-one was waiting at home for her.

571
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,400
Only the hideous scissors.

572
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,040
OPERA REACHES A CRESCENDO

573
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,480
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

574
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,520
SHE SCREAMS CONTINUOUSLY

575
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,000
THEY GIGGLE

576
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,840
Lucy?

577
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,600
The cheque's arrived.

578
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,960
Bea, you have to tell Mum, you do!

579
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:16,080
The money's come, but not enough - we'll have to hitchhike to Algiers.

580
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,440
Mum?

581
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,880
Bea has something to say.

582
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,520
I've been talking to Charlotte.

583
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,560
She says I can stay here until you get back.

584
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,840
- Is that what you want?
- If you really want to go.

585
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,400
- What does Charlotte say?
- That it's no place for girls to run wild in.

586
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,080
I don't need another adventure, Mum.

587
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,000
I have to go to school. I have to learn things.

588
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,680
I'll still be here when you get back.

589
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,120
Fine.

590
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,640
I never thought she'd say that.

591
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,080
- Bea?
- You know, Lucy, you don't have to go either.

592
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,120
Not if you don't want to.

593
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,840
Hideous.

594
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,320
Kinky.

595
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,600
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER >

596
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,240
- Charlotte?
- >

597
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,280
- Where are you?
- >

598
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,320
- I know you're here somewhere!
- >

599
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,040
Charlotte?

600
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,080
- Hello!
- I can't find you.

601
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,480
Where are you? I know you're here somewhere.

602
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,000
I got you!

603
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,840
I found you!

604
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:22,960
# ..Then the colour of your eyes are fiery bright... #

605
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,080
I got you, I got you!

606
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,880
# While darkness lines the sky with all its light

607
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,800
# Come see where your eyes cannot see

608
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,360
# Then close your eyes, child

609
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,640
# And look at what I'll show you

610
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:53,520
# Let your mind go reeling out and let the breezes blow you... #

611
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,520
Bea!

612
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,960
See you soon, Bea. Bye, Bea!

613
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,760
- Bye, darling!
- See you soon, Bea!

614
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,320
# ..Then don't mind me

615
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,160
# Cos I gave nothing

616
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,200
# But a dream

617
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,480
# And you can follow

618
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,200
# And you can follow... #

619
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,760
Algiers?

620
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,560
Henning... Henning.

621
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,200
Henning?

622
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,640
Algiers.

623
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,760
# On the first part of the journey

624
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,720
# I was looking at all the life... #

625
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,600
Rush hour!

626
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,960
# ..There were plants and birds and rocks and things

627
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,120
# There was sand and hills and rain

628
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,600
# The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz

629
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,560
# And the sky with no clouds

630
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,520
# The heat was hot and the ground was dry

631
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,720
# But the air was full of sound

632
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,800
# I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

633
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,760
# It felt good to be out of the rain

634
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,640

01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:43,120
- Well, I suppose it's what Bea always wanted.
- To be an orphan?

795
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,760
No, Lucy.

796
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,800
To be normal.

797
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,000
Bea, is Patricia your mum now?

798
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,840
- Mum won't like that.
- Really?

799
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,040
Don't, Bea!

800
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,600
Thank you.

801
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,360
Thank you, Bea.

802
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,720
Your coffee, darling.

803
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,640
Oh!

804
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,160
Coffee?

805
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,040
Honestly, Julia.

806
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,400
Just because she wants coffee doesn't mean she should have it.

807
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,680
- The poor, wee orphan.
- What?

808
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:01,200
- I insist we go elsewhere to argue.
- And I insist I'll do as I please!

809
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,840
Have you ever done differently?

810
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,600
- Don't do that...
- Bea! I'm your mummy...

811
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,560
not her!

812
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,800
- ­
- You go there and take my daughter...

BOTH: Hideous.

821

Whoo!

826
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,000

SHE CLAPS

828
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,960

- Magnificent.

829
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,520
Aaaah!

830
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,480
No, Lucy, the uniform belongs to the boss.

831
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:34,200
- And if he gets angry...
- Does the boss pay you himself?
- And overtime!

832
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,240
And bonuses for special days.

833
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:41,280
- Bilal, don't spend it all on us.
- Anything you want.

834
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:47,560
- Can Bilal take us back to London?
- No, you can have a Fanta!
- Is the boss nice?

835
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,600
- No, the boss is very, very scary.
- Scary like Black Hand?

836
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,440
Even scarier.

837
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,880
- Marrakech...
- Bea.

838
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,720
Bea!

839
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,800
Bea, what's the matter? Look at me.

- No, it's streptococcus.

842
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,720
- And just as dangerous.
- God!

843
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,800
Here's the medication.

844
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,840
- Can you afford this, madam?
- It's so expensive.

845
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,520
Yes, your Western companies are not kind to we Africans.

846
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,560
I suggest you find some way of taking these children home.

847
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,400
I hope so.

848
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:53,240
Bilal? Will Bea die now?

849
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,200
SHE SOBS

850
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,560
Bea would never do anything she didn't want to do.

SHE SPEAKS IN ARABIC

No, that's not possible. Ce n'est pas possible!

853
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:14,280
I'm sorry, madam. With the Moroccan postal service, anything is possible.

854
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,360
Come on!

01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,120
You're going away again, aren't you?

870
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,480
No.

871
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,640
Bilal?

872
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,800
Is Lucy really your little girl now?

873
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,320
No, you're both my little girls.

874
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:27,240
- Even if you've heard things?
- Things?
- Or would I still be your little girl?

875
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,800
You must do something first.

876
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,400
You sleep now.

877
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,920
Remember to take care of Lucy.

878
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,480
Yes, of course.

879
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,960

Have you seen it?

01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,520
Shit!

887
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,800
Mum? Where's Bilal?

888
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,680
He's gone back to Agadir, hasn't he?

889
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,960
No, darling. He's just vanished again.

890
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,040
Yeah, good. Perfect!

Phew!

897
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,920
It's three tickets to London.

898
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,680
From Dad?

899
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,920
I suppose so, but I can't see how.

900
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,680
- I can't see how at all!
- Something strange is going on here.

901
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,360
At least we can get home!

902
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,880

01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,120
- So? What new mystery?
- Bilal's gone to Casablanca.

907
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:11,360
He stole the uniform to pay for our tickets. He's in trouble, I'm sure.

908
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,200
- We've got to find him, Eva.
- Bilal's gone.

909
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:19,520
- You know what happens to a thief here.
- We can't just leave him!

910
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,280
Listen, the journey's over.

911
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,560
Use the tickets. That's what he wants.

- < SOBBING
- Bea!

913

Bea, what's wrong?

914
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,800
If we leave tomorrow, does that mean we'll never come back?

915
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:41,000
No, no, darling, of course not.

916
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,880
- You can keep a secret, can't you?
- Mm-hmm.

917
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,920
When a holy man dies, his things become magical.

918
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,440
So you can make a wish on the Sufi slipper.

919
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:57,000
- Make a wish!
- Please let me come back here to Morocco,

920
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:03,200
be in Bilal's village, have all the rose petals thrown on us again.

921
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,240
Please let Bilal know that we love him.

922
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:11,280
And please, please, keep him safe from harm.

923
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,480
Do you know the story of the Black Hand?

924
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,120
1,300 times.

925
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,560
Yes, I do.

926
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,960
Anyway, go on.

927
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,160
Well, the nice Black Hand was nice, especially to little girls.

928
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:41,400
So they asked the Black Hand for a special favour.

929
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:46,240
To hide Bilal in a place where the scary boss couldn't find him.

930
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:51,080
The only problem is, the little girls couldn't find him either.

931
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,600
Lucy, come on.

932
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,240
Bilal?

933
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,640
