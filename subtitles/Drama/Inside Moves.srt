1
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,461
Jim, line one, please.

2
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,157
Jim, line one.

3
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,409
All right, load him up.
Load him up.

4
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,919
Come on, he's not the only
flyer in town today.

5
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,750
Get him up. Transport him.

6
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,619
- A lot of paperwork.
- Careful.

7
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,852
I got him.

8
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,519
Ready? Up.

9
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,654
Right there. I'm going in.

10
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,891
Easy. Easy. Okay.

11
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,457
I got it.

12
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,533
Okay, gentlemen, what do we got?

13
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,797
This man jumped out of a building
and landed on a car.

14
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,839
- Did you get his blood pressure?
- Eighty over something.

15
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,341
Jumped out of a building.

16
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,810
Why? What do you mean,
it was another suicide?

17
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,903
I need another--

18
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,581
Boy, look at the X-rays on that kid.

19
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,585
He is so messed up.

20
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,917
How did it happen?
Does anyone know?

21
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,581
Jumped out of a ten-story window.

22
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,090
Ten-story window?
You're kidding.

23
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,626
- Was he on drugs?
- I don't think he was light at all.

24
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,595
- Toxic screen was negative?
- I heard it was attempted suicide.

25
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,761
Take a deep breath, Roary.

26
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,997
Okay, Roary.

27
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,369
That's it.

28
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,964
Looks like a nice, clean wound.

29
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,976
He's been here eight months or more.

30
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,038
I've been here before.

31
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,414
- I've been here--
- Can you hear me, Roary?

32
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,544
Sure. I can hear you.

33
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,552
My mom's maiden name.

34
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,822
I don't know.
Remember Peggy...

35
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,696
Peggy...

36
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,736
What was her name?

37
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,271
She was the first one to have a bike.

38
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,864
I loved her for her bike.

39
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,741
All the neighbors wanted a bulldog...

40
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,342
Collision Corner.

41
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,909
475 North Columbus.

42
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:32,789
M-l-C-K-E-Y...

43
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,231
Why? Why?

44
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,799
- That's silly.
- But it's true.

45
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,563
Only to drive Chevys.

46
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,402
Excuse me.

47
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,204
You know where I can
get a beer around here?

48
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,711
Yeah, around the corner. Max's.

49
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,771
You go out here to the right.

50
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,443
A lot of guys from the hospital go there.

51
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,589
Hey. Hey, want some company?

52
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,063
- It's just $25. That's all.
- No.

53
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,623
No. No.

54
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,192
$20?

55
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,238
You look like you could use it.

56
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,268
I'll have a draft.

57
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,743
Right here.
Put the money up.

58
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,244
First one's on the house.

59
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,109
- First time in here, right?
- Yeah.

60
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,308
My name's Jerry.

61
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,748
Roary.

62
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,412
Hey, Jerry, give me another beer,
will you please?

63
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,977
Yeah, that's a 3.

64
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,023
Trust me. It's 3.

65
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,767
Benny, you got a queen, you got a 1 0,

66
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,803
you got two 4s.

67
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,698
- 7, 6...
- 6...

68
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,469
- 4...
- 4...

69
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,602
- And a 2.
- Possible straight.

70
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,373
- But that's good for me, man.
- Queens.

71
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,679
- You got caught--
- Oh, no! No!

72
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,981
God damn. No.

73
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,146
- Burt is at it.
- Hey, listen, I can't--

74
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,713
...out of the state,
but that he will be on SFO

75
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,783
as soon as he gets back to California.

76
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,261
We just hope we're still
on the air in 1 983...

77
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,888
- Hey!
- when he gets back to California.

78
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,364
Don't touch the set, man.

79
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,196
People ask me what SFO is, you know?

80
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,498
What the show is all about...

81
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,937
- Sorry.
- and what we're trying to do.

82
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,598
Let me say, ladies and gentlemen,

83
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,610
what we're trying to do
is not get canceled.

84
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:45,112
And you can help
with those postcards and letters.

85
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,947
I think part of our problem is that

86
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,681
we're going to be covering
a lot of different territory.

87
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,383
In broadcasting terminology,

88
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,256
I would say that in that vast waste--

89
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,287
Shoot!

90
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,967
Here. To me.

91
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,528
All right.

92
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,436
Hey, hey, hey.

93
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,273
You're the jerk.

94
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,913
Who's the jerk? Bullshit.

95
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,411
Go, go, go!

96
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,083
That was beautiful!

97
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,092
Get busy with this game.

98
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,957
- Take this.
- Hey! Hey!

99
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,394
Yeah!

100
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,091
Man, that white boy can shoot good.

101
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,030
Come on. Goddamn it.

102
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,728
- Wings?
- Yeah, yeah.

103
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,168
Wings, did you see
the Dillinger movie last night?

104
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,172
- No. No.
- It was really good.

105
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,767
It was one of them art films
with a whole lot of slow motion.

106
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,903
They probably didn't have
the real ending, though, did they?

107
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,139
What real ending?

108
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,011
The man dies in the alley.

109
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,108
Dillinger's pecker's
in a jar at the Smithsonian.

110
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,216
His schlong. It's in a jar.

111
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,723
What is it doing in a jar?

112
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,818
Well, it's 16 inches long,
for Christ sake.

113
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,693
It's in there with the Spirit of St. Louis
and everything.

114
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,665
It's like a national treasure.

115
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,963
What kind of jar did they use?

116
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,504
'Cause if they use a mayonnaise jar,
something like that,

117
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,835
they'd have to bend it
in order to get it in there.

118
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,431
Can they do that?

119
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,376
Look, Blue, if they put
a man's pecker in a museum,

120
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,879
they're going to take the time
to find the right size jar.

121
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,007
Of course they're going
to get the right size jar.

122
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:25,982
Yeah.

123
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,150
I heard that story.

124
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,780
When I was a kid, I was down there.

125
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,791
At the Smithsonian?
Did you see it?

126
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,884
The guard said it wasn't there.

127
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,794
- See?
- It's probably on tour.

128
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,526
You know, like the King Tut stuff.

129
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,897
They do that.

130
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,765
You know, if they put that thing on tour,

131
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,931
it'll do a hell of a lot more business
than the King Tut thing, huh?

132
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,032
Good morning, Blue, fellas.

133
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,136
- Come in.
- Play cards.

134
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,612
Right, Blue. Right.

135
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,514
They ain't putting my pecker in no jar.
I'll tell you that much, Stinky.

136
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,609
And in no Smithsonian lnstitute, either.

137
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,278
I'm gonna take mine with me,

138
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,322
'cause there are a lot of things
I want to do with it.

139
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,517
- We're ready to go.
- Morning, fellas.

140
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,125
Hey, Books.
How are you?

141
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,891
- Play some cards.
- Wings.

142
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,363
That's right.

143
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,127
Hey, who the hell left this chair over here?

144
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,998
Hey, Jerry, how'd the game go?

145
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,162
Good. Hey, what do you say, Max?

146
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,071
All right, he's okay.
Stinky's okay. He's doing all right.

147
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,166
- Hey, how you doing?
- Come on, guys. Get over here.

148
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,710
Roary, right?

149
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,075
Jerry, right?

150
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,738
Good to see you back.

151
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,406
Did you meet Max yet?

152
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,780
Max, that's Roary.

153
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,512
Looks like another one on the cuff, huh?

154
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,419
Here's your enchiladas.

155
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,049
How you doing, Roary?
Glad to have you.

156
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,355
- What'll you have?
- Enchiladas!

157
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,521
I have some free time.
I just thought I'd get a beer.

158
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,030
- Draft?
- Draft.

159
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,191
Jerry, Burt, how about
some beer over here?

160
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,100
- We're thirsty.
- All right. They're coming.

161
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,933
Hey, I got them, Jer.

162
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,646
What's wrong with your leg?

163
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,443
What's wrong with yours?

164
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,846
Hey, you play cards?

165
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,782
I played a lot in the hospital.

166
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,920
Hey, can you use another hand over there?

167
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,759
Another hand? Yeah.
I can use two of them.

168
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,095
What's this...

169
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,594
Goddamn, that's funny.

170
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,535
Every time I hear it, it's still funny.

171
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,903
Grab your beer.

172
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,408
I'll introduce you to the guys.

173
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,445
Here we go.
Wet and cold.

174
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,037
I will have one of those
wet and colds, buddy.

175
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,844
Hey, Roary.

176
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,853
Okay, everybody,
I'd like you to meet Roary.

177
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,379
Roary, this is Stinky,

178
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,220
that's Wings,

179
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,022
and this is Blue Lewis.

180
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,356
What's wrong with him?

181
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,592
He walks funny, and his head
sort of tilts to one side.

182
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,997
Which side?

183
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,432
The right side.

184
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,833
Then put him over here.

185
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,803
I don't want him looking at my cards.

186
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,239
Watch out for him. He cheats.

187
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,575
So you're a friend of Jerry's, huh?

188
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,908
Yeah.

189
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,949
- He's a hell of a guy.
- The best.

190
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,644
Well, he's not that good.

191
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,981
What's your name?

192
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:19,582
- Roary. R-O-A-R-Y.
- Stinky, let's deal the cards out

193
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,920
and get the game going, huh?

194
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,756
- Okay, just a second.
- Okay.

195
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,523
Everybody ready?

196
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,062
Look at--

197
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,307
- Oh, wow.
- I'm all in with 3 of clubs.

198
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,176
Hey, man!

199
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,876
- Hey, kid, you're all right.
- Hey, you're okay, kid.

200
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,315
I'll drink to you.

201
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,750
Hey.

202
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,382
Look at that ass.

203
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,560
Come here.
Let me see it.

204
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,723
- That's not--
- Yeah.

205
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,060
Fifty-five.

206
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,567
$55? You told him $50.

207
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,103
Goes up, man.

208
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,638
- Goes up since from here to there?
- lnflation.

209
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,731
Don't look away for a second.

210
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:10,740
Know what I mean?

211
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,868
Bad sneeze, eyes closed and--

212
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,474
But anyway, I'm going to bet a dime.

213
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,245
A dime more.

214
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,981
You better take a look at your hold cards.
I think you read them wrong.

215
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,615
No, no, no.
I know what I got. Let's go.

216
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,091
Say, so what happened to you?

217
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,557
I've been in the hospital for a while.

218
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,390
So?

219
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:57,818
I jumped off a building
and tried to commit suicide.

220
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,758
You asshole.
You got it all backwards.

221
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:15,432
First you get crippled,
then you try to commit suicide.

222
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,909
Roary, I'm sorry I called you an asshole.

223
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,644
- It's all right.
- Yeah.

224
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,347
That's the most depressing thing
I've ever heard.

225
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,622
Hey.

226
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,889
Okay, let's play some cards.

227
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,452
A little distributing company.

228
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,589
Max, you're two weeks behind on this one.

229
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,133
Not while I'm eating, okay?

230
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,999
Well, let's try this one.

231
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,005
Hey, Jerry, you got a friend down there.

232
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,738
Hey, Mouse!

233
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,439
Let me see.
That's an 8 of hearts.

234
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,347
What are you doing up with the sunshine?

235
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,611
Phone rang this morning.

236
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,084
It was the wrong number.

237
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,053
Got another Coke?

238
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,615
Okay, so, then bet.

239
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,717
- I did already.
- You gonna raise?

240
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,728
Well, I may do that, too.

241
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,593
Is this a deuce-- this card?

242
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,131
- Yeah.
- Hey, that's Jerry's girl.

243
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,757
I'm gonna take yours.

244
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,699
Poor kid's a junkie, and, you know,

245
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,568
she whores it so she can buy junk.

246
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,766
Promise? On my ass.

247
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,038
Does Jerry know that?

248
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,979
Yeah, he knows it,
but he thinks he loves her.

249
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,950
Hey, here's the last card.
Down and dirty.

250
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,350
- Cover me, Burt?
- You got it, Jerry.

251
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,888
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

252
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,651
Outside. I don't want
to talk in here, Mouse.

253
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,693
Where the hell's the money?

254
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,954
The money's right there--

255
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,155
- Where the hell is it?
- Right there.

256
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,494
Don't get excited.
Right there in front of you.

257
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,965
Max, this is ridiculous.

258
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,558
You got to stop buying these things.

259
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,627
Jeez, Max. Here's one for electric.

260
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,433
Eight hundred bucks!

261
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,770
- lmpossible.
- Possible!

262
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,004
So what the hell you want me to do,
Burt, raise prices?

263
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,878
Everybody in the damn neighborhood
is on a fixed income.

264
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,679
You keep it up, you're going to be
the one who's on a fixed income.

265
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,579
- Gil.
- Yeah?

266
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,590
- You want to go to the game tonight?
- Nah.

267
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,627
- Come on. This will be a great game.
- Jerry, you go too early.

268
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,922
Look, I got an extra ticket.

269
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,055
Hey, I'm sorry, man.
I can't make it.

270
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,895
Roary, how you doing?

271
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,229
Good.

272
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,237
Listen, I got an extra ticket
to the Warriors game tonight.

273
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,739
My lady's out of town.
You want to go?

274
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,537
Yeah. Good.
Game starts at 8:00.

275
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,078
I like to be there about an hour early,

276
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,444
so I'll meet you here at 6:30.

277
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,642
Okay with you? Good.

278
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,651
How's your beer doing?

279
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,983
Give me that.
I'm going to buy you one.

280
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,924
Hey, Clifford!

281
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,522
If you can catch the ball,
maybe you can pull up a lay-up.

282
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,527
They're looking at you, Jerry...

283
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,596
Don't worry about it.
They never come up in the stands.

284
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,571
Hey, hey.

285
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,238
There he is.
That's Alvin Martin.

286
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,773
Which one is Martin?

287
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,011
The one that says "Martin" on his back.

288
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,053
Right.

289
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,145
Hey, Alvin!

290
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,749
Work on the 3-pointers!
You look good!

291
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,817
Hey, shut up, Mouth!

292
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,489
Hey!

293
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,997
They love it.

294
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,269
Hey, those two girls next to you--

295
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,434
do they come to all the games?

296
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,307
I don't know.

297
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,040
Why don't you ask her?

298
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,581
He wants to ask you something.

299
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,276
What?

300
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,521
He's just shy.

301
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,198
Can we get a beer?

302
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,700
Stop the ball!

303
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,997
Get on Westphal, get on Westphal.

304
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,097
Come on, Jo Jo!
Stay on that man!

305
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,338
Let's go. Get back there!
Get back!

306
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,537
Get on Westphal!

307
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,191
- Run the play!
- Yeah!

308
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,387
Run the play!

309
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,356
Get the rebound!

310
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,903
- No, you bum!
- Get up!

311
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,573
- Abernathy, pass off!
- Pass it off!

312
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,109
Come on!

313
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,508
Screen him!

314
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,008
Yes! All right!

315
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,947
All right!

316
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,484
Let's go!

317
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,383
All right!

318
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,853
Come on!

319
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,856
Get out of here.

320
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,887
- Yes, yes!
- Yeah! Yeah! All right!

321
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,490
Move it! Get down there!
Get down there!

322
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,200
The key, Roary--
The key is Alvin Martin.

323
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,607
Shoot it!

324
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,644
Martin, shoot the ball!

325
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,415
Shoot it! Shoot it!

326
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,289
Alvin--

327
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,348
Two points.

328
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,860
Shit!

329
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,265
He choked!

330
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,630
Martin-- Come on, Roary.

331
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,635
Final score--

332
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:49,140
Phoenix Suns: 94,
Golden State Warriors: 93.

333
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,954
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

334
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,490
and be sure to drive home safely.

335
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,353
Al, you got a couple of seconds?

336
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,158
I just got two questions
that I want to ask you.

337
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,289
Real short, okay?
Tough luck, huh?

338
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,095
Look, tight shot just on his face, all right?

339
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,192
Are you rolling on this thing?

340
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,531
We're ready? Okay, good.

341
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,696
Al, a great ball game
for you individually tonight,

342
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,468
but what about the last two seconds?

343
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,340
Well, I came off the pick,
and I got the pass from Abernathy.

344
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,641
I had the shot,
but I saw him cutting down--

345
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,182
- That's a lie, man! You panicked!
- Shut it down, okay?

346
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,376
- We can't use this thing.
- Who let that guy in here?

347
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,750
I'll talk to you later, Al.
Let's see if we can talk to him.

348
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,585
- It's The Mouth, sideline know-it-all.
- He's not worth it, man!

349
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,921
You didn't play so hard either, Clifford.

350
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,256
Al, you gotta remember that panic is dumb.

351
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,263
You made that shot thousands of times.
Just relax, man.

352
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,858
Alvin, why don't you take care
of that jerk once and for all?

353
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,425
Why don't you get out of here, man?

354
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,027
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

355
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,198
I don't? I can beat you
any day of the week.

356
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,434
Why don't you be cool?
You're making a fool out of yourself.

357
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,806
Why not?
Why don't we go one-on-one?

358
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,811
- We'll see just how big a fool I am.
- Let's go.

359
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,404
Wait a minute.
Okay, man. Okay.

360
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,779
We'll do it.

361
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,442
I got practice tomorrow at 1 1 :00.

362
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,577
You meet me at the arena at 1 0:30.

363
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,086
- And be on time.
- I'll be there.

364
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,679
- We'll do it.
- All right.

365
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,418
Okay, guys. Come on.

366
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,891
If you got the balls, you'll be there.

367
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,086
What? Get out of there.

368
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,755
- I was talking to him.
- Okay. Take off. That way.

369
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,320
- Yeah, we'll see.
- That way.

370
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,172
Here you are.

371
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,403
You hurt yourself?

372
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,638
- No, I didn't.
- No.

373
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,305
What's the matter with your leg?

374
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,871
Nothing.

375
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,576
Nothing that's going to bother you.

376
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,119
What's wrong with your hand?

377
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,951
Hey, look, man, I don't want to play you
if you got something wrong.

378
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,719
- There's nothing wrong with my leg.
- Nothing wrong with his leg.

379
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,420
Let's just play.

380
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,861
That's exactly why I'm here, man.

381
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,729
I'm going to shut you up once and for all.

382
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,235
I mean, we love you when we're winning.

383
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,739
We love you out there yelling
and screaming when we're hot.

384
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,072
But, man, you come down on us
so hard when we get behind.

385
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,735
Why don't you give us a break?

386
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,803
Let's play.

387
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,849
Wait a minute.

388
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,908
Last chance.

389
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,352
I got nothing to prove.
You want to forget it?

390
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,619
You want to take it out?

391
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,422
You take it out.

392
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,097
Don't you want to warm up first?

393
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,599
No need.

394
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,365
That's one.

395
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,307
Come on. Put it up.

396
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,142
Put it up.

397
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,817
Damn it!

398
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,182
What is this?

399
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,084
That's two.

400
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,816
That's two.

401
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,289
Not bad, Maxwell.

402
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,496
Three.

403
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,327
That's three, Jerry. Not bad.

404
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,867
Damn it!

405
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,062
Damn it!

406
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,197
That's four, Jerry.
Stay with it.

407
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:14,742
Come on!

408
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,008
That's five! That's five!
That's a foul.

409
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,016
You hurt yourself.
Time, time, time.

410
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,346
- Take it easy.
- That was a foul.

411
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:25,912
5-1.

412
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,789
You got one, Alvin.
You got one.

413
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,356
Come on, Jerry.

414
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,831
5-2. 5-2.

415
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,596
Look out!

416
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,365
Oh, repeat after me.
"That was a nice block, Alvin."

417
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,040
Foul-mouth. Get off.

418
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,100
- Watch him now, Jerry.
- Get off.

419
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,544
- Watch the feet. Stay with him.
- Look out!

420
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,114
Attaboy!

421
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,879
All right.

422
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,315
- 7-7.
- Sweet!

423
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,054
7 -7, Jerry.

424
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,431
All right!

425
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,528
9-7.

426
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,505
It's 9-7, Jerry.

427
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,474
You only got one to beat him.

428
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,567
- One to beat him!
- Look out, look out!

429
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,202
Stay with him, Jerry!

430
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,975
- Aw, Jerry!
- How are you? What happened?

431
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,243
9-8.

432
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,558
That was a foul!
That was a foul!

433
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,890
One to beat him, Jerry.
One to beat him.

434
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,122
- Block!
- Roll in!

435
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,462
- Got him!
- All the way!

436
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,632
Damn!

437
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,102
Swish!

438
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,232
1 0-9.

439
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,774
- 1 0-9. Game.
- No, man.

440
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,540
You gotta win by two.

441
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,310
Two. Hey...

442
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,783
That'll shut you up, Mouth.

443
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,342
No, man. I wasn't ready.

444
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,479
- Bullshit!
- Hey! Come on, Alvin!

445
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,992
Look, man, I don't play that hard
against cripples, you know?

446
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,823
I could've beat you with his hands.

447
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,159
You're a half-court showboat, Charlie.

448
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,563
- That's all you'll ever be.
- No, he's not.

449
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,363
He's great, and you know it.

450
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,766
No, come on.
Shut up, Roary.

451
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,429
Hey, man, look, get out of my gym,

452
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,598
and take that other freak with you.

453
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,608
Yeah.

454
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,942
Yeah.

455
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,175
Un-fucking-believable!

456
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,649
Unbelievable!

457
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,118
Two points!
It was so close!

458
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,916
You're fantastic! All right!

459
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,184
You're unbelievable!

460
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,249
I was there.
I'm your witness.

461
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,760
- All right. I'm good.
- I saw it.

462
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,261
- I'm good, aren't l?
- "Good," Jerry?

463
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,730
- You're fantastic!
- And it's not a dream, is it?

464
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,030
- A dream? No.
- All right, Roary!

465
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,570
- 9-1 1 --
- 9-1 0.

466
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,265
He cheated on the last one.

467
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,274
- I'm going to buy you a beer.
- All right!

468
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,242
You don't want any cookies or anything?

469
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,039
- No, I don't want cookies.
- All right. Let me get this.

470
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,739
- Listen, Roary...
- You keep that.

471
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,076
don't tell the guys what happened.

472
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,549
- What do you mean don't tell the guys?
- They won't believe it.

473
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,382
Jerry, you almost beat the guy.

474
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,183
I surprised him.

475
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:15,158
Hey, Roary, nobody is ready
for me the first time.

476
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,921
- Besides, he had a bad hand.
- Hi, Jerry.

477
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,986
- Hi, Georgie. How you feeling?
- Fine.

478
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,328
But you almost beat him.

479
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,765
Oh, Jer.
Look, about your leg--

480
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,268
I know it's none of my business,

481
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,735
but you're sure there's nothing
could be done?

482
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,568
Roary, I had an operation
on my bread and butter.

483
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,404
- Bread and butter?
- When I was 1 6.

484
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,807
I went through the physical therapy.

485
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,276
I went through everything.
Nothing happened, nothing changed.

486
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,607
But they know a lot more now.

487
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,443
I know, Roary.
I've been to the doctors.

488
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,449
Listen, I bet they could
do something for you.

489
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,418
It'll cost a million bucks.
Who's going to pay for it? You?

490
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,149
I thought you said we were taking a shortcut.

491
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,589
This is a shortcut.

492
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,559
That's a shortcut-- those steps?

493
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,424
I'll race you.

494
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,361
Sheesh. What does that mean--
that, uh, "bread and butter"?

495
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,728
It means good luck.

496
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,790
You want to come up for another beer?

497
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,301
Sure.

498
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,132
Is it all right?

499
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,140
Anne's gone to Richmond for a while.

500
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,300
Come on.

501
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,400
Aw, sh--

502
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,003
Hey.

503
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,587
That's Anne.

504
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,453
Not so rough!

505
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,685
You're hurting me!

506
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,284
Roary, go around the back.

507
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,958
You said you wanted it, man!

508
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,127
- You wanted it, right?
- Take it easy!

509
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,728
Okay, that's how you're going to get it.

510
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,637
Oh, shit!

511
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,371
Get out of here, Jerry.

512
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,641
- Hey, beat it, huh?
- This is my house.

513
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,581
And that's my girl you're fooling with.

514
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,517
Whatever you paid her,
I'll see you get it back.

515
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,554
Now, please, get out.

516
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,393
Christ!

517
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,454
Look, she came on to us.

518
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,794
Anne?

519
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,800
Yes, honey?

520
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,802
Where's the money?

521
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,303
They didn't give me any money.

522
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,636
Listen, man, she took 25 bucks,
and I want to see it.

523
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,766
- Or what?
- Or this.

524
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,171
Mistake.

525
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,755
I'll give you five seconds to get out,

526
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:31,126
or me and my friend there
are going to hurt you.

527
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,891
I'm not even going to count.

528
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,489
You figure it out.

529
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,803
Starting right now.

530
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,337
Okay.

531
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,746
Relax. Relax.

532
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,374
Okay.

533
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,059
What's 25 bucks among friends, huh?

534
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,192
Oh, Jerry.

535
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,730
Oh, Jerry.

536
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:25,680
Anne, what happened?

537
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,649
I met this guy.

538
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,212
Jerry, he had such incredible stuff.

539
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,258
Jerry, it was heaven.

540
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,785
Listen to me, Anne.

541
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:45,029
I can't handle this anymore.

542
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,367
Do you understand?

543
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,698
I can't take care of you anymore.
I can't do it.

544
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,374
Hey, come on, honey.

545
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,277
When I get back here...

546
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,417
I want you gone.

547
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,755
Hey, baby, I'm pretty screwed up right now.

548
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,559
What are you talking about?

549
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,863
Just leave, Anne.

550
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,365
Jerry, I'm sorry.

551
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,171
It's okay.

552
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,241
It just didn't work out.

553
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,609
Don't leave, Jerry.

554
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,898
"Her huge melons
glistened in the moonlight.

555
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,400
"She smiled, taunting him,

556
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,663
"then slowly, ever so slowly,

557
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,365
she began to undu-- undu--"

558
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,668
- "Undulate"?
- "Undulate"!

559
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,107
- Undulate what? Her hips?
- Yes, yes, her hips.

560
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,237
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- "As her breasts moved toward him,

561
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,975
"bubbling in the night air,
he couldn't help but notice

562
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,109
"how she had grown from that small child

563
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,644
from whom he had once babysat."

564
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,426
"He reached out..."

565
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,755
Go ahead, go ahead.

566
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,423
"and gently touched
her large, brown aur--"

567
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:26,363
A-U-R-E-O-L-E-S.

568
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,995
"Aureoles"?

569
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,835
You're killing the story.

570
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,102
"Her large, brown aureoles"?

571
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,009
What? He touched her cookies?

572
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,512
Hey, guys, let's go to lunch, huh?

573
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,515
- I'm hungry.
- Okay, good.

574
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,517
Here's your hat.
Here's his coat.

575
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,418
- Oh, good.
- Blue, block that in the book, will you?

576
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,683
- Yeah.
- You guys still reading that dirty book?

577
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,622
No, no, no.
We don't read dirty books.

578
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,023
Hey, Max, I'm going out to eat.

579
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,288
You don't read those dirty books anymore?

580
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,330
- Roary, come on to lunch with us.
- I'm coming.

581
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,424
Roary, don't bring me
those chili burritos, okay?

582
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,264
What's the matter?

583
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,566
I got heartburn or something.

584
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,606
Get me a couple
bologna sandwiches instead.

585
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,072
With?

586
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,372
- Mayonnaise--
- Mayonnaise on white?

587
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,071
- White bread and--
- No pickles.

588
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,807
- No pickles.
- How about a Bromo?

589
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,542
Hey, Benny.
How you doing, Benny?

590
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,810
- All right.
- How's it going, huh?

591
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,852
- Coming along.
- Hey, Blue!

592
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,116
Blue, when you coming to see me again?

593
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,282
No, no. Move, brother Stinky.

594
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,292
Hey, Roary, when you see Jerry,

595
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,386
tell him his old lady took up
with a pimp in San Francisco.

596
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,294
I'm not going to tell him anything.

597
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,889
There's no need to tell him that.

598
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,196
Don't tell him. Right.

599
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,203
We don't have to tell him anything, okay?

600
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,432
- Right, right.
- Come on. Let's go.

601
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,834
- I dropped the book.
- What?

602
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,776
Wait a minute.
I dropped the book. Pull me back.

603
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,177
Don't lose the place.

604
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,441
Blue, don't lose the place.

605
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,280
We're going to lose more than that
if we don't get out of the way!

606
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,081
- Get out of the street!
- Oh, my God!

607
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,755
Folks, keep clear.
This man's a big one here.

608
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,126
Let them through, please.

609
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,196
- Let's get him up.
- Okay, let's go.

610
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,138
All right, there.

611
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,079
You'll be all right, man.

612
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,858
Roary.

613
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,063
Jer, how's Max?

614
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,228
- He had a heart attack.
- I know. How is he?

615
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,362
He's resting.

616
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,498
He hasn't been looking right, you know?

617
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,007
I know.

618
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,010
He's worried about the bar.

619
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,069
He just got a foreclosure notice.

620
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,913
He hasn't closed the bar
for one night since he opened it,

621
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,043
and he owes $1 1,000.

622
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,713
Eleven thousand. Jesus.

623
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,278
Let's get something to eat.

624
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,294
- So what's going to happen?
- Happen to what?

625
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,661
What are you going to do about the bar?

626
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,030
I don't know. What can I do?

627
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,728
Someone comes through with $1 1,000,

628
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,737
or we find another bar.

629
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,946
We could buy it, Jerry.

630
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,607
Come on-- Roary, we could buy it?

631
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,208
No, listen. I was going to tell you.

632
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,686
I got some money put away.

633
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,188
My mother, when she died--

634
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,383
they put it in a trust fund.

635
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,359
I was going to loan it
to you for your operation.

636
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,588
How much?

637
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,153
Bread and butter.

638
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,926
$1 0,000.

639
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,262
That'd be enough to get
a half interest from Max.

640
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,499
$1 0,000?

641
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,940
I did it for-- I did it for you.

642
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,273
But with that money,
we could buy half interest in Max's.

643
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,246
Are you kidding?
$1 0,000, Roary?

644
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,907
You have ten--

645
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,451
You've got $1 0,000?

646
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,419
Roary, with my--
I've got money saved.

647
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,921
I can get my operation!

648
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,753
- But Max's.
- No. Come on!

649
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,055
- Jerry--
- Max's? No. Roary, that's a bad investment.

650
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,425
Look, places like Max's,
they go under all the time.

651
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,192
No. Jerry, you and me.
We can make it work.

652
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,257
No, Roary. Please?

653
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,563
I want that operation.

654
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,070
You'll get it.

655
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,435
I guarantee you.

656
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,936
Roary!

657
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,407
It is just a bar!

658
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,277
I'm talking about my life!

659
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,307
It's not just a bar.

660
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,087
Jerry, it's family.

661
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,359
You're right.

662
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,872
There you go.

663
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,771
Here you go.

664
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,112
- Jerry--
- You're right.

665
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,341
You mean you believe me?

666
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,080
Jerry?

667
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,281
You freak show, I told you you're right.

668
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,387
- We'll get rich.
- Yeah, you and me, rich.

669
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,224
What a sight.

670
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,857
If it doesn't work out,
Jerry, I'll do it myself.

671
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,991
- I'll fix your leg. Hold still.
- No, no.

672
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,797
I'm gonna fix his leg.
I'm a doctor, really.

673
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,394
- He's a lunatic.
- Come on.

674
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,632
- What, again?
- Cottage cheese.

675
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,731
- Hi, Max.
- It's good for you.

676
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,740
Hi.

677
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,504
Where are my four beers?

678
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,340
Jerry's working on 'em.
How you doing?

679
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,880
Here you go, Louise.
Excuse me.

680
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,608
Thank you so much.

681
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,344
- How's your tips?
- Oh, great.

682
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,750
- Just run a tab on them.
- Okay.

683
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,913
Now, is there anything else
I can get for you guys here?

684
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,978
Hey, chef.

685
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,787
Ordering a tuna fish with Swiss cheese
and a roast beef on rye.

686
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,657
Tuna fish, cheese, roast beef, rye.

687
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,391
It's a good idea, the sandwiches, Roary.
We're doing a hell of a business back there.

688
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,696
Yeah. I've been having trouble
with the ordering, though.

689
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,701
Some days I don't get enough cheese,

690
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,536
some days I get too much bread,

691
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,042
and today I forgot--

692
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,102
I forgot...

693
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,772
I'll wait till somebody orders it.

694
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,339
- Then I'll remember.
- You're doing beautiful, baby.

695
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,112
Don't forget these.

696
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,450
Hey, Jerry.

697
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,581
- You want a sandwich?
- Nope.

698
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,956
Hey, Jerry, you read today's sports page?

699
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,325
It named Alvin Martin Rookie of the Year.

700
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,593
Jerry, he's been getting 3 million a year.

701
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,531
Hey, what's this?

702
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,297
That's Scotch.
I want two bourbons.

703
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,206
You get it, Burt, okay?

704
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,737
Hey, Burt, do you think he deserves
this kind of money?

705
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,474
Hey, Burt.

706
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,640
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

707
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,876
- Louise.
- Yeah.

708
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,384
Come here.

709
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,679
See, I got--

710
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:55,624
I got two cheeseburgers going there.

711
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,718
Just make sure they're rare.

712
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,388
Hey.

713
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,696
You okay?

714
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,704
Yeah. I'm just tired.

715
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,672
Your leg giving you pain?

716
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,368
A little.

717
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,740
It's nothing new.

718
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,905
Yeah. It won't be long
before your operation.

719
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,448
It'll be forever.

720
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,580
Sh--

721
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,857
Hey, Jerry.

722
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,332
I threw it away.

723
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:43,203
I threw away thousands!

724
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,401
Thousands of dollars on that bitch,

725
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:49,572
and she's off in some
stinkhole in San Francisco.

726
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,716
You'll make it back.

727
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,718
I wasted it!

728
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,682
I'm breaking my back.
I'm working two jobs.

729
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,055
I'm no better off than when I first met her.

730
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,094
And she's worse.

731
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,066
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

732
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,898
Hey, Jer.

733
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,870
You know how you're always talking

734
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,601
about how we have to forget our past.

735
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,668
Oh, bullshit!

736
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,906
Shit, Roary, I don't know shit.

737
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,711
Everything I touch

738
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,242
turns to shit.

739
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,221
I didn't turn to shit.

740
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,314
Well, that's because
you're already shit, Roary.

741
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,586
I didn't have to do a thing.

742
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,674
Hey, what's going on?

743
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,770
I'm alone behind the bar.
Louise is screwing up--

744
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,973
I'm sorry. I forgot.

745
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,516
Come on, get out there and help her.

746
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,388
Hey, Jerry.

747
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,965
Hi, Roary. How are you?

748
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,300
Hi, Anne.
When did you get back?

749
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,340
- I got back--
- She got back this morning.

750
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,433
I called her.
I wanted her back.

751
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,214
You want a hamburger?

752
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,446
Thanks. I have to go back to the bar.

753
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,080
Hey, Jerry tells me that you're
doing great business there.

754
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,556
Yeah, we're doing good.

755
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,559
I just wanted to ask you
if maybe you could leave

756
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,026
your other job a little earlier.

757
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:48,997
Burt's going to see
his cousin Joan in Marin, and--

758
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,966
Sure, I can come any time he wants.

759
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,696
Good.

760
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,635
You don't--

761
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,244
You don't have to leave too early.

762
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,280
I mean, a half hour would be good.

763
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,814
No, it's okay.

764
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,577
I'm gonna quit that job, anyways.

765
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,743
You're gonna quit?

766
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,150
Why?

767
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,415
You need the money.

768
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,582
No, I need more time with Anne.

769
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,531
Okay. I'll see you down there.

770
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,260
All right.

771
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,827
You want a beer?

772
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,032
- I'll go get it.
- No.

773
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,268
Thanks.

774
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,937
You sure you want to quit your other job?

775
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,105
Yeah, I'm sure.

776
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,046
Okay.

777
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,052
Have a good one.

778
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,383
All right.

779
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,185
And oil thyself, squeaky.

780
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,497
Hey, Roary.

781
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,732
I'll see you in a while.

782
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,737
Yeah, Jerry.

783
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,172
Yeah, I'll see you later, Jerry.

784
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,142
See you later.

785
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,679
Please and thank you very much.

786
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,216
I appreciate it.

787
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,588
I think we got trouble.

788
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,129
What do you mean?

789
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,561
It's up your alley.

790
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,292
No. A family--
No, I wouldn't enjoy that.

791
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,492
Go with the man.

792
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,003
- What is it?
- Stinky, shut up.

793
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,095
Benny, who's that?

794
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,571
Lucius Porter.

795
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,684
How do you do?

796
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:56,749
Mr. Maxwell.

797
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,853
I'm Lucius Porter,

798
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,024
a friend of Anne's from the city.

799
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,864
Anne has a ring of mine,

800
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,996
one that I place a great value on.

801
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,907
Now, if you would be kind enough
to tell me where she is,

802
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,069
I would be deeply appreciative.

803
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,310
I didn't know that ring was real.

804
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:23,183
It is of infinite worth, and I want it back.

805
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,689
Well, then, I'll get it for you.

806
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,055
I think she's probably already hawked it.

807
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,118
But if she hasn't, I'll get it for you.

808
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,290
If you don't, I will kill you.

809
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,030
I wish you hadn't said that.

810
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,800
I mean, that kind of thing--

811
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,467
that's not allowed in Max's.

812
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,567
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

813
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:50,738
I mean, I'm sorry,
but you can understand that.

814
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,543
You are a fool.

815
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,016
Get out of here.

816
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,417
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

817
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,927
Perhaps we'll get together again,

818
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,225
sometime in the not-too-distant future.

819
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,169
What's with the suitcase?

820
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,339
Look, I'm not staying here anymore.

821
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,543
It was a mistake.

822
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,085
What are you talking about?

823
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,815
Look, Jerry, I don't think
you should be here right now.

824
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,521
I don't understand.

825
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,528
Lucius is gonna be here any minute.

826
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,496
I'm going back with him.

827
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,398
That's crazy, Anne.

828
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,197
We're doing all right this time.

829
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:22,864
I've got money.

830
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,170
Yeah, but not enough.

831
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,041
I'm not hustling for Lucius.

832
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,983
He's just taken real good care of me.

833
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,752
I love you.

834
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,709
I am in trouble.

835
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:03,803
Right?

836
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:36,676
Damn it!

837
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,477
- You look a little thin.
- Please, no.

838
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,517
Have you lost some weight?

839
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,918
- Look, just--
- I think you just need a little rest, hmm?

840
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:50,049
Wait--

841
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,062
God, Lucius, don't hurt him anymore.

842
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,757
Honey, he's gonna be all right.

843
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,527
- All right. All right.
- Why don't you go on down to the car?

844
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,590
We're through here.

845
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,863
It's--

846
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:04,670
It's-- It's enough, okay?

847
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,887
Please, please.

848
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,653
It's-- I've had enough.

849
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,456
Where the hell is Jerry?

850
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,621
Never been late before.

851
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,130
He should have been here
over an hour ago.

852
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,166
It's just not like him.

853
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,463
I wish he had a phone.

854
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,800
He gets his calls from somewhere.

855
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,361
I don't know, maybe--

856
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,964
maybe you ought to go over there.

857
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,303
I think somebody should.

858
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,502
You want me to go?

859
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,101
- Hey, Max!
- One minute.

860
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,909
No. I'll go.

861
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,813
Louise, can you get down
by that green table?

862
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,783
I got to go.

863
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,986
Here's a guy doing figure eights.

864
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,060
Hey, hold it right there, pal.

865
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,792
I'm Roary, the chef from Max's bar.

866
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,834
Oh, yeah, that kid.

867
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,528
See ya, Roary.

868
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,197
See you later.

869
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,206
Jerry.

870
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,144
Jerry.

871
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,443
Why don't you get a telephone, Jerry?

872
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,923
Hey, what did you leave the door open for?

873
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,855
Hey, Jerry.

874
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:47,105
Jerry.

875
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,580
Jerry, sit up.

876
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,617
Jerry.

877
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,413
Jerry.

878
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:57,885
Jerry, I'll go get some help.

879
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:01,446
I'll go get some help.

880
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:10,664
Oh, Christ, Jerry.

881
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,258
Roary.

882
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,395
Your face.

883
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:19,306
Jerry, you're hurt bad.

884
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,866
Jerry, I'm gonna get a doctor.

885
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:21,968
No.

886
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:23,137
- Jerry--
- No.

887
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,376
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No. No ambulances.

888
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,712
Why can't I call an ambulance?

889
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,649
No doctor.

890
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,481
Nobody.

891
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,892
Roary.

892
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,632
Oh, shit.

893
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,375
No, don't take any off the top, Louise.
I like it just the way it is on the top.

894
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,777
Just take a little off the side, okay?

895
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,282
- Okay, just keep your hands down.
- Okay.

896
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,250
Hey, leave her alone.
She knows what she's doing.

897
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,685
What do you mean?

898
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,881
- Oh, hi, there.
- Hi.

899
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,924
How's he doing today?

900
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:11,017
Same as always, sleeping.

901
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,391
That's what he needs.

902
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,759
Yeah, but two weeks?

903
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,457
Does he talk about what happened?

904
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,397
He doesn't talk about anything.

905
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,594
Well, you know, you would think
Jerry would want to get better

906
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,034
so he can bust those guys up.

907
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:26,098
He doesn't get angry,
he doesn't do anything.

908
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,344
The other day I'm giving him a bath,

909
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,141
you know, massaging his leg
like the doctor says,

910
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,613
and I dunk him.

911
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,445
Roary, you don't do that.

912
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,509
It was just a joke.

913
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,815
He didn't fight back.

914
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,521
He would have let me drown him.

915
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,928
Okey-dokey, Blue, I think you are done.

916
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,525
You're gonna leave him like that?

917
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,695
- What do you mean, leave him like that?
- This is for you.

918
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,238
- For me, Louise?
- Yes.

919
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,637
A red lollipop.

920
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,334
Yes, you were a very good little boy.

921
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,842
Oh, wow.

922
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,970
- You look great, Lewis.
- Thanks, Roary.

923
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,775
Why don't you let me cut your hair, hmm?

924
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,440
No, I've got bad hair.
It doesn't cut--

925
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,006
Oh, no, you don't.
You have nice hair.

926
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:11,349
- Whoa-ho, there's gonna be sex.
- I can tell.

927
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,854
Maybe some other time, Louise.

928
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:16,256
- Some other time.
- Some other time.

929
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,123
I meant my hair.

930
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,186
Yeah, we know what you mean.

931
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,730
Okay, if you're all done up here,

932
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,595
I'll go set up the sandwich stuff, okay?

933
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,659
- Yeah, I've got to do some reordering.
- Reordering!

934
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,000
We know where you're going.

935
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,700
We know where you're going

936
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,970
- Hey, Louise.
- We know where you're going

937
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,602
- We hear you!
- Shame, shame, double shame

938
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,204
It might not be a bad idea someday
to take a little bit off.

939
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,375
- Everybody knows your name
- Whatever. You are the worst.

940
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,586
Hey, Jerry.

941
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,849
How's the water? Still hot?

942
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:48,481
It's fine.

943
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,254
I forgot to show you something.

944
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,024
Wait till you see this.

945
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,292
This is terrific.

946
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,960
Let me see.
Where the hell is it?

947
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,902
I hate that, when you know
where something is, and you don't--

948
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,338
you don't know--

949
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,136
Look at this.

950
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,040
Look at this.

951
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,579
Alvin Martin, $3 million.

952
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,012
$3 million.

953
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,245
Makes you about 2.7 or 2.6.

954
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,958
Give me your leg.

955
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,453
Come on.

956
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,659
Lift.

957
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,872
That thing getting a boner?

958
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,842
Whoops, sorry.

959
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,310
Didn't mean to make you smile.

960
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,281
You gotta start feeling better soon.

961
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,943
You gonna try to get back
at that guy Lucius?

962
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,646
I don't know.

963
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,245
You don't know?

964
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,756
Think about it.

965
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,155
I don't know.

966
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,626
Stop being such a basket case, man.

967
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,158
- Where's your balls?
- I got no balls, Roary.

968
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,267
What are you gonna do,
give up on your operation, too?

969
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,708
That's right.

970
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,519
Why don't you make some bubbles?

971
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,825
You'll feel better, you'll see.

972
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,767
You'll see.

973
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,578
Hey, Roary, you sure
you ain't bullshitting us

974
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,415
just to get me to take you guys for a ride?

975
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,852
Hey, Roary don't bullshit.

976
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,550
If he said Jerry played
Alvin Martin one on one

977
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,649
and almost beat him, I believe him.

978
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,160
We had bets down.

979
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,786
We had major bets.

980
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:07,852
Lewis, where's the book?

981
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,796
I didn't bring the book.

982
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,800
What, are you crazy?
You never know when you're gonna bet.

983
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,827
If you had your book, I'd lay odds
that we don't find Alvin Martin's house.

984
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,202
Yeah, well, you'd lose.

985
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,138
There it is, right on the other side
of this shrub here.

986
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,109
- It's the white house.
- Hey, let's see the magazine.

987
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,543
- Stop. Stop, Benny.
- There it is. There it is.

988
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,638
No, no, that's not the house, man,

989
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,548
'cause Alvin Martin's house has got--

990
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,779
well, you know all them
white houses look alike to me.

991
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,650
- Okay, let's go, let's go.
- You're right, anyway.

992
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,092
His number's 1 4458. That's it.

993
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,720
Right. Yeah, okay.

994
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:41,957
This is fantastic.

995
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,362
I almost moved into a neighborhood like this.

996
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,695
- Benny.
- Baloney.

997
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,258
- Let me have that magazine, Roary.
- Here you go.

998
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,804
This is a tough neighborhood.

999
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,567
Hey, this is the house right up here.

1000
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,800
Right up here.
Hold it, hold it.

1001
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,807
That's it. That's it.

1002
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,002
Look, that's the house.

1003
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,476
- What's the number?
- Look at that house, man.

1004
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,309
- 1 4458, that's it.
- Boy, look at that house.

1005
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,872
I don't believe it.
Are you kidding?

1006
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:01,939
So what's it gonna be?

1007
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,009
You gonna ask Alvin Martin for the money
for Jerry's operation?

1008
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,487
- I didn't say--
- Yeah, what are you gonna say to Martin?

1009
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:09,252
- Excuse me, Mr. Martin--
- Excuse me, Mr. Martin.

1010
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,349
Perfect, go ahead.

1011
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,258
- Give me the magazine.
- Oh, okay.

1012
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:13,488
- All right.
- Great.

1013
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,895
Looking good.

1014
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,057
What's the place look like?

1015
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,395
Stinky, it's beautiful.

1016
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,368
It's all in white, and it's modern.

1017
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,634
And Alvin Martin has got two
Japanese gardeners working on the lawn.

1018
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:24,832
- Japanese?
- Yeah.

1019
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,637
I thought Martin was a spade.

1020
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,143
Don't use that word when there's
another spade in the car.

1021
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,339
What? There's a Negro in this car?

1022
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:32,938
There are several Negroes in this car.

1023
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,041
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

1024
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,109
You know,
I never thought about it before,

1025
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:40,156
but it must be tough
being a bigot if you're blind.

1026
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,248
I know. I had to give it up.

1027
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,591
Yeah.

1028
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:50,120
Excuse me. Mr. Martin?

1029
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:06,947
Well, I guess Roary was wrong.

1030
00:58:07,015 --> 00:58:10,178
You don't want to die, do you?

1031
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:15,855
I'm going to loan you
the money for your operation.

1032
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:18,484
Now, it's not charity, it's just a loan.

1033
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,687
I don't want your money.

1034
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:22,787
Wait a minute.
Look, you little bastard.

1035
00:58:22,864 --> 00:58:24,195
I'm not finished.

1036
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:27,235
I'll be honest with you.

1037
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:29,293
If you hadn't almost kicked my ass
that day we played,

1038
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:30,633
I wouldn't be here now.

1039
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:32,696
I mean, your whole story
is sad and all that,

1040
00:58:32,774 --> 00:58:35,265
but I know stories that make yours
sound like a picnic.

1041
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,938
I don't want your charity.

1042
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:41,846
I told you, man.

1043
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:43,179
No charity.

1044
00:58:43,251 --> 00:58:45,446
Are you listening to me?

1045
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,579
No charity.

1046
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,161
Call it curiosity.

1047
00:58:57,232 --> 00:58:58,631
Curiosity?

1048
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,861
Listen, Jerry,

1049
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:03,234
I know you're good enough
to play semi-pro ball.

1050
00:59:03,305 --> 00:59:04,738
Can you understand that?

1051
00:59:04,806 --> 00:59:07,172
I mean, a hot shot
little white boy like you?

1052
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:11,144
Man, if you can pass like you can shoot,
you might just go all the way.

1053
00:59:12,614 --> 00:59:16,778
Hey, look, I know it sounds unreal,
but that's what makes it so good.

1054
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:18,478
That's exactly what makes it so good.

1055
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:23,882
What do you say?

1056
00:59:40,775 --> 00:59:42,470
Hey, look.

1057
00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:44,444
I'll send a car for you tomorrow.

1058
00:59:44,512 --> 00:59:46,173
Bitch.

1059
00:59:46,247 --> 00:59:47,612
Fetch, fetch.

1060
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:51,277
Alvin's got you in the best hospital,
at Stanford Hospital.

1061
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:54,584
The doctor for the Warriors
is going to be taking care of you.

1062
00:59:54,656 --> 00:59:56,920
- He's not bad, huh?
- Yeah.

1063
00:59:56,992 --> 01:00:00,155
He lives right nearby,
so he'll be conditioning with you

1064
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:03,356
or working on your thing
while you're there, and--

1065
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:05,956
I guess you'll be there three,
four months or something.

1066
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:08,594
I wonder how they can do that
with their mouths open

1067
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,831
- without taking a lot of water in.
- I don't know.

1068
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:12,896
You'd think they'd get sick,
or get a headache or something.

1069
01:00:12,974 --> 01:00:16,171
- Come on! Here, boy!
- Looks like they're choking.

1070
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:18,144
- I'm going to need you.
- What for?

1071
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:19,805
For the operation.

1072
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,439
You don't need me.

1073
01:00:21,516 --> 01:00:24,076
You got the best people
in the world around you.

1074
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:25,744
I'd just like you to be there.

1075
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,788
I've been working so hard at the place

1076
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:29,619
and taking care of you, I'm wiped out.

1077
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:32,854
- I need a rest.
- Please?

1078
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:34,519
Sure. I'll ride up with you.

1079
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:37,793
No. I think it's better if you come by
and you're on your own.

1080
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:39,959
Kind of make it look like it's a surprise.

1081
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:42,196
Wait a minute.

1082
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,864
What, are you ashamed
to let people know that l--

1083
01:00:44,939 --> 01:00:46,873
that you need me?

1084
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:49,603
- What the hell does that mean?
- I just thought it'd be better this way.

1085
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:52,146
Nothing. I'll be there.

1086
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:55,511
So long, Jerry.

1087
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,813
Hey, so long, you guys.

1088
01:00:57,886 --> 01:00:59,376
I'll see you sooner than you think.

1089
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:00,853
Hey, you guys take care of Max.

1090
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:01,980
Jerry, good luck to you.

1091
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:03,786
All right, Roary.
He's your responsibility.

1092
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:06,019
It's all on your shoulders.

1093
01:01:06,094 --> 01:01:07,220
Sprint!

1094
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:09,456
- Bye, Jerry.
- Good luck, Jerry.

1095
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:13,832
All right, fellas, drinks are on Max.

1096
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:16,029
- What?
- Hey!

1097
01:01:16,104 --> 01:01:17,435
Three cheers!

1098
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:19,097
Hey, let's go!

1099
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:31,642
Bread and butter.

1100
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,654
Hey, Louise, "apparently"--

1101
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:43,391
L-Y or L-E-Y?

1102
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:44,489
L-Y.

1103
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:46,056
That's what I got.

1104
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:49,098
Hey, Roary.

1105
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,161
I think we have to increase
our order on draft beer,

1106
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:52,706
maybe two, three kegs a week.

1107
01:01:52,774 --> 01:01:54,674
- That okay?
- Good. Make it three.

1108
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:57,840
Hey, Herrada!

1109
01:01:57,912 --> 01:01:59,038
Yo!

1110
01:01:59,114 --> 01:02:02,572
Here are your two
ham sandwiches with chips.

1111
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,550
- No?
- I got better things to do with my money.

1112
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:07,019
Hey, I got a new one for you guys.

1113
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:08,112
Okay, go ahead.

1114
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:11,989
- This ain't no Polish joke, is it?
- No, no, Mr. Wilkowski, never.

1115
01:02:13,394 --> 01:02:15,487
No Polish jokes.

1116
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:18,531
Roary, who are you writing to?

1117
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,589
What?

1118
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:22,227
- You writing to Jerry?
- Jerry.

1119
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:24,669
We haven't heard from him in months.

1120
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:26,536
Why don't you call him?

1121
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:27,939
Call him?

1122
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:30,437
I don't want to be pushy,

1123
01:02:30,512 --> 01:02:33,037
I just want to bug him a little bit.

1124
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:34,638
Listen to this.

1125
01:02:34,716 --> 01:02:36,581
Tell me how it sounds.

1126
01:02:36,651 --> 01:02:37,982
Okay.

1127
01:02:40,822 --> 01:02:42,449
"Dear Jerry..."

1128
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:45,853
Yeah?

1129
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:48,862
I just wanted to get your impression

1130
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,488
- about the opening there.
- Okay.

1131
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:53,159
"ln case you've forgotten,
my name is Roary.

1132
01:02:53,234 --> 01:02:54,496
"How are you?

1133
01:02:54,569 --> 01:02:56,400
I used to be your best friend,
so you said--"

1134
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,132
Now that's not too angry, is it?

1135
01:02:58,206 --> 01:02:59,639
- No, no. That's fine.
- All right.

1136
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:00,833
Go ahead.

1137
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:04,675
"I'm sure you're working very hard,
and apparently, you're very busy,

1138
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:08,204
"but I would appreciate hearing from you,
hearing about your recuperation,

1139
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:10,615
"and how life is treating you.

1140
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:13,017
"Stinky says hello.
So does Wings.

1141
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:15,078
"So does Blue Lewis.

1142
01:03:15,156 --> 01:03:17,750
"And Stinky has
a girlfriend named Claire.

1143
01:03:17,826 --> 01:03:20,761
"She looks like Shirley Temple, but older.

1144
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:24,697
"l think mainly she and Stinky
have a good thing going, sexually, but--

1145
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:30,769
"Blue Lewis doesn't have to read him
porno anymore, she does.

1146
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:33,069
Louise is..."

1147
01:03:33,141 --> 01:03:35,735
What? What'd you say?

1148
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:37,903
The rest of this stuff is just guy talk.

1149
01:03:37,979 --> 01:03:39,173
- Is that more titty talk, there?
- No.

1150
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:40,373
Let me see that.

1151
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:43,940
I tell him that you're doing a good job
and how pretty you are.

1152
01:03:44,018 --> 01:03:45,952
Thank you.

1153
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,954
No problem.

1154
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:51,057
Okay. "Burt and I went to Tijuana,

1155
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:53,116
"saw a lousy bull fight.

1156
01:03:53,194 --> 01:03:55,458
"They had this old cow
that could hardly walk.

1157
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,963
"A guy comes out, stabs it.

1158
01:03:57,031 --> 01:03:59,226
"Blah, blah, blah. Big deal.

1159
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,825
So why don't you come by?
Love, Roary."

1160
01:04:07,942 --> 01:04:09,876
I just wanted to write a friendly letter.

1161
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:12,504
It's beautiful.

1162
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:17,044
Do you really think he'll come back?

1163
01:04:17,118 --> 01:04:19,313
Oh, yeah.

1164
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:21,617
Yeah, he'll come back.

1165
01:04:21,689 --> 01:04:24,055
I know what he's doing now.

1166
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:26,787
This is a dream come true for him.

1167
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:33,229
And he has to spend
some time with his dream.

1168
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:34,598
Yeah.

1169
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:41,166
But what's your dream?

1170
01:04:43,578 --> 01:04:45,170
I don't know.

1171
01:04:45,246 --> 01:04:47,942
Well, why don't you spend
a little time finding out?

1172
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:53,514
Yeah.

1173
01:04:58,092 --> 01:04:59,559
Why don't you go wash the dishes?

1174
01:04:59,627 --> 01:05:01,618
- Oh, no. Must l?
- No.

1175
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:03,129
I'm only kidding.

1176
01:05:04,265 --> 01:05:05,527
Come on, we'll do it together.

1177
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,033
All right, I'll be right over.

1178
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:08,830
I'll wash, you dry.

1179
01:05:09,837 --> 01:05:12,169
No, you wash and dry.

1180
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,675
Yo, Benny, the girls are all alone.

1181
01:05:21,749 --> 01:05:23,182
Dance with them.

1182
01:05:23,251 --> 01:05:24,775
One, two, go dance.

1183
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:26,843
Hey, Roary, take this to the back table.

1184
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:29,412
Down there, to the right.
Thanks.

1185
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:36,095
- Bread and butter.
- Merry Christmas.

1186
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:37,188
Hey, Roary!

1187
01:05:37,265 --> 01:05:38,732
Where the hell is Jerry, huh?

1188
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,131
He'll be here.

1189
01:05:40,201 --> 01:05:43,295
Hey, if he isn't here at Christmas,
when is he coming, huh?

1190
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:44,702
He's coming, he's coming.

1191
01:05:44,772 --> 01:05:46,763
Come on, baby. Let's go!

1192
01:05:50,011 --> 01:05:52,946
Come on, honey.
It's still pouring out.

1193
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:54,208
Oh, boy.

1194
01:06:00,321 --> 01:06:02,482
Hey, dance with Roary.

1195
01:06:02,557 --> 01:06:04,457
Jingle your bell.

1196
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,251
Hey, Roary.
Come on, Roary.

1197
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:09,591
Let's go.

1198
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:10,995
Come on, baby.
Let's dance.

1199
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:12,464
Okay.

1200
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:18,472
Yeah, yeah.

1201
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:25,241
Oh, yeah.

1202
01:06:39,727 --> 01:06:42,753
- A couple beers.
- What's going on over there?

1203
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:45,060
Roary and Louise are dancing together.

1204
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:46,896
What? To that music?

1205
01:06:46,968 --> 01:06:49,459
Where the hell is that jukebox?

1206
01:06:49,537 --> 01:06:51,368
Here. Here, Stinky.

1207
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:53,669
Watch the stick.

1208
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:55,572
Stinky!

1209
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:57,167
Where are you going, Stinky?

1210
01:06:57,245 --> 01:06:58,576
Where are you going?

1211
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:02,149
Hey, come on.
That's my favorite song.

1212
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,916
What?

1213
01:07:04,986 --> 01:07:07,454
Hey, you cut my song, Stinky!

1214
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:09,456
Hey, hey, Stink!

1215
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:12,550
I'm playing the piano.
What the hell do you think I'm doing?

1216
01:07:19,133 --> 01:07:21,397
Hey, Roary! Roary!

1217
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:26,671
What is this, a woman with a beard?

1218
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:29,399
Where's Louise. Louise!

1219
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:32,173
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.

1220
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:35,613
Here, here.
Dance to some real music.

1221
01:07:35,683 --> 01:07:36,809
That's it.

1222
01:07:36,884 --> 01:07:38,010
Okay.

1223
01:07:38,086 --> 01:07:39,348
Hey, where's Claire?

1224
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,320
Here I am, Stinky.

1225
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:40,844
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1226
01:08:40,915 --> 01:08:42,849
Merry Christmas.
Ain't no drug dog, is it?

1227
01:09:39,073 --> 01:09:41,906
Merry Christmas.

1228
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:47,547
Hey, Louisie!

1229
01:09:49,016 --> 01:09:50,108
Oh, no.

1230
01:09:50,184 --> 01:09:52,675
- Oh, boy.
- Merry Christmas.

1231
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:54,687
Burt's kissed her.

1232
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:56,814
Hey, Roary.

1233
01:09:56,891 --> 01:09:59,951
Mistletoe, come on--
Hey, not me, the lady!

1234
01:10:00,027 --> 01:10:01,824
Jesus. Come on.

1235
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:02,954
Come on.

1236
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:04,122
Kiss her.

1237
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:07,190
Mistletoe! Mistletoe!

1238
01:10:08,336 --> 01:10:09,701
Burt's making--

1239
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,135
Burt's making Roary kiss her.

1240
01:10:11,205 --> 01:10:12,638
Louise, come on.

1241
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:16,172
With your lips, your lips!

1242
01:10:16,244 --> 01:10:18,041
Come on, now.
On the lips.

1243
01:10:21,716 --> 01:10:23,411
Roary, on the lips.

1244
01:10:23,484 --> 01:10:25,452
On the lips. On the lips.

1245
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:29,955
Come on, on the lips.

1246
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:31,423
What are you waiting for?

1247
01:10:31,492 --> 01:10:33,255
On the lips! Come on!

1248
01:10:33,327 --> 01:10:35,056
Lay it on her!

1249
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:39,524
Go ahead, Roary!

1250
01:10:40,868 --> 01:10:42,358
He's kissing her!

1251
01:10:42,436 --> 01:10:43,460
He's kissing her.

1252
01:10:43,537 --> 01:10:44,629
All right, Louise.

1253
01:10:48,976 --> 01:10:50,204
Hey, all right!

1254
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:52,712
Hey, Max, we need a bunch of water!

1255
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:56,409
Look at that!

1256
01:10:56,484 --> 01:10:58,111
Hey, Roary, come up for some air.

1257
01:10:58,185 --> 01:11:00,449
Come on, hey.

1258
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,887
Oh, what fun it is to ride

1259
01:11:07,962 --> 01:11:09,691
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey

1260
01:11:09,764 --> 01:11:11,425
Jingle bells, jingle bells

1261
01:11:11,499 --> 01:11:13,228
Jingle all the way

1262
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:15,098
Oh, what fun it is to ride

1263
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:16,898
In a one-horse open sleigh

1264
01:11:24,612 --> 01:11:28,070
We're going home.
The party's over.

1265
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:30,208
Party's over, huh?

1266
01:11:30,284 --> 01:11:31,842
Did Jerry come?

1267
01:11:31,919 --> 01:11:33,011
Didn't show, he didn't show.

1268
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:34,611
Let's go home.

1269
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:36,486
Can we wait--

1270
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:37,819
We're going home.
Blue, it's late.

1271
01:11:37,892 --> 01:11:41,191
But we should wait
for ten minutes for him, at least.

1272
01:11:41,262 --> 01:11:42,695
I'm wondering what
happened to him, too.

1273
01:11:42,763 --> 01:11:44,492
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's Christmas.

1274
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:46,499
You can't expect everybody
with the traffic...

1275
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:48,501
Let's go home and have our own party.

1276
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:49,558
To hell with Jerry.

1277
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:53,266
Santy Claus sees this mess,
he ain't gonna bring you guys no presents.

1278
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:55,434
- Hey, Burt.
- Yeah.

1279
01:11:55,509 --> 01:11:57,500
Thank you again for the cheap tie.

1280
01:11:57,578 --> 01:12:00,513
I didn't buy it. I stole it.

1281
01:12:00,581 --> 01:12:02,208
Goodnight, Max.

1282
01:12:05,653 --> 01:12:08,121
Those guys were really disappointed,
weren't they?

1283
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:09,816
Yeah, well, they love Jerry.

1284
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,790
He's like family.

1285
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:13,850
Maybe that's the problem.

1286
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:14,986
- No more.
- What?

1287
01:12:15,062 --> 01:12:17,895
Let's forget all this
and take care of it tomorrow morning.

1288
01:12:17,965 --> 01:12:19,990
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1289
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:21,466
What do you mean by that?

1290
01:12:21,535 --> 01:12:22,559
What?

1291
01:12:22,636 --> 01:12:23,660
It's a problem?

1292
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:25,035
Oh, he's well.

1293
01:12:25,106 --> 01:12:26,471
Well, I don't know.

1294
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,304
Maybe he just doesn't really want
to come back anymore.

1295
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:31,572
You mean, like, he feels
he doesn't fit in anymore.

1296
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:33,408
- Yeah, maybe.
- Here.

1297
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:36,041
I don't know.
Just-- I don't know.

1298
01:12:36,117 --> 01:12:37,141
Can I pull your collar up?

1299
01:12:37,218 --> 01:12:39,914
Oh, thanks.
I had a great time.

1300
01:12:39,987 --> 01:12:42,649
- You were terrific.
- It was so much fun.

1301
01:12:42,723 --> 01:12:45,248
And I also want to thank you
for the present.

1302
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:48,420
- Present?
- My kiss.

1303
01:12:50,331 --> 01:12:52,356
You'd better get home.

1304
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:53,832
- I'll tell you what you can do.
- What?

1305
01:12:53,901 --> 01:12:54,890
You can sleep late tomorrow.

1306
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:56,368
Oh, may l?

1307
01:12:56,437 --> 01:12:57,665
You get some rest, too.

1308
01:12:57,738 --> 01:12:59,672
- Yeah, have a merry Christmas.
- You do, too.

1309
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,799
- Goodnight, Louise.
- Merry Christmas. Bye.

1310
01:13:03,043 --> 01:13:04,510
Shit.

1311
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,170
"Don't worry, Roary.
I'll get it."

1312
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:11,184
Yeah, it's Max's, it's Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1313
01:13:11,252 --> 01:13:12,685
It's very late.

1314
01:13:17,558 --> 01:13:20,186
Do you believe Christmas Eve,
you drive for five hours,

1315
01:13:20,261 --> 01:13:22,252
only get three dollars in tips in this rain?

1316
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,320
Some Christmas spirit, huh?

1317
01:13:25,933 --> 01:13:27,161
Have a good time, pal.

1318
01:13:27,234 --> 01:13:28,428
All right.

1319
01:13:28,502 --> 01:13:30,527
Here you go, pal.
Keep the change.

1320
01:13:30,604 --> 01:13:32,595
Hey, Merry Christmas.

1321
01:13:32,673 --> 01:13:34,436
Hey, Jerry!

1322
01:13:34,508 --> 01:13:36,100
Hey, Roary!

1323
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:37,337
No, stay there, Roary.

1324
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:38,810
I want to show you something.

1325
01:13:38,879 --> 01:13:40,710
Yeah.

1326
01:13:43,684 --> 01:13:45,481
Look at this knee.
Just look at it.

1327
01:13:45,553 --> 01:13:47,578
- Beautiful.
- Oh, it's good to see you.

1328
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:49,020
- You look terrific.
- You look terrific.

1329
01:13:49,089 --> 01:13:50,420
Well, let's get out of the rain.

1330
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:51,719
All right.

1331
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,258
Them boys really
missed you tonight, man.

1332
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:56,728
Well, I got hung up, you know?

1333
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:59,061
- You could've called.
- I did call. I called you.

1334
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:00,225
Oh, yeah.

1335
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:01,393
Oh, yeah.

1336
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:03,801
Hey, I got a present for you.

1337
01:14:04,805 --> 01:14:06,033
These are for the guys.

1338
01:14:06,106 --> 01:14:07,835
- Terrific.
- Let's get a beer.

1339
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:09,967
My doctor says the leg is pretty strong.

1340
01:14:10,044 --> 01:14:12,740
Should be okay if I don't push too hard.

1341
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:15,748
You know, kind of pace myself.

1342
01:14:15,816 --> 01:14:18,114
I've really gone along pretty fast.

1343
01:14:18,185 --> 01:14:19,777
Alvin works out with me every day.

1344
01:14:19,854 --> 01:14:21,151
Ah, that's great.

1345
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:22,450
No.

1346
01:14:22,523 --> 01:14:24,354
This is great.

1347
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:28,156
I tried out for a semi-pro team
in San Jose last week.

1348
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:29,389
And?

1349
01:14:29,463 --> 01:14:32,330
And they want me.

1350
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:36,666
Jer, that's terrific.

1351
01:14:36,737 --> 01:14:38,796
This is Christmas.

1352
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:40,670
So...

1353
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:42,003
when do you start?

1354
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:43,907
Thursday night.

1355
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:46,071
Sorry, guys. Last call.

1356
01:14:46,146 --> 01:14:47,113
- Want another beer?
- Yeah.

1357
01:14:47,181 --> 01:14:48,113
- Two?
- Two.

1358
01:14:48,182 --> 01:14:49,911
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1359
01:14:50,918 --> 01:14:52,715
San Jose Thursday night.

1360
01:14:52,786 --> 01:14:53,946
Can you make it?

1361
01:14:54,021 --> 01:14:55,511
Can I make it?

1362
01:14:55,589 --> 01:14:56,851
Are you kidding?

1363
01:14:56,924 --> 01:14:57,856
I'll be there on Wednesday.

1364
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:00,953
I'll bring the guys.

1365
01:15:03,864 --> 01:15:05,855
My fault.

1366
01:15:05,933 --> 01:15:08,026
My fault, I'm sorry.

1367
01:15:08,102 --> 01:15:09,262
I almost had a heart attack.

1368
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:13,200
No.

1369
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:15,265
Hold off on the guys for a little bit.

1370
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:18,844
I don't know how I'm going to do.

1371
01:15:18,913 --> 01:15:20,175
I think I'd be too nervous.

1372
01:15:22,349 --> 01:15:23,680
Yeah.

1373
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:26,984
Good.

1374
01:15:27,054 --> 01:15:28,351
Can I bring Louise?

1375
01:15:28,422 --> 01:15:29,889
Louise?

1376
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:32,721
- The waitress?
- Waitress.

1377
01:15:35,062 --> 01:15:37,963
It's a shame you didn't
get a chance to know her.

1378
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:41,092
She's really doing good.

1379
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:45,070
She's-- She's something.

1380
01:15:45,139 --> 01:15:46,504
The guys love her.

1381
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:49,099
Gee, I hardly remember her.

1382
01:15:49,176 --> 01:15:50,768
She's kind of pretty, isn't she?

1383
01:15:50,844 --> 01:15:53,005
Jerry, she's beautiful.

1384
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:56,007
You really like her.

1385
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,017
No, I mean, we're just friends.

1386
01:15:58,085 --> 01:15:59,609
She's a good waitress.

1387
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:03,049
Sure, bring her.

1388
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:05,925
Merry Christmas.

1389
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:09,427
Merry Christmas.

1390
01:16:09,496 --> 01:16:11,191
He didn't even call or nothing.

1391
01:16:11,265 --> 01:16:13,358
His first game, he didn't even invite us.

1392
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:16,403
Who does he think we are,
people he used to know?

1393
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,598
Hey, I happen to know
you guys are wrong.

1394
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:21,641
He wants to see you bad.

1395
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:23,336
It is his first game, you know?

1396
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,037
I mean, he's tense.

1397
01:16:25,112 --> 01:16:27,273
He's under a lot of pressure.

1398
01:16:27,348 --> 01:16:28,906
He did send you gifts.

1399
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:31,349
Roary, you and Louise
are going to the game,

1400
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:32,885
and we knew Jerry before you did.

1401
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:34,284
Shut up, Blue.

1402
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:36,585
If the man doesn't care,
he just doesn't care.

1403
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:38,284
He does care.

1404
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:41,055
It's just that you got to give him some time.

1405
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:45,126
Look, if you don't
want me to go, I won't go.

1406
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,099
Well, the point is,
somebody's got to go.

1407
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:49,533
- Go ahead.
- Hey, Roary, you ready?

1408
01:16:49,603 --> 01:16:51,571
It's getting a little late.

1409
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:53,038
- Go. I'll see you.
- Go on, it's all right.

1410
01:16:53,107 --> 01:16:54,472
See you when I get back.

1411
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:55,599
Yeah, we'll be here.

1412
01:16:55,676 --> 01:16:56,938
All right. You got the camera?

1413
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:59,445
Yeah, I got the camera,
got the bulbs, got supper--

1414
01:16:59,513 --> 01:17:00,912
I'm not hungry.

1415
01:17:00,981 --> 01:17:02,505
Hell, I'm going to eat.

1416
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:04,949
What's on my plate, Wings?

1417
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:07,078
You got a potato at 6:00,

1418
01:17:07,154 --> 01:17:08,985
you got succotash at 9:00,

1419
01:17:09,056 --> 01:17:10,717
and you got a steak at high-noon.

1420
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,725
I don't like succotash at 9:00.

1421
01:17:20,701 --> 01:17:22,293
- All right!
- Move, move!

1422
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:24,565
Come on, man, me!

1423
01:17:24,638 --> 01:17:26,902
Coming down!

1424
01:17:29,543 --> 01:17:32,478
I thought The Mouth would be out there
hot dogging his way to overnight star.

1425
01:17:32,546 --> 01:17:33,945
What does that mean, "hot dogging"?

1426
01:17:34,014 --> 01:17:35,777
Hot dogging, that's like--

1427
01:17:35,849 --> 01:17:37,783
When a white player tries
to play like a black player.

1428
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:38,840
Yeah.

1429
01:17:40,487 --> 01:17:41,852
Jerry, shoot it!

1430
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:44,684
Oh, God.

1431
01:17:44,758 --> 01:17:47,249
Now that's a foul.

1432
01:17:47,327 --> 01:17:48,453
That's a foul.

1433
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:50,019
You okay?

1434
01:17:50,097 --> 01:17:51,257
Oh, no.

1435
01:17:51,331 --> 01:17:53,094
Walk it off.

1436
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:54,532
Walk it off.
Come on, Jerry.

1437
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:57,728
Easy, easy.

1438
01:18:02,276 --> 01:18:04,005
All right!

1439
01:18:04,078 --> 01:18:06,911
Okay, gentlemen, line up.
We got two shots.

1440
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:08,140
Two shots.

1441
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:11,882
That scared me.

1442
01:18:12,886 --> 01:18:13,978
Get it down.

1443
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:17,554
Hey, that's my boy!

1444
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:24,530
Hey, you know what?

1445
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:27,499
Kind of reminds me of what
it must be like to watch me.

1446
01:18:29,536 --> 01:18:31,470
I'm serious.

1447
01:18:31,538 --> 01:18:33,199
Hey. Thanks, Alvin.

1448
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:35,571
Hey, man.
It's all right.

1449
01:18:37,478 --> 01:18:38,945
Skin that!

1450
01:18:41,081 --> 01:18:43,015
All right!

1451
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,516
Yeah!

1452
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:47,008
Wasn't he terrific?

1453
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:48,452
Yes, he was.

1454
01:18:49,857 --> 01:18:51,654
- lncredible.
- Let's see, where are my keys?

1455
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:52,919
Here we go.

1456
01:18:54,394 --> 01:18:55,725
You got your keys, Louise?

1457
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:56,956
Louise has got her keys.

1458
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,088
Yes, I have them.

1459
01:18:58,165 --> 01:19:01,157
Look at that fire.
It's incredible.

1460
01:19:01,235 --> 01:19:02,930
You know, I think I like basketball now.

1461
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:05,096
I really liked those guys
in those little shorts.

1462
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:07,663
Alvin says Jerry could go
all the way if he wants.

1463
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:09,333
You know, I think he could, too.

1464
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:10,603
Yoo-hoo, anybody in here?

1465
01:19:10,677 --> 01:19:11,871
You know, he looks different.

1466
01:19:11,945 --> 01:19:14,175
Yes, he did look different.
He looked very good.

1467
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:17,649
- He looks like a gazelle--
- He did look rather gazelle-like.

1468
01:19:17,718 --> 01:19:20,312
- You little spider monkey, you.
- He looked like a gazelle.

1469
01:19:20,387 --> 01:19:22,150
Oh, no.

1470
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:23,382
Hey, watch the oranges.

1471
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:25,448
- This is the greatest night of my life.
- It was really fun.

1472
01:19:25,526 --> 01:19:28,791
I think I had a pretty good time,
too, you know?

1473
01:19:28,862 --> 01:19:31,387
Thank you. It was great.
I had a great time.

1474
01:19:31,465 --> 01:19:32,830
Excellent.

1475
01:19:57,357 --> 01:19:58,654
Louise?

1476
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,960
What's wrong?

1477
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:04,054
Nothing.

1478
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:06,429
Could you just go away?

1479
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:12,837
I'm going.

1480
01:20:14,842 --> 01:20:16,173
Louise...

1481
01:20:18,812 --> 01:20:20,040
Come on, we've got to talk.

1482
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:23,608
There's nothing to talk about.

1483
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:24,810
Bullshit.

1484
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:26,819
I know what it is.

1485
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:28,855
It's because I am the way I am.

1486
01:20:28,922 --> 01:20:29,980
That's it, isn't it?

1487
01:20:30,057 --> 01:20:32,457
- Roary, please don't.
- It's all right.

1488
01:20:32,526 --> 01:20:35,962
I'm not going to mope around
wounded for the rest of my life.

1489
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:39,426
I love you as a friend.

1490
01:20:39,499 --> 01:20:41,967
I got carried away.

1491
01:20:48,008 --> 01:20:49,873
So we won't be lovers.

1492
01:20:49,943 --> 01:20:51,171
Big deal.

1493
01:20:55,515 --> 01:20:56,982
I'm sorry.

1494
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:00,486
When I kissed you,
it's because, you know, I'm--

1495
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:02,647
I'm happy about Jerry,
and all he's doing,

1496
01:21:02,723 --> 01:21:06,625
and the kissing, the rest of it

1497
01:21:06,693 --> 01:21:09,662
was stupid.

1498
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:12,096
It's not like I lie awake, horny for you.

1499
01:21:12,165 --> 01:21:13,792
I don't.

1500
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:19,337
It was just a moment.

1501
01:21:19,406 --> 01:21:21,738
A big moment.

1502
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:23,173
No big deal.

1503
01:21:29,049 --> 01:21:30,880
Are we still going to have a cup of coffee?

1504
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:40,118
But, of course.

1505
01:21:40,193 --> 01:21:41,922
Come on in.

1506
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:45,291
Pick up the oranges.

1507
01:21:45,365 --> 01:21:47,094
Yeah.

1508
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:49,328
All right.

1509
01:21:49,403 --> 01:21:51,303
All of them.
I want them up...

1510
01:21:51,371 --> 01:21:52,565
- I got them.
- and in the kitchen.

1511
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,231
I'll clean everything up.

1512
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:56,071
I got it all.

1513
01:21:56,143 --> 01:21:57,770
I'll clean it all up.

1514
01:21:57,844 --> 01:21:59,004
Oh, boy.

1515
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:00,410
Wow.

1516
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,778
All these oranges.

1517
01:22:02,849 --> 01:22:05,215
Do you know how many
oranges we bought here?

1518
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:07,583
I love you.

1519
01:22:07,654 --> 01:22:08,678
What?

1520
01:22:08,755 --> 01:22:10,416
I said, "l love you."

1521
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:11,980
Oh, good.

1522
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:15,392
I love you, too.

1523
01:22:15,462 --> 01:22:19,558
Let's be friends
and forget all that other crap.

1524
01:22:21,034 --> 01:22:23,229
All that other stuff.

1525
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:30,300
Wait. I don't think
you really understand.

1526
01:22:34,915 --> 01:22:37,850
See, I do...

1527
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:39,909
want to be your lover.

1528
01:22:43,056 --> 01:22:44,523
And there's nothing
that I would like better,

1529
01:22:44,591 --> 01:22:47,822
do you know, than to be your lover.

1530
01:22:51,164 --> 01:22:53,792
It's...

1531
01:22:53,867 --> 01:22:56,062
You're afraid.

1532
01:22:58,672 --> 01:23:00,401
I think so. Yeah.

1533
01:23:00,474 --> 01:23:03,409
Of what it would be like with a cripple.

1534
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:07,743
Yeah. Yeah. And...

1535
01:23:07,814 --> 01:23:11,215
I'm-- I know it's all inside my head.

1536
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:12,911
Do you know?

1537
01:23:12,986 --> 01:23:16,319
And it doesn't make any sense to me.

1538
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,689
And I hate that part of me.

1539
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,161
But if we did try, do you know, and it--

1540
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:28,964
and, I mean, let's say
that it didn't work out--

1541
01:23:29,036 --> 01:23:31,061
I couldn't forgive myself.

1542
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:35,508
I couldn't.

1543
01:23:37,978 --> 01:23:40,708
And I couldn't hurt you that way.

1544
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,650
You're right.

1545
01:23:49,723 --> 01:23:51,213
It would hurt.

1546
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,857
So let's not push for anything.

1547
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:01,833
Let's just be friends, okay?

1548
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:14,377
Thank you.

1549
01:24:16,249 --> 01:24:18,012
Thanks so much.

1550
01:24:21,088 --> 01:24:25,115
Now, Jerry scored 426 points

1551
01:24:25,192 --> 01:24:27,626
in 1 5 games.

1552
01:24:27,694 --> 01:24:31,152
1 5 in the 426th

1553
01:24:31,231 --> 01:24:35,793
gives me 28.4 points average per game.

1554
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:38,599
- Please.
- Huh?

1555
01:24:38,672 --> 01:24:40,401
Huh?

1556
01:24:40,474 --> 01:24:41,907
Does that sound right to you?

1557
01:24:41,975 --> 01:24:44,068
Sounds right to me.
That's absolutely right.

1558
01:24:44,144 --> 01:24:46,112
Does what sound right to me?

1559
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:47,373
28.4.

1560
01:24:47,447 --> 01:24:49,074
No, it doesn't sound right to me.

1561
01:24:49,149 --> 01:24:50,241
What do you mean?

1562
01:24:50,317 --> 01:24:53,480
I got it right here, Stink,
in black and white.

1563
01:24:53,553 --> 01:24:56,078
In black and white?

1564
01:24:56,156 --> 01:24:58,647
Black and white.

1565
01:24:58,725 --> 01:25:01,216
Yes, I got it right here
in black and white.

1566
01:25:01,294 --> 01:25:03,956
The National Hockey League
has announced it plans to crack down

1567
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,622
on the violence
that's been plaguing the game.

1568
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:08,896
Hey, I thought that Jerry's going to be
on the Gil Stratton show.

1569
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:10,197
Relax, relax, Blue.

1570
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:13,398
If Jerry told Roary he's going to be on,
he's going to be on.

1571
01:25:13,473 --> 01:25:14,633
That the right station, Max?

1572
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:16,232
That's Gil Stratton.
That's what they said.

1573
01:25:16,309 --> 01:25:18,971
Hey, Max, make it
a little clearer, will you?

1574
01:25:19,045 --> 01:25:21,570
Damn you, Stinky.

1575
01:25:21,648 --> 01:25:23,343
In the NBA, the Warriors announced

1576
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:25,748
the signing of Jerry Maxwell
to the club today.

1577
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:27,616
Hey.

1578
01:25:27,687 --> 01:25:29,279
Jerry looks good in that.

1579
01:25:29,356 --> 01:25:30,755
--where during his short
but dazzling career,

1580
01:25:30,824 --> 01:25:32,985
he was averaging 26 points a game.

1581
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:36,051
28 points, you dodo!

1582
01:25:36,129 --> 01:25:37,357
Listen to Blue Lewis.

1583
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,193
28 points.

1584
01:25:39,266 --> 01:25:40,995
Hey, Max, drinks on the house.

1585
01:25:41,067 --> 01:25:42,659
In addition to everything else,

1586
01:25:42,736 --> 01:25:44,727
there was a lot of damaged
cartilage in my knee,

1587
01:25:44,804 --> 01:25:48,535
which had to be removed,
which means they had to replace it.

1588
01:25:48,608 --> 01:25:50,007
I don't think I've heard of that.

1589
01:25:50,076 --> 01:25:51,566
Well, it's a pretty new operation.

1590
01:25:51,645 --> 01:25:54,705
Anyways, there was this guy there
who had to get a nose job,

1591
01:25:54,781 --> 01:25:56,180
you know, get it reduced.

1592
01:25:56,249 --> 01:25:58,717
Well, they took the cartilage
from his nose...

1593
01:25:58,785 --> 01:26:00,980
- From his nose.
- and it ended up in my knee.

1594
01:26:03,023 --> 01:26:04,183
In his knee.

1595
01:26:07,294 --> 01:26:08,761
There's even nose donors.

1596
01:26:08,828 --> 01:26:10,489
That's right. People who want
to make extra money.

1597
01:26:10,564 --> 01:26:13,658
Make bucks on the side.

1598
01:26:13,733 --> 01:26:15,360
That's great.
She got it right away.

1599
01:26:15,435 --> 01:26:16,459
Oh, no.

1600
01:26:16,536 --> 01:26:18,629
I got to admit, he had me going.

1601
01:26:18,705 --> 01:26:21,833
I'm thinking, "Hell, that's a great idea."

1602
01:26:21,908 --> 01:26:23,432
Oh, boy.

1603
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:24,499
Roary, you are beautiful.

1604
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:25,943
Can I help you with that?

1605
01:26:26,012 --> 01:26:28,378
- No, thanks.
- Is there anything else?

1606
01:26:28,448 --> 01:26:29,472
Louise?

1607
01:26:29,549 --> 01:26:30,641
No, thanks.

1608
01:26:30,717 --> 01:26:32,742
- Roary?
- I'm all right.

1609
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:35,344
- Well, I hope you've had a nice dinner.
- Roary.

1610
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:37,549
No, Roary.

1611
01:26:37,624 --> 01:26:38,682
Wine in my water?

1612
01:26:38,758 --> 01:26:39,782
She's cute.

1613
01:26:41,428 --> 01:26:42,918
She is cute.

1614
01:26:44,364 --> 01:26:46,423
I can't get over how beautiful Louise is.

1615
01:26:49,903 --> 01:26:51,768
Well, thank you.

1616
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:53,100
Told you, didn't l?

1617
01:26:53,173 --> 01:26:55,368
Yeah.

1618
01:26:57,077 --> 01:26:58,942
Why don't you come by Max's
and see the guys?

1619
01:26:59,012 --> 01:27:01,446
I mean, you know, they love you.

1620
01:27:01,514 --> 01:27:02,913
It hurts them.
You're never around,

1621
01:27:02,983 --> 01:27:05,713
- you never come by--
- I will, Roary.

1622
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:07,150
Just not now.

1623
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,756
- Just come by Max's.
- I said I will.

1624
01:27:13,093 --> 01:27:14,856
- To Max's.
- To Max's.

1625
01:27:15,895 --> 01:27:17,556
All right, to Max's.

1626
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:19,531
And to your nose.

1627
01:27:21,701 --> 01:27:23,532
Okay. Strong fingers.

1628
01:27:23,603 --> 01:27:26,231
- Get a good head massage.
- I love it.

1629
01:27:28,942 --> 01:27:31,137
Boy, I'm cold.

1630
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:32,576
Okay.

1631
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:34,807
Wait.

1632
01:27:37,117 --> 01:27:38,141
There.

1633
01:27:38,218 --> 01:27:39,242
Thanks.

1634
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:40,343
Well, you're welcome.

1635
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,478
It's cold.

1636
01:27:41,554 --> 01:27:44,352
Why don't you go
dry your hair on the porch?

1637
01:27:44,424 --> 01:27:46,289
- Okay.
- So it'll bring out all the little

1638
01:27:46,359 --> 01:27:48,384
golden highlights in your hair.

1639
01:27:48,461 --> 01:27:49,985
Come on out.

1640
01:27:50,063 --> 01:27:52,554
Yeah, I'll be out in just a minute.

1641
01:27:52,632 --> 01:27:55,100
I wish I was a fish

1642
01:27:55,168 --> 01:27:56,635
I wish

1643
01:27:58,638 --> 01:28:01,471
- Floating in your bathtub
- Oh, wow.

1644
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:02,906
It's great out here.

1645
01:28:02,976 --> 01:28:05,444
Yes, you are getting
blonder as we speak.

1646
01:28:05,512 --> 01:28:06,979
Swimming 'round your drain

1647
01:28:07,047 --> 01:28:08,981
I've been meaning to tell you,
you look very good.

1648
01:28:09,049 --> 01:28:12,348
- You have been looking very good lately.
- Yeah?

1649
01:28:12,419 --> 01:28:14,080
Oh, my God.

1650
01:28:15,655 --> 01:28:18,317
Roary, you shaved your beard off.

1651
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:20,757
You finally shaved it off.

1652
01:28:20,827 --> 01:28:23,853
- No handle.
- God, look at you.

1653
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:26,922
God, you have a mouth now.

1654
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,058
Does it look okay?

1655
01:28:28,134 --> 01:28:29,897
It's beautiful.

1656
01:28:29,969 --> 01:28:32,028
I feel good, too.

1657
01:28:32,105 --> 01:28:34,437
I think my moves are getting better.

1658
01:28:34,507 --> 01:28:36,998
Watch this. I'm going to make a sharp turn.

1659
01:28:37,077 --> 01:28:39,807
You tell me if it's
precise enough, all right?

1660
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:40,868
Okay.

1661
01:28:40,947 --> 01:28:42,778
Dashing figure.

1662
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:46,747
See that?

1663
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,117
It's very good.

1664
01:28:48,188 --> 01:28:50,281
Wow.

1665
01:28:50,357 --> 01:28:52,086
Is there a need
for that particular move?

1666
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:53,250
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

1667
01:28:53,326 --> 01:28:54,588
I might have to defend you someday.

1668
01:28:54,661 --> 01:28:55,787
By turning left.

1669
01:28:55,862 --> 01:28:57,352
Yeah.

1670
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,728
You want to go to a movie
this afternoon?

1671
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:02,427
Well, I can't.
I got other plans later.

1672
01:29:03,803 --> 01:29:05,134
Okay.

1673
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:09,365
Roary...

1674
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,375
I have been seeing Jerry.

1675
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:28,055
Since when?

1676
01:29:28,128 --> 01:29:30,722
A couple of weeks.

1677
01:29:32,499 --> 01:29:34,091
Since the night at the restaurant.

1678
01:29:35,268 --> 01:29:36,758
Wasn't I supposed to know?

1679
01:29:37,837 --> 01:29:40,601
Jerry thought it would be better,

1680
01:29:40,673 --> 01:29:43,665
you know, for the time being
if we just didn't say anything.

1681
01:29:43,743 --> 01:29:45,233
Jerry said that?

1682
01:29:53,553 --> 01:29:54,884
I got to go.

1683
01:29:58,224 --> 01:29:59,555
I got to go.

1684
01:30:02,929 --> 01:30:04,419
Thank you.

1685
01:30:05,432 --> 01:30:07,832
Shampoo and everything.

1686
01:30:12,205 --> 01:30:13,536
Roary.

1687
01:30:15,575 --> 01:30:18,544
Hey, come on.

1688
01:30:18,611 --> 01:30:22,012
It's not like there's some
wild love affair going on.

1689
01:30:24,617 --> 01:30:26,744
Roary, please.

1690
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,347
- See you guys later.
- You got some speed there.

1691
01:31:37,624 --> 01:31:39,251
Hey.

1692
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:40,485
Jerry.

1693
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,993
Hey.

1694
01:31:42,061 --> 01:31:43,460
Roary.

1695
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:44,656
Hey.

1696
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:46,164
Great news.

1697
01:31:46,232 --> 01:31:48,996
Tomorrow night's the night.
I play pro-ball.

1698
01:31:49,068 --> 01:31:51,263
Yeah.

1699
01:31:51,337 --> 01:31:55,137
Well, I don't think tomorrow night's
a good night for me, Jerry.

1700
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:58,666
I don't think I can get
a mascot uniform in time.

1701
01:31:58,745 --> 01:32:00,542
What?

1702
01:32:00,613 --> 01:32:02,376
A mascot uniform.

1703
01:32:02,448 --> 01:32:05,315
You know, for your dog.

1704
01:32:05,385 --> 01:32:07,546
I'm your best friend, aren't l, Jerry?

1705
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,248
Isn't a man's best friend his dog?

1706
01:32:10,323 --> 01:32:11,620
Isn't that what I am?

1707
01:32:11,691 --> 01:32:12,817
Hey.

1708
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,518
What's going on?

1709
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:18,325
I'm your dog, Jer.

1710
01:32:18,398 --> 01:32:20,229
You know, your little companion,

1711
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,667
trails along,
follows you wherever you go.

1712
01:32:23,736 --> 01:32:24,896
Your dog?

1713
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:26,962
Is this a joke?

1714
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,203
Come on, Roary, what the hell
are you talking about?

1715
01:32:30,276 --> 01:32:32,369
I'm talking about friendship, Jerry.

1716
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:34,936
Of course, you're not
too good at that, are you?

1717
01:32:35,014 --> 01:32:38,279
Only when it's good for you.

1718
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:40,842
But you know what you are?

1719
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,047
You know what you are, Jer?

1720
01:32:43,122 --> 01:32:44,612
You're a thankless shithead.

1721
01:32:44,691 --> 01:32:46,625
And I had it over my head,

1722
01:32:46,693 --> 01:32:49,253
and I'm choking on all the shit
you dumped on me.

1723
01:32:49,329 --> 01:32:51,923
And no more. No more.

1724
01:32:51,998 --> 01:32:53,329
Look, Roary, if you're
talking about Louise--

1725
01:32:53,399 --> 01:32:54,593
I'm not talking about Louise.

1726
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:57,295
Don't mention her name.
You don't talk.

1727
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:01,704
You-- I'm feeling good.

1728
01:33:01,774 --> 01:33:04,038
I'm mad.

1729
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:06,738
You know? I think I maybe
should be grateful

1730
01:33:06,813 --> 01:33:08,781
for all the shit you dumped on me

1731
01:33:08,848 --> 01:33:11,874
because all my life,
I felt like I was dumped on.

1732
01:33:11,951 --> 01:33:14,545
This is the first time
I feel like I'm fighting back.

1733
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:17,784
The first time I feel like
I'm doing something right, Jer.

1734
01:33:19,158 --> 01:33:22,491
Thank you, Jerry Maxwell!

1735
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:26,227
Thank you!

1736
01:33:29,869 --> 01:33:32,064
You want to hear something funny?

1737
01:33:32,138 --> 01:33:34,868
I couldn't even kill myself.

1738
01:33:36,376 --> 01:33:38,401
What a joke.

1739
01:33:38,478 --> 01:33:40,639
I jump off the tenth floor of a building,

1740
01:33:40,713 --> 01:33:42,305
and I can't even die.

1741
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:49,149
A joke suicide, like a cartoon.

1742
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:52,915
I fell on a fucking Pontiac,
for Christ's sake.

1743
01:33:52,992 --> 01:33:54,789
Roary, please, I never knew--

1744
01:33:54,861 --> 01:33:56,488
No, you stay where you are.

1745
01:33:56,562 --> 01:33:57,790
You stay where you are.

1746
01:33:57,864 --> 01:33:59,456
You know, you never even asked me

1747
01:33:59,532 --> 01:34:02,433
why I tried to kill myself, Jer.

1748
01:34:02,502 --> 01:34:06,370
Nobody. Nobody asked me why.

1749
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:08,498
Well, I'm going to tell you.

1750
01:34:10,343 --> 01:34:13,210
Nothing like...

1751
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:17,773
the girl I loved being
stolen by my best friend.

1752
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:20,444
Nothing that romantic.

1753
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,920
Nothing that dramatic, Jerry.

1754
01:34:24,057 --> 01:34:26,184
It was just because of nothing.

1755
01:34:30,763 --> 01:34:32,731
I just felt like nothing.

1756
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:37,897
You wouldn't understand that,
would you, Jer?

1757
01:34:38,938 --> 01:34:40,405
You've always had people like me

1758
01:34:40,473 --> 01:34:42,964
to tell you you were something.

1759
01:34:45,712 --> 01:34:48,647
But I'm not nothing, Jerry.

1760
01:34:50,450 --> 01:34:52,247
I'm something.

1761
01:34:54,721 --> 01:34:56,348
I'm big, Jer.

1762
01:34:58,124 --> 01:35:00,149
I'm big.

1763
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:09,066
Bigger than you.

1764
01:35:13,372 --> 01:35:15,465
But that's not hard to be.

1765
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:20,076
That's not hard to be.

1766
01:35:22,081 --> 01:35:24,242
That's not hard to be, Jer.

1767
01:35:30,289 --> 01:35:34,191
Hey, about the guys,

1768
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:37,457
you don't have to come by
Max's anymore, Jerry.

1769
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:39,589
We don't need your kind of cripple there.

1770
01:35:42,835 --> 01:35:45,497
Have a good game, Jer.

1771
01:35:45,571 --> 01:35:49,166
Have a good game.

1772
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:51,499
My heiny!

1773
01:36:19,906 --> 01:36:21,271
It's open.

1774
01:36:27,814 --> 01:36:30,374
Hi.

1775
01:36:30,449 --> 01:36:32,542
Hello.

1776
01:36:32,618 --> 01:36:35,451
Well...

1777
01:36:35,521 --> 01:36:39,821
it kind of looks like we both done it.

1778
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:41,689
What?

1779
01:36:41,761 --> 01:36:45,026
I saw Jerry tonight.

1780
01:36:45,097 --> 01:36:47,190
So?

1781
01:36:47,266 --> 01:36:50,258
I didn't know you'd seen him this afternoon.

1782
01:36:52,605 --> 01:36:56,336
I didn't figure you had to know.

1783
01:36:56,409 --> 01:36:58,673
I wish I had known.

1784
01:36:58,744 --> 01:37:00,974
I told him I wasn't
going to see him anymore.

1785
01:37:04,617 --> 01:37:08,053
- You did?
- Yeah.

1786
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,111
I don't think he had too good of a day.

1787
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:16,428
So?

1788
01:37:16,495 --> 01:37:18,588
And I told him I was in love with you.

1789
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:23,894
- You said that?
- Yes.

1790
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:27,371
I told him that you and I were lovers.

1791
01:37:39,385 --> 01:37:41,819
We're gonna be, aren't we?

1792
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,879
Roary! Roary.

1793
01:37:43,956 --> 01:37:49,861
I mean, I went over there
and I told Jerry that l--

1794
01:37:49,929 --> 01:37:51,829
Have you heard anything
that I've been saying?

1795
01:37:51,898 --> 01:37:54,696
It was something that was...

1796
01:37:54,767 --> 01:37:56,359
Roary!

1797
01:37:56,435 --> 01:37:58,835
Roary, listen!

1798
01:38:02,775 --> 01:38:04,436
I want you.

1799
01:38:47,286 --> 01:38:50,449
Roary, hold me.

1800
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:13,244
Well, you gonna play or what?

1801
01:39:20,119 --> 01:39:23,088
I want to tell you guys
why I never came back here.

1802
01:39:33,766 --> 01:39:35,791
I didn't come back here...

1803
01:39:38,738 --> 01:39:43,471
because I was afraid
something was gonna rub off on me.

1804
01:39:43,542 --> 01:39:45,134
Come on, Jerry.

1805
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:47,873
Wings, I was afraid...

1806
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:52,079
that I would be...

1807
01:39:54,587 --> 01:39:56,521
a cripple again or something.

1808
01:40:00,226 --> 01:40:05,960
But Roary, he told me I'm still a cripple.

1809
01:40:06,032 --> 01:40:08,660
He's right.

1810
01:40:08,734 --> 01:40:12,932
In fact, I am the only

1811
01:40:13,005 --> 01:40:17,066
real cripple in this room.

1812
01:40:18,944 --> 01:40:21,276
Did you know that Alvin
was looking for you?

1813
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:25,649
That's too bad.

1814
01:40:31,757 --> 01:40:34,988
I really feel badly about that.

1815
01:40:36,328 --> 01:40:38,023
But I'm not playing tonight.

1816
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,361
You wanna know why?

1817
01:40:43,436 --> 01:40:46,030
Because I forgot
something very important.

1818
01:40:48,908 --> 01:40:51,741
I can't do anything alone.

1819
01:40:53,946 --> 01:40:56,039
I'm afraid to be alone.

1820
01:40:58,951 --> 01:41:01,181
That's a good one, huh?

1821
01:41:01,253 --> 01:41:04,984
The great Jerry Maxwell.

1822
01:41:05,057 --> 01:41:08,288
I was so into what I wanted

1823
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:11,454
that I lost everyone I loved along the way.

1824
01:41:15,734 --> 01:41:19,500
Blue, let's break out your book.

1825
01:41:19,572 --> 01:41:22,871
I'm giving 3 to 1 odds
that Maxwell plays tonight.

1826
01:41:22,942 --> 01:41:24,773
You lose, Stinky.

1827
01:41:26,545 --> 01:41:28,775
Hey, you got any tickets
for tonight's game?

1828
01:41:28,848 --> 01:41:30,179
Why?

1829
01:41:30,249 --> 01:41:32,683
Because you're not gonna
fuck around with our dream.

1830
01:41:32,751 --> 01:41:34,514
Your dream?

1831
01:41:34,587 --> 01:41:36,077
Yeah.

1832
01:41:40,626 --> 01:41:43,618
You've taken an awful lot
from everyone here, Jerry.

1833
01:41:43,696 --> 01:41:45,664
Don't take any more.

1834
01:41:58,744 --> 01:42:00,871
This is our dream, too.

1835
01:42:06,285 --> 01:42:09,652
Jerry, if you blow this,

1836
01:42:09,722 --> 01:42:12,418
we've all been robbed.

1837
01:42:14,193 --> 01:42:15,820
Don't blow it.

1838
01:42:25,905 --> 01:42:28,465
Don't blow it, Jerry.

1839
01:42:29,475 --> 01:42:31,340
Yeah.

1840
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:33,878
Blue's got 38 points on you.

1841
01:42:33,946 --> 01:42:35,379
He's gonna lose his shirt.

1842
01:42:38,584 --> 01:42:40,176
Hey.

1843
01:42:40,252 --> 01:42:41,310
Jerry!

1844
01:42:41,387 --> 01:42:43,184
Hey! Jerry!

1845
01:42:48,494 --> 01:42:50,086
Look at you. You shaved.

1846
01:42:53,132 --> 01:42:55,794
Hey, guess what? Jerry's on!

1847
01:42:55,868 --> 01:42:57,495
This afternoon,
before Warrior practice,

1848
01:42:57,570 --> 01:42:59,538
we caught up with the newest
member of the ball club,

1849
01:42:59,605 --> 01:43:02,267
- rookie Jerry Maxwell.
- Yay, Jerry!

1850
01:43:02,341 --> 01:43:04,502
Can I say something
before you ask me anything?

1851
01:43:04,577 --> 01:43:05,601
Sure, go ahead.

1852
01:43:05,678 --> 01:43:09,375
I would like to say "Hi"
to all the guys at Max's.

1853
01:43:09,448 --> 01:43:13,248
- Especially Roary.
- Roary.

1854
01:43:16,255 --> 01:43:18,621
This is a basketball, you got that?

1855
01:43:18,691 --> 01:43:21,091
Hey, Alvin, lighten up.

1856
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,627
Listen, seriously, look over here.

1857
01:43:22,695 --> 01:43:25,323
- I bet he's nervous.
- Yeah, he is.

1858
01:43:25,397 --> 01:43:28,332
How does it feel to come out
of semi-pros right to the NBA?

1859
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,631
I feel super.
I dreamt about this all my life.

1860
01:43:31,704 --> 01:43:34,434
Dreams! Dreams!

1861
01:43:40,246 --> 01:43:41,975
- Hey, Roary! Roary!
- Yo.

1862
01:43:42,047 --> 01:43:44,277
Tell Jerry when he comes back
to bring the rest of the team with him.

1863
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:45,817
Drinks on the house.
Is that all right with you?

1864
01:43:45,884 --> 01:43:47,351
Hey, I think that's terrific.

1865
01:43:47,419 --> 01:43:50,183
You have a good time.
Tell Jerry we love him, huh?

1866
01:43:50,256 --> 01:43:51,689
- Hey, Max? Max?
- What?

1867
01:43:51,757 --> 01:43:53,281
Can I go to the game?

1868
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:54,553
Come on.

1869
01:43:54,627 --> 01:43:56,857
I ain't paying you to go
to no damn basketball game.

1870
01:43:56,929 --> 01:43:58,624
Aw, come on.
Have a heart.

1871
01:43:58,697 --> 01:44:01,029
My buddy Burt'll cover for me,
won't you, Burt?

1872
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,159
"My buddy, Burt'll--"
I wanna go to the game, too!

1873
01:44:03,235 --> 01:44:05,897
I want to go to the game, too.
What do you want me to do? Lock up?

1874
01:44:05,971 --> 01:44:07,598
- Yeah!
- I ain't been closed in 25 years

1875
01:44:07,673 --> 01:44:09,607
and I ain't closing to go
to no damn basketball game.

1876
01:44:12,911 --> 01:44:14,845
Hold the bus! Hold the bus!

1877
01:44:14,913 --> 01:44:18,371
Max's is closed
for the first time in 25 years.

1878
01:44:21,987 --> 01:44:23,955
Burt didn't want to go,
but I talked him into it.

1879
01:44:24,023 --> 01:44:25,388
I said Jerry needed us.

1880
01:44:27,793 --> 01:44:29,192
Jerry'll be surprised.

1881
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:35,926
We're partners in the bar, not my girl.

1882
01:44:36,001 --> 01:44:37,127
Did you lock up?

1883
01:44:37,202 --> 01:44:39,363
I don't know. Did you?

1884
01:44:39,438 --> 01:44:40,700
I thought you did.

1885
01:44:40,773 --> 01:44:42,570
I'll do it. It's all right.

1886
01:44:42,641 --> 01:44:44,871
Stay here.
Don't anybody leave without me.

1887
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:08,924
Got a light?

1888
01:45:14,373 --> 01:45:15,772
Hey.

1889
01:45:15,841 --> 01:45:17,308
Hey, want some company?

1890
01:45:17,376 --> 01:45:19,537
Anne. Do you remember me?

1891
01:45:19,611 --> 01:45:21,374
I'm Roary, from Max's.

1892
01:45:29,722 --> 01:45:31,917
Roary.

1893
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:33,651
Roary!

1894
01:45:33,726 --> 01:45:35,193
Shit.

1895
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:36,454
I know you.

1896
01:45:36,528 --> 01:45:39,895
I didn't recognize you.

1897
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:41,296
You look great.
What did you do?

1898
01:45:41,367 --> 01:45:43,631
You did something.
What's different?

1899
01:45:43,702 --> 01:45:46,170
You lost weight or something like that?

1900
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:48,900
You look great.

1901
01:45:48,974 --> 01:45:53,035
All right, well,
I could do something for you.

1902
01:45:53,112 --> 01:45:54,602
No.

1903
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:57,148
What? You gay or something like that?

1904
01:45:57,216 --> 01:46:00,083
No. I've got a girlfriend.

1905
01:46:05,724 --> 01:46:08,284
Okay, then.

1906
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,828
Roary!

1907
01:46:10,896 --> 01:46:13,763
You do me a favor?
You lend me 50 bucks?

1908
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:18,565
For junk?

1909
01:46:18,637 --> 01:46:20,127
For old times' sake.

1910
01:46:20,205 --> 01:46:22,901
25, Roary?

1911
01:46:22,975 --> 01:46:24,840
Please?

1912
01:46:26,645 --> 01:46:28,010
For old times' sake?

1913
01:46:39,525 --> 01:46:40,958
Don't you want to know about Jerry?

1914
01:46:41,026 --> 01:46:43,620
You think I don't know about Jerry?

1915
01:46:43,695 --> 01:46:45,595
I don't know. Do you?

1916
01:46:45,664 --> 01:46:48,258
Well, of course I do.

1917
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:53,699
That-- That gimp!

1918
01:46:53,772 --> 01:46:56,673
He's gonna limp around
that fucking freak house

1919
01:46:56,742 --> 01:46:59,575
for the rest of his life
'cause he's nothing.

1920
01:47:04,917 --> 01:47:07,511
And you're a sucker.

1921
01:47:07,586 --> 01:47:09,986
And I'm a whore.

1922
01:47:10,055 --> 01:47:11,147
That's the way it is.

1923
01:47:17,529 --> 01:47:20,157
Oh, God! My behind has gotten--

1924
01:47:21,733 --> 01:47:23,963
Come on, boy!

1925
01:47:25,904 --> 01:47:28,600
Hey, don't let him leave without me!

1926
01:47:31,376 --> 01:47:32,934
Hey, hey, Roary, come on!

1927
01:47:33,011 --> 01:47:34,535
Sir, could you wait
just one second, please?

1928
01:47:34,613 --> 01:47:37,980
- Come on!
- I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

1929
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:41,042
Will you move your bun, boy?
Get over here!

1930
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:42,746
What are you--
What are you doin'?

1931
01:47:44,723 --> 01:47:47,055
- Roary, move your ass!
- All right!

1932
01:47:47,125 --> 01:47:50,390
Move 'em out!
Move 'em out!

1933
01:47:57,736 --> 01:48:03,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Golden State Warriors!

1934
01:48:04,409 --> 01:48:07,378
And introducing the newest Warrior,

1935
01:48:07,446 --> 01:48:09,641
Jerry Maxwell!

1936
01:48:09,715 --> 01:48:10,875
There he is!

1937
01:48:10,949 --> 01:48:12,974
Jerry!

1938
01:49:02,267 --> 01:49:03,700
Holy shit!

1939
01:49:03,769 --> 01:49:04,963
What happened?

1940
01:49:05,037 --> 01:49:06,334
Three guys fell down the stairs.

1941
01:49:06,405 --> 01:49:07,736
- Sir, are you okay?
- You all right?

1942
01:49:07,806 --> 01:49:09,569
Sir? Sir, you okay?

1943
01:49:09,641 --> 01:49:10,938
I broke my arm.

1944
01:49:11,777 --> 01:49:13,836
- It's Lucius.
- Lucius!

1945
01:49:13,912 --> 01:49:15,072
Who? Who?

1946
01:49:17,282 --> 01:49:19,045
Roary!

1947
01:49:19,117 --> 01:49:20,584
What did you do?

1948
01:49:25,257 --> 01:49:28,249
- You got him!
- Way to go!

1949
01:49:28,327 --> 01:49:31,524
Roary, I love you, baby,
but I'm movin' to L.A.

1950
01:49:35,801 --> 01:49:38,702
Sir, you all right?

1951
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:40,431
Lucius.

1952
01:49:44,876 --> 01:49:46,605
Hey!

1953
01:49:46,678 --> 01:49:47,940
Jerry!

1954
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:51,472
Hey! Roary!
