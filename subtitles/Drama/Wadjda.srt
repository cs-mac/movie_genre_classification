1
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,640
I devoted myself to God
and expect

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,480
Him forever in heaven
have my habitation among the excellent

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,520
My heart, I rinsed
in light of the law and faith

4
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,200
And my patience brings me right
When I'm lost

5
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Come on, girls!
Stand on your seats.

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,160
And again...

7
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,280
Wadjda!

8
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,920
Come here, quick!

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,140
Let's continue!
Repeat the first two verses.

10
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,040
Do you not think we should hear
your voice? Go there. Go there!

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,100
Now we start over again.

12
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
DANGER!

13
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,680
Do not forget the keys, locks do not over-
lock. Dad can come after work.

14
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
- Okay?
- Oh yeah.

15
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,760
It is long way and you're late every day.

16
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,000
Then I run another school.
If you're late again, I did not expect.

17
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,160
- Mom is not late. You just got here.
- Ignore him

18
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm not talking to you, little girl.
I tell mom. Mom every day since.

19
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Watch!

20
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,900
- Soon you'll be a pro.
- Where have you been all week?

21
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,500
Jar has a thing for you.

22
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,508
A volcanic rock from the
Rub Al-Khali desert.

23
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:57,880
It has a huge magnetic force.

24
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,600
Dad! Mom has been waiting
throughout the week for you.

25
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,240
I did not read over the lock.

26
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,000
What a mustache! Would suit as
advertisements for shaving soap.

27
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,080
Smarting. A real mustache
a falcon can land on.

28
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,060
You are right.
I would say an airplane.

29
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,300
Thank you for the breakfast.

30
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,760
Finally, my sandwich!

31
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,560
Watch it!

32
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,120
Who said you can catch up with me?
Did you really try to take me?

33
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,000
If I had a bike you would see.

34
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,000
Girls, stop!
Why are you laughing and talking so loud?

35
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,800
You forget that women's voices
not be heard by the men outside.

36
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,280
How often must I repeat it?
That a woman's voice is taboo.

37
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,280
- Sorry, Miss Hassa
- We will not do it again.

38
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,280
Wadjda!

39
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,000
Where is your headscarf?

40
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,920
Did you come to school with head offense?

41
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,560
Stop it, girls, do not laugh!

42
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,520
Good girl! Come on up!
Come up and play with us.

43
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,160
Wadjda!

44
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,640
- Do not talk to me.
- Wait a moment, please...

45
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,120
I brought this to you.

46
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,080
We are not confirmed yet. When I get my
bike and win the race, we're even.

47
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,388
Do you know that girls
do not ride bikes?

48
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,440
Double loss if it
is against the girl.

49
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,040
You! Go play somewhere else.

50
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,040
800 Rials

51
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,840
Too expensive for you.

52
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,760
- Hello
- Hello

53
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,800
Now I arrange lunch for you.

54
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh, God! The three hour trip
in a car without air conditioning!

55
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,260
This trip to the world's end
is killing me.

56
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,560
- Dull min. What are you thinking?
- I want to ride up Abdalla.

57
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,120
Have you seen the girls on the bike?
Selling fruit at the hospital this next -

58
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,188
- Would have been easier
than to commute and

59
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:52,120
safety Colours I hear:
"I want a bike."

60
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,360
- Where are the bracelets?
- I was only ten. My back went off.

61
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,640
There will be two more Rials each.

62
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,080
I had so much pain in the back,
When I sat down and did it.

63
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,960
God save me, for you! Take them.

64
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,960
It's your turn.

65
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,000
You see, girls.
There are men who watch us.

66
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,720
- In the Superman, so they can see us?
- Can you see them, they can see you.

67
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,840
Respectable girls are entering.
Other stops where men can see them.

68
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,680
What are you doing here? Go to your class.
Do not you see men up there?

69
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,200
- There was a thief with Miss Hussa.
- Dummis, it was not a thief, but...

70
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,040
her lover. Her father thought
it was a thief and called the police.

71
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,160
- Did she say "thief ", it was a thief.
- Of course you say so, Salma.

72
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,520
Just a sinner and jailbird
would show interest in you.

73
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,600
Wadjda

74
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,680
Can you bring this to my brother?

75
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,360
It's my permission to go out.

76
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,400
- You get ten Rials.
- Twenty.

77
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,080
God save me for you...

78
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,560
He waits behind the school
and has a white pickup.

79
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,560
Wadjda.

80
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,440
Tomorrow you wearing headscarves otherwise
to book a place in the sun for you.

81
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,440
If God wants.

82
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
Cover the face.

83
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,080
- Are you Abirs brother?
- Boob that I am her brother.

84
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,960
Do you have the card?

85
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,800
Here, however Abir said
you would give me 20 Rials.

86
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,840
- Really?
- Yes, by God.

87
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,880
Okay, then you may well not, then.

88
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,600
Huh? Even your money
cologne stinks.

89
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,840
Writing on back of truck:
" I long for you, my dear"

90
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,760
Do you know that there's a new invention
sometime called tape recorder.

91
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,800
- Want to buy something?
- How should I know?

92
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,160
First, if you look around,
then buy it.

93
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,480
- No tapes. Only CD.
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.

94
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,840
Do you believe me or do I
oath?

95
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
I can not find words for
to describe for you

96
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,720
Do you believe me or need
I take an oath?

97
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,200
I can not find words
to describe for you

98
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Love's loveliness in your way...

99
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,120
- Would not you like to be a singer?
- I'm a singer? God forbid!

100
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,080
I have been together 87 Rials cycle
and needs only 713 to.

101
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
Can not you lend me it?

102
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,560
Oh, no! Not the bike again!
Stop nagging, please!

103
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,800
Ms. Hussa said I must have
a headscarf, and cover your face.

104
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,480
That was neat! Veil!
Shall we marry you?

105
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,360
Very funny!

106
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,520
Come...

107
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,920
Try this.

108
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,840
Too long.

109
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,360
Keep it that, from the bottom.

110
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,720
Oh, no! A thief, a thief!

111
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,800
A thief jumped in with Miss Hussa
to greet her.

112
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,920
We do not know, it may have been a thief.
You should be ashamed to say so.

113
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,320
A thief.

114
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,320
A thief, a thief.

115
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,680
I need to buy a nice dress
to your uncle's wedding

116
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,800
- so that women think about,
before they start dreaming about your dad.

117
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,240
Forgive me, my dear Leila.
I'm really sorry.

118
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,240
Iqbal, our driver, is rude.
He shouted at poor Aisha today.

119
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,040
She cried throughout the journey
for three hours.

120
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,760
Abir. Mariam's daughter?

121
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,320
Come to her with a man?
Do you know who he is?

122
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,280
Now I know who he is.
A playboy like his dad.

123
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,720
Is he as good as his dad?

124
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,440
Frankly eat father looking.

125
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,000
The religious police?

126
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,440
Mariam is well completely destroyed. They
should have married her off long ago.

127
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,440
That kind of girls are actually
just a nuisance.

128
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,160
Leila, I have to stop now.
Dad seems to have come.

129
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,680
But I want to know what happens
minute by minute in Abir scandal.

130
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,960
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.

131
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,600
What is it?

132
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,000
Do not worry. We marry not
you away. Go and saw hi to daddy.

133
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,880
Oh, God, why I changed my game?
This is strange, as I have lost.

134
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,400
- Is the score right, or last year?
- Really. I'm good with math.

135
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,760
The proof? Pythagoras is God
miracle: triangle remains the same.

136
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,840
It sounds like you know
what you are talking about.

137
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm saving for a bike.

138
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,560
I lost.

139
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,160
Where is the food?

140
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,120
What a beauty!

141
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,760
- A superstar is here.
- Get out! What do you mean "superstar"?

142
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,840
Why is your mom around
and looking for a bride to you?

143
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,800
I doubt that
she try so much.

144
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,440
- Come play with me.
- I can not play.

145
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,960
Let me play.

146
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,720
Band with love songs.

147
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,600
Bracelets for football clubs.

148
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,560
Do you have a fan club for fotball?

149
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,120
Do not you know these things
are banned in school?

150
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,720
Abir always behaved well.
She never caused problems.

151
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:28,240
Do you know that the religious police came
on her yesterday with a strange man?

152
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,680
Arranged meeting you yesterday
between Abir and this man?

153
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,840
- No, ma'am, I did not.
- Do not lie.

154
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm sure you were involved.
I just do not know how.

155
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,920
What shall we do with you now?
Expel you?

156
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,760
One moment, Miss Jamila.
Let me be clear with this girl.

157
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:11,560
You can go back to your class now.
We'll see what we will do with you later.

158
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:29,520
Replace those ugly shoes, have regular
black shoes like the other girls.

159
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,320
What is this?

160
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,040
The basis for religious club
competition in the Koran knowledge.

161
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,560
I really do not know
what I say. Principal.

162
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,600
All this for a bicycle's sake.
As long as I live, no purchase cycle.

163
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,120
Should I wait until
you get kicked out?

164
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,960
Turn off the damn radio
and these infernal songs.

165
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,720
The songs have just come up with
bane to us.

166
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,520
You are not better than Abir.
The parents married her off.

167
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,560
Should I pay? Can not you pay
for once?

168
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,000
Where's your mileage? Should everything
be put into savings association.

169
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,360
Where have you dowry for the next bride?
What a nifty groom.

170
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,760
Do you think I yearn to
support two families?

171
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,640
Give me a son. Everything will be fine.

172
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,800
But we both know that it will not.

173
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,800
Forget it and do not count
I will at all next week.

174
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,240
Do not come! Go home to your mother.
Turn your heads together and find brides.

175
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,320
Just an hour I wait. You will be
late, I will go. You take a taxi.

176
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,120
That's enough, Iqbal. We get it.

177
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,840
Who is she, that little one, Iqbal?

178
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,480
Little girl, my daughter.
She is three years old.

179
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,960
She is the school now.
I do not go to school.

180
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,680
- It shows. You can not behave yourself.
- Shut up, you must not say so.

181
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,840
You can not behave yourself.

182
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,160
I do fancy bracelet.
You give me ten rials per piece?

183
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,640
No, thank you. I'll get from China.
100 for 10 Rials.

184
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,880
- Can China make our country's colors?
- You mean like these?

185
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,160
- Can I try it?
- Sure.

186
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,280
At the far end of the corridor
A ladies.

187
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,920
If it is too large,
we can sew it up.

188
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,120
Thank you.

189
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,200
What do you think of the dress?
Would your dad like it?

190
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,320
We go back to the clerk,
Colours so they sew into it a bit.

191
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,880
We go before Iqbal gets angry
and leave us.

192
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,160
Do not worry, he will not go away.

193
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,960
Came here with my dress.

194
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,248
Who was the boy who
spoke about the bike?

195
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:30,680
What boy? What are
you talking about?

196
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,440
You know very well.
Do not sell my bike to someone else.

197
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,160
Here. I mixed a tape to you,
because we are friends now.

198
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,600
But do not sell my bike to anyone.

199
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,480
With God's will.

200
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Ms. Hussa will explain the rules
for Quran competition.

201
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,920
It is about five weeks.

202
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,480
- I send around a sign-up sheet.
- Make the headmaster.

203
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,480
Good news, girls. The prize has been
increased to 1,000 Rials, from 800.

204
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,160
You will be the first five sections.

205
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,840
The competition is in two parts.

206
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,200
First, the terms and background
to God's revelation in the verses.

207
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,840
Second part is the recitation.

208
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,560
The recitation should be with
the correct pronunciation.

209
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,280
I repeat.
Correct pronunciation is a must.

210
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,000
Good luck in your endeavors.

211
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,520
What do you want?

212
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,600
I've thought a lot about what you said.
I'm willing to change my mind.

213
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,080
God be praised! Suddenly only?

214
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,840
I want to become member
religious club.

215
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,240
How much?

216
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,720
Only 80 Rials.
Cheaper than a bike, right?

217
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,520
Is 62 okay?

218
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,480
" Choose the right answer.
What are sabianerna?"

219
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,520
"Wrong. Retry.
What are sabianerna?"

220
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
Okay, brother!

221
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,480
"Wrong. Retry.
What are sabianerna?"

222
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,280
- How should I know?
- Iqbal!

223
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,600
You Colours your paycheck each month,
whether you're me or not.

224
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,320
Why do you speak so to me?
Have you no shame?

225
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,080
How so? Do you believe that there is
other drivers here?

226
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,160
Tomorrow I get
a better driver.

227
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,880
Guys! I 'll be late
to school. I must go.

228
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,480
Abdalla, how do I get to Derah?

229
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,040
Come on.

230
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,160
Hide your face.
I say you are my sister.

231
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:47,040
Your sister? No one believes you. I am
too cute to be your sister.

232
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,000
"I can not arrange transportation today.
Could it not be seen as emergency leave?"

233
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,640
I still have leave to withdraw.

234
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,360
Certainly. Next Month
I can stand in for others.

235
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,160
It is very kind of you.
See you tomorrow. Take care of yourself.

236
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:44,120
- Do you know where the driver Iqbal live?
- Many drivers named Iqbal here.

237
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,440
I hope we are going in
the right direction.

238
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,640
That could be Iqbal's car.

239
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,160
Yes, it's his.

240
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,680
What do you want?

241
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,360
Iqbal?

242
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,560
This is not my thing.
You may speak for yourself.

243
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,800
All right.

244
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,760
- You? What do you want?
- Iqbal, why do you do so?

245
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,200
Go away.

246
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
- Where is your residence?
- How so? What do you want?

247
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,560
It's a good job. Run Wadjdas
mother again, so it is quiet.

248
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,168
My uncle, with the mustache,
I'll speak with him.

249
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:42,680
You do not have permission.

250
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,120
" My uncle, with the mustache..."

251
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,480
He knew right away.
The mustache is like a trademark.

252
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,080
They say the son sat explosives
around the waist and bam... He died.

253
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,920
- Clueless type! It makes the pain.
- Dying man of God is like pinpricks.

254
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,440
And then you fly up
and get 70 chicks.

255
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,680
Can you?

256
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,240
Pang! 70 bikes!

257
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,480
You have misunderstood the total.
" 70 bikes," she says.

258
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,600
Come on. Have not you missed us?
You have kept you away for two weeks.

259
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,760
The key is:
Do you think of us or do you have others?

260
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:01,440
If you have the moon,
Why are you looking among the stars?

261
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,160
Okay. Take care of yourself.

262
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Continue studying.

263
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,520
Hello? Hello, Leila.

264
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:27,240
So. Will you come?
Do you take the money you have for me?

265
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,080
Is that true?
Do you work at the hospital here next?

266
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,520
Is your husband with the
that you work together with men?

267
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,120
What do you want?

268
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,668
My uncle asked me to
hang Ijusslingor across

269
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:50,120
the street and pay
them on your roof.

270
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,948
Attach them to the
neighboring house's roof.

271
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,680
Not on our roof.

272
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:00,120
They do not have a pole to attach in.
Your roof is the only one that has one.

273
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,800
Wait a minute.

274
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,320
Mom...

275
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,520
Thank you, darling. When you want,
you may be the world's rarest.

276
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,000
Abdalla to turn on Ijusslingor
roof, so his uncle wins the election.

277
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,960
Say no. Not one of us,
so we do not vote for him.

278
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,480
Okay, you can go up on a condition.
In the morning, take your bike.

279
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,240
Hello, Wadjda.

280
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,440
You have been great and you are so sweet.

281
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,480
- Where's Mom?
- She will.

282
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,080
- How is school?
- I do not like it but it's okay.

283
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,360
Traitor! I work in the hospital
and I know the last time?

284
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,160
Finally with Iqbal! Three hours
in his car every day took killing me.

285
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,320
In addition, the hospital
good hours and good pay.

286
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,960
And so the waiting driver at me.

287
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,720
When is the party?

288
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,000
Next month. Going to buy dress
to Wadjdas uncle's wedding.

289
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,920
Perhaps future bi wife there.

290
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,280
God help those who become his concubine.
you can show her hell middle of the day.

291
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,008
By the way, they are
hiring at the hospital.

292
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:46,520
We could talk all day.

293
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,800
My husband is jealous. Seeing someone
on me, he turns on the globe.

294
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,320
Stop it. You blame everything
on your poor husband.

295
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,040
- What is it?
- It will help you learn to ride a bike.

296
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,800
I have to hang up the lights,
can not push on you.

297
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,280
You think I'm a knatting?

298
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,920
I took off the training wheels.

299
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,440
You get five Rials if you stop crying.
1
00:47:03,360... > 00:47:06,240

300
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,320
Have all his Koran?

301
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:29,480
Before we begin, you have the mens must
not touch the Quran without Kleenex.

302
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,280
It's no laughing matter.
You are young women now.

303
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,960
I said stop.

304
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,840
You take it to the edge with a Kleenex,
not with your fingers.

305
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,440
Page 87.

306
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,280
Start with Surat al -Nisa, Ayat 59.

307
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,600
Let's start with the new face.
Wadjda.

308
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,720
Wadjda, start reading.

309
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,680
- " O you who believe!"
- Higher.

310
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,720
" Believers!"

311
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:13,280
- "Obey God and..."
- "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger..."

312
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,308
- "..And those among you..."

313
00:48:22,321 --> 00:48:24,880
- "...To whom responsibility
has been entrusted..."

314
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:31,160
- ".. And if you happen to" branch "..."
- What " branch"? You read wrong.

315
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,440
- ".. And if you get into dispute..."
- "... Happen in dispute ; Leave then..."

316
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:42,720
- ".. And if you get into a dispute,
transferable when the judgment of God."

317
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,720
- Enough.
- Noura, continue.

318
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,408
"O you who believe!
Obey Allah and obey the

319
00:48:56,421 --> 00:48:58,960
Messenger, and those
of you for whom..."

320
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,208
"... authority and
responsibility entrusted;

321
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:03,320
and if you happen
to in dispute " -

322
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,080
- " Transferable when deciding to God
and the Messenger..."

323
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,600
So much pounding on a bike
and you can not even ride a bike.

324
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,280
I want to buy one. I have a plan.

325
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,520
- What is it?
- An antenna for all radio stations.

326
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,840
My uncle will speak
with two famous Quran Reader-

327
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,320
- Who " get one's heart to melt."

328
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,400
You have not heard mother sing.
She should have her own channel.

329
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,040
We talk about this later.

330
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,960
- Where's the nail polish?
- I hid it there, when the creature came.

331
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:51,120
What are you doing here?
Why did you run your hand under her skirt?

332
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,640
Go immediately into my office.

333
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:32,480
Wadjda, wake up, sweetheart.
Get up, so we read the dawn prayer.

334
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,200
I saw girls cycling on TV.
Give me the money for a bike.

335
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,760
I know you have money.
I saw them in the box.

336
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,560
Here bicycles are not girls. You will not
be able to have children if you ride.

337
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,240
You cycle not
and you can not have children.

338
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,840
How can you say so?
I almost died when I found you.

339
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,200
Wash before prayer.

340
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:40,160
Girls!
Who will find a 'Tajwid' on page 92?

341
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,760
- Which verse?
- Verse 88?

342
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,880
"He who..."

343
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,920
- What kind of 'Tajwid' recitation?
- " Idgham?"

344
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,080
- Moughanna.
- Excellent!

345
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,920
What are you thinking, Wadjda?

346
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,760
The fact that this competition
is very difficult Colours me.

347
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,080
I listened to the Quran radio yesterday.

348
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,400
"The learning of the Quran difficult
for you, God will reward you twice"

349
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,068
Good.

350
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:14,600
I want you all to look
Wadjda as an example -

351
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,840
- Someone who endeavors
and is committed to God and His Prophet.

352
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,760
- You are making progress.
- Thank you, miss.

353
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,120
Sorry.

354
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,760
Wadjda, Miss Hussa said
she wants to talk to you.

355
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,240
Put the Quran.

356
00:54:53,360 --> 00:55:00,480
You will be surprised, but you remind me
of myself at your age.

357
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,040
And look at me now.

358
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,920
Close the door.

359
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,160
States you still think you did not
do anything behind the school?

360
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:30,600
Read magazines, did none of
what you have in mind. Ask her.

361
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,960
I'm not sure, miss.
I was so far away.

362
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:52,080
Thanks, Wadjda. You can go back.
Give this folder to Miss Jamila.

363
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,320
Close the door.

364
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:14,160
This is a declaration.
Sign in and you get to stay in school.

365
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:35,640
In the name of God, I congratulate you all
for your efforts this semester.

366
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:44,640
I remind you that the school is
a place of learning and morality.

367
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,440
Listen carefully.

368
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:53,440
Two students were found in the backyard
when they committed a sin.

369
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,120
The two are...

370
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,440
Faten Khaled and Fatima Abdalla.

371
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,960
To avoid similar things -

372
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,960
- May you no longer bring flowers
to school -

373
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,400
- And do not give each other
neither love letter or fan mail.

374
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,400
And you can not hold hands.

375
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,720
Have you understood?

376
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,520
Then you can go back to your classroom.

377
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,640
Your bags are there.

378
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,040
Mommy! Do not touch me.

379
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,640
I would like to have shorter here
as Lubna Abdul Aziz.

380
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,640
Cut it, then.

381
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,280
Your dad loves my long soft hair.

382
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,800
Mom saw the lights
but forgot to ask me about them again

383
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,680
She does not know if the lights?
And your dad?

384
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:13,800
I think they like your uncle now that he's
been in the Quran Radio.

385
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,760
- I bleed.
- Where does the blood? What a shame!

386
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,920
From my lap.

387
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,440
How many times can I say that bikes
are not for girls.

388
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,528
Think you can do as boys?

389
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:38,480
And you? Why did you
let her ride a bike?

390
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,240
Come back! Bring your bike!

391
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,240
To your uncle to learn to behave.

392
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,880
Up to you.

393
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,240
You should be ashamed of coming here
with a boy, when no one is home.

394
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,080
Did dad know, he would kill you.

395
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,840
Do you want the men to hear you?
Remove the bread from the oven.

396
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,160
Oh, how nice! They are impressed.
You always make me so proud.

397
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,600
Hope it is good enough for you.

398
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,240
Turki, Saleh Ali Abdurahman.

399
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,000
Abulazziz, Rashed, Abdalla.
My dad...

400
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,120
Interested in dad's amazing family tree?

401
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,160
You are not. It is only
men's name is written there.

402
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,040
Clean up after yourself.
Hide traces of your crime.

403
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,680
I do not want him to be mad at us again.

404
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,440
WADJDA

405
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,400
Give me the photo.

406
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,920
"I said ' give here."

407
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,440
Stop it. What is going on here?

408
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:05,640
- Salma has the photos of their wedding.
- Congratulations. May I see the photos?

409
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,040
In those from your wedding?

410
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,360
Is it your husband?

411
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,680
- How old is he?
- Twenty.

412
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,080
Quiet, girls. Do not laugh.

413
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:27,640
Photos are prohibited at school.
Now we start.

414
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,200
The chapter on women, page 97.

415
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,760
Wadjda, start reading from verse 115.

416
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,600
- I will try to learn by heart.
- Fine! Close Quran and start.

417
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,320
" But as for guidance
disobeys the Messenger"

418
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,560
- " And do not take the believers' way " -

419
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:55,640
- "He sounds We go where he wants to go
and then we let him " -

420
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,400
- " Burn in hell -
which wretchedly goal!"

421
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,600
Amazing! But you have to work on
your reading and Tajwid - recitation.

422
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,680
If you are aiming to win
you must recite as Salma.

423
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,800
Salma, read verse 115 again.

424
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:16,880
" But after guidance has
been made clear to him sits up " -

425
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:22,000
- "Against the Messenger and want to go
a different path than the believers ' -

426
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,440
- "He sounds We go where he wants to go
and then we let him " -

427
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,440
- " Burn in hell -
which wretchedly goal!"

428
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,800
"God does not forgive those who put
the aide on His side."

429
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,880
" But He forgives whom He wills
his minor sins."

430
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,640
"Whoever puts aide on God's side " -

431
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,960
- " Has pushed sin to its limits."

432
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,160
Excellent.

433
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,960
- Are you mad at me now?
- I have homework to do.

434
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,840
Wait a minute. Here, for your bike.
Such as you have seen on TV.

435
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:27,320
Want to ride a little? Behind the tent.
We have a while before people come.

436
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,960
Abdalla, look!

437
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,720
The shopkeeper told Khalid and
his father that the bike is reserved.

438
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,480
He keeps it safe for me.

439
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,120
The correct answer.

440
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,560
Choose the correct answer.
What are sabianerna?

441
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,160
I know the answer.

442
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,520
The correct answer.

443
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,920
Finally!

444
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:19,080
"You've never listened to me.
Why should I listen to you?"

445
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,000
Get dressed, we're going to go out.

446
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:34,040
Do not let the Qur'an be open.
The devil can spit in it.

447
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:39,440
Work with Leila? Cool lab coats,
as in "The Matrix," but whites.

448
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,320
Quiet, I'll just give her a thing.

449
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,160
Wadjda!

450
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,200
Hello and welcome.

451
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,120
Leila, why do you hide not your face?

452
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:04,520
Never mind!
Let me get an application form for you.

453
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,600
Welcome!

454
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,120
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

455
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,400
Great job and soon no places left.
You should...

456
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:32,960
Leila, stop. I just wanted to say hi
I'll call you later, you are busy.

457
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,800
- Take care of yourself.
- Where are you?

458
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,560
Take care of yourself.

459
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,000
- If you do not work with Leila?
- Stop it.

460
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:56,240
"Among His signs is that He created
for you wives of your own kind.."

461
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,128
- "..That ye may dwell in
tranquility with them."

462
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:03,880
- No honey, try this. Listen.

463
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:11,760
"... And He has put love
and mercy between you."

464
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:20,840
" In that are signs for
those who reflect."

465
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,720
I'm so shy.
I can not recite so for everyone.

466
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,120
You, shy? If only it were true.

467
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,600
Look, there's Daddy!

468
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,280
- Where?
- There! There!

469
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,640
Do you love him?

470
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:23,480
- Who? Your father?
- No, the boy next door.

471
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,720
I do not think it's me
who is in love with the boy next door.

472
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:34,360
That was not fun.
You did not answer. Do you love him?

473
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:40,800
Dear children, I went to high school
when he proposed to me.

474
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:47,320
All the girls were crazy when they saw
the photo of him. They were so jealous.

475
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,400
The first man in my life.
Hopefully also the last.

476
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:03,200
You are beautiful. When he looks at you in
the red dress he gets a heart attack.

477
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,080
Do not worry. He would never take
a wife and break my heart.

478
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,920
Let us recite for the race tomorrow.

479
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,448
The words should come from the heart.
Ignore

480
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:37,440
those around you and
read from the heart.

481
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,800
I'd like to be there tomorrow
and make sure you win.

482
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,720
But I have to commute
to the end of the world again.

483
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,640
Generosity?

484
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,280
Wrong answer.

485
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,280
Next.

486
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,200
What does " sadakatouhonn "?

487
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,000
- Wedding Gift?
- Right.

488
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,520
Salma.

489
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,320
What is " Al-Furkan "?

490
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,960
- Quran?
- Right.

491
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,440
Wadjda.

492
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,200
What does " da'ab "?

493
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,080
Custom.

494
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,200
Right.

495
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,280
Noura.

496
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,800
What does " zaygh "?

497
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,080
Weakness.

498
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,280
Right.

499
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,240
Next.

500
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,320
What does " hawban kabiran "?

501
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,480
I'm sorry, Yasmin.
Go back to your seat.

502
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,080
What does " hawban kabiran "?

503
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:26,040
Something big?

504
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,360
Wrong. Go back to your seat.

505
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:41,400
- What does " hawban kabiran "?
- Great injustice.

506
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,160
Right.

507
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,693
"If we had ordered them this:

508
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,368
"'Kill yourselves'

509
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,010
"or" Get out of your homes '

510
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:57,532
"They have not done,
except a few of them."

511
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,933
"If they had done what
they exhorted..."

512
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:06,968
"This is the Scripture whereof
there is no doubt"

513
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,779
"This is a guide for the righteous,"

514
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,414
"who believe in the unseen"

515
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,457
"and do prayer"

516
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,050
"and spend,
what We have given them."

517
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,816
"Those who..."

518
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,215
"Those who..."

519
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,492
"Those who..."

520
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,720
Thank you, Salma. God bless you.

521
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,720
Wadjda.

522
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:57,800
Verse 7, "Sur'at Al-Baqarah" Starting on
"God has sealed their hearts..."

523
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:05,360
"God has sealed their.."

524
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:19,320
"God has sealed their hearts and
their ears and covered over their eyes"

525
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:23,240
" A severe punishment awaits them."

526
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:28,480
" There are people who say:
'We believe in God ' " -

527
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:34,160
- " ' And the Last Day '
though they do not believe."

528
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,560
"They are trying to deceive God
and the believers."

529
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:46,160
" But they deceive none but
themselves and do not realize it."

530
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:52,560
" Their hearts are sick and
God lets their disease getting worse" -

531
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:59,000
- " and a painful punishment awaits them
for their constant lies."

532
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:04,720
"When they are urged not to sow discord
on Earth, they answer"

533
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,760
" We just want to improve
and make amends."

534
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,520
" No, it is they who create discord
and spreads depravation."

535
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,120
"But they do not realize."

536
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,200
It was excellent, Wadjda.
God bless you.

537
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,840
Will you pray your prayer next to us?

538
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,040
- Congratulations.
- The winner is yet to be appointed.

539
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,200
You won. Their favorite.
All voted safely on you.

540
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:50,640
Wadjda, come here!
We kept a place for you in the front row.

541
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,320
Coward.

542
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,320
In the line.

543
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,880
Stand closer together.
Leave no room for the devil.

544
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,320
God is great.

545
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,280
God hears the prayer of thanks.

546
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,240
Quiet, girls. Silence!

547
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:56,120
Finalists in the competition.

548
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:01,320
Noura Saleh, Salma Abdul Aziz
and Wadjda Al Saffan.

549
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:06,280
And now... the third prize goes to...

550
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,280
Salma Abdul Aziz.

551
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,240
Congratulations.

552
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,760
Winner of the second prize is...

553
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,880
Noura Saleh.

554
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,400
Congratulations, Noura.

555
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,600
Wadjda, the first prize goes to you.

556
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:35,280
You won thanks to your dedication
and that you have been so diligent.

557
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,440
I hope everyone here
today learn from your example.

558
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,000
Congratulations.

559
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,640
And what do you intend to use
prize money for?

560
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,280
I want to buy a bike at the store
down the street.

561
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,400
What did you say?

562
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:04,520
I want to buy a bike, but without training
wheels because I can ride a bike.

563
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:21,920
Were well better to donate money
to our brothers in Palestine?

564
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,640
A bike is not for girls.

565
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,840
Especially not for the benefit of girls
who are afraid of their honor.

566
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:38,080
I'm sure your family will not allow it.

567
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:44,200
The money will be donated in your name and
May God reward you for the good work.

568
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,160
Now go back to your place.

569
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,920
It's all girls. You can go now.

570
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,080
So nothing's changed after all.

571
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,560
You think you can behave anyhow unnoticed?

572
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:10,720
Your stupid behavior
will haunt you forever.

573
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,880
You mean like your "fancy" thief?

574
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,960
Won you not? Where is the money?

575
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,000
In Palestine.

576
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:15,320
- I give you my bike.
- How can we ride up?

577
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,240
Wadjda...

578
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:27,640
You know I want to marry you
when we grow up, right?

579
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,760
So you're finally home.

580
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:09,680
- What's the new haircut?
- Your mother does not answer the phone.

581
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,880
Can I see?

582
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:19,320
You won? I do not think that's true.
You are my little darling.

583
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:24,200
Why are you crying? You won after all.

584
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:28,360
- Wait a second.
- Hello?

585
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,240
Are you ready?

586
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:45,600
I'm so proud of you,
my little heroine.

587
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,160
I have tried to call my mom all day.

588
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:53,040
When she comes home,
tell her I love her.

589
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,840
Hello? Hello, Aunt Leila.

590
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,960
No, I do not know where she is.

591
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,080
Yes, she used to be home at this time.

592
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,840
Okay, I'll say it to her.

593
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,040
Goodbye.

594
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,320
Congratulations, I heard the news.

595
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:48,080
They said you won.
I did not believe it was true.

596
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:53,080
When you go in for something,
no one can stop you.

597
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:02,040
- I did not get the money.
- Why say you wanted to buy the bike?

598
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:07,120
But you do not need them and their money.

599
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:19,840
What happens at home with grandma?
Uncle marries well next month?

600
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,720
This is not your uncle's wedding.

601
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:40,480
It's okay. He has made his decision.
It's just you and me now.

602
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:02,760
We buy the red dress
and go there and fetch father.

603
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:09,600
The dress is no longer needed.
In addition, I spent the money.

604
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,840
I hope it is right.

605
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,720
The shopkeeper had held it for
a brave little girl.

606
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,880
I want you to be the happiest person.

607
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,880
You're all I have left in this world.

608
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,320
- Abdalla.
- Goal!

609
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,320
Catch me if you can.

610
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:38,000
