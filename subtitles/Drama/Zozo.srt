1
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:09,940
Mom?

2
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:14,095
Mom? Look what I made.

3
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:19,015
- That's nice.
- Look, please.

4
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,892
Not now. Wait a minute.

5
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:39,169
Mom,
when are we going to Sweden?

6
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,637
What's wrong with you?
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!"

7
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:44,998
Cut it out, we're watching the news.

8
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,581
- What's the matter?
- Look what I made.

9
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:29,056
- It's very nice. Did you carve it?
- Yes.

10
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:37,578
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

11
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,651
- Tell me, Zozo.
- It's nothing.

12
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:54,131
- Do you ever dream, Mom?
- Yes. Have you been dreaming?

13
00:04:56,251 --> 00:05:00,527
Did you dream a lot
when you were a child?

14
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:09,480
Tell me
what you've been dreaming?

15
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:14,590
You're not going to leave me,
are you?

16
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:20,671
Darling, what makes you think that?
How can you think I'd leave you?

17
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,548
I'd leave the whole world
before I left you, sweetie.

18
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:37,460
Don't ever think like that again.

19
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:43,145
- Have you finished your homework?
- No, not yet.

20
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:51,816
Come here! Give me a kiss.

21
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:15,127
I'll tell you something.
Look at this ruler.

22
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:21,727
If it's one mm shorter than 15cm,
you'll never see the money.

23
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:26,478
- Well?
- Wait, I'm thinking of a beautiful girl.

24
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,920
- Imagine Amil's sister.
- What?!

25
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:32,882
I'm kidding.
But... your sister is amazing.

26
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:35,522
As amazing as your head.
Shut up, will you!

27
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:41,272
My God! My granddad doesn't even
have a thing like that!

28
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,794
- It must be fake.
- Hurry up if you want to measure it.

29
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:51,387
Amil! Riad! I've been
looking for you everywhere.

30
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:54,987
- Where's my money?
- Shut up. Never mind him.

31
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:56,989
Come on, let's go!

32
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:16,546
- His sister is pretty, isn't she?
- Yeah, but don't exaggerate.

33
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:20,702
I'm not. It's not like
I'm gonna do something to her.

34
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:23,586
Forget her. Just forget her!

35
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:30,092
Guys... Who wants bread?
But it's not my turn.

36
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:34,255
- I went last time.
- No, I did, then him and now you.

37
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:39,175
On one condition...
I get to meet your sister.

38
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,774
- Stop talking about my sister!
- I just want to say hello to her.

39
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:48,134
- OK, but that's the last time.
- Think about the bread instead.

40
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:52,844
Shit, he's really horny.

41
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:57,523
- Three breads, please.
- Certainly.

42
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,478
OK. One, two, go!

43
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:06,845
- My money!
- Hold the bread.

44
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:10,599
You brats, you bastards!

45
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,038
Where did he go? Did you see him?

46
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:16,792
- Son, I have no idea.
- Bastards!

47
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:23,548
Charbel, my son. Warde, my daughter-
in-law. I hope you're all well.

48
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:27,829
And most importantly, Zozo?
Zozo, my love. You're well, I hope.

49
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:33,465
Hurry up with the paperwork
so you can come to Sweden soon.

50
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,271
We're waiting, grandma and I.

51
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:40,945
I'll teach you some Swedish-

52
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,702
- so you're prepared
when you arrive. I'll start now.

53
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,539
"What's your name"
is "what's your name".

54
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:50,776
"How you are" means "how are you".

55
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:55,493
"Where comes from school" means
"when did you come from school".

56
00:09:55,662 --> 00:10:01,894
"Table dining" means "dining table".
"Curtanny" means "curtains".

57
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:07,847
"Flowers" means "flower".
They like flowers a lot over here.

58
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,484
"Go play soccer, Zozo"
means "Go and play soccer, Zozo".

59
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,405
I know you love soccer, Zozo.

60
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:18,404
Please hurry and come over
so that we can meet soon.

61
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,765
Take care now, my dear Zozo.

62
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,839
"Bye" means "bye".

63
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,918
"Bye."

64
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:31,196
- How's the paperwork going?
- The passports are ready...

65
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:35,958
...and the tickets
are coming any day now.

66
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,839
- Flowers...
- What's that?

67
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:43,309
- Grandpa just said it.
- It means "flower".

68
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:48,629
"Flower"? Does that mean
that my name is Flowers in Swedish?

69
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:52,753
Imagine me introducing you: "I'm
Charbel and this is my wife Flowers."

70
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:57,141
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

71
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,859
- Have a bite.
- No, I'm going downstairs.

72
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,464
- Where to? Eat first.
- I'm studying with a girlfriend.

73
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:07,222
You're too thin.
Eat first and study later.

74
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:10,660
You're the one
who's always telling me to study.

75
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:15,179
- Okay. Give my love to her Mom.
- I will.

76
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,980
Take care now, my son.

77
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:22,887
"Give my love to her Mom"? You did
anything to catch a glimpse of me.

78
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,733
I did? You were always
showing off behind the curtains.

79
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:33,331
- We didn't have any curtains.
- I meant "curtanny", like Grandpa said.

80
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:37,371
Okay, but we did have a rug
that I used to beat on the balcony.

81
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:52,956
They won't even let you eat in peace...

82
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,676
Dani, get downstairs!

83
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:14,830
Hurry, hurry! Give me the passports.

84
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:18,109
Hurry up!
Wait for me downstairs by the door.

85
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,510
There are so many
destroyed buildings in Lebanon.

86
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:28,908
It's not like that in Sweden.
They've only got nice houses there.

87
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:32,623
- How do you know?
- My grandmother sends me pictures.

88
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:38,310
- The sea, trees... It's like paradise.
- What are the girls like there?

89
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:43,866
- Tall and blonde. You'd like them.
- Send me one then, will you?

90
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:47,736
- Stop talking about girls.
- I'm not talking to you.

91
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,817
You're wet behind the ears
and you want to talk about girls!

92
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:55,494
- It's not your business.
- Who wants to date you?

93
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:31,082
Just a thought: We're going to Sweden
soon. Will you come with us?

94
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:36,166
- Where's Sweden? Never heard of it.
- It's a nice country far away.

95
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:40,527
- There's no war there.
- Are there countries without war?

96
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:42,759
- There's no war there.
- How'd you know?

97
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:45,288
I know because grandma's
sent me pictures.

98
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:49,995
- Here, have a look.
- Let me see. It looks nice.

99
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:55,078
Yeah, it's really nice. If we go there
we can have fun all the time.

100
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:56,880
- What?
- We'll have fun.

101
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,680
But how can I go with you?
I don't have a passport.

102
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,590
- I'll hide you, but my dad musn't see.
- What if your dad sees me?

103
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,187
Don't worry, I'll arrange something.

104
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:19,108
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

105
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:23,262
- Yes, you're talking to someone.
- No, I'm not.

106
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:37,093
Are you talking to a chicken?
Have you lost your mind?

107
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,854
No, I'm bringing him to Sweden.

108
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,046
Sure, just get him a passport,
a visa and a ticket too.

109
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:52,092
- No, seriously.
- Seriously, come up and eat instead.

110
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:45,577
- Guess where we're going today.
- To Sweden? Is it true?!

111
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:10,409
- I'm going to Sweden today!
- You're so lucky.

112
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,451
I'm going to miss you!

113
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:16,128
- I'll miss you too.
- Say hello to Riad, I won't have time.

114
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:19,886
- Tell him to leave your sis alone.
- He messes with her, I'll kick his ass.

115
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:27,800
- Before you go: Don't forget to write.
- I'll do my best.

116
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:32,082
- Just send anything.
- I will. Bye.

117
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:34,041
- Maybe I'll come after you.
- Please try.

118
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:40,230
- Where's your passport?
- I gave it to you.

119
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,357
- I can't find it.
- What do you mean you can't find it?

120
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:47,709
- Mom, where's my pink skirt?
- Forget about it.

121
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:52,709
- But I want to bring it with me.
- Bring something else. Just hurry up.

122
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:58,630
- You put it in the kitchen?
- In the kitchen?

123
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:04,500
Are you going to make soup of it?
Darling, I can't find your passport.

124
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:09,058
What do you mean?
I put it here with yours...

125
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,493
Here it is.

126
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:30,531
- Yes, Dad?
- Hurry home now. Hurry!

127
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:37,165
- I have to talk to my girlfriend.
- Forget about her. We're leaving!

128
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:41,282
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

129
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,646
Go and buy some water. Hurry!

130
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:49,437
- You said I was going with you.
- Yes, but on the next flight.

131
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,681
Why?
I thought we were going together.

132
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:56,596
- The plane was full.
- Why didn't you tell me?

133
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:59,799
I just found out.
I'll send you a ticket tomorrow.

134
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:03,428
- How will you send it?
- I'll arrange it.

135
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,713
- Have you been lying?
- No I'm not lying.

136
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:08,232
You said we'd get married
and have children.

137
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,474
- Yes, and we will.
- Why've you been lying!

138
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:14,433
You are my sweetheart,
I'd never lie to you.

139
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,697
- Mom!
- Don't look at them.

140
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,181
- Look at me!
- Mom!

141
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:33,931
- What are you doing?
- Climb inside. Hurry!

142
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:38,250
- Take these.
- Dani, come with me!

143
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:43,961
Listen! I can't, but don't be afraid.
I promise I'll come back for you.

144
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,846
The soldiers will be here
any second. Keep quiet!

145
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:51,967
- Get up now.
- Is that you, Mom?

146
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,648
Come here, Zozo.

147
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:08,965
- Where am I?
- You're with me.

148
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:23,355
- Where are you?
- Here.

149
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:47,097
- What is this?
- Don't be afraid.

150
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:31,413
Zozo? Come on, wake up now.

151
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:41,488
I don't think your brother will return.

152
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:46,529
I know it's hard,
but you must be strong.

153
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,121
Maybe he'll show up at the airport?

154
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:56,316
Come on, let's go to Sweden.

155
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:11,292
- Hello.
- Hello, what would you like?

156
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,764
One bread, please.

157
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:20,291
- Here. That'll be five lira.
- But I have no money.

158
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:26,205
No money? Do you think this
is charity? Give it back and go away!

159
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:30,723
- What's this supposed to mean?
- Why not give it to him, you bastard?

160
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:35,241
- Can't you see he's hungry?
- Aren't you the landlord's daughter?

161
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:39,316
- How are you? How's your dad?
- Fine. Why didn't you give it to him?

162
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:44,394
- I tried to, but he refused it.
- Don't lie. I heard you.

163
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,154
- Here you are. Enjoy.
- Here's some money to keep you happy.

164
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:54,590
- Would you like something else?
- It's on me.

165
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:59,233
- No, don't bother.
- Get off my back then.

166
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:03,110
We might as well close
if everyone gets to eat for free.

167
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:16,853
You look like you're starving.

168
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:24,970
Thanks for this.

169
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:38,490
Is that your chicken? It's cute.
What's its name?

170
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:41,881
- I don't know.
- Why are you so sad?

171
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:47,204
- Do you know the way to the airport?
- Why do you want to go there?

172
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:53,082
- I'm going to Sweden.
- To Sweden? By yourself?

173
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:57,521
- Yes.
- Where are your parents?

174
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:00,790
They're dead.

175
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:14,548
If you want to get to the airport
it's near my house. I'll take you.

176
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:22,263
- What's your name?
- Zozo.

177
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:25,341
My name is Rita.

178
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:34,104
- Is the airport far away?
- No, we're pretty close.

179
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:38,382
But it's getting dark. I don't think
any planes fly this late.

180
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:59,648
- Are we by the airport?
- I want to show you something first.

181
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:12,842
- What's that?
- Cartridges.

182
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:24,718
- It's beautiful here, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

183
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,475
Dad takes me here when they go bird
hunting. I'll show you how they do it.

184
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:38,585
They hide behind a tree,
load their guns and take aim...

185
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:42,141
And then, if they see a bird...

186
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:52,576
Come here, quickly!

187
00:33:53,346 --> 00:33:57,576
I'll count to three,
and then we start shooting birds.

188
00:33:57,664 --> 00:34:00,619
One, two... come on!

189
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,751
Quiet...

190
00:34:57,474 --> 00:35:02,784
Hurry up. In here!
Just hurry up and be careful.

191
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,182
Stay there and be as quiet as you can.

192
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:21,496
Where have you been?

193
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:26,369
You stupid little girl?
Don't you know what time it is?

194
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:29,576
Go straight to bed now!

195
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:35,412
Next time you're home this late
I'll kill you, you little brat!

196
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,881
You can come out now.

197
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:57,516
Can I sit down?

198
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:05,035
- Did he hit you?
- No.

199
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,078
- But you're all red.
- He's always that angry.

200
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:12,148
It's okay. I'll get a mattress for you.

201
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:16,102
Don't worry about it.
I can sleep on the floor.

202
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:55,332
- Zozo, are you asleep?
- No.

203
00:36:58,774 --> 00:37:02,764
Can I hold your hand?

204
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,329
One, two... come on!

205
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,768
Come on, shoot.

206
00:38:37,324 --> 00:38:40,632
How are you feeling?

207
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:46,397
- Fine, but I feel something strange.
- Me too. What is it?

208
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,868
I don't know.

209
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:52,635
Do you?

210
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:22,014
- What are you doing?
- Going with you to Sweden.

211
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:27,374
- Really?
- Hurry up so we don't miss the plane.

212
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:30,727
Hurry!

213
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:39,044
- Wait.
- What is it?

214
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:41,929
I have to talk to my sister.

215
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:48,845
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to miss you very much.

216
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:52,078
I'm going to the airport
with my boyfriend.

217
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:54,242
- Where?
- The airport.

218
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:59,875
To the airport? With him?
Kids today... Get upstairs now.

219
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:03,238
No, we'll miss the plane.
Don't tell dad.

220
00:40:03,321 --> 00:40:06,232
- What? Get upstairs now.
- Don't tell him.

221
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,071
Get in here or he's going to kill you!

222
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:11,235
- I can't. Bye.
- Rita, come back!

223
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,666
- Hurry up, we'll miss the plane!
- Wait, I'll be right there.

224
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:36,853
- Are you sure you don't want to come?
- Yes, don't worry.

225
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:42,096
Why should I go there? It's too cold.
At least it's warm here.

226
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,979
I'm a chicken, I need warmth.

227
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:49,331
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

228
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:55,127
- But that's life. What can you do?
- What will you do? Where will you go?

229
00:40:55,256 --> 00:40:58,212
I'll be alright.
I'll just hang out with my buddies.

230
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:03,320
We'll have fun, chill, catch some rays,
drink some beer. I'll be alright.

231
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:15,685
Alright, you take care.

232
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:28,243
Turn the engine off and open
the window. Where are you going?

233
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,320
- To the airport.
- You too? Where are you going?

234
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:36,836
- To Sweden.
- Bullshit. Both of you, out of the car!

235
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:42,042
To Sweden? You serious?
Do you have the necessary papers?

236
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:46,433
Get them. Little kids
going to Sweden... What a joke!

237
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,751
Let me have them
and wait here with her.

238
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:57,707
- But I don't have a passport.
- Maybe my sister's will do?

239
00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:59,784
What if they find out?

240
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:08,783
- Come, quick.
- What is it?

241
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:12,579
- What is it?
- It's my dad.

242
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:19,262
How did he get here?
What do we do now?

243
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:29,611
Have you seen a little girl?
She's about this tall.

244
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:33,490
- Yes, we just stopped a girl and a boy.
- Where are they now?

245
00:43:33,576 --> 00:43:37,693
Wait, I'll have a look.
- Guys! Where are the kids?

246
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,651
- They were just here.
- So where are they?

247
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:44,601
Zozo, I like you so much.
But... I have to go now.

248
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:46,250
What!

249
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:57,603
Come here, you little brat!

250
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:01,478
Where have you been? I'll teach you
not to run away like that!

251
00:44:02,402 --> 00:44:05,916
What have you been doing? Tell me!

252
00:44:06,441 --> 00:44:13,433
- Leave her alone!
- You little bastard! Who are you?

253
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:19,107
Do you think
you can take my little girl?!

254
00:44:20,553 --> 00:44:24,544
Let go of me! I'm going to kill him!

255
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:30,948
Rita, come with me. Rita!

256
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,527
- What's your name?
- Zozo.

257
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:54,172
What was going on out there, Zozo?

258
00:44:55,936 --> 00:44:59,165
- I don't know.
- What do you mean "I don't know"?

259
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:01,608
And the man who was shouting?

260
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:06,727
- I don't know.
- Are you here all alone?

261
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:10,559
Yes.

262
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:18,153
All these identification documents
and tickets... who do they belong to?

263
00:45:18,365 --> 00:45:22,402
- My family.
- Where is your family?

264
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,312
Dead.

265
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:45,030
- Are all of them dead?
- Yes.

266
00:45:50,108 --> 00:45:55,658
- Can you help me get to Sweden?
- Who do you know in Sweden?

267
00:45:57,705 --> 00:46:01,491
My grandfather and grandmother.

268
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:16,615
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

269
00:46:21,293 --> 00:46:27,082
Hello, this is Tony.
Can I ask you a favour?

270
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:46,091
Grandpa! Grandma!

271
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:50,690
Sweetheart! Welcome.
I'm so glad you're safe!

272
00:48:50,778 --> 00:48:54,292
I've missed you, Zozo!

273
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:06,889
Lt's so good to hug you. You're
the most precious thing in our lives.

274
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:23,416
- What shall we do with Zozo?
- What do you mean, my love?

275
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:30,018
- Should we talk about his family?
- Does it matter if we talk or not?

276
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:35,216
What's happened has happened.
He's a child. Why remind ourselves?

277
00:51:35,296 --> 00:51:40,572
Let him live like other kids,
in peace and quiet.

278
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:44,884
You're right.
I won't dress in black then.

279
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:48,930
No, it's best you don't.
It was God's will. What can we do?

280
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:55,515
- Talk quieter so he won't hear us.
- Okay.

281
00:51:55,766 --> 00:51:59,156
Go back to sleep now, my darling.

282
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:45,937
Let's go to the lake.
It's a very nice lake.

283
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:54,770
Come on now, Zozo!
Well done. Well done, my boy!

284
00:52:54,857 --> 00:53:00,247
Well done! Attaboy, Zozo!
You're granddad's little hero!

285
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:11,723
- Let's break it so it's easier to chew.
- Can I share it with you?

286
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:19,873
Add a little bit of salt
and we'll have a really tasty apple.

287
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:31,150
- You can remove your teeth?
- It helps me taste better.

288
00:53:31,238 --> 00:53:34,196
I can remove them
and put them wherever I want.

289
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:39,350
- Doesn't it hurt?
- No, nothing hurts your granddad.

290
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,823
- I'm as tough as nails.
- Where are your real teeth?

291
00:53:42,913 --> 00:53:48,031
Do you want to hear that story?
Lt's a long and winding one.

292
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:51,498
- Which tooth do I begin with?
- They each have a story?

293
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:55,745
- Yes, they all have a story. Pick one.
- That one.

294
00:53:55,946 --> 00:53:59,222
Did you have to pick that one?

295
00:53:59,306 --> 00:54:05,059
Your granddad got into some rough
fights when he was young.

296
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:11,611
I'd smash people to pieces. I would
crush anything that got in my way.

297
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:16,008
This tooth... Your grandmother and I
were going to the cinema -

298
00:54:16,096 --> 00:54:23,773
- when some bastard came and bumped
her on the shoulder. Right here.

299
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:30,482
I have a brain, by God, but that
bastard made me shut it down.

300
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:36,044
- So you attacked?
- Yes, I did. Bravo, Zozo!

301
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:40,084
I closed in on him:
"You son of a whore! You fuck!"

302
00:54:40,164 --> 00:54:44,202
I used my left fist
and went... bam! Right in the face.

303
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:47,079
Then my left fist... bam!
Crushing his nose...

304
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,116
- Shall I take that one?
- Yes, just go ahead and take it.

305
00:54:55,437 --> 00:55:00,111
- Shit, you're heavier than me now!
- What the hell are you doing?!

306
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:11,861
- He scared me.
- What a monster.

307
00:55:11,948 --> 00:55:18,897
- I have a few in my pocket.
- What a cheap bastard. Bloody idiot!

308
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,054
Take it easy.

309
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:36,214
Look how he's eating! The shame! It
looks like he hasn't eaten in a month.

310
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:41,932
For God's sake, leave me alone.

311
00:55:42,013 --> 00:55:45,005
I've eaten like this for 30 years
and now it's a problem?

312
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:49,800
Leave me alone. Go find someone else
if I'm not good enough anymore.

313
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,563
That man Lambare,
he likes talking to me.

314
00:55:53,648 --> 00:55:57,480
My darling. Lambare, I don't care
about Lambare or his father Ambare.

315
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,318
At least he doesn't have a gut
and even has hair on his head.

316
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:04,521
This is true.
No gut and hair on his head.

317
00:56:04,603 --> 00:56:10,072
But one leg is wooden, the other one
plastic. You can have him.

318
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:18,072
What are you waiting for? Tell her
how the girls hound us on the street.

319
00:56:18,156 --> 00:56:23,307
- How they keep fondling us.
- Congratulations.

320
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:27,748
I hope you live a thousand years.
Believe me, you are my everything.

321
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:30,821
I hope God doesn't
take you away from me.

322
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:34,696
- You know I'm kidding too.
- We have to lighten things up for Zozo.

323
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:40,382
He's the apple of his grandfather's
eye. We just want to make you laugh.

324
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:25,281
Really? Well,
I think we have something here...

325
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:31,792
- Yes, a shoe.
- Shoes? Shoes...

326
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:34,553
Can I haggle over the price?

327
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:41,713
- Haggle? Like sheep's guts?
- Haggle. Shoes.

328
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:46,149
- Your Swedish is coming along so well.
- I'm learning.

329
00:57:46,312 --> 00:57:49,542
Bravo.
Tell me what words you've learnt.

330
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:55,385
Shoes, haggle, orange, apple, car...

331
00:57:55,548 --> 00:58:01,813
You speak better Swedish than your
granny. You're smart, like grandpa.

332
00:58:01,903 --> 00:58:05,373
You speak better Swedish than me?

333
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:08,897
I speak better Swedish than the
Swedes. What are you talking about?

334
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:10,897
- Go ahead, then.
- I'll go ahead alright.

335
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:16,177
Where are ayou from?

00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:31,481

338
00:58:32,048 --> 00:58:34,881
I can speak a little Swedish.

339
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:37,401
Orange...

340
00:58:41,844 --> 00:58:44,277
Orange, apple...

00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,031

343
00:58:54,158 --> 00:58:58,308
You're leaving.
I am dumb.

344
00:58:58,476 --> 00:59:03,866
Hi, my name is Zozo
and I'm eleven years old.

345
00:59:03,953 --> 00:59:09,150
I can speak a little Swedish
and Arabic.

346
00:59:09,231 --> 00:59:11,663
I live with my grandmother
and grandfather.

347
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:17,299
I'm from Lebanon
and I like to play soccer.

348
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:20,821
And I also like apples with salt.

349
00:59:21,704 --> 00:59:23,933
- Salt?
- Yes, it's nice.

350
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:27,537
It's a little...

351
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,211
- Sour?
- Sour.

352
00:59:33,378 --> 00:59:39,974
- I like pears with salt. Don't you?
- Yeah. I need to try bananas with salt.

353
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:44,046
- How about bananas with pepper?
- Be quiet.

354
00:59:45,093 --> 00:59:49,482
Zozo? You can sit over there.

355
00:59:56,528 --> 01:00:00,279
- Hey.
- Hi.

356
01:00:00,365 --> 01:00:04,242
My name's Kalle.
Don't call me Karl, it's a stupid name.

357
01:00:04,323 --> 01:00:06,790
- Hi, Karl.
- No, Kalle.

358
01:00:06,962 --> 01:00:10,157
- Your name is Karl.
- No, it's Kalle. One more thing.

359
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,556
- I hate girls too.
- No, you don't.

360
01:00:14,638 --> 01:00:21,074
- You asked Jenny to go steady.
- No, she asked me.

361
01:00:21,475 --> 01:00:24,829
- Be quiet!
- It's them. They're teasing me.

362
01:00:24,993 --> 01:00:28,267
They're saying I go steady
with Jenny, but I hate her.

363
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,136
Remember you have sports
after the break.

364
01:01:16,128 --> 01:01:18,845
Give me the ball.

365
01:01:19,326 --> 01:01:23,555
Give it here. Give me the ball, dammit.

366
01:01:46,113 --> 01:01:48,750
Hi.

367
01:01:54,708 --> 01:02:01,258
- What a big book.
- I've read bigger.

368
01:02:03,343 --> 01:02:07,460
How can you read everything...
so much?

369
01:02:08,381 --> 01:02:10,689
Lt's not that hard.

370
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,053
I can't do it.

371
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:17,653
I read too. I read Bamse.

372
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:21,011
With Bamse and Little Skutt.

373
01:02:22,295 --> 01:02:24,853
That's not a book, that's a comic.

374
01:02:25,373 --> 01:02:29,727
I know. I read it. It's good.

375
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:39,239
- Do you want to play soccer?
- I don't know. I'm not very good.

376
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:42,952
We can play anyway.

377
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:53,275
- I've got to go.
- Okay. I'll see you.

378
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:59,350
- Hey there. Who are you?
- My name is Zozo.

379
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:03,069
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Lebanon.

380
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,463
Lebanon? Where's that?

381
01:03:06,553 --> 01:03:09,384
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

382
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:12,905
- Do you play soccer?
- Yes, I'm good at soccer.

383
01:03:14,508 --> 01:03:15,941
Sorry.

384
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:20,338
- That was good?
- Not especially.

385
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:24,817
- Why did he leave?
- It doesn't matter.

386
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:28,814
- Why does it matter if he leaves?
- I don't understand.

387
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:33,018
What do you mean? We're the ones
who make the rules here.

388
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:36,773
- Why?
- You have problem with that?

389
01:03:36,858 --> 01:03:38,653
- What?
- Stop it!

390
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,534
Cut it out. Are you stupid?!

391
01:03:43,134 --> 01:03:45,249
Stop!

392
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:48,530
Stop it, dammit!

393
01:04:40,705 --> 01:04:44,139
- Hello, sunshine.
- Hello, gorgeous.

394
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:48,454
What a beauty.
Is that your face or is it the sun?

395
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:51,532
God give me strength.
Are you sewing my shirt?

396
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:55,770
Zozo fell off his bike
so I'm sewing the button that fell off.

397
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,371
- Zozo!
- Yes, grandpa.

398
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:04,091
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing, I fell off my bike.

399
01:05:04,173 --> 01:05:07,529
No, you've been in a fight.

400
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:12,400
- No, it's true.
- Come on, we're friends. What is it?

401
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,366
- It's the truth.
- Zozo?

402
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:21,441
- I was in a fight.
- With who?

403
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:25,482
- These three guys.
- What? Three boys hit you?

404
01:05:25,643 --> 01:05:30,191
- Yes, they were older than me.
- Who are these fags?!

405
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,917
Damn hooligans.

406
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,343
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, I can't drink any more.

407
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:58,068
Coffee is...

408
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:02,742
Do you understand? Good.

409
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,418
Hello, Jocke. Have a seat right there.

410
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:12,810
Is that the boy that hit you?

411
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:17,130
- Why did you hit my grandson?
- I didn't hit him.

412
01:06:17,218 --> 01:06:19,729
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I didn't hit anyone.

413
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:21,972
Hold on!

414
01:06:22,135 --> 01:06:25,284
- Don't you understand?
- Yes, but I didn't hit him.

415
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:32,043
- You want to wrestle with Zozo?
- Please, this is no way to resolve this.

416
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:34,881
Sit down and be quiet!

417
01:06:35,168 --> 01:06:40,034
Don't you understand?
You can't be three boys against one.

418
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:45,641
Get up. - Come up here
and beat the shit out of him.

419
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:47,603
One, two, three!

420
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:51,149
- Stop this.
- Get out of here!

421
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,470
- You want to wrestle with me? Wait.
- I don't want anyone to fight.

422
01:06:55,878 --> 01:07:00,346
We need to be calm and reasonable.
I don't want to fight!

423
01:07:07,313 --> 01:07:09,904
Hold on. Take it easy.

424
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:17,583
Bloody stupid headmaster.
He's ruined my day.

425
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:22,500
What kind of headmaster is he?
How do the students stand him?

426
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:28,771
Zozo, listen to me. Promise me
never to be afraid of anyone.

427
01:07:28,862 --> 01:07:35,013
Anyone comes up to you, just hit him.
Rearrange his face.

428
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:39,375
Don't be afraid, no matter who it is.
Understand?

429
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:42,405
Okay?

430
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,878
Hey, hold on!

431
01:07:55,328 --> 01:08:00,558
Let me make myself clear, if you ever
rat on me again you're dead!

432
01:08:00,725 --> 01:08:03,797
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

433
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:07,558
- I won't squeal.
- And don't squeal to your grandpa.

434
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:12,356
Come to me instead. Be a man.
What's this? Math?

435
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:18,388
He studies math. Don't study math,
study Swedish, fucking foreigner!

436
01:09:03,815 --> 01:09:06,373
Hello.

437
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,842
What is your name?

438
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,884
My name is Zozo.

439
01:09:23,165 --> 01:09:26,235
Do you speak Arabic?

440
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:10,110
Who are you?

441
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:13,466
What do you want from me?

442
01:11:20,226 --> 01:11:22,614
Are you God?

443
01:11:27,943 --> 01:11:33,014
Can you bring my family back to life?
Can you bring my Mom back to life?

444
01:11:37,578 --> 01:11:41,534
This is my Mom.
Can you bring her back to life?

445
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:50,286
Why won't you answer me?

446
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,245
Answer me!

447
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:58,127
Come on, answer me.

448
01:12:20,755 --> 01:12:24,714
- What's with you? What're you doing?
- Nothing.

449
01:12:25,754 --> 01:12:29,631
What do you mean "nothing"?
Why do you look so sad?

450
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,746
- Been fighting again?
- No.

451
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:36,026
Yes, you have. Look at me.
Who hit you?

452
01:12:36,108 --> 01:12:38,497
No one.

453
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:44,774
What did I tell you?
You don't take crap from anyone.

454
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:49,141
If anyone messes with you
you just swing at him right away.

455
01:12:49,303 --> 01:12:51,052
Grandpa, I can't.

456
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,700
- Why not?
- I just can't.

457
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,612
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not like you.

458
01:12:57,698 --> 01:13:00,926
You should be better and stronger
than me. Don't say that again!

459
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:04,485
- Then I'll just have to be a coward.
- No, you won't. Come back!

460
01:13:04,655 --> 01:13:07,292
- Leave me alone.
- Don't be so hard on him.

461
01:13:07,453 --> 01:13:10,250
Should he get beat up every day?

462
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:15,687
- Calm down.
- I won't be calm! Come back here.

463
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,967
"Hi, Rita. How are you?"

464
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:25,330
"I'm writing to you from Sweden to
tell you everything is great here."

465
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:31,008
"The other day I dreamt we were in
a house, playing and having fun."

466
01:14:31,171 --> 01:14:34,640
"I hope the dream comes true."

467
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:42,201
"I've missed you so much.
Can't you come to Sweden?"

468
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:27,022
- Nice eraser.
- Thanks.

469
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:30,890
- Where did you get it?
- From the store.

470
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:36,617
- Do you want it?
- You're giving it to me? Thanks.

471
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:40,895
- Look what Zozo gave me.
- Cool. Can I have one too?

472
01:15:41,056 --> 01:15:46,764
I don't have any more.
You can have this. It smells good.

473
01:15:47,533 --> 01:15:48,522
Thanks.

474
01:15:48,733 --> 01:15:51,484
- Can I have a pen too?
- Sure you can.

475
01:15:51,651 --> 01:15:56,041
- Then can I have an eraser too?
- An eraser and a pen? Sure.

476
01:15:56,129 --> 01:15:58,562
Thanks.

477
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,711
- I want these.
- That'll be six crowns.

478
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:21,914
- And his head goes flying off...
- Hi.

479
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:26,545
- I got you an eraser and a pen.
- That's so nice of you. Thanks.

480
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:30,068
- Were there any other colours?
- Yes... No... What...?

481
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:34,143
- Were there other colours?
- Where did you get that pen?

482
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:37,823
- Would you like one? I can get it.
- Can I have one too?

483
01:16:39,787 --> 01:16:42,060
Can I have an eraser?

484
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:45,501
- My sister needs an eraser.
- My mom needs one too.

485
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:32,712
"Hi, Zozo. Grandpa and I are at
the hospital, but don't worry."

486
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,713
"Hopefully, we'll be home tonight.
There's food in the fridge."

487
01:17:37,798 --> 01:17:40,595
"Take care."

488
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:58,227
- What's wrong with you, grandpa?
- Why are you here? School's over?

489
01:17:58,388 --> 01:18:02,936
- Yes. What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I fell off my bicycle.

490
01:18:03,105 --> 01:18:06,097
I broke both my legs.
Don't worry about it.

491
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:09,777
- You broke your legs?
- Yes, they got a bit broken.

492
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:16,898
- Why is gran crying?
- That's just how she is.

493
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:23,414
Could you leave so that
I can speak to Zozo alone?

494
01:18:27,853 --> 01:18:32,049
I want to tell you something.

495
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:37,001
- Have you ever seen me cry?
- No.

496
01:18:37,089 --> 01:18:41,319
Have you seen anything
that shows me as being weak?

497
01:18:42,525 --> 01:18:45,358
It is true... my son has died.

498
01:18:45,445 --> 01:18:48,435
I've grieved, but it was his fate.

499
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:53,674
Everyone has to walk that path.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

500
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,910
Okay, so my legs are broken.

501
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,916
But if all of me is broken I'll still
make it, with God's help.

502
01:19:00,037 --> 01:19:04,108
I fear nothing. I have a heart of iron
and a will of steel.

503
01:19:04,275 --> 01:19:08,061
I want you to be like me.

504
01:19:08,153 --> 01:19:11,189
Grandpa, I've tried to be like you,
but I can't.

505
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:16,663
Maybe next week, next month, it'll
happen. Never fear. Stay strong.

506
01:19:17,668 --> 01:19:21,819
Okay. Give me a kiss.

507
01:19:22,386 --> 01:19:24,023
May God give you a long life.

508
01:19:39,418 --> 01:19:42,771
Excuse me for being late.

509
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:59,320
What is this?

510
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:03,802
I don't know.

511
01:20:07,484 --> 01:20:10,918
- Everyone in here says it was you.
- What?

512
01:20:11,082 --> 01:20:16,029
- You can't take things without paying.
- It wasn't me.

513
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,593
- Admit it, it was you.
- What?

514
01:20:18,758 --> 01:20:22,067
Don't try to pretend, everyone knows.

515
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:48,013
- Zozo!
- Bloody idiots! I hate you all!

516
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:53,778
I hate you all!

517
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,490
Bloody idiots!

518
01:21:22,447 --> 01:21:26,996
- How are you?
- Go away.

519
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:31,557
Just so you know, I didn't tell
the teacher, the others did.

520
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:34,313
I don't care. Go away.

521
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,238
But...

522
01:21:38,318 --> 01:21:42,595
- I know the feeling.
- You know nothing about me. Go!

523
01:21:44,755 --> 01:21:47,189
Go away!

524
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:18,656
I live over there.

525
01:22:28,773 --> 01:22:34,561
- Isn't that bike hard to ride?
- Yes. It's my grandfather's.

526
01:22:42,127 --> 01:22:45,561
- Aren't these apples too sour?
- No.

527
01:22:45,725 --> 01:22:49,238
- They're good with salt.
- Can you eat apples and salt?

528
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:53,039
Yes, I eat it with my grandfather.

529
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,390
In Sweden we never
eat apples like that.

530
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,435
I know. In Lebanon too.

531
01:22:59,637 --> 01:23:02,071
I don't know, I eat it with grandpa.

532
01:23:03,715 --> 01:23:06,593
Why does everyone write here?

533
01:23:08,673 --> 01:23:12,904
I don't know, it's graffiti.
You write and draw...

534
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:17,461
I drew one thing here. This one.

535
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:22,098
- What does the Z mean?
- It's a letter.

536
01:23:22,187 --> 01:23:25,621
It's just from the alphabet.

537
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,976
Come on in.

538
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,934
Nice room.

539
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:42,773
- You don't like to clean?
- Sure I do, but this morning...

540
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:48,293
- It's not a problem.
...I was late and didn't have time.

541
01:23:48,374 --> 01:23:51,125
- Can I sit down?
- Sure.

542
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:56,159
Take these and I'll go get some salt.
Coarse salt or regular?

543
01:23:56,250 --> 01:24:00,160
- Salt.
- Okay.

544
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:41,339
- You draw very well.
- Thank you.

545
01:24:41,427 --> 01:24:44,542
- It looks real.
- Yeah, kind of.

546
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:49,254
- Are you good at drawing?
- No, not like you. Just a little.

547
01:24:49,343 --> 01:24:51,776
Everyone can draw a bit.

548
01:24:52,222 --> 01:24:57,931
I had a girlfriend named Rita and she's
good at drawing - rita in Swedish.

549
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,247
Rita can rita.

550
01:25:01,737 --> 01:25:06,126
- Is she nice?
- Yes, nice.

551
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,163
- Leo?!
- Yes?

552
01:25:10,252 --> 01:25:14,210
- Have you cleaned your room?
- No, I'm going to.

553
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:18,209
- Do it right now.
- It's just my dad, never mind him.

554
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:21,484
- Why?
- No...

555
01:25:21,647 --> 01:25:24,284
Just never mind.

556
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:28,833
What did we tell you about cleaning?
It smells like...

557
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:30,833
- Who are you?
- Zozo.

558
01:25:31,082 --> 01:25:37,189
What did I tell you about having
friends over? Out, you little bugger.

559
01:25:39,997 --> 01:25:43,512
I never want
to see you here again, understand?

560
01:25:49,473 --> 01:25:52,669
Leo, what have I told you about
having friends over?

561
01:25:52,832 --> 01:25:58,860
- I know I'm not supposed to.
- So why did you? Now clean up!

562
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:02,383
- I will.
- When? Get to it.

563
01:26:02,467 --> 01:26:06,253
Start cleaning right now or I'll...

564
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:10,010
- Zozo?
- Yes?

565
01:26:10,342 --> 01:26:16,688
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Your dad is stupid.

566
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:20,565
I know, butjust never mind him.
Can we meet up tomorrow?

567
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:25,525
- Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

568
01:26:29,055 --> 01:26:32,601
- Do you know what this means?
- The pinky.

569
01:26:32,692 --> 01:26:35,690
I see, "the pinky".

570
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,397
- What about this one?
- The ring finger.

571
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:43,684
It's where you wear your ring
when you get married.

572
01:26:44,007 --> 01:26:48,681
- And...
- Middle finger. That lets you do this.

573
01:26:49,085 --> 01:26:51,721
- Index finger.
- That's right.

574
01:26:51,802 --> 01:26:54,554
- Thumb?
- Thumb.

575
01:26:54,641 --> 01:26:59,757
So you can light a lighter.
What are fingers called in Arabic?

576
01:27:03,757 --> 01:27:04,983
No, not like...

577
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,863
No...

578
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,741
- It's kind of hard.
- Yes.

579
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:22,098
Yes. That's it. Good.

580
01:27:23,387 --> 01:27:31,016
- You know Anna in our class?
- Blond hair? Yes, I know.

581
01:27:32,582 --> 01:27:36,050
- What do you think of her?
- She's nice.

582
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,534
- What do you think?
- I think she's pretty.

583
01:27:39,618 --> 01:27:43,610
You like Anna? Is she your girlfriend?

584
01:27:43,697 --> 01:27:45,731
- No.
- Why?

585
01:27:45,895 --> 01:27:49,251
- I don't know.
- Have you asked him?

586
01:27:49,335 --> 01:27:53,291
Her. I've asked her many times.

587
01:27:53,372 --> 01:27:56,442
- What did she say?
- No, of course.

588
01:27:56,610 --> 01:28:01,317
- Why?
- I don't know. She doesn't like me.

589
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:05,557
- But you're very good-looking.
- I know, but...

590
01:28:06,085 --> 01:28:11,918
I know. You're good at drawing.
You could draw a picture for her.

591
01:28:12,082 --> 01:28:14,993
You could maybe draw... yourself.

592
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,277
The foreigner has got himself a friend.

593
01:28:21,357 --> 01:28:25,268
- What do you want from me?
- Could you stop?

594
01:28:25,355 --> 01:28:28,711
- We don't want to fight. Leave.
- Shut up!

595
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:32,069
- Don't hit him.
- I'll hit him all I want.

596
01:28:32,152 --> 01:28:34,824
Stop that! Don't hit him.

597
01:28:34,911 --> 01:28:37,265
Don't hit him!

598
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:40,303
You bloody idiots...

599
01:29:23,647 --> 01:29:26,239
- Mom!
- Come on, Zozo.

600
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:28,600
- Mom!
- Not now.

601
01:29:28,685 --> 01:29:31,242
- Come on, stop.
- That's enough, Zozo. Not right now.

602
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,071
- That's enough, Mom, stop.
- Can't you see the bombs?

603
01:29:41,157 --> 01:29:44,035
Forget them, they're not real.
Not even the grenades.

604
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:46,988
What do you mean "not real"?

605
01:29:48,395 --> 01:29:52,101
Mom, why did you leave me?

606
01:29:53,272 --> 01:29:56,546
Zozo, what are you talking about?

607
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:04,503
I'm not happy here. Why can't you
come back? I'm unhappy without you.

608
01:30:06,705 --> 01:30:10,298
What's the matter with you?
What happened?

609
01:30:14,662 --> 01:30:18,494
Nothing. I've missed you.

610
01:30:23,777 --> 01:30:27,051
I missed you.

611
01:30:27,735 --> 01:30:31,645
Don't be scared,
everything will be alright.

612
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:42,915
- I love you.
- I love you too.

613
01:31:35,462 --> 01:31:39,577
The foreigner has got himself a friend.

614
01:31:42,097 --> 01:31:48,091
- Stop it, we don't want to fight.
- Shut up.

615
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:51,050
- Come, Leo, let's go.
- That's what I thought. Geeks.

616
01:31:51,212 --> 01:31:55,727
Geeks! Couple of girls!

617
01:32:04,367 --> 01:32:07,835
- Do you want to play soccer?
- Sure.

618
01:32:07,925 --> 01:32:13,042
Let's go to the docks
and maybe get something to eat.

619
01:32:56,061 --> 01:33:02,246
- Do you think we'll catch anything?
- Yes, I do. Maybe...

620
01:33:03,897 --> 01:33:06,807
Did you ever consider...

621
01:33:07,095 --> 01:33:10,530
How many fish
do you think there are here?

622
01:33:10,694 --> 01:33:13,445
- Maybe one...
- Just one?

623
01:33:13,612 --> 01:33:17,888
- No, maybe one hundred.
- Yes, or one million.

624
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:21,242
One million! No...

625
01:33:21,328 --> 01:33:28,276
- Maybe... maybe two million.
- Yes. Or three.

626
01:33:28,445 --> 01:33:32,117
- Or four.
- Or five.

627
01:33:32,202 --> 01:33:36,557
- Or six.
- Or a billion.
