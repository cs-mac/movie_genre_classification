1
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:08,317
Give me your hands.

2
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:11,317
It's okay.

3
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,393
Is it your marriage ring?

4
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:34,034
Your wife must be happy
to have an attentive husband.

5
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:41,737
I read an article that you met her
in America and married there.

6
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:49,035
And you let her continue her study
for the love of her, right?

7
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:56,035
Why are you still single?

8
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,035
I know.

9
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:04,737
Guess I was busy living my life.

10
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:09,302
Oh, I'm bleeding.

11
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,536
Seems the hen pecked at you.

12
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,035
Let me see?

13
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:21,435
I'm okay.

14
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:23,035
Let me see.

15
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,502
Are you daring or reckless?

16
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:34,436
You didn't know
you were being pecked?

17
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:46,703
That was close.

18
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:53,034
Time is the bigger deal
than my scratch.

19
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:58,035
Hurry, let's go.
I have to try the new menu.

20
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:33,036
Alright, ma'am.
What shall I tell you first?

21
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,035
Yes.

22
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:42,035
With this, I can finish
both Minjoon and Lena Jeong.

23
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:45,970
Such a weakling.

24
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:54,034
When Minjoon and I were at your age,
we could drink gallons of liquor.

25
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:59,034
You can't succeed
with that mettle.

26
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:01,937
You need to start over
at the bottom.

27
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:06,034
With whose permission?

28
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:09,035
I didn't give birth to him
to see him suffer.

29
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,303
Mr. Taesoo Park,

30
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:28,136
you will have no choice
but to do this.

31
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:33,035
Oh, there you are!

32
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:36,802
Why didn't you answer?
I looked for you.

33
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:40,370
Hi. I was
going over something.

34
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:43,035
What are these?

35
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:51,336
Remember I told you about
the hospital site in Qingdao?

36
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,068
I know you don't want to
put too many irons in the fire...

37
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,802
but Dr. Choi already signed the paper.

38
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:03,703
So why don't you...

39
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,970
Honey.

40
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:17,034
I made it clear that Jaejoon is
too soft-hearted to run a hospital.

41
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:21,235
Spending money on the hospital
will be a waste of money.

42
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:24,770
Break the contract and just wait.

43
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:31,969
Are you going to
discriminate your kids like this?

44
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,303
What?

45
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:37,034
You encouraged and supported Minjoon
when he started business,

46
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:40,034
but you put Jaejoon down
before he even starts.

47
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,034
Your favoritism
might break his spirit.

48
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:44,602
Are you serious?

49
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,168
Yes, I am.

50
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,269
Have I ever asked you
a favor for Jaejoon?

51
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,335
I've endured a lot for the peace
in the family but this is too much.

52
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:59,034
Tell me.
What's so wrong with him?

53
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,035
Well, listen.

54
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:05,536
He became a doctor because
you wanted to have a doctor son.

55
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:10,302
He also flew to Taiwan to date a girl
because you told him to.

56
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:14,602
He does whatever you tell him.
So why do you hate him so much?

57
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,202
That's the problem!

58
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:21,836
He is a man but he's so sissy
and dependent to his parents!

59
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:26,402
With that soft mettle,
what can he achieve in this tough world?

60
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:30,034
Then should he be like
defiant Minjoon...

61
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:33,034
who started business at will,

62
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:36,903
who married and divorced
of his own accord?

63
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,034
Wasn't it enough for you
to invest in his business?

64
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:43,034
Must you always put him
before Jaejoon?

65
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:45,034
Are you done?

66
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:48,034
How could you
draw the line between them?

67
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,636
Both Minjoon and Jaejoon
are precious to me.

68
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:54,836
Every child is dear to his parents!

69
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:58,034
You are really disappointing me!

70
00:05:58,035 --> 00:06:01,235
Disappointing?
YOU are disappointing.

71
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:08,034
For our 30 years of married life,
how have I treated you and Minjoon?

72
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,034
He still doesn't
regard me as his mother...

73
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:14,034
and keeps his distance from me.

74
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:19,135
But I've always smiled at him
and put him before my own son!

75
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,034
Honey, listen.

76
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:24,302
Don't tell me to let it pass.

77
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:29,034
If you really
regard them equally,

78
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:32,769
prove it to me
before you support Minjoon.

79
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,269
Otherwise, I will never believe you!
Do you understand?

80
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,270
Honey.

81
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,035
- Heera.
- Heera.

82
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:52,936
My daughter, Heera.
What's the matter?

83
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,034
Where are you
going to go at this hour?

84
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,270
Right, it's late at night.

85
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,034
You really want to
take it this far?

86
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:04,602
Don't raise your voice!
It's your fault!

87
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:10,269
You should humbly beg for
her forgiveness instead of yelling at her.

88
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,335
Stop her.
Oh, Heera! Heera!

89
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:18,034
Let her go!
She is not in her right mind.

90
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:23,904
Do as you like!
Let's have it our ways!

91
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:30,035
How cold-hearted!

92
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:34,602
I cast pearl before swine.

93
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:40,035
Can't believe I gave
my daughter to him. You're a devil!

94
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:46,236
Margherita is ready!

95
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:53,369
Taste it.

96
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,370
Margherita will add
rich flavor to this.

97
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:06,035
Let's taste the upgraded taste
of our top-selling pizza.

98
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:17,736
The cheese tastes really good
with spicy chicken.

99
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:18,737
Yes.

100
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:21,168
This is the very taste.

101
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,136
I'm sure it'll
receive a great response.

102
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:30,035
Oh, yes.

103
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,970
It'll go very well
with a drink, too.

104
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,670
It's good.

105
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:43,036
We can do more sales in the evening
if we release this.

106
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,036
Wait.

107
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:49,069
How about moving up
the release date?

108
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,034
Meeting on 15th...

109
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:01,703
Oh, we're on a tight schedule.

110
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,536
Can I ask you a quiz?

111
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:05,537
Quiz?

112
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:10,802
Guess you're poor at Korean history
since you lived abroad.

113
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:14,602
What are you talking about?
I lived in Korea until I turned 20.

114
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:16,603
Then you can guess the answer.

115
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:23,034
Of all kings in Korean history,
guess who held the lowest position.

116
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:25,737
The lowest position?

117
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,035
Let me think.

118
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,970
Yeonsangoon?

119
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,636
Kwanghaegoon?
Uijawang?

120
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:34,637
Beep!

121
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:36,636
Your guesses are wrong.

122
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,035
The answer is...

123
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,270
the minimum wage.

124
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,770
Sorry for the lame joke.

125
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:52,004
I think you need
a little balance.

126
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,937
I look like a workaholic, huh?

127
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,034
But I really feel rushed.

128
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:07,034
I worked frantically hard
to achieve something in life.

129
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:11,737
But I always ended up
empty-handed.

130
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:17,470
If I fail this time,
my life will end up in failure.

131
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,603
I push ahead hard
not to miss the chance.

132
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:29,769
I know how you think of me.

133
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,035
I'm frantic and
reckless to your eyes.

134
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:43,670
That's fine.
Just understand that I have a reason.

135
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,270
My service to you.

136
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:10,034
I'm so bitter and resentful!

137
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:14,034
This is ridiculous!

138
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:20,034
How dare he preach
a homily to my daughter!

139
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:26,034
He's completely uneducated but
she is an Ewha grad.

140
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:30,034
It's him who should
listen to her!

141
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:34,034
I don't think so.
Taesoo is right.

142
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:38,103
It's true Jaejoon is a bit too
weak-hearted, isn't it?

143
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:42,569
How can you say that?

144
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:48,135
When we should close ranks
and attack Taesoo, you're saying what?

145
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:51,637
Cut the crap and just pack up!

146
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,303
<Husband>

147
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,436
The person you have dialed
is not available.

148
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:13,034
Dang it.
Where on earth did she go?

149
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,035
I'm so resentful!

150
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,034
Changsoo, get the car ready!

151
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,870
Okay.

152
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,469
Where are you going
this late at night?

153
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,702
You really don't know?

154
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,102
Hope you enjoy your
solitary life in this big house.

155
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:33,034
I will go to my daughter...

156
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:37,034
and make a living by ourselves.

157
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,669
We are history now.

158
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,035
Wait!

159
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:49,035
Are you adding oil to the fire?

160
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:50,969
What?

161
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,802
Okay, leave.
But keep this in mind.

162
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:59,135
You are free to go but
you can't come back at your will.

163
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:02,302
What?
Is that a threat?

164
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:05,335
Yes, it's a threat.
Go ahead, leave.

165
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:06,435
Leave my house.

166
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:10,837
What?
You think I'm afraid?

167
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:21,035
What's wrong with this?
Is it broken?

168
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,569
It won't move.

169
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,034
Changsoo, I think the
wheels are broken.

170
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:30,636
Let's go back in.

171
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,035
They're turning well.

172
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,136
Listen, Taesoo.

173
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:40,034
I'm going back to my room
when you told me to leave,

174
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:43,335
but don't think
I got scared by your threat.

175
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:47,936
Once I fix the wheels,
I'll leave right away. Changsoo.

176
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:50,936
Go get a screwdriver
and come in with this.

177
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,034
The wheels are fine.

178
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:53,302
Just shut up and come in!

179
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:56,035
We can leave. Mom!

180
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:05,034
By the way,
where on earth has she gone?

181
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,035
It's dangerous at night.

182
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:25,303
Well, I've endured for 30 years.
I can't give up now.

183
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,436
I will roust Minjoon and
let Jaejoon have the hospital.

184
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:08,034
I worked frantically hard
to achieve something in life.

185
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:11,537
But I always
ended up empty-handed.

186
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,570
I dozed off again.

187
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,035
I always put my
worst foot forward.

188
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:42,035
Thank you so much
for today. Good night.

189
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,203
Lena.

190
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:06,035
You said your life might end up
in failure if you fail this time.

191
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,035
That'll never happen.

192
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,035
This time,
you have me by your side.

193
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:23,136
Thank you.

194
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:26,035
Drive safely.

195
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:56,637
What's wrong with me?

196
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,370
Why is my heart racing?

197
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,035
Get a grip.

198
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:12,336
You still didn't learn a lesson?

199
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:17,336
Men eat the orange
and throw the peel away.

200
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:24,203
He's only a ladder
for my success.

201
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,034
Is it your marriage ring?

202
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:13,035
I read an article
about your love for your wife.

203
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,136
Excuse us.

204
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,769
We came to see
if we can work here.

205
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,035
I don't hire inexperienced people.

206
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,235
I'm not inexperienced.

207
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:49,769
I made stuffed animals
in Taiwan for 3 years.

208
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,136
And I picked bananas
and pineapples there for 4 years.

209
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,169
Really?

210
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:02,202
So you have
international experience.

211
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:07,034
Yes. If you give us a chance,
we'll do anything.

212
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:09,269
Come on,
don't say like an amateur.

213
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,502
Everybody in this
Whiz Sideline is a pro.

214
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:15,103
Take a look around.

215
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,236
They seem to be whizzes.

216
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:36,035
Can we do it like they do?

217
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:10,035
Enough.
You may leave.

218
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,270
Bastard.

219
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,303
I wonder if he is alright.

220
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:21,336
I almost scorched it!

221
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:26,035
It's done.

222
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:31,035
Where's my recipe notebook?

223
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,702
Esol, hurry.
You might be late for job interviews.

224
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:41,369
Can't you knock?
You scared me.

225
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:47,034
Oh, sorry.
Hurry up. I'll go out.

226
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:50,202
Wait. Have you seen
my recipe notebook?

227
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,035
I can't find it anywhere.

228
00:20:58,004 --> 00:20:59,004
Hey.

229
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,102
Don't you think
you're going too far?

230
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:05,502
Why?
Oh, because I lost it?

231
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:09,068
No, it's not that.
I'm a man.

232
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:15,203
How can you crawl around
in your underwear in my presence?

233
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:18,802
You're not a man to me.

234
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:22,202
We used to swim in our skin
and go to a bathhouse when little.

235
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:23,203
Hey!

236
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,034
I'm not who I used to be.

237
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,937
I'm a grown up, mature man!

238
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,034
What's wrong with him?

239
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:39,169
Is he at the awkward age?

240
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:43,035
By the way,
where on earth has it gone?

241
00:21:58,537 --> 00:22:03,168
Jaejoon, give me 30,
or at least 10 minutes.

242
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:09,035
I need to explain
what happened. Please.

243
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:13,136
Jaejoon,

244
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:18,003
your mom and dad had a
big fight last night over your hospital.

245
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:22,034
I spoke with Mom.
She needs some time alone.

246
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:23,035
Huh?

247
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:27,202
Why don't you act charming
and pester your dad?

248
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:31,536
"Dad, can you set up
a hospital for me? Please." Like this.

249
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:33,034
- Uncle Changsoo.
- Yes?

250
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:38,035
Don't worry.
They'll stop fighting over that matter.

251
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:42,169
What does he mean?

252
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:46,035
There's a bite in his words.

253
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:53,035
Why is it still on YouTube?

254
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,203
Didn't you ask the police
to delete video clips?

255
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:58,068
I did.

256
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:02,269
Then why are some
still on the Internet?

257
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,034
They keep spreading them.

258
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:11,436
Yura became famous overnight,
"Water Bombed Club Girl!"

259
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:17,903
Be quiet.
Did you tie Jaejoon's tongue?

260
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:19,034
Who knows?

261
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:23,035
Yura constantly called him
but he didn't answer.

262
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,870
I'm going nuts.

263
00:23:30,737 --> 00:23:31,737
No.

264
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:35,035
I'm not Hyejin
if I back off here.

265
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:40,034
Heera is quiet, which means
she doesn't know about it yet.

266
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,502
I must persuade Jaejoon
once he comes to work.

267
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:45,603
Will he come to work?

268
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:48,034
He saw everything?

269
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:51,034
Shut the mouth.

270
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:54,034
But from a
common-sense point of view...

271
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:55,637
One, two!

272
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,769
Yes. Did Dr. Park
come to work?

273
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,035
Yes, he just went up.

274
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:16,370
Okay. The game is on.

275
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:20,737
Jaejoon.

276
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,004
I have to work.
Please get out.

277
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:31,235
No. I came since you
didn't answer the phone.

278
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:36,034
I know you're upset
but please listen to me.

279
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:39,869
I'm not upset.
I'll tell Dr. Choi everything.

280
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,969
Like what?
You mean you'll break up with me?

281
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,035
Yura.

282
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,770
No! Please don't do that.

283
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,936
Don't be so petty.

284
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:55,102
Girls at my age go out
on the razzle at a club.

285
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:59,034
I learned all sorts of dances
since I was little.

286
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:01,670
Korean dance,
ballet, jazz dance...

287
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:07,537
So when I hear music,
my body moves in spite of myself.

288
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,035
I have to work.

289
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,035
No. You can't go!

290
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,636
You can't move an inch
before you change your mind.

291
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:18,035
Yura.

292
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:21,502
Jaejoon, cut me some slack.

293
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:27,034
I will quit drinking and clubbing
if you tell me not to.

294
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:34,035
If you break up with me,
I'll be dead in my mom's hands.

295
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,035
Do you love me?

296
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,136
I'm sorry?

297
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:42,570
Do you love me enough
to marry me?

298
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,303
Well...

299
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:52,937
I'm not mad at you.

300
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,770
On the contrary, I thank you.

301
00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:00,402
We both were
pushed to marry but...

302
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:04,034
you being honest with yourself
encouraged me.

303
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:07,034
Let's break up for both of us.

304
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:08,035
Jaejoon.

305
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:12,236
Don't worry.
I won't cause you damage.

306
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:16,034
Jaejoon, wait.

307
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:19,436
Break up?
With whose permission?

308
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:23,103
You think it's possible?

309
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:26,669
Didn't you hear what she said?

310
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,335
She only danced at a club.

311
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:32,736
She was highlighted
since she was outstanding.

312
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:37,669
She didn't have a fling with a man
or have a dirty past.

313
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:42,035
Her dance at the club
can't be a ground for breakup.

314
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,035
Right.

315
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:49,035
You're mutually at fault.
You too had fun at the club.

316
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:56,870
Please accept my resignation.

317
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:02,870
Were you this foolish?

318
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,034
Can't you see what
your breakup means?

319
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:13,034
Your marriage is not just
about you and Yura...

320
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:17,737
but more about business
beyond the two families.

321
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,034
Yet, will you break up with her
and neuter the great synergy...

322
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:28,135
from your marriage just because
you think she's ill-behaved?

323
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:31,769
Yes, I will break up with her.

324
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:37,035
I'd rather listen to my heart than hope
to get a rake-off from the synergy.

325
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:40,034
What? Dr. Park!

326
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,034
I don't want to ruin
your friendship with my mother.

327
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,669
I'll bear all the responsibility.

328
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,336
Thank you for everything.

329
00:27:57,035 --> 00:28:00,034
Boy. He's manly.

330
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:01,035
What?

331
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:04,034
Well, you want me
to bring him back?

332
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:05,035
One, two, three!

333
00:28:05,036 --> 00:28:08,670
Don't. It won't work.

334
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:10,770
What's in your mind?

335
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:12,035
Can I break up with him?

336
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:13,270
Are you crazy?

337
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:19,737
Now I have no choice
but to use the last card.

338
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:23,035
The last card?
Like what?

339
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,870
You don't need to know.

340
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:33,135
So you lived in Taiwan.

341
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:35,435
Yes, I lived there for 6 years.

342
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:39,369
I got certificates for
Chinese and Korean cuisines there.

343
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,003
Really.
Seems you're industrious.

344
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:46,034
Why didn't you
go to college then?

345
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:47,035
Excuse me?

346
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:53,034
I dropped out of college
for family reasons.

347
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:57,034
I think field experience is as important
as the school education.

348
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:02,034
I learned a lot from experience.

349
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:06,034
Her mother is half-educated.
You can tell her backgrounds.

350
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,035
Really?

351
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:14,502
Well, you're dressed up today.

352
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,502
Can you dance before us?

353
00:29:16,503 --> 00:29:20,034
Yes. It's written here your hobby
is singing and dancing.

354
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:21,904
Show us.

355
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:25,503
Come on.

356
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:30,034
A good staff these days
can liven up the mood.

357
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:34,034
Do you know
'Poison' by J.H. Uhm?

358
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:35,637
Poison.

359
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:40,803
Yes. I'll do my best.

360
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:03,069
Keep going.

361
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:10,035
You're making a fool out of me.

362
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:15,034
I really need a job
so I came here in desperation.

363
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:18,770
Even though you're interviewers,
how could you...

364
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,035
You know what?

365
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:28,035
You can't have the
upper hand over me forever.

366
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:36,336
I might be back
as your customer someday.

367
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:33,503
The person you have dialed
is not available.

368
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:41,402
Mom, I have
something to tell you.

369
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:43,136
Give me a call
when you get this message.

370
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,035
Chef Esol Kang?

371
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:08,035
Esol Kang...

372
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:11,737
Esol Kang?

373
00:32:13,004 --> 00:32:16,035
So you are Esol Kang.

374
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:21,035
Now I learned your real name.

375
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:41,034
Monthly Plan of Esol Kang.
Go, Esol! You can do it!

376
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:47,502
There are so many things I want to do
but I can't because of my family.

377
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:51,034
Do you have to do this job?

378
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:55,536
Doesn't it hurt your pride
to sing before drunken men?

379
00:32:55,537 --> 00:33:00,436
Sometimes, there are things
to come before my pride.

380
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:32,203
It's good!

381
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,135
Paprika tastes
different per color.

382
00:33:35,136 --> 00:33:37,034
Mom, try it.

383
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:39,869
Paprika is good for your stress.

384
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,034
How indifferent!

385
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:50,034
How can you possibly eat
when we haven't heard from Heera?

386
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:54,034
Yes, we have.
She needs some time alone to think.

387
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:59,737
So what does she
have to think about so long?

388
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:03,035
Perhaps, something bad
happened to her.

389
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:08,035
She's pretty, she looks rich.

390
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:12,034
Someone might have
kidnapped her.

391
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:13,869
Who would have kidnapped
a middle-aged woman?

392
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,703
And she's so heavy
you might break your back.

393
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,936
Sample menu fair?
Already?

394
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:27,035
Yes, we'll release new menus
next week with publicity.

395
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,034
You look full of confidence.

396
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:33,402
Seems Lena acts her part well.

397
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:34,736
I feel reassured.

398
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:36,034
If this new menus make a hit,

399
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:38,302
we can push into
Shanghai right away.

400
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,369
Maybe next month...

401
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,370
Minjoon.

402
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:48,035
Actually, I called you in
regarding that matter.

403
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:54,035
How about putting it off?

404
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,636
Things are messed up.

405
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:00,502
Your business expansion...

406
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:03,903
and Jaejoon's marriage
came up all at once...

407
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:06,035
and it's beyond my limit.

408
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:09,369
Though I have money to burn,

409
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:14,035
it's too much for me
to support you both.

410
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:15,203
So...

411
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:17,035
I see your point.

412
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,703
Support Jaejoon first.

413
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,335
I think Stepmother
wishes it too,

414
00:35:23,336 --> 00:35:25,569
though she didn't show it.

415
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,034
Well, it's not
because she wishes it...

416
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:33,035
As long as
you are happy, I'm fine.

417
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:39,203
Well, I'm really sorry.

418
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:42,035
I'll get back to work.

419
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,870
That's my boy.
Very thoughtful.

420
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:58,436
That's why I trust him.

421
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:14,469
This is Spicy Chicken
Margherita Pizza.

422
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,303
Have a taste.

423
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:31,035
It's great!

424
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:34,034
It has a grilled chicken taste.

425
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:38,034
Yes. It's spicy yet sweet,
very inviting.

426
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:41,034
I think it'll make a big hit.

427
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:44,034
Ha. It's not different
from the pizza I made.

428
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,202
Yes, it is.

429
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,035
Chicken meat is
as chewy as cheese.

430
00:36:48,036 --> 00:36:50,034
Did you use different chicken?

431
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:51,035
Yes.

432
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:54,302
The secret of this pizza
lies in the meat.

433
00:36:54,303 --> 00:36:56,202
See?

434
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:57,703
Shut up.

435
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:00,103
I know that much.

436
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:05,034
I think it'll bring us success
with a good marketing.

437
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:07,435
Thank you for your
hard work so far.

438
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,035
Thank you!

439
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:16,637
Guess the response was good.

440
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,869
Why yes.

441
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:23,736
I beat the bush and
Ms. Jeong caught the birds.

442
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:25,870
This new menu
will be successful.

443
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:28,035
Good job, everyone.

444
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,034
Ms. Jeong,
you need to come with me.

445
00:37:31,035 --> 00:37:33,537
Sorry? To where?

446
00:37:37,336 --> 00:37:38,769
What the.

447
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,035
They always go in couples.

448
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:44,270
Are they
seeing each other or what?

449
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:51,034
What is it?

450
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,969
Mrs. Park,
we got a problem.

451
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,034
Lena Jeong twists
Mr. Park around her finger.

452
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:58,034
If her new menu is released,

453
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,936
she'll be on a roll.

454
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:01,469
What should we do?

455
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,435
Where are you calling?

456
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:06,102
In the restroom.

457
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:11,603
I clearly told you to
keep this matter between us.

458
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:16,034
Don't worry, Mrs. Park.
My mouth is tight.

459
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:18,836
I initiate contact with you.

460
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:23,836
So don't make a call to me.
Understood?

461
00:38:23,837 --> 00:38:26,035
Okay. I'm sorry.

462
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:29,035
Lena Jeong will be on a roll?

463
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:32,035
Don't make me laugh.

464
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,035
With this,

465
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:38,035
I can finish her today.

466
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:45,034
How are you, sir?

467
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:46,102
Is it ready?

468
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:48,035
Yes.
Come this way please.

469
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,068
- Here's the car key.
- Thanks.

470
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,370
How do you like it?

471
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,802
I'm busy.
Why did you bring me here?

472
00:39:02,803 --> 00:39:04,034
Can't you tell?

473
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:07,034
I bought a new car.
Take the wheel.

474
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:08,035
Excuse me?

475
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:10,469
Why should I drive your car?

476
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,034
What do you mean why?

477
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:14,702
Did you forget
I drove you home several times?

478
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:17,503
You can at least
do me this favor. Take it.

479
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:20,435
Mr. Park.

480
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:22,103
You said you're busy.

481
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:27,502
The person you have dialed
is not available.

482
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:31,637
Dang it.
Where on earth is she?

483
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:35,570
She's worrying me too much.

484
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:41,302
Sir, your wife is here to see you.

485
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:43,937
What?
My wife?

486
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,502
What tea would you like to...

487
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:50,035
Just leave us alone.
Get out.

488
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:56,502
Honey, I'm sorry.

489
00:39:56,503 --> 00:40:01,402
I'm sorry no matter what.
Just don't leave home again.

490
00:40:01,403 --> 00:40:04,336
Without you,
I couldn't focus on work,

491
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,034
I couldn't sleep,

492
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:09,035
and I couldn't even eat.

493
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,035
Honey, forgive me.

494
00:40:18,035 --> 00:40:19,936
Are you still mad at me?

495
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:24,035
What should I do
to have your forgiveness?

496
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:28,435
Honey, I'm sorry.

497
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:32,335
I'm really sorry, so don't cry.

498
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:34,035
It's not that.

499
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:38,236
I'm not crying because of you.

500
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,035
I'm just disappointed in myself.

501
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,570
I...

502
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:52,203
made a resolution to love Minjoon
as my own when I married you.

503
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,903
Surely, the skin
is nearer than the shirt.

504
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:05,335
I've come to favor
Jaejoon before I realized it.

505
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:10,034
No, it's not your fault.
That's human nature.

506
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,035
No.

507
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,303
I don't deserve
to be his mother.

508
00:41:16,403 --> 00:41:18,302
You were right,

509
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:22,536
so feel free to support Minjoon first.

510
00:41:22,537 --> 00:41:24,702
No.

511
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:28,335
I will build the hospital
for Jaejoon first and then...

512
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:29,937
No, no.

513
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:33,436
Like you said,

514
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:37,904
Jaejoon can't gear
his ability to the job now.

515
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:44,470
Minjoon is your successor
so please support him first.

516
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:48,235
Okay.

517
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:50,303
If you insist,

518
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:56,035
I'll support him first and
look after Jaejoon's needs right away.

519
00:41:56,603 --> 00:42:01,034
But if any problem
comes up with Minjoon,

520
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:07,035
I'll build the Qingdao hospital
for Jaejoon first, okay?

521
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,034
Okay.

522
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:16,136
That'll never happen
but thank you for saying that.

523
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,136
Oh, that's my wife.

524
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:26,035
Honey, life is short.
Let's not fight.

525
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:29,869
You are my sunshine.

526
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:34,035
So please smile
like a bright sunshine.

527
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,035
Please smile.

528
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,034
You're so...

529
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,004
Please.

530
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:47,469
Oh, that's my beautiful wife!

531
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:52,136
My beautiful wife!
Oh, my beautiful wife!

532
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:11,670
Mr. Park!
Here you are.

533
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:18,035
Keep it.
It's your car.

534
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:20,035
I'm sorry?

535
00:43:20,036 --> 00:43:25,402
You returned the rental car.
Use this car.

536
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,035
Wait.

537
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:32,034
Why are you
giving this car to me?

538
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:37,035
If it's out of a personal favor,
I want to refuse it.

539
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:39,537
Why?

540
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:41,035
You really don't know?

541
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:43,035
You're a married man and...

542
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:46,035
Don't trust the article you read.

543
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:49,270
You don't tell the truth
when interviewed.

544
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:53,035
I bought you this car
for one reason.

545
00:43:53,837 --> 00:43:58,802
I want to give my partner
the best working environment.

546
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,036
You've done well so far,
so it's a kind of reward.

547
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:07,303
That's all.
So feel free to take it.

548
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:30,069
A reward?

549
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:35,837
Yes, now my
ability is recognized.

550
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:39,035
Sure, Mr. Park.

551
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,770
I'll drive to the top.

552
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,035
Who is it?

553
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:55,035
Yes.

554
00:44:55,036 --> 00:44:56,436
Ms. Lena Jeong?

555
00:44:57,035 --> 00:44:59,670
Can we meet?

556
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:01,035
Who's calling please?

557
00:45:01,036 --> 00:45:03,470
You'll see when we meet.

558
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,068
I'll text the place to you.

559
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:07,069
Wait.

560
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,034
Why would I...

561
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:12,034
You know Mr. Sungsoo Kim,
don't you?

562
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:15,035
It's about him.

563
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:31,034
Wonderful!
That is it!

564
00:45:31,035 --> 00:45:35,168
It'll make us look great
on the mountain.

565
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:40,034
Absolutely!
We want that outfit each.

566
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:45,034
What freehanded ladies!
Let me size you with my eye.

567
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:47,603
Well, well.

568
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:50,370
Guess you wear size 4.

569
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:56,503
And guess you wear size 5.

570
00:45:57,203 --> 00:45:58,035
Right?

571
00:45:58,036 --> 00:46:02,035
You're a handsome,
excellent sales clerk.

572
00:46:03,035 --> 00:46:04,035
He's cute.

573
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:07,235
So are you Dongoo's friend?

574
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:08,236
Yes, sir.

575
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:12,135
You look like a
model in that outfit.

576
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:17,034
Why don't you
work full-time here?

577
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:19,034
Really?
As a sales clerk?

578
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:21,135
Yes. Salaries and incentives,

579
00:46:21,136 --> 00:46:22,702
health insurance,
and paid vacation.

580
00:46:22,703 --> 00:46:24,034
How does that sound?

581
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:26,035
- I'm okay with...
- No!

582
00:46:27,837 --> 00:46:30,702
She can't.
She's a culinarian.

583
00:46:30,703 --> 00:46:32,736
She came to help me
just for today.

584
00:46:32,737 --> 00:46:34,004
Really?

585
00:46:34,035 --> 00:46:36,069
I'm sorry.

586
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:40,035
You can come here often though.

587
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:46,034
Why did you cut him off?
It wasn't a bad offer.

588
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:49,369
Don't give up just because
you failed job interviews.

589
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,035
You're a born cook.

590
00:46:55,035 --> 00:46:58,035
No. Maybe I'd better give up.

591
00:46:58,436 --> 00:47:03,536
It's hard competing with
all the elite college graduates.

592
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:06,670
And I swallowed an insult today.

593
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:11,034
Then how about
going back to college?

594
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:12,802
I'll support you.

595
00:47:12,803 --> 00:47:14,636
If I work hard
and receive incentives,

596
00:47:14,637 --> 00:47:16,034
I can pay your tuitions.

597
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:18,636
What?
Why would you do that?

598
00:47:18,637 --> 00:47:20,035
Huh?

599
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:24,636
Well, it's kind of
an investment.

600
00:47:24,637 --> 00:47:26,034
Later when you succeed,

601
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:29,034
I can eat free meals
at your restaurant.

602
00:47:29,035 --> 00:47:31,770
Get real. Forget it.

603
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:39,035
It's not in our lot to attend college
when we have to earn our bread.

604
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:45,034
I'm serious.
Give it a thought.

605
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:46,736
Forget it.

606
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:50,035
Let's work hard and make money.

607
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,035
Fool.

608
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:58,035
I meant our marital home
by the free meals.

609
00:48:06,035 --> 00:48:07,035
Yes.

610
00:48:08,436 --> 00:48:10,035
Yes, this is she.

611
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:16,503
Really?
Oh, thank you!

612
00:48:17,035 --> 00:48:18,035
Yes.

613
00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:21,302
Sure, I'll be right there.

614
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:22,403
Bye.

615
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:26,035
Dongoo!

616
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:29,034
Why, something good
happened to you?

617
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:33,035
I found my recipe notebook.
I'll be back soon.

618
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:52,302
Excuse me.

619
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:55,502
Did you call me
to return my recipe notebook?

620
00:48:55,503 --> 00:48:57,035
Have a seat.

621
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:05,034
This is my treasure.
I was upset after I lost it.

622
00:49:05,035 --> 00:49:07,603
Thank you for turning it in.

623
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:09,036
Wait.

624
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,335
I can't give it to you
for nothing.

625
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:15,035
I made time to come here.

626
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,034
Then how much
do you want as a reward?

627
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:22,335
You're going too far.

628
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:25,035
You think money is everything?

629
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:29,135
I feel pathetic
for having worried about...

630
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,502
your losing this notebook forever.

631
00:49:31,503 --> 00:49:32,203
Wait.

632
00:49:32,204 --> 00:49:34,636
'What if he never wakes up?'

633
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:36,536
'What if he has
a serious disease?

634
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:39,035
Something happened to him?'

635
00:49:39,703 --> 00:49:44,034
I feel pathetic for
having worried about you.

636
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:45,702
I helped you not for money,

637
00:49:45,703 --> 00:49:47,269
I helped you not for money,

638
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,034
but out of concern for you.

639
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:51,603
But out of concern for you.

640
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,004
How are you?

641
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,003
What happened?
How did you get this?

642
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:08,569
I think you left it in my car
the day you took me to the hospital.

643
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,569
Oh, I can relate.

644
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:15,034
Fool, I never thought that.

645
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:17,035
I want my reward.

646
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:19,103
Okay.

647
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:28,737
What is this?

648
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:30,937
Fortune cookie.

649
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:36,035
It's a reward from my heart.
Hope it'll bring you luck.

650
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:44,570
By the way, it's filled with recipes.
Are you a would-be chef?

651
00:50:49,136 --> 00:50:51,035
It's my dream.

652
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:59,004
I have licenses and work experiences
but it's hard to get a job.

653
00:51:02,737 --> 00:51:07,569
How about dinner with me?
You owe me.

654
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,836
Sorry, I have to
get back to work.

655
00:51:10,837 --> 00:51:12,703
Oh, really?

656
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,703
Okay.

657
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:18,803
Don't forget you owe me dinner.

658
00:51:21,637 --> 00:51:24,637
Okay.
Goodbye.

659
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:39,035
We're back.

660
00:51:39,036 --> 00:51:41,035
- We're back!
- Hi!

661
00:51:43,035 --> 00:51:46,034
You sound happy.
You have good news?

662
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:47,035
Yes.

663
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:51,034
Did you pass the interview?

664
00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:52,435
I'm proud of you!

665
00:51:52,436 --> 00:51:58,435
See? I told you
she's good enough to get a job!

666
00:51:58,436 --> 00:52:02,335
Wait.
I want to celebrate it.

667
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:07,936
One, two, three, four!
You are the best

668
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:11,903
You are the best

669
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:16,034
You are the best to me

670
00:52:16,035 --> 00:52:18,034
It's not that.

671
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:20,537
She failed job interviews.

672
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:27,035
Sorry, I failed.

673
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,537
I was happy to find this.

674
00:52:31,203 --> 00:52:38,669
Oh, is that so?
We're acting silly.

675
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,035
Sorry, Esol.

676
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:44,034
No, don't be sorry.

677
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:48,803
Family's meant to comfort
and support each other.

678
00:52:49,904 --> 00:52:51,469
<Esol Kang>

679
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,802
A job?

680
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:53,903
Yes.

681
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,034
I think she has great potential.

682
00:52:56,035 --> 00:52:57,035
She's a good cook,

683
00:52:57,036 --> 00:53:00,136
her Chinese is excellent,
and she's pretty.

684
00:53:00,937 --> 00:53:02,034
If you hire her,

685
00:53:02,035 --> 00:53:05,035
your business in China
will be smooth and easy.

686
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:09,603
Who is she that
you ask me for a job for her?

687
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:12,936
Just a friend.

688
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:14,103
You like her, don't you?

689
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:18,068
Nice aroma.
What brand is this?

690
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,034
Okay, I won't ask anymore.

691
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:22,034
I'll meet her.

692
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:26,869
If she's really competent,
I will give her a job.

693
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,369
You mean it.
Stick to your word.

694
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:35,702
Sure. I can do
the favor for my only brother.

695
00:53:35,703 --> 00:53:37,034
Don't worry.

696
00:53:37,035 --> 00:53:40,034
I love you, Minjoon.

697
00:53:40,035 --> 00:53:44,035
I give you my heart. Bye!

698
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,035
Esol Kang?

699
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:12,169
It's a reward from my heart.
Hope it'll bring you luck.

700
00:54:13,035 --> 00:54:14,370
Okay.

701
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:26,236
"Your dream
will come true soon."

702
00:54:33,035 --> 00:54:34,469
Hospital coordinator?

703
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,869
Yes.

704
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,034
It's a plastic surgery hospital
in Chongdam.

705
00:54:38,035 --> 00:54:41,369
They need a coordinator
good at Chinese.

706
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,769
You're the right person.

707
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,503
Do you think they'll hire you?

708
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:49,035
I have a last interview
with the director.

709
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,537
<Cool!>

710
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,035
<Cook!>

711
00:55:00,837 --> 00:55:03,034
Sending you my luck.

712
00:55:03,035 --> 00:55:07,035
You will get a job soon.

713
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,034
Wish your mom is always upset.

714
00:55:20,035 --> 00:55:21,035
Why yes.

715
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:24,670
Otherwise we can't
eat these foods.

716
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:27,034
She always says,

717
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:27,837
"You'll get fat.

718
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,236
Just throw them away!
One, two!"

719
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:34,670
Look at me.

720
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:40,035
I just move as a
reflex action at one, two.

721
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,136
Oh, right.

722
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:46,969
I got a call from a
TV network to appear on TV.

723
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:47,803
Really?

724
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:50,435
Guess they saw your dancing video
and really liked it.

725
00:55:50,436 --> 00:55:51,703
On what program?

726
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,269
I Am a Singer?
Super Star Korea?

727
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,270
No.

728
00:55:56,035 --> 00:56:01,035
It's a morning show,
'How Is Your Daughter?'

729
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:06,837
I was offered to appear as a bad girl
with my face blotted out.

730
00:56:07,403 --> 00:56:09,235
Those bastards!

731
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:13,403
Tell them to mind
their own daughters.

732
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:16,034
Don't worry.

733
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:21,034
I will wipe out those
who give you a hard time.

734
00:56:21,035 --> 00:56:22,035
Even Mom?

735
00:56:23,035 --> 00:56:25,035
Yes, of course!

736
00:56:25,036 --> 00:56:27,169
Be quiet!

737
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:32,837
Yes, honey.

738
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,103
Let's just eat.

739
00:56:36,035 --> 00:56:37,436
<Resignation Letter>

740
00:56:39,303 --> 00:56:41,068
I will break up with her.

741
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,034
I'd rather listen to my heart...

742
00:56:43,035 --> 00:56:45,870
than hope to get
a rake-off from the synergy.

743
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,370
How impudent.

744
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:11,937
I can't help but
reveal the truth after 28 years.

745
00:57:13,737 --> 00:57:18,336
Heera will be shocked but
she'll understand after all...

746
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:23,803
since our common cause
is the Qingdao Hospital.

747
00:57:31,035 --> 00:57:34,034
But if any problem
comes up with Minjoon,

748
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:39,034
I'll build the
Qingdao hospital for Jaejoon first.

749
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:40,436
Alright?

750
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:44,069
Keep the promise, Taesoo.

751
00:57:45,169 --> 00:57:51,004
A problem will come up soon.

752
00:58:04,035 --> 00:58:05,936
Hi, Ms. Lena Jeong.

753
00:58:05,937 --> 00:58:07,169
Mrs. Park.

754
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:16,035
Why?

755
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,004
Are you surprised
because it was me?

756
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:32,703
I don't want to be interrupted
so I'll order later.

757
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,937
Was it you who called me?

758
00:58:39,035 --> 00:58:42,034
What's your business with me?

759
00:58:42,035 --> 00:58:47,035
I told you it's about Sungsoo Kim.

760
00:58:51,035 --> 00:58:53,069
I don't get it.

761
00:58:54,169 --> 00:58:56,637
Who is Sungsoo Kim?

762
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,370
I don't know who that person is.

763
00:59:04,035 --> 00:59:05,470
You don't know him?

764
00:59:06,703 --> 00:59:13,035
Sungsoo Kim of Youngdengpo
Private Detective Agency.

765
00:59:15,436 --> 00:59:17,035
Should I continue?

766
00:59:25,035 --> 00:59:26,970
Alright, ma'am.

767
00:59:27,637 --> 00:59:29,803
What shall I tell you first?

768
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,035
It was a put-up job.

769
00:59:34,403 --> 00:59:40,035
She asked me to pretend to faint
at the restaurant that day.

770
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:47,035
She said she'd save me if I
fainted from mango allergy...

771
00:59:51,035 --> 00:59:52,603
I'm sorry, Mrs. Park.

772
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:59,035
I did great wrong.
Please forgive me.

773
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:08,034
I was so desperate to get a job.

774
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:09,803
I mean it.

775
01:00:10,035 --> 01:00:12,637
I didn't have
any bad intentions.

776
01:00:13,703 --> 01:00:18,034
I wanted a job
to prove my ability.

777
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:22,669
I've worked really hard
and I still will.

778
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:25,269
If new menus are released,

779
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:30,102
sales will increase and
we'll make success in Shanghai.

780
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:36,035
I will work hard with my best
so please forgive me.

781
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:42,303
I thought you were smart
but seems you are not.

782
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:47,036
That's not what I want.

783
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:49,035
Excuse me?

784
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,035
What do you mean?

785
01:00:52,937 --> 01:00:59,035
Didn't you eavesdrop me
at the restaurant the other day?

786
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,769
I'm not interested
in management.

787
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:06,469
What if Minjoon succeeds
your father in the mean time?

788
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,068
If he succeeds Father,

789
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:09,402
that's good for both
the company and the family.

790
01:01:09,403 --> 01:01:14,034
What if you're left out forever?

791
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:17,035
There cannot be
two suns in the sky!

792
01:01:18,035 --> 01:01:20,034
If you're shouldered off now,

793
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:24,536
you'll live as a loser
for the rest of your life.

794
01:01:24,537 --> 01:01:28,503
You want to be
a loser all your life?

795
01:01:32,035 --> 01:01:33,035
You mean...

796
01:01:33,035 --> 01:01:34,035
Right.

797
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:40,035
What I want
is the fall of Minjoon Park.

798
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:46,035
To prevent his
success in Shanghai.

799
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:53,035
You'll release
new menus soon, right?

800
01:01:58,035 --> 01:02:00,169
Instead of what you prepared...

801
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:05,035
use this.

You're wily enough so I think
you don't need further instructions.

804
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,035
I'll leave the matter to you.

805
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:33,370
What if I say no?

806
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,837
Why should I do that?

807
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:46,670
I have no reason to do that.

808
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:50,168
What?

809
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:52,302
I can't do that.

810
01:02:52,303 --> 01:02:55,069
No, I won't.

01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:27,737
I didn't know
there's a place like this.

814
01:03:30,035 --> 01:03:32,536
Did you throw yourself
to Mr. Park?

815
01:03:32,537 --> 01:03:33,936
So sexy.

816
01:03:33,937 --> 01:03:36,034
Don't drool.
It might hit the floor.

817
01:03:36,035 --> 01:03:38,936
You're my lovely wife, Chef Kang.

818
01:03:38,937 --> 01:03:41,035
You think marriage is a joke?
Forget about it!

819
01:03:41,036 --> 01:03:42,536
Honey!

820
01:03:42,537 --> 01:03:44,435
Can you make me a star?

821
01:03:44,436 --> 01:03:47,168
You're a mere consumable of TNC.

822
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:51,034
It's natural to
switch to a higher ladder.

823
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,969
Now it's your turn to trust me.

824
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:56,035
To the first success
we'll make together!
