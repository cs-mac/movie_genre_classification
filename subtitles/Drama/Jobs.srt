1
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,294
I'm really excited
to be here.

2
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,231
We have something really special
to share with you today.

3
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,903
In total, between iMac
and PowerBook lines,

4
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,244
we have sold over
3 million units this year.

5
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,948
Okay. That's it.

6
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,328
Well, maybe there's
one more thing.

7
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,188
I'm about to show you
something that's amazing.

8
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,959
Something that no one else
in the world has seen yet.

9
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,603
Now, Jony, myself
and a small team

10
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,270
have been working really
hard on a secret project,

11
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,279
which is something
I've been known to do

12
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,179
from time to time.

13
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,545
The device I'm about
to introduce to you

14
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,815
is gonna revolutionize
an entire industry.

15
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,788
It's a music playing device.

16
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,722
Okay

17
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,891
We'll get to that in a minute.

18
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:09,798
Because what it represents is
as important as what it is.

19
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,897
It's a tool for the heart.

20
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:20,072
And when you can
touch someone's heart,

21
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,807
that's limitless.

22
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,250
If I do say so myself,
it's insanely cool.

23
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,483
It's a music player.

24
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:38,158
It's a thousand songs
in your pocket.

25
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,428
I'd like to introduce you

26
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,829
to the iPod.

27
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,040
Hey, Jobs.

28
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,112
Get up, man. Wake up.

29
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,486
I'm up.

30
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,890
I'm up.

31
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,058
I'm up.

32
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:04,905
Steve.

33
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,244
Hey, Daniel.
Hey, what's going on?

34
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,948
<i>Are you reading Be Here Now?
 Yeah, it's amazing.</i>

35
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,819
I'm reading that right now.
It's unbelievable.

36
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,153
It's the next level.
Hey, speaking of Be Here,

37
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,249
what happened to you last night?
Where'd you go?

38
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,760
I had to study.
I know, I know.

39
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,993
You know, I'm not dismissing
the value of higher education,

40
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,193
I'm just saying it comes at
the expense of experience.

41
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,328
The system can
only produce the system.

42
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,428
I don't want to be a part of that.
Neither should you.

43
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,339
I agree with you. It takes balls
to drop out like you did.

44
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,001
That's why you should.

45
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,010
I mean...
Steven.

46
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,646
Might I borrow
you for a moment?

47
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,850
I'll see you in, see you later.
Sure.

48
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,942
Thank you. Thanks. I hope
I'm not interrupting.

49
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,116
What about your classes?

50
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,855
I'm not a student
anymore, Jack.

51
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,687
Well, you're here,
and you're learning.

52
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,454
Sure sounds like
a student to me.

53
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,352
If you want me gone...

54
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,192
Why would I want
you gone, Steven?

55
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,030
I'm glad that
you're here.

56
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,794
Whether you're
paying or not.

57
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,863
Now, you're always carrying
this notebook around.

58
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,405
You obviously fancy
yourself as an artist.

59
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,872
Why don't you sit in
on some design classes?

60
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:08,310
No. Well, I like the idea of art the beauty.
But only in the right context.

61
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,405
Just not as a career. I don't
have the necessary talents.

62
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,574
But aren't you interested in electronics?
What about engineering?

63
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,381
There's a growing market for qualified
technicians. What about that?

64
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,080
I don't want to spend
my parents' money

65
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,748
to get a degree
and become something

66
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,189
as forgettable
as an electrician.

67
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,352
Excuse me, what, a degree is
a waste of time now? So...

68
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:30,095
For some. For others it offers validation.
Job security.

69
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,000
Steve...
I'll see you around.

70
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,535
Steven. To be continued.

71
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,749
What are you working on?

72
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,853
Nothing, really. It's homework
for calligraphy class.

73
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,016
It's beautiful.

74
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,864
Yeah, the teacher's
this monk, or something.

75
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,056
A monk?

76
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,269
Yeah. Robert Palladino.

77
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,698
He's totally inspiring.

78
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,532
My name's Julie.

79
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,209
Are you leaving?

80
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,543
Yeah. I have to go.

81
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,450
You want a hit?

82
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,881
Yes.

83
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,060
Yes, I do.

84
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,721
Can I take a couple?

85
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,768
Sure.
For my friends.

86
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,731
Well, my friend,
and my girlfriend.

87
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,749
It's so beautiful.

88
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,912
Like a window to the world.

89
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,357
What do you think
it's like in space?

90
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,485
It's...

91
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,592
beyond understanding.

92
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,128
Yeah.

93
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,327
Who has a baby,

94
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,605
and then just throws it
away like it's nothing?

95
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,004
You talking about
your birth parents?

96
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,013
Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

97
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:31,047
That's bad. Yeah. That's
making me really sad. I...

98
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,858
Sorry that my life
is ruining your high.

99
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,193
It's okay.

100
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,733
I miss you when
you're not around.

101
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,006
I love you, Steve.

102
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,808
I love you.

103
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,983
Space. The endless black deep.

104
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,888
What was it that
that guru used to tell us?

105
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,663
There is no time to waste.

106
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,233
Do you hear that?

107
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,174
What?

108
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,021
There he goes again.

109
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,604
Calligraphy is the artful and
visual expression of communication.

110
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,650
Take Garamond, for example.

111
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:11,051
A typeface specifically designed
to make the very act of reading

112
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,779
more natural.

113
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,804
Computers are inherently
designed to make your lives easier.

114
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,102
Theoretically there's no limit
to what computers can do.

115
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,323
It is not who you were
at birth that matters

116
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,757
but what you do with
the time you are given.

117
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,602
The moment of
your death is fixed.

118
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,933
Life is but a journey to
serenity, to its completion.

119
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,110
Be as simple
as you can be.

120
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,783
You'll be astonished
to see how uncomplicated

121
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,985
<i>and happy your
life can become.</i>

122
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,339
I don't even know what I'm
gonna do when I go back home.

123
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,848
What about you?

124
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,079
What are you gonna do when
you get back to The Valley?

125
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,519
Steve?

126
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,482
Steve? You okay?

127
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,376
No. No, no! No. It's
still black and white.

128
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,043
People want color.

129
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,246
Pong didn't have color.
So?

130
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,873
Let's do something better.

131
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,679
It can't do color.

132
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,775
Says who?

133
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,214
Okay, you refuse
to do anything

134
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,348
that vaguely escapes
your comfort zone.

135
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,618
You're not even my boss.

136
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:28,886
Well, I damn sure
should be.

137
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,188
Hey, Jobs!

138
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,119
What're you doing, Steve?

139
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,253
He's an idiot.

140
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,692
You know, and half
the people around here

141
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,133
don't know how
to design shit.

142
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,071
People are complaining
about your behavior.

143
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,102
Okay? And, yeah.
About mine?

144
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,974
And your odor.

145
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,777
Are you showering
like we discussed?

146
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:50,939
I'm wearing shoes.
You asked me

147
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,209
to wear shoes,
and I've got them on.

148
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,751
That's not part
of the deal, Steve.

149
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,752
You've gotta learn how to
work well with other people.

150
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,247
I'm just trying
to do it right, Al.

151
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,553
I know you are.

152
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,718
Then let me.

153
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,386
Listen, Steve!

154
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,397
You're good.
You're damn good.

155
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,895
But you're an asshole.

156
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,460
Well, that...

157
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,560
Hey. Let me finish.

158
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,332
I want you here.
I really do.

159
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,569
Somethings gotta change.

160
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,313
Give me my own project.
What?

161
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,908
Give me my own project.

162
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,349
I'll do it on my own.

163
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,617
And I'll make the best damn
game you have ever seen.

164
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,585
You're serious.

165
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,255
Okay, Steve.

166
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,959
I need someone to reprogram
a troublesome game.

167
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,193
But I'm on
a tight deadline.

168
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,758
So if you can deliver,

169
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,763
we'll pay you
up to $5,000.

170
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,639
$5,000?
Mmm-hmm.

171
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,833
Okay.

172
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,442
And as for your personal issues,
I think I may have a solution.

173
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,718
So many circuits.

174
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,078
Woz? Hey, it's Steve.

175
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,492
Thanks for saving my ass.

176
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,769
Of course. We're friends.
That's, that's what friends do.

177
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,342
I just can't work
for other people.

178
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:11,751
I guess I need my independence.
If that makes any sense.

179
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,852
Uh-huh.

180
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,554
That makes perfect sense.

181
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,633
I'm sorry for ruining
your Friday night.

182
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,594
Are you kidding me?
This is great.

183
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,631
I'd do this for free.
I really would.

184
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,540
But just out of curiosity,
how much are we getting paid?

185
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,037
$700.

186
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,280
Some big bucks there.

187
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,757
Shit.

188
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,935
This is good. Really good.

189
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,729
I know.

190
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,308
Wow. 4 days.
You aren't kidding around.

191
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,472
I'll have to show it to Nolan,
but this is, this is good.

192
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,985
Woz?

193
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,495
Hi. Hi.

194
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,159
Woz!

195
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,634
Hi! Yeah, I'm
in the living room.

196
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,499
Hey. Good news.

197
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,006
Huh? Let me guess, your
bosses liked the video game.

198
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,507
They loved it!
Ooh.

199
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,307
$350. Whew! That's not bad.

200
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,278
Not bad? It's great.

201
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,844
What are you working on?

202
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,508
I'm writing jokes for
my dial-a-joke machine.

203
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,953
I've got some really good funny Polish
jokes, which work because I'm Polish.

204
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,853
Hang out and tell me what
you think of this one.

205
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,016
Ready? Ready?

206
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,857
<i>What is long, and hard, that a Polish
bride gets on her wedding night?</i>

207
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,692
<i>A new last name.</i>

208
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,860
That's hilarious.

209
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,801
Pretty good, isn't it?

210
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,238
What do you call a beautiful
Polish girl? Lucky.

211
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,868
What's that?

212
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,303
Hmm?

213
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,210
Oh.

214
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,553
That. Now that
is gonna be cool.

215
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,648
It's a computer terminal board
I'm working on.

216
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,329
Hooks up to the TV
for the display.

217
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,259
What is it like, a kit?
What do you mean?

218
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,723
Well, well...

219
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,995
The code is still buggy,

220
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,267
but in theory it'll display
whatever you're working on. Like...

221
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,601
Show me.

222
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,701
Show you. Okay.

223
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:07,954
Wow.

224
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,746
<i>I don't care if HP
didn't like it. It matters.</i>

225
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,046
<i>Yeah.
It's got potential.</i>

226
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,577
<i>No, the Sex Pistols have potential.
This is the wheel.</i>

227
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,884
It's the
Industrial Revolution.

228
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,152
No more decks,
no more mainframes.

229
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,419
That changes everything.

230
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,586
It's pretty cool, I guess.

231
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,788
Hi, Charlene. Hello.
Hey.

232
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,764
Cool. It's profound. How could you
not tell me about this before?

233
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,234
I don't know. I was just working on it for my own.
It, it was a hobby.

234
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,170
Exactly. Exactly.
For your own. For you.

235
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:52,308
It's what you wanted. It's what
your gut' your instinct wanted.

236
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,345
Your big evolved brain wanted
something that didn't exist,

237
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,244
so you just willed it
into existence.

238
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,612
It's, what do you
call the system?

239
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,743
The operating system?

240
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,912
The operating, and it just shows you...
That's what I call it.

241
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,354
Yeah, it's just a real time
display of current operations.

242
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,483
You can see what you're working
on while you're working on it.

243
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,822
Okay. Look...

244
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,020
Don't you get this?
This is freedom.

245
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,656
This is freedom to create,
and to do, and to build,

246
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,631
as artists, as individuals.
Look, look, look.

247
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,533
But look,
you're overreacting.

248
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,437
Even if you were developing this for
freaks like us, and I doubt you are,

249
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,340
nobody wants to buy
a computer. Nobody.

250
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:30,005
How does somebody know what they
want if they've never even seen it?

251
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,103
Huh?

252
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,117
We're going to Homebrew.

253
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,111
No...

254
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,322
I am not presenting
anything at Homebrew.

255
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,189
I'm. No.

256
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,123
Why do people drive so slow?
Get out! Move!

257
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,064
I'm telling you right now,
I've been to Homebrew.

258
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,693
I understand the caliber
of people who speak there.

259
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,237
I'm not one of those people.

260
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,704
I'm telling you this thing is amazing.
I'm not...

261
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,366
You're gonna be great, Woz.

262
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,967
Steve, could you do me a
favor, could you just please

263
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,535
slow down a little bit
so that I feel like

264
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,582
there's a chance we might
actually get there alive.

265
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,151
I want to get there first
so we present first.

266
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,049
You know if we're
gonna do this thing,

267
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,247
we need to come up
with a name.

268
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,016
Yeah, I know. Something catchy.
Something...

269
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,250
I've been
thinking about it.

270
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,485
...electric.

271
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,021
It needs to feel like...
I don't know.

272
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,188
What about
Enterprise Computers?

273
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,254
No.

274
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,856
<i>No Star Trek names.
I swear.</i>

275
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,163
What about Kirk Enterprises?

276
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,396
I will drive this car
right off this road.

277
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,493
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine!

278
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,732
I will run the car
right off the road.

279
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,739
Jesus! Calm down! Seriously.

280
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,003
Okay. Nothing Trekkie. Jesus.

281
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,939
It just needs to be, like, something
that people will relate to, you know?

282
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,743
Like, it needs to be
something that you see,

283
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,580
and you're just, like,
"Man, I just gotta have it."

284
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,416
Apple.

285
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,620
Excuse me?

286
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,188
Apple.
Apple, like the fruit?

287
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,922
The fruit of creation. Apple.
It's simple but sophisticated.

288
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,695
It comes before Atari
in the phone book, too.

289
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:04,037
That is so much better
than Phaser Beam Computers.

290
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,770
It's naming it
after a fruit.

291
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,470
Apple. Apple Computer.

292
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,078
But, what about
Apple Records?

293
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,278
Apple Records?
The Beatles' label, stu...

294
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,783
What, they own
the word "apple"?

295
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,046
Why do you always
hate The Beatles?

296
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,143
Well, I do not
hale The Beatles.

297
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,983
Yes, you do. You always...
I do not hate The Beatles.

298
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,989
They're just, they're not
Dylan, and you know that.

299
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,060
Okay, and that's a comparison
that you always make.

300
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,287
Well, I...
'Cause it's obvious.

301
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,555
And I don't think it's fair.

302
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,426
Apple. Really? Apple?

303
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,667
Right, listen. If we come up with
something better, we'll change it.

304
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,567
Let's just go with it
and see if it sticks.

305
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:47,073
<i>It will display
up to 192 memory locations</i>

306
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,483
<i>on the monitor simultaneously.</i>

307
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:54,615
Allow me to explain because it's
quite fascinating, actually.

308
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,426
The logic board is rather complex,
especially compared to some of

309
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,763
the other boards here,
including of course,

310
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,493
the Altair.

311
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,033
And as you can see...

312
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,204
it's much smaller, and cheaper
to manufacture and build...

313
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,375
which, by using
dynamic RAM, I was able...

314
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:23,277
We were able to shrink the size
of the board substantially.

315
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,288
So, it works with
your television?

316
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,119
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

317
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:31,356
It will work on any
television, or video monitor.

318
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,023
All you need is
a radio frequency converter

319
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,893
to display the images
from your microprocessor

320
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,993
to your set output device.

321
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,471
And it'll run BASIC.

322
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:52,311
It will also run BASIC, which
I think could be a great...

323
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,385
So I guess that wraps it up. Thank
you very much for your time.

324
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,852
This was terrific. Fuck.

325
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,149
Tough crowd.

326
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,896
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Frank.

327
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,021
I'm Lutz.

328
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:12,160
And we're here with reduced
instruction set computing CPU.

329
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,911
Excuse me.
Name is Paul Terrell.

330
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,515
Saw your presentation.

331
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,009
And?

332
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,711
And I'd like
to talk business.

333
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,254
What can I do for you?
Well...

334
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,588
I own a local computer parts
store, in Mountainview.

335
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,786
The Byte Shop?

336
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,089
You buy computer parts.

337
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,631
Yeah. We sell transistors, boards,
soldering equipment, monitors.

338
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,200
You know, hobbyist types.

339
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,394
Like Radio Shack?

340
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,197
No.

341
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,136
Listen, why don't you stop
by and talk to me sometime.

342
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,437
There's my card.
Give me a call.

343
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,101
Great..

344
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,474
It was nice meeting you.

345
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,073
Steve Jobs.

346
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,648
Steve Jobs. All right.

347
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,380
Who was that?

348
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,387
It's Paul Terrell.
Oh.

349
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,125
Who?

350
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,660
So what kind of investment
are we talking about here?

351
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,532
Jesus, Steve. I said I was
interested, not buying.

352
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,095
I know. But you're also not
the only interested party.

353
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,869
Oh, really? I'm not?
No.

354
00:24:58,964 --> 00:24:59,999
You're not.
Hmm.

355
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,169
That's interesting.

356
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,371
Because it sure seemed that way
the other night at Homebrew.

357
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,109
You think that's the
first stop that we made?

358
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,317
We've been
all over The Valley.

359
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:11,617
Oh, well, then you
already have a retailer.

360
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:12,945
I got offers.

361
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:17,358
Look, Paul. My middle name's Paul.
My dad's name is Paul.

362
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,224
Bunch of Pauls. I'm...

363
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,820
I think we're
kindred spirits here.

364
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,499
We're both businessmen
that operate from our gut.

365
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,061
And my gut tells me to
give you this opportunity.

366
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:36,706
I'm thinking $400 per machine, for 50
units, paid at the time of delivery.

367
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,806
$400 for a hundred units,
a third up front.

368
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,011
We're not negotiating.

369
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,144
Yes, we are.

370
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:51,418
Okay. I'll pay $450
per machine. $450.

371
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:56,231
On delivery, nothing up front. I
know it's asking a lot, Steve.

372
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,892
But it's a big payoff
if you deliver.

373
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,997
When I deliver.

374
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,371
$500 per unit and
you've got a deal.

375
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,741
All right.
You got 90 days.

376
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,543
I'll have it in 60.

377
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,891
Daniel and I just didn't have
room at our place, so...

378
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,930
No, no.
I'm glad you asked.

379
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,430
We could move some things around,
give it a good cleaning.

380
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,266
I could move most of
my tools to the shed.

381
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,636
Maybe get you boys
a fan when it gets hot.

382
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:38,799
Ooh.

383
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,972
What do you think?

384
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,877
It's great, Dad.

385
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,473
Yes. It is.
This is perfect.

386
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:50,247
Good. Well, it'll be good to
see you building something.

387
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:56,152
Good. Hey, keep it neat.

388
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:57,952
Inside and out.

389
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:00,988
Thanks, Mr. J.
Mmm.

390
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,268
We got a shop.

391
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,933
Yes, we do.

392
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,314
How's it going?

393
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,790
And voila.

394
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:39,157
It's gotta be straighter. These
have to be more symmetrical.

395
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,032
We have 60 days to
complete 50 of these,

396
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,538
and you're worried
about the symmetry?

397
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,041
Sieve, nobody cares
about the look of the board.

398
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,111
I care.
Well, that's just great.

399
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,779
But we were out of time the minute
you made that stupid promise.

400
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:54,943
You're right.

401
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,112
Need help.

402
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,214
Woz.
Huh?

403
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,860
We got a problem.
Huh?

404
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,896
We got to figure out what to
do with all these employees.

405
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,291
You know Bill?
Bill.

406
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,028
Too long, Woz.
How are you?

407
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,364
Good to see you.
How is everyone?

408
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,562
Oh, this is my friend
Daniel Kottke.

409
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,003
Hey. I've heard a lot about you.
How're you doing?

410
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,740
Kottke?
Kottke from India, of course.

411
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,208
I've heard a lot
about you, too.

412
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,973
Don't touch that.

413
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,909
That's Chris Espinosa. Kid down the
street I was telling you about?

414
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,177
Nice to meet you, fella.
This is gonna be so cool.

415
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,983
Great. I'm so glad
that you're excited

416
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,648
about this thing
we're doing here.

417
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,850
Can I talk to you
for a second?

418
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:35,983
Yeah.

419
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,722
Excuse me, just please stop.
And go over there.

420
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,161
Just out of the way,
over there.

421
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:50,367
We can't afford to pay
3 people right now.

422
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:56,375
We can't afford to pay
ourselves, unless we deliver.

423
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,445
And don't worry about Chris. He's just a kid.
So he just wants to help.

424
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:03,912
You're just a kid.

425
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,050
Cheese!

426
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,026
Thanks, Mom.

427
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,294
So embarrassing.

428
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,871
All right.
As promised.

429
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,011
Nice board.

430
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,850
Where's the rest?

431
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,187
The rest?
This is all of them.

432
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,185
I asked
for 50 computers.

433
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:56,027
That's keyboards, cases,
monitors, and power included.

434
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,896
Not just boards.

435
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,635
Just boards? Excuse me? Just boards?
These are state-of-the-art.

436
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:07,006
The logic boards alone are...
Nobody's making anything like this.

437
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,739
They're, what, how dare you!
How dare you!

438
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:13,647
I think what my colleague
is saying is that...

439
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,849
You're not seeing
the possibilities here.

440
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,048
That is indeed one unbelievably
kick ass computer.

441
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,091
Not to the consumer.

442
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,488
Well, then maybe
your consumer

443
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,084
should start to
learn how to...

444
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,321
How to even work that,
don't you think?

445
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,023
Listen, boys.

446
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,062
You sold me on a home computer.
That's a keyboard and monitor.

447
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,694
This is a board.

448
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,070
Now, I'm sure this makes
a very capable starter kit,

449
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,573
but the everyday person,

450
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,700
the kind of person
that's not an engineer,

451
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,939
or in a computer club like you,

452
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,412
they're not gonna know
what the hell this is.

453
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,610
The average Joe doesn't want
to build their own computer.

454
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,050
They just want to buy it.

455
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,452
They want to take it out
of the box, plug it in,

456
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,387
and have it work.

457
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,614
Steve.

458
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,793
Are you listening to me?

459
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:03,529
Yeah. These are your boards.

460
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,396
And they will sell.

461
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,870
I can promise you that.

462
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,636
You saw our demo
at Homebrew.

463
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,767
You know what it's capable of
with the right components,

464
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,074
which, by the way,
all of which you sell.

465
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,543
So, demo it to the consumer.

466
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,745
And market
the components separately.

467
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,048
You show them your keyboards,
and your monitors.

468
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,749
You'll move more
inventory that way,

469
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,656
and you'll make a hell
of a lot more cash.

470
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,294
You got me.

471
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,635
All right, Steve.

472
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,497
I'll try to sell them.

473
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,304
But if I don't, I'm not
making another order.

474
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,469
Okay. That's fine.

475
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:52,071
But I think that you might be really
interested in our second model.

476
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,844
What's the second model?

477
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,143
What are
you talking about?

478
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,088
All-in-one.

479
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,680
Can I help you?

480
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,281
Yeah, I'm Rod Holt.

481
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,322
The technician.
We talked on the phone.

482
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,995
Of course. It's Rod.

483
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,869
Glad you could stop by.

484
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,141
Welcome to Apple Computer.

485
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,178
All right.

486
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,350
Show me this
revolutionary piece of shit.

487
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,384
The Apple ll.

488
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,484
It's the first ever all-in-one
personal home computer.

489
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,319
And you called
me because?

490
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:16,094
We need a heat efficient power supply.
In the case.

491
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,665
That's impossible,
but don't mind me.

492
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,703
I'm just, you know,
an engineer.

493
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,397
What's the wattage?

494
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,770
40 watts. And quiet.

495
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,668
What the hell do you mean, quiet?
I mean silent.

496
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,609
There's no such thing.

497
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,413
These things run hot.
They need fans in them.

498
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,847
Those bitches
ain't quiet.

499
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,076
That's exactly
why we need you.

500
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,446
To redesign it.

501
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,218
Redesign what?

502
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,590
The power supply.
From scratch.

503
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,791
It can't have a fan,
it can't overheat.

504
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,695
And ii needs to fit
inside a box this size.

505
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,110
Don't do that.
Please, don't do...

506
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,548
Whatever.
Do whatever you want.

507
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,060
My rate is $200 a day.

508
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,956
And if I ever think things
aren't working out, I walk.

509
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,056
Mmm-hmm.

510
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,664
Are we clear?

511
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,171
We're clear.

512
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,339
We're talking
about the future.

513
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,242
We're working in a market
that doesn't even exist yet.

514
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,807
What Intel has done
for the microprocessor,

515
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,608
we are gonna do for
the home computer.

516
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,182
How can you not know
what I'm talking about?

517
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,797
No, ma'am. But it
runs on a TV monitor.

518
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,762
Yes, like a television set.
Exactly.

519
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:04,770
I don't think you understand. It's not a TV.
It's a personal computer.

520
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,673
Okay, do you own
a typewriter?

521
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,975
Great. Okay, now do you use it?
Perfect.

522
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,518
So imagine combining your typewriter
with your television set.

523
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,190
No. Don't... Wait. Wait!

524
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,123
Wait. Please, sir,
don't, don't hang up.

525
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:29,957
Yes. We are small
right now, but we...

526
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,236
How do you know we're
working out of our garage?

527
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,405
Who told you that?

528
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,074
Ahhh!

529
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,978
Yes. Yes.

530
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,547
Well, thank you
for taking the time.

531
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,553
Yes, sir. Apple Computer.

532
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,884
Apple? Yes, like the fruit.

533
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,660
Who's that?

534
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:06,162
No. No. All I'm asking is
that you come visit us.

535
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,767
One meeting and I promise
you'll be on board.

536
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,767
Around $50,000
would be my guess.

537
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,943
Hello?

538
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,182
What did they say?

539
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,878
What the hell is
the matter with people?

540
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,544
Take it the call went well.

541
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:58,219
I would say I hope you choke, but that
burrito is gonna kill you either way.

542
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,821
Oh, come on, Steve.

543
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,754
Cool your jets, man.

544
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,317
Excuse you?

545
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,988
Just, you know, you're
so stressed, you know?

546
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,064
It's, like,
relax for a change.

547
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,559
For a change... Why? Why? So I can
be more like you two assholes?

548
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,127
Hey. I'm studying integrated
circuit design here, man.

549
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,398
Are you?

550
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,001
We each do our part.

551
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,738
Really? Then why do I suddenly
feel like your part is expendable?

552
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,675
Out here smokin' up like we're in India.
Well, wake up! We're not.

553
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,779
What happened to you?

554
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,512
You used to be...
What? I used to be what?

555
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,181
Motivated.
l am motivated.

556
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,588
Really? Then show me.

557
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,958
This is a business, Daniel.

558
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,855
And I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

559
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,261
I'm in there making
a hundred phone calls.

560
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,861
Rod is slaving away.

561
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,103
The kid always finds
something to do,

562
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,436
and God knows Woz
pulls his weight.

563
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,532
Thank you.

564
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,110
And that's
a whole lot of weight.

565
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,612
That really... That kind
of hurts my feelings.

566
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,013
Whoa.

567
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:14,289
Is this the right...

568
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,858
Apple Computer?

569
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,392
Yeah, this is us.
Yeah.

570
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,628
You expecting something else?

571
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:26,903
Uh, no. Well, yeah, maybe something
a little less Manson Family.

572
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,709
It's a startup.
Yeah.

573
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,513
I'm Mike Markkula.

574
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,005
Steve. Jobs.

575
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,219
Steve. I heard
a lot about you.

576
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,853
You spoke to Don Valentine
on the phone.

577
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,583
He and I are old
colleagues of sorts.

578
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,888
The VC from Atari.

579
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,824
Yeah, Valentine. He said
you called him 150 times.

580
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,227
Jesus.

581
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,231
He practically begged me to come
and look at your outfit here.

582
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,732
Called in
a personal favor.

583
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,661
Well, Mark.

584
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,829
Mike.

585
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,372
Mike.

586
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,675
Welcome to Apple Computer.

587
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,675
Thank you.
Yeah, is this...

588
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,502
This is everything?

589
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,843
Yes.
No.

590
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,282
No. We're, we're in 6 stores
in the greater area.

591
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,344
We'll be launching the
Apple ll in about a month.

592
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,411
In a few months.
It's close.

593
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,685
Gentlemen, is there
some place we can talk?

594
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,097
Here you are, fellas.

595
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,760
For you.

596
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:29,303
Steve's a fruitarian.
He will only eat fruit.

597
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,442
Okay, boys. I'll leave
you to your business.

598
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,566
Thank you.

599
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,303
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Mrs. J.

600
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,641
You're the best.

601
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,080
Yeah. So where were we?

602
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:45,053
I'm sorry, don't take this the
wrong way, but what's your angle?

603
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,144
Uh...

604
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,780
What my colleague is
trying to say is...

605
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,222
Where was your
last employment?

606
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,087
Intel.

607
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,633
So how much are we
talking about here?

608
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,634
What, the investment? That's
what you came here for.

609
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,831
Foreplay is not
Steve's strong suit.

610
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,134
Isn't it?

611
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,641
Yeah, well,

612
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,576
I've been looking for something
to really sink my teeth into.

613
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:24,086
Look, Steve. I'm willing
to take the risk.

614
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,095
And, this
certainly qualifies.

615
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,263
But risk disguised
as promise.

616
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,627
And you've shown promise.
I've seen it in your eye,

617
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,929
and I know that look
because I've had it myself.

618
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,205
Tells me you're
onto something big.

619
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,946
Yeah. Okay. To the point.

620
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,948
I think we should start
with around 90 grand,

621
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,112
see where that takes us.

622
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,557
Okay, I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that?

623
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:56,954
I'm sorry.

624
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,390
$90,000 isn't
gonna get it done.

625
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,657
Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait.
Steve, one second.

626
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:03,993
I don't see anybody else coming
in your garage with a checkbook.

627
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,294
Oh, no, no.

628
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,802
90 grand
gets it done for us.

629
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,203
I just don't think it
gets it done for you.

630
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,638
We'll do the
$90,000 investment.

631
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,905
At a $300,000 valuation.

632
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,480
But I also want you to kick
in a $250,000 credit line

633
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,880
with 10% interest to
be paid back in full

634
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,646
once we meet
net revenue positive.

635
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,156
Okay.

636
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:39,763
What I mean is, okay.

637
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,197
Yeah.

638
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,400
Now, the first thing
you need to do

639
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:51,503
is incorporate, so that you two as
owners can protect your interest.

640
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:56,447
And that is, of course,
if you'll have me aboard.

641
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,851
Thank you very much,
Mr. Markkula.

642
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,720
Of course. Mike. Yeah.

643
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,018
How're you doing?
Yeah, put her there.

644
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,355
- Bill.
- Bill?

645
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,416
- Fernandez.
- Yeah.

646
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,018
Oh. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah.

647
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,122
Steve. Here's to you, pal.

648
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,411
<i>Are you
even listening to me?</i>

649
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,638
I'm pregnant.

650
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,442
Steve, you have
to talk to me.

651
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,552
This is your
responsibility, too.

652
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:37,885
Don't you dare

653
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,890
blame this on me.

654
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,061
I'm not.
Mmm-mmm.

655
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,235
We both had
our moments of...

656
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,262
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

657
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,567
You.

658
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:58,770
When I was in India,
you were with, you know.

659
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,777
Steve? Are you crazy? You
cannot put this all on me.

660
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,309
You can't do this to me
right now. Not now.

661
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,087
Well, I'm sorry this
isn't part of your plan.

662
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,490
I'm sorry you
have a problem.

663
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,622
But it's not
happening to me.

664
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,258
But this is your...
No!

665
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,458
Get out of my house.

666
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:21,964
What?
Now!

667
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,605
Oh, Jesus. Here we go.

668
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,981
Hey. ls everything
okay out here?

669
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,657
Steven, he's kicking me out.

670
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,956
He doesn't want
anything to do with me.

671
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:54,633
Maybe
it's for the best.

672
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,969
You don't deserve to be treated
the way he treats you.

673
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,972
I'm pregnant, Daniel.

674
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,071
What? You're...

675
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,037
He says it's not his,
but I would never...

676
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,910
What did I do wrong?

677
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,021
You didn't do
anything wrong.

678
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,191
It's Steve.

679
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,824
That's just him.

680
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,201
He changed.

681
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,779
Hook them right
to your television.

682
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,990
It is, yeah.

683
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,701
What do you think, J?
Ready?

684
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,117
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Steve Jobs.

685
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,987
When I founded
this company,

686
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,222
I had one goal in mind.

687
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:35,195
And that was to do what nobody
else considered possible.

688
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,230
To put the power
and the beauty

689
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,632
of the world's most
advanced technology

690
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,631
in the hands and homes of
people just like you and me.

691
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:48,410
And I can promise you
that after today,

692
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,042
you will never look at
computers the same way again.

693
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:57,311
So I am proud to introduce
to you, and the world,

694
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,581
the future of
personal computing.

695
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,915
The revolutionary Apple II.

696
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:30,002
Gotta just start over.
It has to be intuitive.

697
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:33,979
Precognitive. I mean, I want
it to know what you want to do

698
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,914
before you even know
you want to do it.

699
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,815
Wait, are we still talking
about the command prompts?

700
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,253
Bill, we're talking about everything.
The whole thing.

701
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:45,760
Lisa. Guys, it's the future.
I'm telling you right now.

702
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,696
I mean, Lisa's
gonna do for the next 10 years

703
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:51,824
what the Apple ll
did for the last 3.

704
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:54,099
I can tell you
that right now.

705
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,934
Do you know why
people buy an Apple?

706
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,774
Why do they buy an Apple,
not the competitor?

707
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,101
Because it's got bravado.

708
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,508
It's social status.

709
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,014
No, you know what?
It's even more than that.

710
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,447
It's social currency.

711
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,676
We've raised the bar.

712
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:16,514
And if we want to stay there,
we gotta risk everything.

713
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:22,963
Great artists, Dylan, Picasso,
Newton, they risk failure.

714
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:27,228
And if we want to be great,
we've gotta risk it, too.

715
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:28,829
On the command bar?

716
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:29,963
On everything.

717
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,167
What...
And it starts with the little things.

718
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,867
There's over 20
different functions

719
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,342
tied to even single variation
of the command bar,

720
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,505
which by the way,
takes weeks to program.

721
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,812
We're not doing anything that
IBM's not already doing.

722
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,482
And I would rather
gamble on our vision

723
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,718
than make a me-too product.

724
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:52,851
We got to make the small
things just unforgettable.

725
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,591
Let's just start with something simple.
Lisa Write.

726
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:58,496
What happens if I click
on one of these tabs?

727
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,162
You get a drop-down menu,
and then there's preferences,

728
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,431
and page options.

729
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,062
Okay. Exactly.

730
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:09,605
Now, which tab do I click on
to get different font styles?

731
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:19,181
How many custom typefaces
are there on Lisa Write?

732
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:23,117
That's actually something that I wanted
to talk to you about, Steve, is...

733
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,193
I've been asking for
the fonts for months.

734
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,456
But everything we're talking
about is conceptual.

735
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:32,398
And I'm sorry, but typeface, it isn't
exactly a pressing issue right now.

736
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,861
Everything is
a pressing issue.

737
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,875
If we want to make the
vision for Lisa a reality,

738
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:47,212
we gotta put in the hours
and make something great.

739
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:50,309
Yeah, but we have a hard
date on this software,

740
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,251
and I'm sorry, but adding pretty
fonts is not gonna change that.

741
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,916
Well, Bill?

742
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,954
If you don't share
our enthusiasm,

743
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:05,496
and care for the vision
of this company...

744
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,296
No, no, no, no. I just,
I'm not understanding...

745
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:08,768
Get out.
What?

746
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,264
Get your shit and get out.
What, wait...

747
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,808
You're done.
What, you...

748
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,137
What, are you gonna,
you're gonna fire me?

749
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:16,336
No!

750
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,435
I already fired you!

751
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,974
Why are you still here?

752
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,260
Steve, he was our best
programmer in the division.

753
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,820
He's the best programmer that
doesn't care about our vision.

754
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:38,800
Okay. Look, I know it's not
my place to say it, but...

755
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,494
Then shut
the hell up, Bill!

756
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:41,793
Yeah.

757
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,328
So sorry to interrupt
you, Mr. Jobs,

758
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:47,034
but your attorney is
here for your 8:00.

759
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,142
All right.

760
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,606
I want to see samples
this afternoon.

761
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:58,984
Somehow we managed to design a word
processor that doesn't have fonts.

762
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,122
And it can't happen again.

763
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,187
So fix it!

764
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:22,203
2:00 to 3:00. And
your 10:00 is waiting for you.

765
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,510
Steve. Steve, hey.

766
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,985
Daniel. Hey.

767
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,350
Do you have
a second to talk?

768
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,047
I thought we rescheduled.

769
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:39,358
It'll only take a second.

770
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:41,595
That's what everyone says.

771
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:42,755
Steve.

772
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,832
Fine.

773
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,601
I don't have a lunch, so' meet
me at Good Earth at noon.

774
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,902
Okay. Cool.
Okay.

775
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,841
What are you
working on these days?

776
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,509
Oh, um.

777
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,944
Apple ll Plus repairs, mainly.

778
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,546
Right.

779
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,925
<i>I need you to sign this.</i>

780
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,520
<i>It legally preserves
your visitation rights.</i>

781
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:20,967
<i>I don't want them.
Lisa Brennan is not my child.</i>

782
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,128
<i>The courts disagree.</i>

783
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:27,437
Chris-Ann is a lunatic. It's impossible.
At the very least, improbable.

784
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:28,771
You knew going into this

785
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:31,870
the paternity test could prove
that you were the father.

786
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,310
There are 24 million
people in California.

787
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,111
That test has a 5
percent margin of error.

788
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,551
That's 1.2 million people that
could be the father of that child.

789
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,487
It's not me.

790
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:47,252
You don't need to convince me.
But you do need to sign this.

791
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,628
Miss Brennan is entitled
to your child support

792
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:53,497
regardless of whether
you sign it or not.

793
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:57,068
Do you really want to give
up the rights to see your...

794
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,835
To see her child
in the future?

795
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,807
I don't have time.

796
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,434
Not now.

797
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,970
Steven, as a father, I
implore you to sign this.

798
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,813
Regardless of whether you think
Lisa is your daughter or not.

799
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,580
There's no risk in signing.

800
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,582
Only the regret
if you don't.

801
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:29,670
<i>Frederick Rodney Holt,
he recently made</i>

802
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,099
an additional
preferred purchase

803
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:36,941
of 106,656 shares
at 19 cents a share.

804
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,141
Right, and to be clear,
this new purchase,

805
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:41,114
it does not affect
Mr. Holt's entitlement to

806
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,950
founder stock.

807
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,849
No, not at all. Steve?

808
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,047
No, no, no.
Rod gets his due.

809
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:48,980
Daniel Kottke,

810
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:53,188
<i>engineering technician, founding employee.
Now, at our last meeting I,</i>

811
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,797
I don't believe that
we meta consensus

812
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,665
as to Mr. Kottke's entitlement
to founder stock.

813
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,898
Well, in all honesty,
to be rewarding Daniel

814
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,166
with the same amount
of stock as Rod seems

815
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,402
a bit unfair.
Doesn't it?

816
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,505
Yes. Daniel gets nothing.

817
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:13,072
Nothing?

818
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:14,707
Don't you think
you should

819
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:16,842
think about what you're
doing, for a second?

820
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,314
I have thought about it.
Daniel gets nothing.

821
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,349
Yes, sir.

822
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,891
It's noted.

823
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:26,359
What?

824
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,391
Any low grade technician
could do his job.

825
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,433
I've been feeding him for years.
It's not personal.

826
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,900
Don't give me that bullshit, Steve.
Of course it's personal.

827
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:36,198
He can barely do his job.

828
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,500
If we give Daniel
preferred stock,

829
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,405
some engineer with 10 times
his talent gets nothing.

830
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,567
Then what happens?

831
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,702
Then we just draw this line
right here, right now, okay?

832
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,872
So you, what are you talking about?
Management, or...

833
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,244
Management and engineers.

834
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,338
Yeah, this means...

835
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,510
I know what it means, Mike.

836
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,181
Thanks.

837
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,784
No, he's...
You know what, I don't...

838
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:59,091
Okay then.
Shall we continue?

839
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,721
<i>We can assume
that Bill Fernandez,</i>

840
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,093
Randy Wiggington

841
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,961
and Chris Espinosa will not

842
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:06,432
<i>be receiving</i>

843
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,059
any options?

844
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:32,226
Drinking a beer, huh?

845
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,796
Tomorrow's
a big day for you.

846
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:39,432
For us.

847
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:41,732
For us.

848
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:48,267
Mike told me about what
happened with Bill and Dan

849
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:54,446
and Chris. And, Steve...

850
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,679
Why'd you do it?

851
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,182
The company outgrew them.

852
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:03,121
They're not management.
They're not project leads.

853
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,418
It's not my job to
be nice to people.

854
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,086
It's my job to
make them better.

855
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,861
They don't deserve it.

856
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,829
Then who the hell does?

857
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,161
Do you know how
this company works?

858
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,162
Do you want to know?

859
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,931
I'd be happy to teach you,
if you want to know.

860
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:22,270
Do you know why I started
this company with you?

861
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:27,506
Why I left the safety
of HP for this?

862
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,312
I doubt you do.
You never asked.

863
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,649
I left because
this was my thing.

864
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:37,615
And you guys thought
it was cool.

865
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,852
I just wanted to be
one of the guys.

866
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:48,797
And of all the guys I knew,
you were the coolest.

867
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,473
You were smart,
quick-witted.

868
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,477
And this was my chance
to do what I loved.

869
00:58:57,968 --> 00:59:00,312
And to do it for fun.

870
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,651
That's all, that's
all I ever wanted.

871
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:08,019
I thought that's what
you wanted, too.

872
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,652
Somethings happened
to you, Steve.

873
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,726
I'm grown up, Woz.

874
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,167
No. No, you're not.

875
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,892
<i>And now, turning to
big news in business,</i>

876
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,800
<i>Apple Incorporated is making
headlines once again.</i>

877
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,530
<i>On Wall Street
the tech titan Apple</i>

878
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,097
<i>went public this morning,
to incredible market interest,</i>

879
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:03,269
<i>as four point six million
shares of its IPO</i>

880
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,403
<i>were sold within an hour
of the opening bell.</i>

881
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,874
<i>Wall Street executives
had forecast the big clay</i>

882
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,440
<i>for the growing
technology company,</i>

883
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,450
<i>but experts now
say Apple's day</i>

884
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,384
<i>exceeded the market's
wildest expectations.</i>

885
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,053
<i>It was the most over...</i>

886
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,471
Hey, hey. Here he is!

887
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,745
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, terrific.

888
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,014
Yeah, you did it.

889
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,857
Let's help
them move that stock.

890
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,287
Hey, pal.

891
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,252
Oh, hey, thank you.

892
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,959
Business as usual, guys.

893
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:09,867
There's work to
be done, people.

894
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,804
Thank you.
I had some fun ideas.

895
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,808
This is it for me, Bill.
I'll see you when I see you.

896
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,318
I'm gonna get out of here.

897
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,615
I'll call you later.

898
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,882
All right.

899
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:43,844
Hi. Could you please tell
Mr. Markkula we're here. Thank you.

900
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,743
Yes, sir, Mr. Rock.

901
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:53,045
Gentlemen.

902
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,816
Mike. Please.

903
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,220
Have a seat.

904
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,693
There's something we
need to talk about,

905
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,664
and I don't think
you're gonna like it.

906
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,891
It's Steve.

907
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,197
He's hemorrhaging
the company's dollar

908
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,603
on fantasies that simply are not
possible with the Lisa computer.

909
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,743
Yeah, but Steve's been
doing the impossible

910
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,778
ever since this company
was in a garage.

911
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:21,614
<i>Mike, I love everything
Steve represents. You know that.</i>

912
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:25,284
<i>But he's like a kid in a candy
store, and we've given him the keys.</i>

913
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,845
Yeah.
But, it's his candy store.

914
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,557
You're never gonna see
a personal computer

915
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:34,088
where the keyboard is attached
to the machine again.

916
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:35,788
<i>Mike, it's a problem.</i>

917
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:39,560
The bigger problem is that
he is ridiculing IBM.

918
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:43,637
<i>Jobs took out a full page ad
in The Wall Street Journal</i>

919
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,970
taunting the biggest computer
company on the planet.

920
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,409
"Congratulations on your
first personal computer."

921
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,480
He's trying to start
a war with IB fucking M!

922
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,249
I'm fully aware of the ad.

923
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:56,648
Then do something
about it!

924
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,050
Listen, Arthur,
you know he's right.

925
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:02,248
3 years ago IBM had no
interest in the personal computer

926
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,620
and now look at 'em!

927
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,989
They followed us.
Think about it.

928
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:07,389
We have, Mike.

929
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,992
And I'm sorry, but the
Board is unanimous.

930
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,227
Steve will no longer be involved
in Lisa's development. Period.

931
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:17,732
<i>What is this, Arthur?
Some sort of power play?</i>

932
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,265
<i>For 18 months now you've
offered nothing but support.</i>

933
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,777
And now you want to try and
take Jobs off of his own team?

934
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:29,015
I don't want
any of this, Mike.

935
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:30,812
But you have to
try to look at it

936
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,818
from the shareholder's
perspective.

937
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,252
Steve is great.

938
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:36,849
He's great.
Yeah, he's great.

939
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,425
But he's a time bomb.

940
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,354
And it's our job
to diffuse him.

941
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,026
So take care of it.

942
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:49,464
I don't give a shit
what the Board thinks.

943
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,971
It's the time you're taking. Your perfectionism.
It's, it's, it...

944
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:54,666
<i>They're looking at
losses in the millions</i>

945
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:56,300
before this thing
even gets off the ground.

946
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:01,482
They're not seeing
the big picture.

947
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:04,109
That's right. The shareholders
don't see past their own shadows.

948
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,983
They're only concerned
about the here and the now.

949
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,817
And the Board has
got blinders on.

950
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:08,979
If they could see you
they'd take them off,

951
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:10,318
they'd see you
the way I see you.

952
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,518
The way your
employees see you.

953
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,616
Lisa is my project.

954
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:15,552
It's mine.

955
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,826
And they're taking
it away from me?

956
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,201
You're letting them
take it away from me.

957
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:26,706
Bullshit, Steve.
You know that's not true.

958
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,309
Shit.

959
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,323
<i>There are more
Apple II's teaching more subjects</i>

960
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,189
<i>in more schools than
any other computer...</i>

961
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,326
<i>Everything from alphabet
lessons for preschool,</i>

962
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,163
<i>to science programs
for graduate school.</i>

963
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,825
<i>So whatever Brian wants to be,</i>

964
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,567
<i>an Apple personal computer</i>

965
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,404
<i>can help him be it.</i>

966
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,911
<i>The Apple II. There's no telling
how far it can take you.</i>

967
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,196
<i>Now that doesn't
make any sense.</i>

968
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,757
<i>Well, you haven't seen as
much of murder as I have, Mr. Cross.</i>

969
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:30,303
<i>I'd rather have a judge give me the
works than have to do n' myself.</i>

970
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:31,933
<i>Right here in solitary.</i>

971
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,098
<i>So what?</i>

972
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:36,769
<i>So you go right on punishing yourself.
You can't get away with it.</i>

973
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,612
<i>Hi, I'm Gabe Kaplan.</i>

974
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:45,286
<i>Take the Pepsi Challenge. Let your
taste decide.</i>

975
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,945
<i>Right, guys? Okay, now
why don't you tell me</i>

976
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,547
<i>which one you chose.
Pepsi Cola.</i>

977
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,056
<i>Yeah?
Hey, Steve. It's Mike.</i>

978
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:54,453
Hey.

979
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:57,555
<i>Hey. Um, I think I may have
found a project for you.</i>

980
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,631
<i>It's more of an R&D
outcast than anything,</i>

981
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,998
<i>but it's actually a project
you approved some time back.</i>

982
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,900
<i>Why don't you look into it?</i>

983
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:12,008
So this is
the Macintosh team.

984
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,239
Mmm-hmm.

985
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,106
Oh, Jesus.

986
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,082
Nope. It's just Steve.

987
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:19,451
It's really good
to see you, Steve.

988
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:23,656
Bill Atkinson. It's good to see
they got A players over here.

989
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,589
Mmm-hmm. Hey. Get up.

990
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,190
Hi, Steve Jobs.

991
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:33,323
What's your name?

992
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:34,993
Burr...
Burrell Smith.

993
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,331
Burrell Smith.

994
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,028
Oh, sorry for the mess.

995
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,664
We're just a bunch
of degenerates. So...

996
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,275
It's okay.
I like degenerates.

997
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,367
Yeah.

998
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,335
Who's your project lead?

999
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:47,046
Uh, Jef Raskin...

1000
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,545
I don't know where he is.

1001
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,142
Jef Raskin.

1002
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:57,447
Okay. I'll deal with that one.
I'll be taking over now.

1003
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:03,487
Um... Sorry, taking over, like,
the entire Macintosh project?

1004
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,995
Yeah.
Awesome.

1005
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,837
Where's your design team?

1006
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:14,040
Team? I don't...

1007
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:16,843
Show me
your current build.

1008
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,373
Well, obviously ease
of use is a big feature here.

1009
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,076
We're trying to develop
a simpler interface

1010
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:27,052
that's geared towards
the real layman end user.

1011
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:31,588
But, we're kind of struggling with
the interface, and, to be frank...

1012
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,251
The results have been.

1013
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,060
Shit.
Yeah.

1014
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,152
What's it got
under the hood?

1015
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:38,593
Standard kick ass stuff.

1016
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:39,894
64K RAM...

1017
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,868
Two 56 bitmap
display, Motorola 6809.

1018
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,402
We're gonna run the 68000.

1019
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,907
But dude,
that's Lisa's processor.

1020
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,341
That's correct. Dude.

1021
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,510
I don't care what the budget is.
Give me their processor.

1022
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,111
Done.

1023
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,909
Hey, Steve.

1024
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,379
How are you, man?

1025
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,215
Chris, it has been a...

1026
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,280
Yep.

1027
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,686
You're working on the Macintosh?
Yeah.

1028
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:08,957
Good.

1029
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,527
Good, this is
gonna be fun.

1030
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,098
Okay. Let's go back to what
you were saying before.

1031
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,110
This thing is for
the everyman. Right?

1032
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,879
That's our end user.

1033
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,112
It's the school teacher.

1034
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,582
It's the garbage man.

1035
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,089
It's the kid. it's some grandma
out in Nebraska. Right?

1036
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,991
So we need to make
this thing simple.

1037
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,388
It's gotta work like...

1038
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,559
like an appliance.

1039
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:49,465
Hey, Jef.

1040
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:50,799
Steve Jobs is here.

1041
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,104
Since you weren't around...

1042
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:58,969
Some of the project leads were
having a meeting with Motorola.

1043
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,277
Why exactly are you here?

1044
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,410
I'm here to help
build the Macintosh.

1045
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:09,081
Ah. I'm not sure that
that's practical for us.

1046
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,092
We're actually trying
to avoid this project

1047
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,924
becoming another
over bloated disaster.

1048
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:21,761
Okay, Jef.

1049
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:26,964
You got my attention.

1050
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:30,939
Look, Steve.

1051
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,771
You didn't want to be involved
back when we started this thing,

1052
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,044
and that was fine by me.

1053
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,684
I just wanted you
to cut the checks.

1054
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:42,347
Be involved,
just don't tum Macintosh

1055
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:44,948
into a measure of
revenge for you.

1056
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,722
Everyone knows about your
fallout with Team Lisa.

1057
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:53,164
So trust me when I say,
we're doing fine.

1058
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,167
Okay, Jef.

1059
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,373
Let's get
a couple things straight.

1060
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,673
We don't do fine.

1061
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,017
And we don't accept things
the way that they are,

1062
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:13,384
and we don't
stop innovating.

1063
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,055
Now, your machine lacks power.

1064
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,816
And your little interface,
it needs work.

1065
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,259
And I'm here
to help with that.

1066
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:25,526
Now, I'm not trying to take
Macintosh away from you.

1067
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:28,701
I want you on this team.

1068
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:32,996
But you can either get on board,
or you can get the fuck out.

1069
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,447
Okay. Now, we've got a lot of work to do.
So, let's get to it.

1070
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,019
Bill, you come with me.

1071
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,748
Okay. Where are we going?

1072
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:48,879
Recruiting.

1073
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,118
Shit.

1074
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,622
Hey, Steve.
Hold these for a second

1075
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,197
Yeah.
Thanks.

1076
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,563
What, what's going on?
What are you doing?

1077
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,297
Steve? You're on the
Macintosh Team now.

1078
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:06,271
What, Ste...
What's a Macintosh?

1079
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:10,476
Andy Hertzfeld.

1080
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,943
Are you good?

1081
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,708
I only want good people
working on Macintosh,

1082
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:16,913
and I'm not sure
if you're good enough.

1083
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,108
Excuse me?

1084
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,586
Bill Atkinson says
that you're good.

1085
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,547
I... Yes.
I think I'm pretty good.

1086
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:25,648
Are you creative?

1087
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:26,886
I... I think so.

1088
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,429
Welcome to the Macintosh Team.

1089
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,639
I'm tired of saving
your ass, kid.

1090
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:40,071
You love saving my ass.

1091
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,836
I want my own
engineering team.

1092
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,638
You can pick them yourself.

1093
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,309
And I am done
working under the gun

1094
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,577
of your ridiculous
deadline bullshit.

1095
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,243
You might as well be asking
for a date with her.

1096
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,453
I want that, too.

1097
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,819
Done.

1098
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:58,415
Serious, Steve.

1099
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,256
So what is this, Steve? Some
sort of performance review?

1100
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,423
How are things
going on the IIE?

1101
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:07,333
Things are great.
Really great.

1102
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,663
You're bored to death,
aren't you?

1103
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,169
Yes. Yes I am.

1104
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,605
You want to come work
with me on the Mac Team?

1105
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:17,440
You're trying to recruit me
for the Mac Team, aren't you?

1106
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,002
Okay, I'm in.

1107
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,519
You've gotta have a problem
that you want to solve.

1108
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,283
A wrong that
you want to right.

1109
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,551
And it's gotta be something
that you're passionate about,

1110
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:34,628
because otherwise you won't have the
perseverance to see it through.

1111
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:38,027
I don't ever want to hear you tell
me that you can't make it faster.

1112
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,726
I mean, millions of people
are gonna buy this machine.

1113
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:42,962
And we can't look
at the competition

1114
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,027
and say we're
gonna do it better.

1115
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:48,734
We have to look at the competition and
say we're gonna do it differently.

1116
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:53,637
We have an opportunity to build
a revolutionary machine.

1117
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,645
<i>And in your life you only
get to do so many things.</i>

1118
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,253
<i>Right now we've
chosen to do this.</i>

1119
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,513
<i>So let's make it great.</i>

1120
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:31,511
It's great.

1121
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,621
No. It's not.

1122
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,689
It's insanely great.

1123
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,560
We should try to get more
memory into it if we can.

1124
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,437
We can still hit the timeline.

1125
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:55,237
Take a look at it.

1126
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:59,141
This little Macintosh side project
has gotten out of hand, Steve.

1127
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:00,737
Way beyond the pale.

1128
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,907
First you created a $10,000
monstrosity with Lisa,

1129
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,817
and now you've
poured millions

1130
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,718
into what was supposed
to be a minor diversion.

1131
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,288
You've missed
multiple ship dates,

1132
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:14,593
and meanwhile, IBM is
just purring along.

1133
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,324
Steve...

1134
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,093
People don't use computers
the way you think they do.

1135
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:22,162
How are we even supposed
to market the Macintosh?

1136
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:23,798
We don't

1137
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,400
You give me 5 candidates for CEO.
You're gonna let me choose.

1138
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,341
I say we choose someone
with a marketing background

1139
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:32,140
to help us sell
what's never been sold.

1140
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:35,846
Now, while I would like
to run my own company,

1141
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:40,409
Mike has helped me understand
that you don't think I'm ready.

1142
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,646
Yes, because you're not.

1143
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:43,780
Okay.

1144
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,657
I want John Sculley.

1145
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:47,587
John Sculley?

1146
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,186
President of Pepsi Cola.

1147
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:50,423
The Pepsi Challenge guy.

1148
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,429
He's smart,
he's a marketing genius

1149
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:55,596
and he'll do whatever
it takes to succeed.

1150
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:57,370
Steve, Sculley
is a tough get.

1151
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,204
Maybe the toughest
on our list.

1152
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:02,140
What the hell makes you
think you can get him?

1153
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,439
Why would he
ever leave Pepsi?

1154
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:11,615
Nobody remembers the world's
best soda salesman.

1155
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,297
I need somebody I can trust.

1156
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,805
<i>You can
make a great product.</i>

1157
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:38,511
But you have to
convince people

1158
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:41,207
that what you're
selling is greater.

1159
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:45,345
We're not selling computers.
We're selling what they can do

1160
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,646
with a computer.

1161
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,015
A tool for the mind.

1162
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:54,321
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

1163
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,758
is limitless.

1164
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,400
Because people will
never stop believing

1165
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,434
that they could get
more out of something,

1166
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,004
whether it be their jobs,
their marriage, their money,

1167
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,937
their lives.

1168
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,271
That's what you have
to do with the Mac.

1169
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,006
It's the belief
in the limitless.

1170
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,677
The impossible.

1171
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:19,512
That no matter what you
dream, you can do it.

1172
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:22,219
And Mac will
help you get there.

1173
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,393
A few months ago, when Steve
was visiting me in Manhattan,

1174
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:29,555
he asked me a very important question.
He said,

1175
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,261
"Do you want to sell sugar water
for the rest of your life,

1176
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:37,428
"or come with me,
and change the world?"

1177
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:42,540
Well,

1178
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:46,242
here I am. Thank you.

1179
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:12,899
<i>It is now 1984.</i>

1180
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:17,309
<i>It appears IBM wants it all.</i>

1181
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,606
<i>Apple is perceived
to be the only hope</i>

1182
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,240
<i>to offer IBM
a run for its money.</i>

1183
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:28,017
<i>Will Big Blue dominate the
entire computer industry?</i>

1184
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:29,414
No!

1185
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,423
<i>The entire information age?</i>

1186
01:17:32,915 --> 01:17:33,916
No!

1187
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:39,258
<i>Was George Orwell
right about 1984?</i>

1188
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,662
No!

1189
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:43,662
<i>Today
we celebrate the first</i>

1190
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:48,265
<i>glorious anniversary of the
Information Purification Directives.</i>

1191
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,278
<i>For the first time
in all history,</i>

1192
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:55,939
<i>a garden of pure ideology,</i>

1193
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,445
<i>where each worker may bloom,</i>

1194
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,453
<i>secure from the pests.</i>

1195
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,953
<i>Our enemies shall
talk themselves to death.</i>

1196
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:10,961
<i>First time in all history.</i>

1197
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:13,797
<i>We shall...</i>

1198
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,730
<i>prevail.</i>

1199
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:21,371
<i>On January 24th, Apple
Computer will introduce Macintosh</i>

1200
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:26,739
<i>and you'll see why 1984
won't be like 1984.</i>

1201
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:00,709
Good work.

1202
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,580
Some response, huh?
I can't believe it.

1203
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:10,884
It's a revolution.
It's a revolution.

1204
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:12,253
The thing's
a game changer.

1205
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:14,225
You really outdid
yourself, Steve.

1206
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:17,355
Hey. Why don't you
give me a call?

1207
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:20,128
Grab some dinner or something.
Yeah.

1208
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:22,202
Okay.
I'd like that.

1209
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,234
Steve.
Arthur.

1210
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,430
Great job up there.

1211
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:26,699
Thank you.

1212
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,937
Steve, I want you to know
that we believe in you.

1213
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:33,880
I hope you know that.

1214
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,046
Thank you, Arthur.

1215
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,622
Hey.

1216
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:50,219
What was that?

1217
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:51,923
What...

1218
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,091
Rock. He just...

1219
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:55,725
Said something,
"we believe in you."

1220
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:58,401
What's going on?

1221
01:19:58,727 --> 01:19:59,967
It's the Macintosh.

1222
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,564
You know, we had
them run the numbers

1223
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,075
100 different ways,
100 times over...

1224
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:04,974
- You're marking up the Macintosh.
- Yep'

1225
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:08,071
If we keep it as is, we'll be
hemorrhaging money by launch date.

1226
01:20:11,774 --> 01:20:13,754
You're gonna price out
the consumer.

1227
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,646
Well, we can't take the risk
of flattening our profits.

1228
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:16,814
No.

1229
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:18,357
We can't have it both ways.

1230
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:20,984
I mean, you insisted on the
most expensive hardware.

1231
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,653
The Mac was originally
much cheaper.

1232
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,664
Jef Raskin
designed a $1,000 box.

1233
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,028
I made it great.

1234
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,999
If you want the company
to remain profitable...

1235
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:30,593
Whose idea was this?

1236
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,308
It's a group decision.

1237
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,477
Whose idea was this?

1238
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:47,518
It was mine. Not Michael's,
not the Board. It was me.

1239
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:54,385
We don't do this, John.
IBM does this shit.

1240
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:56,394
Steve...
Not Apple. Not me.

1241
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,158
Look, don't make me
the villain because

1242
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,564
I'm looking out for our
company's best interests.

1243
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:01,896
Steve.

1244
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:06,204
Some things have to change.

1245
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:12,068
If you keep heading
down this path,

1246
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,646
I will not be able
to protect you.

1247
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:18,646
They got to you.

1248
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:26,418
They?

1249
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:54,252
How'd you get this?

1250
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:59,417
Arrived yesterday. It's pre-beta,
obviously, but it's all...

1251
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:01,392
It's a blatant rip-off.

1252
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:13,471
Get me Bill Gates
on the phone.

1253
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,934
Let me make this
perfectly clear, Bill.

1254
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:23,439
So that when I'm finished, you
can still see through those

1255
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:28,215
thick pretentious glasses, you
psychopathic, unimaginative criminal.

1256
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:37,788
You stole my software,
and I can prove it in court.

1257
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,567
And I'm gonna sue you for every
cent that you have ever made.

1258
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:48,135
And I will make it my life's mission
to see to it that you never,

1259
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:49,667
never,

1260
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:53,736
ever make another dollar that
I don't first take 90 cents.

1261
01:22:56,939 --> 01:23:00,352
I can only assume that you
are all as irate as I am,

1262
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:03,616
and you're simply
too dumbfounded to speak.

1263
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:06,415
Mr. Jobs promised
us a million units.

1264
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:08,255
We have yet to reach
a quarter of that.

1265
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,122
Something has to change.

1266
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:13,525
With two failed projects,
overextended R&Ds,

1267
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:14,999
and that Microsoft fiasco,

1268
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:18,464
we're about to experience the first
quarterly loss in company history.

1269
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:20,774
IBM beat us to market
by 2 years

1270
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,139
with a better product
and better sales.

1271
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:26,269
The Macintosh is not even a toy.
It's a joke.

1272
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,271
IBM has now moved
on to mini decks.

1273
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:31,451
And so should we.

1274
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:35,482
What are you
getting at, Arthur?

1275
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,053
Gentlemen, I believe
it's time to reconsider

1276
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,855
the viability of
the personal computer.

1277
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:47,801
Steve, anything to say?

1278
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:53,534
What would you
have me say, Arthur?

1279
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,473
You raised our price.

1280
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:58,977
Don't put that on me.

1281
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,743
The problem is not the price, Steve.
It's your product.

1282
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:04,549
You over-hyped the Mac.

1283
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:08,677
You told people to wait. You sold
the future of the Macintosh.

1284
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,517
And as a result we lost
2 years of sales.

1285
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,923
It's not my fault.

1286
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:14,995
Well, it sure as shit
is somebody's fault.

1287
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,823
Well, I'm not
receiving any support.

1288
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:19,730
You're stripping
me of my resources,

1289
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,494
and dumping millions
into the Apple ll.

1290
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,265
Do you know why we keep dumping
millions into the Apple II?

1291
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:29,331
Because it sells. It's 70% of our revenue.
How's the Mac doing?

1292
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,106
I made my opinion
perfectly clear.

1293
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,841
If you want to keep sucking on the
tailpipe of IBM, then I can't stop you.

1294
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:39,781
But I will not take the blame for
the failures of some court jester.

1295
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:41,748
All right,
this is crazy, Steve...

1296
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,687
No. No, no. To whom are
you referring, Steve?

1297
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:46,917
I don't know, Arthur.

1298
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,585
You tell me.

1299
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,862
John, you're awfully quiet.

1300
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,463
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1301
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,544
I guess I'm just
at a loss for words.

1302
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:08,908
Head of marketing.
Pepsi genius.

1303
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,875
Loss for words.

1304
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:14,884
It's him. Not the Mac.

1305
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:19,650
But the cost
of that process...

1306
01:25:26,088 --> 01:25:30,434
$10,000 price tag.
That price tag...

1307
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,237
Goes against him,
and not against Mac.

1308
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,778
It's ironic, isn't it?

1309
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,580
You chose Dylan, I chose,
I chose The Beatles.

1310
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,521
Seems so backward now.

1311
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:51,750
Woz.

1312
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,154
What are you doing here?

1313
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:57,491
Good to see you,
too, Steve.

1314
01:25:57,586 --> 01:26:00,089
I'm... I'm a little bit busy.

1315
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:02,827
Just, do you mind
if we talk later?

1316
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:05,962
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This'll
only take a minute.

1317
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:08,936
I, uh...

1318
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,474
I'm leaving, Steve.

1319
01:26:12,768 --> 01:26:13,974
Okay.

1320
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:16,946
No. No, Steve.

1321
01:26:18,774 --> 01:26:20,219
I'm leaving Apple.

1322
01:26:22,044 --> 01:26:25,048
For good. Actually,
I already did. I just...

1323
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:28,694
I thought I should come
back and tell you first.

1324
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:30,859
Why?

1325
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,633
We both knew this was coming
for some time. I don't even...

1326
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:41,197
I don't even remember
the last time we talked.

1327
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,034
What do you want
from me, then?

1328
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:49,308
Not everyone has
an agenda, Steve.

1329
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:52,580
Right.

1330
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:59,481
You know, I can still remember
when we were just kids,

1331
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:02,090
back in your dads garage.

1332
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,559
And we just wanted to

1333
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:09,261
create cool toys for people like us.
You remember that?

1334
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:11,865
Yeah.

1335
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,332
Now it's not about
people anymore for you.

1336
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,706
No, it's about the product.

1337
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:21,012
Worst of all, it's...

1338
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,012
It's about yourself.

1339
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:29,248
You're the beginning and end
of your own world, Steve.

1340
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:35,594
And it's so small. So sad.

1341
01:27:37,953 --> 01:27:41,400
And it's...it's
gotta be lonely.

1342
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:45,535
And I know you're gonna say

1343
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:48,538
that the product
and the person

1344
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,873
need to be connected
and all that,

1345
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,812
but it will never be
what you think it will.

1346
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:58,047
It just won't.

1347
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,816
No, not' not for
a long time at least.

1348
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:07,088
I don't know what you think
is going on, Steve, but I do.

1349
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,994
And it doesn't
end well for you.

1350
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:14,589
And I'm not...

1351
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:18,495
I'm not sticking
around to watch.

1352
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,299
It's been a journey.

1353
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,746
And for the record,

1354
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:36,517
I love what we did.

1355
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,712
<i>Hi. You've reached John Sculley.
Please leave a message.</i>

1356
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:39,145
Hey, John. It's Steve.

1357
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:40,913
Uh...

1358
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,587
I just...

1359
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,094
We're still partners,
John, you and I.

1360
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:52,992
We are, we're in
this together.

1361
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:54,599
And I, um...

1362
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:01,406
You just give me a call back?
That'd be great. Um...

1363
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:15,277
Hey, Mike. It's Steve.

1364
01:30:18,013 --> 01:30:20,391
Would you give
me a callback?

1365
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:23,526
Please?

1366
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:34,070
John, you have
to take control now.

1367
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,971
Do you have any idea how close
our shareholders are to a panic?

1368
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:39,545
The implications
of your inaction?

1369
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:43,879
Forget your job, the entire
company is at stake here.

1370
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:45,417
This could ruin everyone.

1371
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,984
I know, Arthur, but I still
think that we can salvage this.

1372
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:50,215
Can't salvage anything.

1373
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:51,918
I doubt...

1374
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,288
Steve.

1375
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:55,884
Mike.

1376
01:30:56,418 --> 01:30:57,624
John.

1377
01:30:57,719 --> 01:30:58,720
Steve.

1378
01:30:58,887 --> 01:31:00,389
Arthur.

1379
01:31:00,889 --> 01:31:02,630
What the hell are you
doing here so early?

1380
01:31:03,325 --> 01:31:05,601
I could ask you
the same question.

1381
01:31:06,995 --> 01:31:08,668
This is good.

1382
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:12,176
Steve, why don't you join us this time?
Have a seat.

1383
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,606
This time?

1384
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:15,909
Steve, have a seat.

1385
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:25,751
John?

1386
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,117
Arthur, I don't want to. Yes.

1387
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:32,432
You do. Say it.

1388
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:46,838
Tell him what
you've told me.

1389
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,946
I find it increasingly
difficult to do my job

1390
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:59,949
when the greatest
obstacle in my path

1391
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:04,291
casts a looming shadow over
everything I try to do.

1392
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,132
What did you say?

1393
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,164
Steve...

1394
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,539
You are your own worst enemy.

1395
01:32:23,338 --> 01:32:25,818
And this company's.

1396
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,992
This... It's unbelievable.

1397
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:38,388
Who do you think you are?

1398
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:46,502
I'm CEO of Apple Computer.

1399
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,278
Hiring you

1400
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:59,511
was the worst mistake
I have ever made.

1401
01:33:03,445 --> 01:33:05,391
Steve, it doesn't
have to be this way.

1402
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:12,522
Okay. That's done.

1403
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:15,425
<i>Boards
don't run companies.</i>

1404
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,935
The people who create the
product run the company.

1405
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:21,439
He has the nerve to tell me
we should have used the 512.

1406
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:22,769
We told them that
it needed a 512.

1407
01:33:22,864 --> 01:33:24,775
We said not to use the 128.

1408
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:28,109
We knew 128 kilobytes wasn't gonna
get it done when we built it.

1409
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:30,444
Sculley is leaving
for China tonight.

1410
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,779
He's gonna be there for
a week, so we got time.

1411
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:34,148
We just gotta recruit.

1412
01:33:34,242 --> 01:33:35,778
Sieve, Sculley's
gonna find out.

1413
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:38,118
And then what happens,
you know?

1414
01:33:38,213 --> 01:33:39,624
He's the CEO of
the company now.

1415
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:40,818
Well, for now.

1416
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:43,452
But we have the people
who make Apple.

1417
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:45,723
Oh, hey, Mike.

1418
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:47,989
We're just getting started.

1419
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:53,463
Guys, give us a second.

1420
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,674
John's canceled his trip.

1421
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,247
He's having an executive staff
meeting first thing tomorrow.

1422
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:12,918
So I didn't come to join your revolution.
I came to warn you.

1423
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,155
He wants to make
absolutely sure

1424
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:18,094
you're nothing more
than a figurehead.

1425
01:34:19,521 --> 01:34:21,125
No power, no title.

1426
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:22,862
No team.

1427
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:34,975
I remember thinking when we first
met, um, that you were remarkable.

1428
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:38,849
You wanted to do
something truly great.

1429
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:41,813
And I did, too.

1430
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:44,550
I still do.

1431
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:49,823
Raise the white flag. Concede to Sculley.
I'm begging you.

1432
01:34:50,285 --> 01:34:51,320
No.

1433
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,027
You can't win this one.

1434
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:55,965
Whose side are
you on, Mike?

1435
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:58,465
Because there are sides now.

1436
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,302
And you're either with me
or you're against me.

1437
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,878
Are you with me, Mike?

1438
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:10,913
Yes, Steve. I'm with you.

1439
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,644
Okay.

1440
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:17,649
Okay.

1441
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:27,932
Those in favor
of John Sculley.

1442
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:44,682
All in favor
of Steve Jobs.

1443
01:35:56,351 --> 01:35:57,625
Mike.

1444
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:00,791
Every Board member's vote
must be accounted for.

1445
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:10,137
Mike?

1446
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:19,413
Sculley.

1447
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,386
I vote for Sculley.

1448
01:36:58,913 --> 01:37:03,293
So, now what do we do?

1449
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:18,557
<i>Apple's market value has
eroded in the past several years,</i>

1450
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:22,294
<i>which led to the ousting of former
chief John Sculley in 1993.</i>

1451
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:28,338
<i>Ed Woolard,
former CEO of DuPont,</i>

1452
01:39:28,429 --> 01:39:30,272
<i>has joined Apple as
Chairman of the Board.</i>

1453
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:35,774
<i>New CEO Gil Amelio says
sweeping changes are necessary.</i>

1454
01:39:37,672 --> 01:39:41,142
<i>Jobs' computer software company
NEXT, has entered into buyout talks</i>

1455
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:43,153
<i>with his former company,
Apple Computer.</i>

1456
01:40:22,817 --> 01:40:26,128
Hey, will you wake up Lisa and
see if she wants breakfast?

1457
01:40:26,554 --> 01:40:27,794
Yeah.

1458
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,565
Lisa?

1459
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:36,168
Lisa? Come on.

1460
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:38,805
Are you gonna
sleep all day, huh?

1461
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:40,545
Oh, go away.

1462
01:40:40,635 --> 01:40:43,309
Why? I say all day
because it's 10:00.

1463
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:45,245
Laurene made you breakfast.

1464
01:40:45,573 --> 01:40:47,314
I'm not hungry.

1465
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,319
Well, you can't sleep
all winter break.

1466
01:40:51,746 --> 01:40:52,986
Yes, I can.

1467
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:04,194
Reed! Reed!

1468
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:07,665
Can we not run in the garden?
Please?

1469
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:10,939
Thank you.

1470
01:41:13,034 --> 01:41:14,707
Were you able
to get Lisa up?

1471
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:22,419
Well, how can a human
being sleep that much?

1472
01:41:25,246 --> 01:41:28,420
She... I don't know
if she's coming or not.

1473
01:41:29,283 --> 01:41:33,527
I'm going to the farmer's market today.
Just gonna get a few things.

1474
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:35,895
You have any plans?
You want to come with me?

1475
01:41:42,196 --> 01:41:43,402
Hmm?

1476
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:45,305
I said do you have plans?

1477
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:46,434
Today?

1478
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:50,882
Well, Gil Amelio
is gonna stop by.

1479
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:55,414
They're transitioning in
some of our software.

1480
01:41:58,779 --> 01:41:59,951
Okay.

1481
01:42:01,382 --> 01:42:04,829
I'm... I'm just helping them out.
They just need a little help.

1482
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:10,566
Oh, boy.

1483
01:42:11,826 --> 01:42:13,828
I'm in trouble,
aren't I?

1484
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:18,069
Steve, what can I do to
convince you to come back?

1485
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:19,406
What can you do
to convince me

1486
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:22,448
I wouldn't be boarding
the Titanic, Gil?

1487
01:42:24,005 --> 01:42:29,455
Because I know how you feel about Apple.
What NEXT could never be.

1488
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,288
Plus, you know, considering
that you now own

1489
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:35,520
a million and a half
shares of Apple,

1490
01:42:35,616 --> 01:42:38,620
I mean, that's
a tangible investment, too.

1491
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:41,197
You guys must be
pretty desperate.

1492
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:44,163
We're not desperate.

1493
01:42:45,793 --> 01:42:47,932
How are things going
with the Newton?

1494
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:51,200
Look, don't blame me for the
failures of the last regime.

1495
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:53,278
It's not as bad
as you think.

1496
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,846
You're overseeing
massive layoffs.

1497
01:42:56,937 --> 01:42:59,144
Apple stock just set
another record low.

1498
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,844
And you're 4 months
from insolvency, Gil.

1499
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:04,554
I'd say that's pretty bad.

1500
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,318
Well, yeah. In order
to fix what's broken,

1501
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:09,622
some sacrifices
are necessary. All right?

1502
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,358
Steve, what do you need?

1503
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,290
Name it.

1504
01:43:37,478 --> 01:43:39,185
Steve.
Gil.

1505
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:43,250
Steve.

1506
01:43:44,485 --> 01:43:45,589
Mike.

1507
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:47,488
It's nice to see you.

1508
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:55,571
Come on,
I'll show you around.

1509
01:43:55,663 --> 01:43:57,870
No, Gil, don't worry about it.
I'll give him the tour.

1510
01:43:58,265 --> 01:43:59,266
You sure?

1511
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:01,846
Yeah, sure.
No problem. Come on.

1512
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:03,404
That's great.

1513
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:06,612
You guys go ahead. I'll...

1514
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:09,681
I'll catch up.

1515
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:13,518
<i>There's something I
always wanted you to know, Steve.</i>

1516
01:44:15,516 --> 01:44:17,257
It was never my call.

1517
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:18,892
Let's not do this, Mike.

1518
01:44:18,953 --> 01:44:22,093
No, this is important.
You know, I tried.

1519
01:44:23,858 --> 01:44:26,304
I wanted you here.
I always did.

1520
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:29,799
It's too bad it took me
so long to get you back.

1521
01:44:30,531 --> 01:44:31,908
Oh, I'm not back.

1522
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:34,543
Yeah.
You will be.

1523
01:44:35,236 --> 01:44:36,442
We'll see about that

1524
01:44:36,537 --> 01:44:41,486
<i>You know, I'm gonna show myself around.
I'll take it from here.</i>

1525
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,317
Son of a bitch.

1526
01:45:25,753 --> 01:45:27,289
Who did these?

1527
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:30,126
I did, sir.

1528
01:45:34,795 --> 01:45:35,865
Who are you?

1529
01:45:36,797 --> 01:45:40,040
Jonathan Ive. I'm Director
of Industrial Design.

1530
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:43,777
Why are you still here?

1531
01:45:45,105 --> 01:45:46,846
It's 11:00 a.m.
on a Monday.

1532
01:45:47,107 --> 01:45:48,142
No.

1533
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:52,954
Why are you
still here at Apple?

1534
01:45:53,814 --> 01:45:56,158
This isn't
the company I built.

1535
01:45:56,217 --> 01:45:59,061
There's no taste, no style.

1536
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,727
No design.

1537
01:46:01,956 --> 01:46:06,132
So unless they're shackling
you here, why do you stay?

1538
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:14,210
Well, sir, I guess I would
say there are still

1539
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:16,338
those of us that believe
in what Apple stood for.

1540
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:19,650
What you stood for.

1541
01:46:20,641 --> 01:46:22,518
What do you think
I stood for?

1542
01:46:24,311 --> 01:46:25,756
I think...

1543
01:46:28,415 --> 01:46:31,726
I think you believe
that the computer,

1544
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:35,096
or the Walkman,
or whatever it may be,

1545
01:46:35,756 --> 01:46:38,532
should be a natural extension
of the individual.

1546
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:41,495
And it's that mission,

1547
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:47,111
that devotion to quality,
and ideals, and heart...

1548
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:53,682
That's what keeps us here.
That we might do it once more.

1549
01:47:24,471 --> 01:47:26,883
Okay. Whatever
you're working on,

1550
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:29,282
the rest of the day
I want you to forget it.

1551
01:47:31,312 --> 01:47:34,293
I want everyone to
design something new.

1552
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:36,986
I don't care what it is, I
don't care if it's technology,

1553
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:39,621
just create something.

1554
01:47:41,722 --> 01:47:43,292
Something useful.

1555
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:45,736
Something you care about.

1556
01:47:54,635 --> 01:47:55,739
Steve.

1557
01:47:58,339 --> 01:48:00,250
We're glad you're back.

1558
01:48:01,909 --> 01:48:03,411
I'm not back.

1559
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:08,987
Yet.

1560
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:23,137
Steve.

1561
01:48:28,702 --> 01:48:30,204
Ugh!

1562
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:32,810
Junk.

1563
01:48:32,873 --> 01:48:34,978
Steve, you met
our Chairman, Ed Woolard.

1564
01:48:35,309 --> 01:48:37,016
Steve.
Hi.

1565
01:48:40,647 --> 01:48:41,819
Look, um...

1566
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:44,895
I know all about the bad
blood you must taste.

1567
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:50,333
And I understand your hesitation to trust me.
But I just want you to know

1568
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:54,538
l am not Arthur Rock.
I'm your friend.

1569
01:48:56,563 --> 01:48:57,667
Okay.

1570
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:01,805
So, can we take
a minute to talk?

1571
01:49:02,503 --> 01:49:03,504
Apparently.

1572
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:04,739
Today's Paper-

1573
01:49:05,406 --> 01:49:07,545
I'm sure you've
seen the news.

1574
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,651
I'm sorry, Ed, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

1575
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:15,391
Our shares dropped
7.5% overnight.

1576
01:49:16,016 --> 01:49:17,996
It's the lowest
it's been in 10 years.

1577
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:20,824
Last week
an unidentified investor

1578
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,664
dropped one point
5 million shares.

1579
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:27,938
Put a real scare into
the marketplace, Steve.

1580
01:49:28,695 --> 01:49:31,733
1.5 million shares? Wow.

1581
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:36,848
I guess the stockholders
must be getting restless.

1582
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:40,376
<i>We want
you here, Steve.</i>

1583
01:49:40,841 --> 01:49:43,287
I'm here.
As a consultant.

1584
01:49:43,777 --> 01:49:45,279
As CEO.

1585
01:49:47,448 --> 01:49:48,722
CEO?
Yeah.

1586
01:49:48,782 --> 01:49:50,125
At least in the interim.

1587
01:49:51,285 --> 01:49:52,457
And Gil?

1588
01:49:52,553 --> 01:49:54,533
Yeah, well,
Gil's halfway out the door.

1589
01:49:54,888 --> 01:49:57,129
He has to see
the writing on the wall.

1590
01:49:57,224 --> 01:49:59,431
At least if he's not
too proud to admit it.

1591
01:49:59,526 --> 01:50:03,599
Oh, he's going to try to force you
out, and make a case against you.

1592
01:50:03,697 --> 01:50:05,734
Where have I
seen this before?

1593
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,471
Gil's on the ledge. He
doesn't have a play here.

1594
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:11,072
All we need is
a little push from you.

1595
01:50:11,405 --> 01:50:14,045
If you want to get back what
you lost, this is the time.

1596
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:20,153
I never lost it.
It was stolen from me.

1597
01:50:27,421 --> 01:50:31,233
There's no sex left in computers.
No curves.

1598
01:50:32,326 --> 01:50:35,466
Now, if computers are
for art, and beauty,

1599
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:38,771
and global interconnectivity,
why are they so ugly?

1600
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:43,145
You know, it should be artful.
But no one cares.

1601
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:48,643
The world may mistakenly see
computers only in black and white,

1602
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:53,591
but we live, and we dream
and we paint in color.

1603
01:50:55,249 --> 01:50:57,695
And we think
the computer should, too.

1604
01:51:04,291 --> 01:51:05,531
What do you think?

1605
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:15,105
Jony, I always want you
to be honest with me.

1606
01:51:17,938 --> 01:51:19,383
No matter what.

1607
01:51:20,274 --> 01:51:22,481
Just be brutally honest

1608
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:26,286
Understand?

1609
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,216
Understand.

1610
01:51:30,784 --> 01:51:32,559
What do you think?

1611
01:51:34,454 --> 01:51:36,832
I think, I think the blue,

1612
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:40,698
it's not quite right.

1613
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:46,839
Here's a dopey idea. What if
we put the speakers inside?

1614
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:51,910
Yeah, Steve,
Gil Amelio and the board

1615
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:54,178
are not gonna allow that.
No way.

1616
01:51:57,311 --> 01:51:59,917
We're not gonna
ask for permission.

1617
01:52:01,348 --> 01:52:03,328
Steve's done an admirable
job assisting me

1618
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:06,057
as an advisor during
this, this period.

1619
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:11,099
And while I commend his
actions, and his initiatives,

1620
01:52:11,592 --> 01:52:14,903
I believe it's now in our
best interest to move on,

1621
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:18,839
and relieve Steve of his
advisory role in this company.

1622
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,401
I agree, Gil.

1623
01:52:23,003 --> 01:52:24,073
You do?

1624
01:52:24,171 --> 01:52:28,017
I do think it's time Steve step
out of his current role, yes.

1625
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:30,110
Steve?

1626
01:52:30,777 --> 01:52:31,778
Thank you, Ed.

1627
01:52:33,447 --> 01:52:37,589
I'd like to present the Board my
vision for the future of Apple.

1628
01:52:38,852 --> 01:52:41,128
We're not Microsoft or Dell.

1629
01:52:41,688 --> 01:52:44,362
So we need to stop
trying to be that.

1630
01:52:46,193 --> 01:52:51,404
We need to go back to who we
are, and what we do best,

1631
01:52:51,465 --> 01:52:53,945
and throw away
everything else.

1632
01:52:54,401 --> 01:52:55,436
Here's how
we're gonna do it.

1633
01:52:55,535 --> 01:52:57,310
We're gonna build
a new line of computers

1634
01:52:57,404 --> 01:52:59,213
for the home,
and for the office.

1635
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:03,044
We're gonna build a new operating
system on the backbone of NEXT.

1636
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,754
The next generation
of Macintosh.

1637
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:10,057
And we're gonna kill
every other project.

1638
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:12,122
Everything.

1639
01:53:12,219 --> 01:53:15,792
This company will not
make shit anymore.

1640
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:19,101
We're also gonna double down
on the advertising budget.

1641
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:22,663
Chiat Day will be the only
advertising agency we use.

1642
01:53:22,829 --> 01:53:24,809
Just like back
in the old days.

1643
01:53:25,565 --> 01:53:26,771
In short,

1644
01:53:28,068 --> 01:53:29,945
we're gonna make
Apple cool again.

1645
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:33,444
But I will not be
able to move forward

1646
01:53:34,574 --> 01:53:39,023
without the Board's permission to
operate under complete autonomy.

1647
01:53:39,846 --> 01:53:43,692
I'll be made a full voting member
of the Board. And lastly...

1648
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:48,090
Interim CEO.

1649
01:53:51,091 --> 01:53:52,468
Now, hold on.

1650
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:56,831
I'm the CEO, and this is...

1651
01:53:58,865 --> 01:54:01,175
Look, you put me
in this position.

1652
01:54:01,635 --> 01:54:06,015
Apple is like a ship with a hole in
the bottom, and it's leaking water.

1653
01:54:06,106 --> 01:54:08,052
And it's my job
to make sure that

1654
01:54:08,141 --> 01:54:10,212
we point the ship
in the right direction.

1655
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:12,984
So why don't you
let me do my job?

1656
01:54:13,447 --> 01:54:15,688
All right, let's
put this to a vote.

1657
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:18,552
Those in favor?

1658
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,198
What the hell?

1659
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:30,364
Ed?

1660
01:54:32,566 --> 01:54:33,567
Mike?

1661
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:37,182
Sorry, Gil.
Nothing personal.

1662
01:54:46,913 --> 01:54:49,723
<i>When you grow up,
you tend to get told</i>

1663
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:52,592
<i>the world is
the way that it is,</i>

1664
01:54:52,986 --> 01:54:55,865
<i>your life is just to live
your life inside the world</i>

1665
01:54:56,423 --> 01:54:59,495
<i>and try not to bash
into the walls too much.</i>

1666
01:54:59,693 --> 01:55:01,900
<i>But that's a very
limited life.</i>

1667
01:55:02,262 --> 01:55:04,208
<i>Life can be much broader,</i>

1668
01:55:04,264 --> 01:55:07,245
<i>once you discover one simple fact.</i>

1669
01:55:08,101 --> 01:55:10,581
<i>And that is that
everything around you</i>

1670
01:55:10,871 --> 01:55:12,373
<i>that you call life</i>

1671
01:55:12,706 --> 01:55:15,880
<i>was made up by people that
are no smarter than you.</i>

1672
01:55:16,443 --> 01:55:19,424
<i>And you can change it.
You can influence it.</i>

1673
01:55:19,513 --> 01:55:23,086
<i>You can build your own things,
that other people can use.</i>

1674
01:55:23,183 --> 01:55:26,460
<i>It's to shake off
this erroneous notion</i>

1675
01:55:26,553 --> 01:55:27,964
<i>that life is just there,</i>

1676
01:55:28,054 --> 01:55:30,728
<i>and you're just gonna live
in it, versus embrace it.</i>

1677
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:34,466
<i>Change it' Improve it.
Make your mark upon it.</i>

1678
01:55:34,561 --> 01:55:38,907
<i>And once you learn that, you'll
never be the same again.</i>

1679
01:55:40,734 --> 01:55:42,611
But in our cash position...

1680
01:55:42,702 --> 01:55:44,045
Mr. CEO.

1681
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:45,875
Mike.

1682
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:48,044
You wanted
to talk to me?

1683
01:55:48,141 --> 01:55:50,451
Welcome. Please.
Have a seat.

1684
01:55:50,977 --> 01:55:52,786
Ed. Hey, Gareth.

1685
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:54,247
Mike.

1686
01:55:58,785 --> 01:55:59,923
What's this?

1687
01:56:00,554 --> 01:56:01,658
It's an opportunity.

1688
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:06,470
I haven't seen Bernard
around for a few days.

1689
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,767
Wheres Katherine,
Delano?

1690
01:56:08,929 --> 01:56:12,308
Mr. Lewis and Mrs. Hudson made
a difficult decision easier

1691
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:15,245
by agreeing to step
down from the Board.

1692
01:56:15,502 --> 01:56:16,503
Really?

1693
01:56:16,603 --> 01:56:20,779
They both agreed to accept incredibly
generous golden parachutes.

1694
01:56:21,408 --> 01:56:24,651
The same opportunity is
detailed inside that envelope.

1695
01:56:25,512 --> 01:56:27,423
So you're forcing us out?

1696
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:28,918
With good reason.

1697
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:30,120
And what's that?

1698
01:56:30,183 --> 01:56:31,821
The current arrangement is

1699
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:34,321
inhibiting.

1700
01:56:35,422 --> 01:56:37,993
I can't hold everyone's hand
while we cross the street, Mike.

1701
01:56:38,091 --> 01:56:40,867
And so your next big move
is to eradicate your Board?

1702
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:42,463
And you think you
can just do that?

1703
01:56:42,529 --> 01:56:46,341
I'm sorry, Mike.
But it's time.

1704
01:56:47,267 --> 01:56:49,975
Take the parachute.
It's more than fair.

1705
01:56:57,978 --> 01:56:59,719
20 years.

1706
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:05,555
You know, I told myself
I'd be out of here

1707
01:57:05,652 --> 01:57:07,723
while I was still
in my thirties.

1708
01:57:08,889 --> 01:57:13,133
And now look at me.
I'm practically an old man.

1709
01:57:22,135 --> 01:57:23,239
Gentlemen.

1710
01:57:24,004 --> 01:57:25,210
Thanks, Mike.

1711
01:57:38,518 --> 01:57:39,588
So...

1712
01:57:40,854 --> 01:57:43,198
What are we gonna do now?

1713
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:53,571
We're gonna put
a dent in the universe.

1714
01:58:03,343 --> 01:58:04,583
Here's to the crazy ones.

1715
01:58:06,713 --> 01:58:08,715
<i>The misfits,</i>

1716
01:58:09,115 --> 01:58:10,719
<i>the rebels,</i>

1717
01:58:11,618 --> 01:58:13,359
<i>the troublemakers,</i>

1718
01:58:13,853 --> 01:58:16,390
<i>the round pegs
in the square holes,</i>

1719
01:58:17,424 --> 01:58:20,030
the ones who see
things differently.

1720
01:58:20,727 --> 01:58:22,536
<i>They're not fond of rules,</i>

1721
01:58:23,063 --> 01:58:26,203
<i>and they have no respect
for the status quo.</i>

1722
01:58:27,801 --> 01:58:29,906
You can quote them,

1723
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:31,779
<i>disagree with them,</i>

1724
01:58:31,871 --> 01:58:33,908
<i>glorify or vilify them.</i>

1725
01:58:34,941 --> 01:58:36,579
<i>About the only thing
you can't do</i>

1726
01:58:37,243 --> 01:58:39,223
<i>is ignore them.</i>

1727
01:58:39,546 --> 01:58:41,253
<i>Because they change things.</i>

1728
01:58:41,915 --> 01:58:44,293
They push
the human race forward.

1729
01:58:45,752 --> 01:58:47,959
<i>And while some may see
them as the crazy ones,</i>

1730
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:52,730
<i>we see genius.</i>

1731
01:58:53,893 --> 01:58:56,271
Because the people
who are crazy enough

1732
01:58:56,329 --> 01:58:58,673
to think they can
change the world

1733
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:02,175
are the ones who do.

1734
01:59:10,176 --> 01:59:11,780
How was that?
