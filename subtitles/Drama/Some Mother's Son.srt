1
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:35,968
I know full well the
responsibilities that await me

2
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,336
as I enter the door
of number 10,

3
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:40,705
and I'll strive unceasingly

4
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:44,008
to try to fulfill
the trust and confidence

5
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,311
that the British people
have placed in me

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,513
and the things
in which I believe,

7
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,382
and I would just
like to remember

8
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:54,486
some words of
Saint Francis of Assisi,

9
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,187
which I think are really

10
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:59,324
just particularly apt
at the moment--

11
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,694
"where there is discord,
may we bring harmony.

12
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,329
"Where there is error,

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,098
"may we bring truth.

14
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,732
"Where there is doubt,

15
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,268
"may we bring faith.

16
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,935
"And where there is despair,

17
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,342
may we bring hope."

18
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,586
What are those bastards
doing at the bridge?

19
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,033
Clear the road!

20
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:58,603
The prime minister wants
an entirely new approach

21
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:00,604
to the northern Ireland problem.

22
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:04,079
We've drawn up
a 3-pronged strategy--

23
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,213
isolation,

24
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,347
criminalization,

25
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:12,684
demoralization.

26
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:17,289
We've cut off these routes
across the border.

27
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,325
We've taken control
of these roads.

28
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,794
We isolate the communities.

29
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:26,664
Criminalization--

30
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:30,234
these people are criminals.

31
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:33,270
They are not soldiers.

32
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:36,040
They are not guerrillas.

33
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,176
There is no war.

34
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,946
There is only crime.

35
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,250
Demoralization--

36
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,251
I want to see
these people in jail.

37
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,222
Tim, what's the situation

38
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,489
in the prisons at the moment?

39
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,258
In our experience,

40
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,494
getting involved in a struggle with
the I.R.A. Prisoners in particular

41
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:59,297
merely tends to serve
the terrorists

42
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,066
as a rallying issue.

43
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,400
Thank you, Tim,

44
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:05,636
but I think we need to
change tack slightly.

45
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:08,506
We want to make the
prisons an asset,

46
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,107
not a liability,

47
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,910
for it is in the prisons

48
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,480
that we will break the
back of the I.R.A.

49
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:17,514
Gerard.

50
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,756
Frankie's called
an emergency meeting.

51
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,144
I have to go.

52
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:52,217
Jesus, come on. We can't
let them away with this.

53
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,417
We've no clearance from Dublin.

54
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,419
I don't give a shit.

55
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,522
We have to retaliate.

56
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,860
Can anybody get a clean car?

57
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,432
Huh?

58
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:09,434
What's for breakfast, ma?

59
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,234
Liam Quigley, look at you.

60
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,338
You'll never get a girl looking
like that, will you? It's eggs.

61
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,571
Sit down.

62
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,474
- I want a soft one this time.
- All right.

63
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,842
Those bastards.

64
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:21,580
They're blowing
all the Bridges up.

65
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,215
Don't use that language
in here, please.

66
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:26,150
But why?

67
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,652
Why?
To control us.

68
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,091
Us? What do you mean, us?

69
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,132
This egg is hard.

70
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,238
Very funny.

71
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,039
Here you are.

72
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,342
Here's the real one.

73
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,213
Where's my lunch?

74
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,216
Who ate my lunch?

75
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,384
I took an apple.

76
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,721
Why don't you get a job?

77
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:06,823
It was just an apple.

78
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:09,228
She's on a diet.

79
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,698
Have some tea.
You must be freezing.

80
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,501
Can I borrow your car?

81
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,302
Car? Why?

82
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,936
I have to get shoes.

83
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,207
OK. Will you
drive me to school?

84
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,607
Sure I will.

85
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,042
Good. There you go.

86
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,076
Thanks.

87
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,379
How's your egg?
God, look at the time.

88
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,282
Come on. Come on.
Eat it up quick.

89
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,490
Come on, Gerard.

90
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,826
Hup.

91
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,829
Hup. Hup.

92
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,965
Hold it! Hold it! You're
frightening the animals.

93
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,336
Hold it!

94
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,270
Hup. Hup.

95
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,905
Hup. Hup.

96
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,506
Hup. Hup. Hup.

97
00:07:56,507 --> 00:08:00,445
Hup. Hup. Hup. Hup.
What the hell is this?

98
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,145
How are we supposed
to get to our cattle?

99
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:04,249
It's to stop your son
murdering people

100
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,116
and running back across
the border down there.

101
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:09,653
My son would never
run from you, McPeake.

102
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:12,957
Why don't you go home, Annie,
before you get yourself in trouble?

103
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,393
Come on, ma.

104
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,463
Ignore them.

105
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,597
Tell your Frankie we'll get him,

106
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,299
no matter what he does.

107
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,535
Tell him yourself.

108
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:27,270
All right, boys, bring it down.

109
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,276
Stand back there.

110
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,345
Hup. Hup. Go on.

111
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,426
Bastards.

112
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,159
God, I don't believe this.

113
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,597
And I've got concert
practice this morning.

114
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:59,302
Will you pick us up
at 4:00?

115
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:00,437
Yeah.

116
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:03,008
Don't spend too much money, OK?

117
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,544
Run, Liam.

118
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,257
Sorry I'm late, Brenda.

119
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,191
No problem.

120
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,760
How's it going?
All right? Good.

121
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,928
God, the roadblocks
this morning.

122
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,031
I couldn't believe it.

123
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:30,268
OK, I've got the order here.

124
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,121
Come on.

125
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:52,155
Let's go.

126
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:34,363
Go.

127
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:42,636
Just be calm. Be calm, everybody.
Be calm.

128
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,572
Get off the road!

129
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,638
Get off the fucking road!

130
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,541
Oh, my God.

131
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,042
Get off the road.

132
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,677
Move or I'll have you arrested.

133
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,680
Madam, I don't have
time for this.

134
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,681
He cursed at me.

135
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,915
You tramp.

136
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,718
I'm not moving for them.
Get off of me.

137
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,153
Get off.
Leave me alone.

138
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,754
And get those girls in here.

139
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,122
Get away from me.

140
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,322
- You tramp.
- Come on, girls.

141
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,291
Tramp.

142
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,533
Come on. Quickly, girls.
Quickly.

143
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,045
You're home early.

144
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,747
There was a bomb. They
had to close the school.

145
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,516
Did you not hear it?

146
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,317
I was in castleward.

147
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:08,786
Madness.

148
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,787
Did you get any shoes?

149
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,422
There weren't any I liked.

150
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:15,426
Huh--do you mean to say I had
to walk home for nothing?

151
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,331
Oh, God. Make me
a cup of tea, will you?

152
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,131
Who did this?

153
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,668
We believe this man did it.

154
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,771
Frank Higgins.

155
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,408
Get him.

156
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,847
Quick.

157
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:38,321
Uh, hello, sister Bernadina.

158
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:46,590
Did you strike my daughter
yesterday?

159
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,526
I beg your pardon.

160
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,129
You did, and you humiliated her
in front of a bunch of brats.

161
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,330
Please, Mrs. Higgins, uh...

162
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:56,633
You're a troublemaker,
Annie Higgins,

163
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:59,135
and I want you out of my school.

164
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,439
By Jesus, you'll not
do that to one of mine.

165
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,209
Get out of my school,
or I'll call the police.

166
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,778
Do you think
I'm afraid of the police?

167
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,180
You touch my child again,

168
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,552
and that outfit won't save you.

169
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,568
Get up to your classes.

170
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,052
Is everything all right?

171
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,321
He's fine.

172
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,224
He wants to see youse
tonight, OK?

173
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,091
So we'll be coming over
the back way.

174
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,561
Good. I'll keep
the dogs in so.

175
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,696
OK.

176
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,196
Happy Christmas.

177
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:03,940
I'll see youse later.

178
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:12,944
Did you see that?

179
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,047
Yeah, I see him.

180
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,518
I got the number.

181
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,284
Ladies and gentlemen,
coming up soon,

182
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:22,619
we'll have the Christmas draw,

183
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,220
- how you doing, Gerard?
- But in the meantime...

184
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:27,090
Take your partners
for a slow waltz.

185
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:30,363
50. Appreciate it.

186
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:34,965
That's from your granny, OK?

187
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:35,965
Thanks, granny.

188
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,402
Here you go.

189
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,402
Thanks, Gerard.

190
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:41,037
Get up and take your ma
out for a dance.

191
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,940
She's sitting there all alone.

192
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,340
I can't dance.

193
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:46,343
Come on.
I'm dying to dance

194
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,045
with the best-looking
man in the room.

195
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:52,450
Well, you'll just have to make
do with me, then, won't you?

196
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:56,957
That'll do for me.

197
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,768
God, I always forget
how tall you are.

198
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,769
Gerard, sometimes you remind me

199
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,707
so much of your father.

200
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:19,677
No. He was--
he was taller,

201
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,579
but his hair was shorter.

202
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,052
Ha ha! That's true.
Ha ha ha.

203
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,956
Oh, listen to me.

204
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,489
I just don't understand

205
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,224
why you won't go back
to university.

206
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,826
Oh, don't start lecturing
on at me again

207
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,027
about university.

208
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,362
I don't mean
to lecture you, Gerard.

209
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,797
I just want to know
why you won't go back.

210
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:42,065
I need to take a year off.

211
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:44,167
Why? Ow. Ooh.

212
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,538
To learn how to dance.

213
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:51,742
I just don't want you
to throw your life away.

214
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,214
Hmm?

215
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,683
Ah! Ha ha ha.
Gerard!

216
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:02,687
Right, kids.
Look who's here.

217
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,125
Ho ho!

218
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,694
Come on up
and pick your presents.

219
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,130
I have to go.

220
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:15,899
I have someone I have
to give a present to.

221
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,034
Who?

222
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,168
You don't know her.

226
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,841
Can I have some more money?
I've spent all mine.

227
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:26,343
You've spent it?

228
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,111
Oh, come on. Let's see

They'll be here.

235
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:16,996
Aye.

00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,904
Alpha team, stand by.

239
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,306
There they are.

240
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:35,179
How you doing?

241
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
How are you?

242
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,748
Come on.

243
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,283
How are you?

244
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,483
You all right?

245
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,118
Yeah.

246
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,252
Theresa, put that dog out.

247
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:45,758
All right, ma.

248
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,158
Come on, Shep.

249
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,096
What about you, ma?

250
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,668
All right, Da?

251
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,403
Still running about?

252
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,740
Ah, you're funny, you are.

253
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,075
Hey, ma.

254
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,710
Happy Christmas, son.

255
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:07,510
You all right?

256
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:10,747
Oh, yeah.
Can you stay long?

257
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,348
Not too long.

258
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,550
Time for a bit of dinner.

259
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,553
Aye.

260
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,957
Good.

261
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,093
Happy Christmas.

262
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,929
You shouldn't have bothered.

263
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,698
All right?

264
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:29,232
Aye.

265
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,235
Will you have
a bite to eat, son?

266
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,969
Yeah, OK.

267
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,537
Good. Sit down there now.

268
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:35,939
All right, Da, you want a hand?

269
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,475
No, no, no. It's all right.
Now leave me alone.

270
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,113
We'll wait for you.

271
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,512
Thank you.
Thank you.

272
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:44,914
It'll soon be new year

273
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,816
before you sit down
there, won't it?

274
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:47,985
All right. Ha ha ha.

275
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,118
That's grand.

276
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,663
How's it going?

277
00:19:58,663 --> 00:19:59,662
Like it?

278
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:00,463
I do.

279
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:03,234
Here, have a cigar.

280
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:06,073
Cigars--
thanks very much.

281
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,272
Got you a present.

282
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:13,483
It's--it's Christmas.

283
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,085
Everything's ready now.

284
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,823
Jesus Christ.

285
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,959
Every year we have to sit
beside a bloody empty chair.

286
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,894
- I know, I know.
- He's dead. He's not coming back.

287
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:32,695
I know. Shh.

288
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,844
God, ma, that looks lovely.

289
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,511
Pass the gravy to
your daddy, Theresa.

290
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:50,514
Are you still in a bad mood?

291
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,449
Are you still in a bad mood?
Here, take those.

292
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,816
Take those cigars.

293
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:56,787
Thank you. You might
give us your bad form.

294
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,322
Ha ha. Here you are.

295
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,522
- This way.
- Rrrr...

296
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:00,323
Unh!

297
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,197
Jesus, Frankie.

298
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:08,598
Go.

299
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,068
- Ma, what's wrong, ma?
- Oh, Jesus, ma.

300
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,805
Help! Help!

301
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:15,944
Security forces!

302
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:22,212
Aah!

303
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:23,222
No! No, you don't.

304
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:34,156
Aah! I'm hit.

305
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:35,291
Aah!

306
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,227
Frankie, we'll
take care of that.

307
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:39,895
Sit down and don't move!

308
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:43,299
Come on.
Get in here. Get in here.

309
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,842
I can't walk, Frank.

310
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:55,412
Let's go! Everybody out!
Move it! Move it!

311
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:56,713
He's hurt.

312
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,119
- Get the back.
- All right.

313
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,904
All units, we're in position.

314
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:23,272
You! Put your
fucking hands up!

315
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,551
We found them, sir.

316
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,423
Well, hello, Frankie.

317
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,094
And who have we here?

318
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,163
Take him.

319
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,831
We've got them!

320
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,631
Oh, Jesus.

321
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,299
Let me go!
Let me go!

322
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,335
Let me go!
Let me go!

323
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,537
Frankie!

324
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,206
Let me go!
Frankie!

325
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,207
Frank! Frankie!

326
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,875
Oh, Jesus! Frank!

327
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:01,444
Frank! Frankie!

328
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:02,948
Frankie!

329
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,282
Frank!

330
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:13,190
I tell you-- anyone who took
Donny to dance ever again...

331
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,726
Ha ha ha.

332
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:18,098
Pass me the cellotape,
would you?

333
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,701
Oh, my God.

334
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,068
What's going on?

335
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,302
You check out the back.

336
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:27,304
What's going on here?

337
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,472
Who else is in the house?

338
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:32,075
Just my, uh, just my
daughter and my son.

339
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:33,376
Where's your husband?

340
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:35,377
He's dead.

341
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:36,412
You leave me alone!

342
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,547
Liam...

343
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:39,149
- Let go of me!
- Watch that glass.

344
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,482
Liam, it's all right.

345
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:42,184
Excuse me. What are
you doing in here?

346
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,185
Where's Gerard?

347
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:44,488
He's with his girlfriend.

348
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,488
Don't tell me lies.

349
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:46,489
I'm not lying to you.

350
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,991
She's not lying to you.

351
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,126
We have him.

352
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:51,662
He's under arrest.

353
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,421
He's been charged
with attempted murder.

354
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,287
Oh, God, look at you.

355
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:19,932
No touching.

356
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:31,500
You got the clothes
all right, then?

357
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:33,142
Aye.

358
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:41,778
Gerard, a man was shot.

359
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,213
But he was a soldier.

360
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,451
He was somebody's son
like you're mine.

361
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,322
He was waitin' to kill us,

362
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,672
and he got shot.

363
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,874
You lied to me.

364
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,142
I had to.

365
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:16,179
I had to lie because
I wanted to protect you.

366
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,581
Protect me?

367
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,115
I didn't think
you could handle it.

368
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:23,486
You spent years, like, running
away from all this stuff, OK?

369
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:24,989
I'm your mother.

370
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,958
Don't you talk to me
about protecting me.

371
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,491
I'm sorry.

372
00:25:29,492 --> 00:25:32,998
Sorry's not enough, Gerard.

373
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:37,499
Listen...Listen, I've got
a lawyer downstairs,

374
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,804
and he says that he can get your
charge reduced to conspiracy.

375
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,739
I have to tell you somethin'.

376
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,743
I'm probably gonna get
locked up for a long time.

377
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:50,614
And I don't need a lawyer,

378
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,348
because I'm a prisoner of war.

379
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:55,421
I am not a criminal.

380
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:59,655
I don't recognize the court.

381
00:25:59,656 --> 00:26:01,591
Are you out of your mind?

382
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:03,493
No, I'm not out of my mind.

383
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:05,028
Time's up.

384
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,264
No, I have--I haven't
finished yet. I--

385
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,332
time's up.

386
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,767
I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

387
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:13,637
I'll be all right!

388
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:16,573
Look, I, uh...

389
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,741
I--I have to
see him again.

390
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,480
Gerard, I'll be back.

391
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,436
Your bag, please.

392
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:49,181
Fine. Move along.

393
00:26:57,181 --> 00:27:00,749
Your son refuses
to see me, Mrs. Quigley.

394
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,486
I don't care. He has
to have representation.

395
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:04,862
Well, I'll try.

396
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,595
Mrs. Quigley,
I'm Danny Boyle,

397
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:14,831
head of Sinn Fein in Belfast.

398
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:17,901
Yes, I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

399
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,671
I'm here to support your son.

400
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,711
My son does not need
your support, Mr. Boyle.

401
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:29,312
Frankie!

402
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:30,748
All right, ma.

403
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,749
All right.

404
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,458
Order! Order!

405
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,727
All rise.

406
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,675
Do the defendants
have representation?

407
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:02,912
I'm here to represent
Gerard Quigley, your honor.

408
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:04,848
No, you're not.

409
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,918
The defendant refuses counsel.

410
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,422
That is his prerogative.

411
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:14,056
We are Irish republican
army prisoners of war.

412
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:17,427
We refuse to participate
in this non-jury farce.

413
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:20,329
This British court has no
jurisdiction in Ireland.

414
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,865
<i>We will not be treated
as criminals.</i>

415
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:25,134
This is a criminal court
of law, sir,

416
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:27,470
empowered by the queen
to try you.

417
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:28,838
I instruct the clerk

418
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,775
to enter a plea of not
guilty on your behalf.

419
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,814
Let us proceed.

420
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:39,653
Exhibit "a," your honor.

421
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,885
Uh, your honor,

422
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:45,922
this is a Kalashnikov
AK-47 assault rifle.

423
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:48,959
It's one of 2 captured
at the arrest site.

424
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,395
Forensic have established that the
fingerprints of both of the defendants

425
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:53,662
are on these weapons,

426
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,664
and that this weapon was fired

427
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,303
by the defendant Gerard Quigley.

428
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,342
Exhibit "c," your honor.

429
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,476
Uh, your honor, we also
captured this grenade

430
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:10,212
which consists of 2 ounces of
Sentex and a percussion cap

431
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:14,817
that is of a type manufactured
and used by the I.R.A.

432
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:17,420
Under the present
emergency legislation,

433
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:21,089
it falls to me to act
on behalf of a jury.

434
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,992
Therefore, I find
these defendants...

435
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:25,996
You've no right! These men
are political prisoners!

436
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,497
- Guilty.
- They're not criminals!

437
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,632
Remove that woman!

438
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,300
Take your fuckin' hands off her!

439
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:33,870
Stop! Gerard!

440
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:37,739
Let go your big fuckin' hands!

441
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,476
Frank Higgins, you are a
criminal menace to this society.

442
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:43,979
I sentence you to life
imprisonment without parole.

443
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,847
Screw you, bastard!

444
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:48,084
Gerard Quigley,
you have aided Higgins

445
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,586
in his wanton acts of terrorism.

446
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:53,459
I sentence you to 12 years.

447
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,460
Clear the courtroom!

448
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:58,760
I'll walk.

449
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:00,463
I'll walk!

450
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:26,059
Clear.

451
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:31,907
Get dressed.

452
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:45,914
Murphy, you're back again.

453
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:54,652
What's your problem?

454
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:58,153
I'm a prisoner of war.

455
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:01,426
I refuse to wear
a criminal's uniform.

456
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:06,105
You refuse.

457
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,938
What about you?

458
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:19,281
Do you refuse?

459
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:26,817
I refuse.

460
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:35,198
I have a special place
for youse.

461
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:44,066
Could I see your pass, please?

462
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,968
We're here to see
Gerard Quigley.

463
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,239
Hold, please.

464
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,239
Lady here to see Gerard Quigley.

465
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,541
On the protest.

466
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,610
Thank you.

467
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,746
I'm afraid you can't
see him today.

468
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,380
Could you back
the car up, please?

469
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:59,848
He's just been sentenced.
I haven't seen him yet.

470
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:01,151
He's involved in a protest.

471
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,752
There's really nothing I can do.

472
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:05,087
Could you back
the car up, please?

473
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:06,957
You're blocking the traffic.

474
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,597
Uh...

475
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,400
2 on.

476
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:18,768
2 on.

477
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,569
2 on.

478
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:25,976
2 on.

479
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,079
2 on.

480
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:37,754
Frankie.

481
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,489
McLaughlin?
McLaughlin?

482
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,758
Yes, sir.

483
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,602
2 on.

484
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,535
Slop out.

485
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:56,639
Frankie, you boy-o.
Good to see you.

486
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,342
Good luck, Gerard.

487
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:01,419
Right, sands,
here's some company.

488
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,052
Bobby?

489
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:11,822
Do I look that bad?

490
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,061
You look like Jesus Christ.

491
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:20,665
Here's your uniform, Quigley.

492
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:26,032
Here's your uniform.

493
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:57,767
What are you doing here?

494
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,835
I resigned.

495
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,970
What?

496
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:04,739
I can't work there anymore.

497
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,114
Why?

498
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,348
Nobody trusts me.

499
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,584
What--did someone
say something?

500
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,984
No. I just know.

501
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:17,721
Oh, for God's sake, Alice.

502
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,855
It's a bloody bank, mum, and the I.R.A.
Have robbed it 4 times.

503
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:22,258
Why should they trust me?

504
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:23,727
Gerard didn't rob it.

505
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,802
How do you know?

506
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,539
Where will you work?

507
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,640
I can't stay here anymore.

508
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,449
I hate this country.

509
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,183
Come on, Alice.
We're going to be late.

510
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:48,752
Will you calm down, mummy?

511
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,154
The plane doesn't
leave till 11:00.

512
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,355
Is that too heavy for you?

513
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:54,659
No.

514
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:32,629
What are you going
to do about him?

515
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,568
Whatever I can.

516
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:40,114
Oh, come on.

517
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:52,848
Thank you,
Mr. Wilson.

518
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:53,950
Hello, Sam.

519
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,084
Hello, Tim.

520
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:56,685
You wanted to see me
about something?

521
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:58,821
This protest has been going
on for 2 years, hasn't it?

522
00:35:58,822 --> 00:35:59,689
Yes.

523
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,991
How many are on it
at the moment?

524
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:06,029
Approximately 300, although
the figure does vary.

525
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,464
I want these men
in prison uniform.

526
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:11,933
Well, we pretty much
tried everything.

527
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:14,980
No, you haven't.

528
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,247
Come on, get up!

529
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,314
What?

530
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,049
Exercise, lads!

531
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,283
More dips!

532
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:29,690
Come on, get up.

533
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,658
Jesus.

534
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,859
Takes this
prisoner-of-war stuff

535
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,264
very serious.

536
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:42,598
It's freezin'.

537
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,334
Well, what's the fuckin' point?

538
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,801
We're not going anywhere.

539
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:46,868
To keep our discipline.

540
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:50,744
Come on. Stop talking
and do the dips.

541
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,578
I'll tell you...

542
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,314
Mary would keep you up,
wouldn't she?

543
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:01,350
Oh, Mary!
Oh, go on, Mary!

544
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:02,618
What?

545
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,120
Shit.

546
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,955
18, 19, 20.

547
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,290
All right, lads,

548
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,390
20 press-ups!

549
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:10,960
Come on.
On the floor.

550
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,329
Oh, shit.

551
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,268
Start with sands.

552
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:21,295
36.

553
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,699
Slop out.

554
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:52,173
No slop out without uniform.

555
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:58,540
What's going on?

556
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,213
No slop out without uniform.

557
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:06,015
This won't fuckin' break us.

558
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,186
Right?

559
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:13,522
Break the window!

560
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:15,527
Break the window!

561
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:20,931
Hey, go, go, go!

562
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,507
Get the beds out.

563
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:31,640
Hello?

564
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,642
Uh, it's Annie Higgins--

565
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,176
Frankie's mother.

566
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:36,477
Oh.

567
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:38,381
Hello, Mrs. Higgins.

568
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,317
Your son wants you
to go up for a visit.

569
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,821
Well, um, is he
coming off the protest?

570
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,256
All I know is you're
to go up on Friday.

571
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:50,225
And, listen, could you ever
give us a lift up there?

572
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:51,928
What's going on,
Mrs. Higgins?

573
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,730
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know.

574
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,753
I have to go. Good-bye now.
I'll see you Friday.

575
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:19,221
No. I've given them up.
Thank you.

576
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:20,622
I'd give them up myself

577
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:22,357
only for this bloody country.

578
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:24,032
You could be dead on the minute.

579
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:31,067
Quigley.

580
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,201
Oh, yes.

581
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:33,873
Higgins.

582
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:38,673
12.

583
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,377
Into 12.

584
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:44,154
10.

585
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,388
Oh, Gerard.

586
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,764
Sit down.

587
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:02,199
Beards...

588
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,667
Makes you look older.

589
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,041
How's it going there,
Mrs. Quigley?

590
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,576
Gerard,

591
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,044
are you coming off the protest?

592
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:18,882
No, I'm not.

593
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:21,283
Well, then...

594
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:23,118
What's going on?

595
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,757
We had to get word out
about what's happened.

596
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:31,130
They won't let us
out to the toilets.

597
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,497
What do you do?

598
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:36,698
Well...

599
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:40,401
At the start,
we put it out the windows.

600
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:42,404
Then they blocked up
the windows,

601
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,040
so we put it under the door.

602
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,875
Then they blocked up
under the door,

603
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,545
so now we spread it
on the walls.

604
00:40:49,545 --> 00:40:52,250
You spread your dirt
on the walls?

605
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,250
Well, what else can we do?

606
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:57,153
God.

607
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,831
How can you live like this?

608
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:08,897
Look...

609
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:12,804
I have to get a message
out to Danny Boyle.

610
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,677
This is really important, ma.

611
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:23,014
Let's go.

612
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:26,927
I love you.

613
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,166
Pass, please.

614
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,574
Raise your arms.

615
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,341
Do you have any contraband?

616
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:54,142
No.

617
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,188
Go on.

618
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:20,468
You all right?

619
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:21,516
Get in.

620
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:35,451
How dare you.

621
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,685
What?

622
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:40,893
You knew I was carrying
this, didn't you?

623
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,373
I just wanted to see my son.

624
00:42:57,373 --> 00:42:59,508
So what's in this message?

625
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:02,044
I don't know.

626
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:06,448
I will not be used as
some stooge for violence.

627
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:10,586
All I know is that Bobby sands
needed to get a message out.

628
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,534
Well, I'm going to read
this bloody message.

629
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:26,502
Give me that.

630
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,539
Give me that.

631
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:32,681
That's I.R.A. Business.

632
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:42,551
Give it me, Mrs. Quigley.

633
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:43,352
No.

634
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:50,058
"My friend, the Brits
have finally forced us

635
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:52,160
"to live in our own dirt.

636
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:54,696
"The lads' morale is collapsing.

637
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:57,031
"If you cannot find a solution,

638
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:59,968
"then we must push this
crisis to its conclusion

639
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:02,837
"by going on hunger strike.

640
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:04,107
"I'm not threatening you,

641
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,643
but stating
a cold reality."

642
00:44:07,643 --> 00:44:10,505
"Your friend and
comrade, Bobby sands."

643
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,745
Come on.

644
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,983
I'm not going in there.

645
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:48,250
Give me the letter.

646
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:51,922
No. You tell him
to come out here.

647
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:56,248
There's 3 people who have
been shot dead there.

648
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:20,186
How you doin'?

649
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:26,888
My son is wiping his shit on
the walls because of you.

650
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,589
Hang on a minute.

651
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,526
It's the British have your son
in jail, Mrs. Quigley, not me.

652
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:34,635
Have you something for me?

653
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:41,873
You read this.

654
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,806
They're talking about
a hunger strike, Danny.

655
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,808
What are you going to do?

656
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:49,745
You have to do something.

657
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,180
What are you gonna do?

658
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,948
We've got to win this
in the streets.

659
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:55,484
Oh, I see.
Disrupt and destroy.

660
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:57,553
That's all you people
can do, isn't it?

661
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,089
Hold on there,
Kathleen. Hold on.

662
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,228
Are you coming, Annie?

663
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,027
Oh, I see.

664
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:09,031
Disagree with those people,
and you're the enemy.

665
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,878
That's it, isn't it?

666
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:26,381
Oh, God, I need a drink.

667
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:28,350
Look at my hands--

668
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,724
shaking like a leaf.

669
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:38,928
Would you not try a wee Valium?

670
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,264
For your nerves.

671
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:43,799
No.

672
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,442
Hmph. Suit yourself.

673
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,414
Are you coming?

674
00:46:58,414 --> 00:46:59,881
1.60, please.

675
00:46:59,882 --> 00:47:01,460
Thanks very much.

676
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,761
Move over.
I'm not sitting there.

677
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:15,233
Why? Why not?

678
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:19,641
I'm not sitting below her.

679
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,353
She'd sour the drink.

680
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,960
And what does that mean?

681
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,333
Our day will come.

682
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,536
And what day is that, Annie?

683
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:56,840
The day the Brits go home.

684
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,308
The day the bloody Brits go home

685
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:02,947
is all you people can
think about, isn't it?

686
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:07,221
Well, my life
won't change either way.

687
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:14,823
Right now, your life and my life

688
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:17,091
are 2 very different
things, missis.

689
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:19,493
My son was shot dead
by the British,

690
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:22,599
so you can take your Brandy
and shove it up your hole.

691
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,466
Annie.

692
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:26,701
Is everything all right, ladies?

693
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:30,471
Yes, yes, we're fine. Just
2 more brandies, please.

694
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:32,152
I'll bring them over.

695
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,154
Oh, I'm so sorry, Annie.

696
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:47,455
I didn't know that.

697
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:51,030
Oh, God. That must be a
terrible thing to lose a child.

698
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,598
There you are, now.
You OK?

699
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,978
Yes, thank you.
Thanks.

700
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,511
All right, lads. Mass.

701
00:49:09,512 --> 00:49:11,914
Mass.

702
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:14,527
Time for mass, lads.

703
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:26,328
Fuck me.

704
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,800
It's Robinson Crusoe.

705
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,468
Sorry, father.

706
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,104
Frankie, would you
like to say our mass?

707
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,108
All right.

708
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,744
Your eminence, this is Bobby sands.
Bobby.

709
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:46,749
I'm really glad you could
come, your eminence.

710
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,597
It was the least I could do.

711
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:06,535
This is the lamb of God

712
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,403
who takes away the
sins of the world.

713
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:10,971
Happy are those who are
called to his supper.

714
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:14,042
Lord, I am not worthy
to receive thee,

715
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:16,918
but say the word
and my soul shall be healed.

716
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,123
Body of Christ.

717
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,994
Body of Christ.

718
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:31,993
Body of Christ.

719
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:33,364
Body of Christ.

720
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:37,369
- Body of Christ.
- Body of Christ.

721
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,102
CBS news, cardinal.
Cardinal?

722
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:42,504
Have you got a statement?

723
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:45,143
Did Bobby sands
have anything to say?

724
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:48,643
When I was a young priest,

725
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:51,846
I worked for a time
with the poor

726
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:53,281
in the sewers of Calcutta...

727
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:55,451
Who let him in?

728
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,385
I did.

729
00:50:57,385 --> 00:50:58,420
Why?

730
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:02,658
He's the head of the Roman
catholic church in Ireland.

731
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,292
...forced to spread
their feces on the walls,

732
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:09,430
to pour their urine
under the cell doors.

733
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:12,466
Now, one would not
allow an animal

734
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:15,437
to live in such condition,

735
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:18,238
let alone 340 human beings.

736
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:20,509
I am an m.P.
In the British parliament,

737
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,379
and you haven't heard the
last of this, I promise you.

738
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,680
Well, the shit has
hit the fan, lads.

739
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:29,750
Gentlemen, I'm glad you find
this situation so amusing.

740
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,819
We need to win the moral
high ground on this one.

741
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,156
I know compromise is a
dirty word in this room,

742
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,491
but if we don't come up with
some fresh ideas, and soon,

743
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:38,597
we're really going to
fuck it up.

744
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:42,931
What a wanker.

745
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,366
Why do we have to
put up with him?

746
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,971
He's got support.

747
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,516
And he may also have a point.

748
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:03,417
I, uh...

749
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:06,453
Brought you a few fresh eggs...

750
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:09,056
And a bit of bread...

751
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:11,093
For driving me up there.

752
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,895
Oh, you shouldn't have.

753
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,229
I wanted to.

754
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,531
Well, thank you very much.

755
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:18,533
All the publicity's
great, isn't it?

756
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:19,901
Do you think anything
will come of it?

757
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:22,504
They can't ignore
the pope, a cardinal,

758
00:52:22,505 --> 00:52:24,105
<i>and an m.P.,
now, can they?</i>

759
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:25,406
Oh, aye.

760
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:27,076
Oh, Mrs. Higgins,
will you have a cup of tea?

761
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,877
Uh, no, thank you. No.

762
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:32,952
Jimmy's on his own.
I better be getting back.

763
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,317
Thank you,
Mrs. Higgins.

764
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:38,118
You're welcome.

765
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,772
Jeez, I thought I was shot.

766
00:52:57,773 --> 00:52:58,775
Oh...

767
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,511
God. You know I nearly had
a heart attack myself.

768
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,312
Would you ever give us a lift?

769
00:53:05,313 --> 00:53:06,184
Yes. Yes, come on.

770
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,624
We'll put it
in the back of the car.

771
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:16,063
I feel silly.

772
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:24,340
It must be a great thing
to be able to drive.

773
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,640
Right.

774
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:34,241
What are we doing here?

775
00:53:34,242 --> 00:53:35,885
You have a go.

776
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:44,659
Come on.
Have a try.

777
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:51,463
Get in.

778
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:56,564
OK, now, you just
put it into gear

779
00:53:56,565 --> 00:53:58,034
and move forward slowly.

780
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:00,535
Jesus God!

781
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,305
<i>My foot is down.</i>

782
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:05,473
Put it down.

783
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:07,375
No, no, not that foot.
The other foot.

784
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:09,713
What do you mean,
the other foot?

785
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,948
Turn the wheel.
Turn the wheel!

786
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,415
- Which way?
- Just turn it!

787
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,588
- Which way?!
- Any way! Just turn it!

788
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:34,602
There's a guy
at the foreign office

789
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:36,606
offering us some kind of deal.

790
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:39,241
I don't believe you.

791
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,911
I'm serious.

792
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:46,147
Oh, that's fucking great.

793
00:54:46,148 --> 00:54:48,082
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

794
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:49,951
Let's not get too excited.

795
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:50,752
Here.

796
00:54:53,088 --> 00:54:54,488
Jeez, where'd you get that?

797
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:56,491
He gave it to me.

798
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:58,926
Kind of a peace pipe, I guess.

799
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:00,777
Fuckin' nice of him.

800
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:17,245
So what kind of deal is it?

801
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:21,448
Civilian clothes, education
instead of prison work,

802
00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:22,850
win back lost time.

803
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:25,889
Pretty much everything
we asked for.

804
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:28,659
And who is this guy?

805
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,396
He's a diplomat.

806
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,505
A diplomat.

807
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:47,615
We'll get 5 or 6 smokes
out of this.

808
00:55:53,615 --> 00:55:54,716
Oh.

809
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:58,155
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

810
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:02,357
God. The tide.

811
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,494
Hello.

812
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:07,995
Oh, there's someone.

813
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:08,997
Hey!

814
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,300
Hey!

815
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,169
Hello!

816
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,971
Come on, lads.

817
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,641
Step back, ladies.

818
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:19,841
All right, lift!

819
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:21,443
Uhh!

820
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:23,845
- Lift!
- Uhh!

821
00:56:23,846 --> 00:56:25,750
Oh, God.

822
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,084
Lucky we were here, ladies.

823
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:32,990
Yes, thank you.
Thank you so much.

824
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:38,426
Well done.

825
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:40,428
Not bad.

826
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:43,330
There. Makes you
feel free, doesn't it?

827
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,469
Aye, till you get stuck.

828
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:49,770
Suppose it's just
as well they came along.

829
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:51,739
Mmm.

830
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,341
I don't hate them all, you know.

831
00:56:54,342 --> 00:56:58,315
Mummy! Mummy!
There's been a deal.

832
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:01,482
You're joke.

Oh.

00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,245
Gonna have a drink now.

00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:34,445
Yeah!

889
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,148
No, I can't take those.

890
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:47,448
Excuse me.

891
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:49,517
Just what do you mean, no?

892
00:59:49,518 --> 00:59:53,120
We were assured that they would be
allowed to wear their own clothes.

893
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:55,390
No, not their own clothes.
Civilian clothes.

894
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,024
I don't understand.

895
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:59,545
Our m.P. Frank Maguire assured
us that these are the new rules.

896
01:00:00,628 --> 01:00:02,364
They're allowed
their own clothes.

897
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:28,723
What's this?

898
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:30,929
These are your new clothes.

899
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:37,832
The question of whether all
prisoners in northern Ireland

900
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,100
should be allowed
to wear civilian clothes

901
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:42,971
issued by the prison officials,

902
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,872
rather than prison uniform.

903
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:46,540
We decided on that,

904
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,408
that it should apply
to all prisoners,

905
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:51,779
and therefore we gave that
concession to all prisoners.

906
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,982
No, no, no. We didn't
say their own clothes.

907
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:57,317
We said
civilian-style clothes.

908
01:00:57,318 --> 01:00:58,620
Now you listen to me.

909
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,587
I'm a diplomat in her
majesty's government.

910
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:02,689
I do not break agreements.

911
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,859
Well, this is war,
not diplomacy.

912
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,993
Really? I distinctly
remember you saying to me

913
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:08,730
<i>that it wasn't war.</i>

914
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:12,500
Look, I want you to start treating
these people for what they are--

915
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:13,935
a bunch of terrorists.

916
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:17,605
You do what it takes to draw
them out into the open,

917
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:19,077
and then you finish them off.

918
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,652
No.

919
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:05,927
Who's Bobby sands?

920
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:18,332
Hello.
Blarney roof garden.

921
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:21,368
Alice?
Alice, it's me.

922
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:23,471
Mummy.
How you doing?

923
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:27,674
Fine. Listen, Alice, the prisoners
are going on hunger strike.

924
01:02:27,675 --> 01:02:29,310
Has our Gerard gone on it?

925
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:30,845
No, no.

926
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:31,846
Are you sure?

927
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:33,413
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

928
01:02:33,414 --> 01:02:35,183
OK. Well...

929
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,954
Do you want me to come home?

930
01:02:38,954 --> 01:02:43,438
No. Stay where you are.
You're better off there.

931
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,906
Bobby sands has been on hunger
strike now for 15 days.

932
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,475
Surely somebody
can do something.

933
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,278
Well, Sinn Fein
are doing all they can...

934
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,179
Parents meeting.

935
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,714
Has Frank Maguire spoken yet?

936
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:09,316
No. Just the usual.

937
01:03:09,317 --> 01:03:10,651
OK.

938
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:13,520
The Vatican's already been informed.
The pope knows.

939
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:15,156
Oh, the pope knows?

940
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:18,091
Yes. The church is doing everything
it can in this situation.

941
01:03:18,092 --> 01:03:19,526
But the church is doing nothing

942
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:22,397
except sitting back and
allowing the British army--

943
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:23,864
what has
the church--

944
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:25,832
gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

945
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:29,403
You're our m.P. What are
you gonna do about it?

946
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,305
What are any of youse
doing about it?

947
01:03:31,306 --> 01:03:35,009
Now, look, the government
needs my vote badly

948
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,410
in this budget debate.

949
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:39,413
Now, I think we can get
what we need.

950
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:43,318
The prisoners can rely
on Frank Maguire.

951
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,830
We only need one.

952
01:03:56,831 --> 01:03:59,905
I'm sorry.
It's the rules.

953
01:04:13,114 --> 01:04:16,917
We interrupt this program
for a news flash.

954
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:19,654
The death has taken place
of Mr. Frank Maguire,

955
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:20,955
the independent
nationalist m.P.

956
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:22,489
For Fermanagh and South Tyrone.

957
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,026
Mr. Maguire, who held the
balance of power at Westminster

958
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:28,096
and was a prominent
supporter of the demands

959
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,663
of the h-block
hunger strikers,

960
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:33,637
died of a heart attack
at his home in Lisnaskea.

961
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:37,981
Damn!

962
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,314
After about 50 days or so,

963
01:04:48,315 --> 01:04:51,285
their bodies begin
to break down.

964
01:04:51,286 --> 01:04:54,421
The apparently
less vital organs--

965
01:04:54,422 --> 01:04:56,957
the eyesight--
would begin to diminish,

966
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,959
become hypersensitive to light.

967
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,363
The muscular system
would begin to pull away...

968
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:04,765
I just had a phone
call from maze.

969
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:06,466
I think we've got a problem.

970
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:09,447
...nervous system,
producing spasms.

971
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,446
Listen...

972
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:21,047
They're going to run sands

973
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:22,649
for Maguire's old seat

974
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:24,121
in the British parliament.

975
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:29,092
That's a fantastic idea.

976
01:05:31,092 --> 01:05:34,160
Will you help us...
With the campaign?

977
01:05:34,161 --> 01:05:37,733
Who do you mean by "us"?

978
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,804
You mean Sinn Fein?

979
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:45,643
No. Help
the hunger strikers.

980
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,143
Annie, I don't believe
in violence.

981
01:05:50,144 --> 01:05:51,546
You must understand that.

982
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:55,816
But this isn't about
violence, Mrs. Quigley.

983
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:57,651
This is about elections.

984
01:05:57,652 --> 01:06:01,321
Once again, the prime minister
stayed unflinchingly firm.

985
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:04,359
There is no such thing
as political murder,

986
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,729
political bombing,
or political violence.

987
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,031
We will not compromise on this.

988
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:13,968
There will be
no political status.

989
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:16,136
All attempts to
intimidate us will fail.

990
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:17,738
Political status now.

991
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:19,207
Don't let them die.

992
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,908
Political status now.

993
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,743
Don't let them die.

994
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:24,245
Political status now.

995
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,113
Don't let them die.

996
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:27,348
Political status now.

01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:30,151
Vote for Bobby sands, missis.

998
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,453

1002
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:39,326

Vote for Bobby sands.

1007
01:06:46,434 --> 01:06:48,602
A vote for Bobby sands

1008
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:51,738
is a vote against British
repression in Ireland.

1009
01:06:51,739 --> 01:06:54,308
- Vote for Bobby sands!

01:06:58,313 --> 01:06:59,846
Vote for Bobby sands.

1014
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:00,915
Don't forget.

01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,082
Vote for Bobby sands.

1016
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,017
Vote for Bobby sands.

1017
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:07,955
Support the prisoners in their
fight for political status.

1018
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:11,359
Vote him in to keep them alive.

1019
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,794
Vote for Bobby sands.

1020
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:17,967

1026
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,116
Mrs. Quigley...

1027
01:07:36,117 --> 01:07:37,559
Can I see you?

1028
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,462
You've decided to honor us
with your presence.

1029
01:07:48,463 --> 01:07:51,397
Yes, I know, mother superior.

1030
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:53,500
I haven't been here
much recently,

1031
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:56,608
but I'm sure you understand
I've been very busy.

1032
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:02,021
I confiscated these
in your class.

1033
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,595
You're suspended.

1034
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,632
Right.

1035
01:08:28,369 --> 01:08:30,903
Good morning,
Mrs. Quigley.

1036
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:32,607
Good morning, class.

1037
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,207
All right, Mrs. Wheelan,
thank you.

1038
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,182
I'll take over now.

1039
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:43,188
Thank you, Mrs. Wheelan.

1040
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:50,023
It's nice to see you.

1041
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:51,128
OK, page 95.

1042
01:08:54,128 --> 01:08:56,095
Good morning...

1043
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:57,930
Sit down.

1044
01:08:57,931 --> 01:08:59,502
May I talk to you now?

1045
01:09:00,502 --> 01:09:02,207
Yes, of course, mother superior.

1046
01:09:06,207 --> 01:09:08,709
Get out of my school.

1047
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,344
With all due respect,
mother superior,

1048
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:13,813
I suggest that you
call the cardinal

1049
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:16,651
and tell him why
you're suspending me.

1050
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,219
I have his number
if you need it.

1051
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,355
In the meantime,
I have a class to teach.

1052
01:09:22,356 --> 01:09:24,926
Thank you very much,
mother superior.

1053
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,099
OK, what page was it?

1054
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,100
Page 95.

1055
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:35,782
95.

1056
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,386
This man is ready for
the hospital wing.

1057
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:54,395
Don't touch him.
I'll do that.

1058
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,595
OK, I'm gonna lift you up, OK?

1059
01:10:03,765 --> 01:10:04,564
Uhh!

1060
01:10:04,565 --> 01:10:06,234
Come on.
You're OK.

1061
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:09,144
OK, I'm just gonna
get your legs.

1062
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,112
OK, I'm gonna lift you up, OK?

1063
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:19,112
1, 2, 3.

1064
01:10:19,113 --> 01:10:20,649
Uhh!

1065
01:10:23,217 --> 01:10:25,753
Sit back.

1066
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:32,574
OK.

1067
01:10:47,574 --> 01:10:49,354
I won't let you down.

1068
01:10:59,354 --> 01:11:01,291
Come on.
Come on.

1069
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,206
OK, back in the cell.

1070
01:11:18,206 --> 01:11:20,073
Stick with it, lads!

1071
01:11:20,074 --> 01:11:21,478
Keep going, Bobby!

1072
01:11:23,478 --> 01:11:25,917
Stick with it, lads!

1073
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:30,917
Put your mark?

1074
01:11:30,918 --> 01:11:32,120
Oh, I did.

1075
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,721
You know, I have a terrible
confession to make.

1076
01:11:35,722 --> 01:11:38,725
I've never voted
in my life before.

1077
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:40,193
Well, we never had much use

1078
01:11:40,194 --> 01:11:43,735
for the ballot box ourselves.

1079
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,381
God, Annie, do you
think he could win?

1080
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,327
The tension here is electric

1081
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:17,531
as we await the results of the Fermanagh
and South Tyrone by-election,

1082
01:12:17,532 --> 01:12:21,469
one of the most bitterly fought
campaigns in northern Ireland history,

1083
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,437
where in an unprecedented move,

1084
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:25,339
the prime minister
Margaret Thatcher

1085
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:29,477
called for the electorate to reject
the I.R.A. Prisoner Bobby sands,

1086
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,946
now in his 50th day
of a hunger strike.

1087
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:35,819
Mrs. Thatcher threw her
support behind Harold west...

1088
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,352
Shh! Shh!

1089
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:41,455
...as polls show the gap closing
between him and the hunger striker.

1090
01:12:41,456 --> 01:12:42,855
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1091
01:12:42,856 --> 01:12:44,691
And now, we're going to go live

1092
01:12:44,692 --> 01:12:47,932
as the polling officer
approaches the microphone.

1093
01:12:50,932 --> 01:12:53,200
West, Harold...

1094
01:12:53,201 --> 01:12:55,870
Unionist and conservative party

1095
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,237
of Great Britain
and northern Ireland...

1096
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:01,508
29,046.

1097
01:13:01,509 --> 01:13:04,178
- Yay!
- Yay!

1098
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,446
Sands,

1099
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,314
Robert,

1100
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:11,251
anti h-block
political prisoner...

1101
01:13:11,252 --> 01:13:12,653
30,000--

1102
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,321
- yay!
- Yay!

1103
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:17,128
30,400--

1104
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:23,331
by God, he got it.

1105
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,264
He fucking got it.

1106
01:13:25,265 --> 01:13:27,265
- Yay!
- Yay!

1107
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:29,303
I declare Robert sands

1108
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:31,604
duly elected
as member of parliament...

1109
01:13:31,605 --> 01:13:33,341
For Fermanagh and South Tyrone.

1110
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:47,955
They done it!

1111
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,623
Bobby sands, m.P.!

1112
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,212
Bobby.

1113
01:14:45,212 --> 01:14:46,818
Bobby.

1114
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,298
Bobby.

1115
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:06,032
Bobby.

1116
01:15:06,033 --> 01:15:08,300
You won.

1117
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:10,836
You made your point.

1118
01:15:10,837 --> 01:15:14,174
Is it not time to stop now?

1119
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:17,721
Will they do a deal?

1120
01:15:27,721 --> 01:15:31,524
I will see this through...

1121
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:33,497
To the end.

1122
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:08,064
No.

1123
01:16:11,064 --> 01:16:12,502
No.

1124
01:16:14,502 --> 01:16:15,903
No.

1125
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,505
God, no!

1126
01:16:18,506 --> 01:16:20,640
Gerard.

1127
01:16:20,641 --> 01:16:22,008
What about Liam?

1128
01:16:22,009 --> 01:16:23,644
What about Liam?
You can't--

1129
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,879
you must--

1130
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,612
you must not do this, Gerard,

1131
01:16:26,613 --> 01:16:27,614
you hear me?

1132
01:16:27,615 --> 01:16:29,483
No!

1133
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:32,184
No!

1134
01:16:32,185 --> 01:16:35,855
Please, I--I have to
talk to him some more.

1135
01:16:35,856 --> 01:16:38,224
No. Get him back.

1136
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:39,225
The visit's over.

1137
01:16:39,226 --> 01:16:41,728
No.
Please, please.

1138
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:44,398
Please, please,
let me speak with him.

1139
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,198
There's nothing we can do.

1140
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:47,166
Our hands are tied.

1141
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:48,033
No.

1142
01:16:48,034 --> 01:16:50,237
Your son has made his decision.

1143
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,804
You don't understand.

1144
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:53,172
Please, I need more time.

1145
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:55,575
Please. Please
give me more time.

1146
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:57,443
I just--I just have
to see him again.

1147
01:16:57,444 --> 01:16:58,779
Please.

1148
01:16:59,779 --> 01:17:01,582
It's all right.
Come on, Kathleen.

1149
01:17:03,216 --> 01:17:07,386
Shh, calm down. Don't show
yourself up in front of them.

1150
01:17:07,387 --> 01:17:09,723
Shh, get ahold of yourself.

1151
01:17:09,724 --> 01:17:11,524
Give me the keys.

1152
01:17:11,525 --> 01:17:12,826
Give me the keys, please.

1153
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:14,694
Give me the keys, come on.

1154
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:16,509
I have to go back.

1155
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,478
Oh, Jesus.

1156
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:32,782
OK.

1157
01:17:34,782 --> 01:17:37,283
Yes, we are deeply
moved, Mrs. Quigley,

1158
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:40,487
but can you explain to my
colleagues why you are here

1159
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:43,595
and what you hope
can be achieved?

1160
01:17:49,863 --> 01:17:52,499
Well, we've, uh...

1161
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,634
We've come to ask--

1162
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:59,607
to beg...You
for our sons' lives.

1163
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,741
For the life of Bobby sands,

1164
01:18:01,742 --> 01:18:03,246
a fellow m.P.

1165
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:09,114
We ask you to persuade
the government to--

1166
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:12,419
to go in there
and speak to them,

1167
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,355
make some kind of compromise
before it's too late--

1168
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:16,922
before someone has died.

1169
01:18:16,923 --> 01:18:19,292
But will the hunger
strikers give up?

1170
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:20,426
Excuse me, madam.

1171
01:18:20,427 --> 01:18:22,828
These men are terrorists.

1172
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:24,264
Her majesty's government--

1173
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:26,267
since I appear to be
the only representative--

1174
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:29,603
does not negotiate
with terrorists.

1175
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:33,040
My son is not a terrorist.

1176
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,676
Your son is
a convicted murderer.

1177
01:18:36,676 --> 01:18:38,178
Look...

1178
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:42,215
They won't even let Bobby
sands talk to the press.

1179
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:45,318
He's our m.P.
We have no voice.

1180
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:48,321
You know, 30,000 people
voted for Bobby sands.

1181
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:49,922
That's more than voted
for Thatcher,

1182
01:18:49,923 --> 01:18:51,657
so what are you afraid of?

1183
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:54,361
You may or may not know

1184
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:58,331
that it is in fact you that
will decide your sons' fate.

1185
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:02,635
The law clearly states that if
your sons should lapse into comas,

1186
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:06,009
then you have the legal right
to take them off the strike.

1187
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:12,515
Surely no mother would
allow her son to die.

1188
01:19:14,515 --> 01:19:17,550
Tension is mounting
in Belfast tonight

1189
01:19:17,551 --> 01:19:20,520
with the news that h-block
hunger striker Bobby sands

1190
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:22,354
is only hours away from death.

1191
01:19:22,355 --> 01:19:25,425
There was no sign of a last-minute
settlement in the prison dispute.

1192
01:19:25,426 --> 01:19:28,203
Sands, who was entering his
66th day of hunger strike...

1193
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:37,504
Leave alone Bobby sands!

1194
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:39,305
You bastards!

1195
01:19:39,306 --> 01:19:40,506
Leave him alone!

1196
01:19:40,507 --> 01:19:41,908
He's our m.P.!

1197
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:44,377
Leave him alone!

1198
01:19:44,378 --> 01:19:46,712
Bastards!

1199
01:19:46,713 --> 01:19:49,116
Would everyone please join us

1200
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,652
for a prayer vigil
at the police station?

1201
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:52,818
Kathleen.

1202
01:19:52,819 --> 01:19:55,922
Form at the corner.

1203
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:57,072
Kathleen.

1204
01:20:16,277 --> 01:20:19,112
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1205
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:20,613
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1206
01:20:20,614 --> 01:20:23,349
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

1207
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,885
Blessed art thou amongst women

1208
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,654
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1209
01:20:31,091 --> 01:20:33,093
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

1210
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,428
Blessed art thou among women

1211
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:36,228
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1212
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:38,831
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1213
01:20:38,832 --> 01:20:40,466
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1214
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:42,836
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

1215
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:44,170
Blessed art thou amongst women

1216
01:20:44,171 --> 01:20:46,373
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1217
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,846
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

1218
01:20:53,847 --> 01:20:55,114
Blessed art thou among women

1219
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:57,184
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1220
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:00,120
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1221
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,621
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1222
01:21:01,622 --> 01:21:04,291
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

1223
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:05,593
Blessed art thou amongst women

1224
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:07,661
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1225
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,229
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1226
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:12,500
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1227
01:21:17,604 --> 01:21:20,172
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1228
01:21:20,173 --> 01:21:22,075
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1229
01:21:22,076 --> 01:21:24,644
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

1230
01:21:24,645 --> 01:21:25,912
Blessed art thou amongst women

1231
01:21:25,913 --> 01:21:27,514
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1232
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:30,517
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1233
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:33,225
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1234
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:40,292
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1235
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:43,702
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1236
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:50,370
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1237
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:52,206
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1238
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,345
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee...

1239
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,779
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

1240
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:02,688
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1241
01:22:10,123 --> 01:22:13,429
He's dead!

1242
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:18,832
He's dead!

1243
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,908
Murdering bastards!

1244
01:22:27,908 --> 01:22:29,876
Liam!

1245
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:31,783
Liam!

1246
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:37,853
Liam!

1247
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:41,988
Run, everybody, run!

1248
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:43,836
Liam!

1249
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:56,003
Liam!

1250
01:22:57,003 --> 01:22:58,037
No!

1251
01:22:58,038 --> 01:23:00,840
No! Come on.

1252
01:23:00,841 --> 01:23:02,211
Come on.

1253
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,690
Present...Arms!

1254
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:25,425
Load...

1255
01:24:25,426 --> 01:24:26,425
Fire!

1256
01:24:26,426 --> 01:24:27,728
Load...

1257
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:28,728
Fire!

1258
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:29,729
Load...

1259
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,337
Fire!

1260
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:40,706
Some 100,000
people took part in the funeral.

1261
01:24:40,707 --> 01:24:42,142
Abroad...

1262
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:44,743
A wave of
anti-British protests...

1263
01:24:44,744 --> 01:24:46,748
This is a disaster.

1264
01:24:47,748 --> 01:24:49,782
Is this the official
foreign office line,

1265
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:52,286
or is this merely
your line, Harrington?

1266
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,153
Thomas, do you know
anything about the role

1267
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:56,456
of Irish martyrs in history?

1268
01:24:56,457 --> 01:25:00,261
1916...Pierce Connelly.

1269
01:25:01,261 --> 01:25:03,261
Well, you've created
another one.

1270
01:25:03,262 --> 01:25:07,166
...Thatcher to behave
with compassion.

1271
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:08,268
Don't let any more die.

1272
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:10,303
Don't let any more die.

1273
01:25:10,304 --> 01:25:11,772
Give us your support.

1274
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,172
Give us your support.

1275
01:25:13,173 --> 01:25:14,441
Don't let any more die.

1276
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,410
Don't let any more die.

1277
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,310
Give us your support.

1278
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:20,046
Give us your support.

1279
01:25:20,047 --> 01:25:21,047
Remember Bobby sands.

1280
01:25:21,048 --> 01:25:22,181
Remember Bobby sands.

1281
01:25:22,182 --> 01:25:23,658
You Fenian bastards!

1282
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:32,295
Here.

1283
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,961
It's all right.
It's all right.

1284
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:36,962
It's only piss.

1285
01:25:36,963 --> 01:25:38,163
Are you all right?

1286
01:25:38,164 --> 01:25:39,768
You'll be OK.

1287
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,969
Come on, we'll get you
home now. Come on.

1288
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,036
Are you all right?

1289
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:45,103
I'm fine.

1290
01:25:45,104 --> 01:25:46,462
You're all right.
Bastards!

1291
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:08,832
Hello?

1292
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:11,997
Mummy.

1293
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:14,367
Alice.

1294
01:26:14,368 --> 01:26:16,202
I had to come home.

1295
01:26:16,203 --> 01:26:17,277
Good.

1296
01:26:23,277 --> 01:26:25,911
There are now 10 of
them on the strike.

1297
01:26:25,912 --> 01:26:28,648
The first few are hard-core
gunmen and bombers

1298
01:26:28,649 --> 01:26:30,250
who've murdered innocent people,

1299
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,850
but further down the line,

1300
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:33,086
we've got young men

1301
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,720
who are only involved
peripherally.

1302
01:26:34,721 --> 01:26:36,355
And I'm not sure

1303
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:39,358
about shifting the onus
onto the families.

1304
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,199
We're not negotiating, are we?

1305
01:26:46,199 --> 01:26:49,068
Who does Harrington report to?

1306
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:53,406
He's a foreign office
monitor at the prisons.

1307
01:26:53,407 --> 01:26:56,009
Be careful with him.

1308
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,858
We have every confidence in you.

1309
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:12,868
Alice.

1310
01:27:21,868 --> 01:27:23,275
Hiya, Liam.

1311
01:27:28,275 --> 01:27:30,443
Hello, ma.

1312
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:32,879
Jesus Christ, Gerard,
can you not stop this?

1313
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,679
Oh, God.

1314
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,715
Look, is there no other way?

1315
01:27:35,716 --> 01:27:36,515
Alice, please.

1316
01:27:36,516 --> 01:27:39,685
We've argued this out.

1317
01:27:39,686 --> 01:27:45,457
Please respect my convictions.

1318
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:48,300
Youse know something?

1319
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,971
I've never seen things
as clearly before...

1320
01:27:57,971 --> 01:28:00,150
As I can see things now.

1321
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:13,287
He won't do it.

1322
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:17,958
Mum, he won't go
through with it.

1323
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:19,758
Oh.

1324
01:28:29,069 --> 01:28:32,371
This is
the northern Ireland news.

1325
01:28:32,372 --> 01:28:36,376
In a further escalation
of the prison crisis,

1326
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:39,478
the I.R.A. Have issued
the following statement:

1327
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:42,348
"Our comrades are prepared
to die for their rights."

1328
01:28:42,349 --> 01:28:43,550
Morning, lads.

1329
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:45,684
"Those who try
to take those rights away

1330
01:28:45,685 --> 01:28:48,494
must be prepared
to pay the same price."

1331
01:28:54,494 --> 01:28:56,965
Come on!

1332
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:59,266
Come on!

1333
01:29:00,266 --> 01:29:01,871
No!

1334
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:05,004
Help!

1335
01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:06,738
No!

1336
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:08,707
Oh!

1337
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:09,709
Oh, no!

1338
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:10,609
Ohh...

1339
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:13,149
I'm proud of you.

1340
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:17,252
Why?

1341
01:29:19,252 --> 01:29:21,955
For respecting my beliefs.

1342
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:23,292
Oh, Gerard.

1343
01:29:25,292 --> 01:29:27,727
Who said I respected
your beliefs?

1344
01:29:27,728 --> 01:29:31,464
You had a choice
in what you did,

1345
01:29:31,465 --> 01:29:34,466
but you left us with no choice.

1346
01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:38,036
Don't let us die.

1347
01:29:38,037 --> 01:29:40,238
Kieran!

1348
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,407
Kieran!

1349
01:29:41,408 --> 01:29:44,077
I'll see.

1350
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:45,046
Oh!

1351
01:29:47,046 --> 01:29:48,734
Can't go out there.

1352
01:30:41,734 --> 01:30:45,270
We must all mourn the death
of this young man,

1353
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:48,273
but we must also mourn the death

1354
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:50,041
of 2 prison officers

1355
01:30:50,042 --> 01:30:53,979
brutally murdered in front
of their own families.

1356
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:56,750
Some of you here

1357
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,685
have your hands
steeped in blood.

1358
01:30:59,686 --> 01:31:02,354
Who paid you to say that, daly?

1359
01:31:02,355 --> 01:31:04,223
I beg you now,

1360
01:31:04,224 --> 01:31:06,325
stop this violence.

1361
01:31:06,326 --> 01:31:08,027
Who put you up to it?

1362
01:31:08,028 --> 01:31:09,461
We don't have to listen to this.

1363
01:31:09,462 --> 01:31:10,862
It is our
solemn duty--

1364
01:31:10,863 --> 01:31:13,066
why don't you stick
to religion, daly?!

1365
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:15,367
...under God,
to save life.

1366
01:31:15,368 --> 01:31:16,568
Did the Brits get at you?

1367
01:31:16,569 --> 01:31:19,205
We must save life
wherever possible,

1368
01:31:19,206 --> 01:31:21,374
however unpopular it is.

1369
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:23,742
Please...

1370
01:31:23,743 --> 01:31:26,179
Don't let anybody else die.

1371
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:30,421
Please don't let
anybody else die.

1372
01:31:37,356 --> 01:31:38,363
Kieran!

1373
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:12,124
This is wrong.
This is wrong!

1374
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:14,727
What you said in there was
an absolute bloody disgrace.

1375
01:32:14,728 --> 01:32:17,663
What I said in there
is God's law.

1376
01:32:17,664 --> 01:32:20,032
You're telling me
to betray my son?

1377
01:32:20,033 --> 01:32:21,867
It's God's law, Annie!

1378
01:32:21,868 --> 01:32:23,870
This isn't a protest anymore.

1379
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:27,206
These people are using these
funerals to win support.

1380
01:32:27,207 --> 01:32:29,809
These people are our
friends and our families.

1381
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:32,679
Look, you have
to take your sons off.

1382
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,113
You have the right to choose.

1383
01:32:34,114 --> 01:32:35,348
You can make a choice.

1384
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:36,549
Leave them alone.

1385
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:37,616
No, I don't.

1386
01:32:37,617 --> 01:32:40,019
It's not my choice to make.

1387
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,522
Jesus Christ, do you think
if it was my choice,

1388
01:32:43,523 --> 01:32:45,125
I'd let him die?

1389
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:47,091
Come on, Annie, let's go home.

1390
01:32:47,092 --> 01:32:48,297
I--

1391
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:53,097
do you hear me, Kathleen?

1392
01:33:24,097 --> 01:33:27,166
He's losing consciousness.

1393
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:29,422
We should contact
the next of kin.

1394
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:51,758
Mrs. Quigley?
Tim Harrington.

1395
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:53,192
Leave me alone.

1396
01:33:53,193 --> 01:33:55,728
Please, Mrs. Quigley, I
think we have a solution.

1397
01:33:55,729 --> 01:33:58,563
Excuse me. I'm going
to stay with my son.

1398
01:33:58,564 --> 01:34:01,468
Look, we can resolve
this bloody mess.

1399
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,501
Do you want to stop
this madness?

1400
01:34:03,502 --> 01:34:05,304
Do you?

1401
01:34:05,305 --> 01:34:10,733
While there's still time,
please take me to Danny Boyle.

1402
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:33,898
Am I safe here?

1403
01:34:33,899 --> 01:34:37,673
They'll have to
shoot me as well.

1404
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:44,587
You think they won't?

1405
01:34:54,587 --> 01:34:56,688
You've got some nerve
coming here.

1406
01:34:56,689 --> 01:34:59,858
Mr. Boyle,
I have a proposal.

1407
01:34:59,859 --> 01:35:04,229
The prisoners can have
their specific demands.

1408
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:05,234
As a right?

1409
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:08,968
As a right.

1410
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:11,036
Provided the hunger strike
is called off first

1411
01:35:11,037 --> 01:35:13,072
and your organization
makes no statement

1412
01:35:13,073 --> 01:35:15,412
claiming to have won
prisoner-of-war status.

1413
01:35:19,412 --> 01:35:21,518
May I have an ashtray?

1414
01:35:25,518 --> 01:35:27,053
The government will say

1415
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:30,788
that in light of the
prisoners' sensible decision

1416
01:35:30,789 --> 01:35:33,059
to end the hunger strike,

1417
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:37,664
we are re-examining
the present regime.

1418
01:35:38,664 --> 01:35:40,465
You cheated us
about the clothes.

1419
01:35:40,466 --> 01:35:44,472
Mr. Boyle, I have never
cheated anyone in my life.

1420
01:35:46,472 --> 01:35:47,474
Now,

1421
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:49,207
if the terms are acceptable,

1422
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:51,210
I will go into
the prison tonight

1423
01:35:51,211 --> 01:35:53,813
and outline the changes
to the hunger strikers

1424
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:56,720
in the presence of a
witness of your choice.

1425
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,287
Thatcher will never
agree to this deal.

1426
01:36:02,288 --> 01:36:05,291
Senior concerned parties
within the government

1427
01:36:05,292 --> 01:36:09,837
feel strongly that the
prime minister will agree.

1428
01:36:17,837 --> 01:36:20,305
I'll have to consult
the prisoners first.

1429
01:36:20,306 --> 01:36:23,108
And I must talk to my people.

1430
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:26,077
Danny, my son is dying.

1431
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:28,313
We don't have any time.

1432
01:36:28,314 --> 01:36:31,329
Can't you just resolve this now?

1433
01:37:16,128 --> 01:37:18,296
Do something.
You must do something.

1434
01:37:18,297 --> 01:37:21,676
There's nothing I can do.
Please leave.

1435
01:37:30,676 --> 01:37:33,923
One on!
Clear the wing!

1436
01:37:43,923 --> 01:37:46,191
Keep goin', Frankie.

1437
01:37:46,192 --> 01:37:48,671
Keep goin', Gerard.

1438
01:37:57,671 --> 01:37:58,804
Hi, tom.

1439
01:37:58,805 --> 01:38:00,672
Must be serious if you're here.

1440
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:02,728
I think we have a deal.

1441
01:38:21,728 --> 01:38:22,795
Oh!

1442
01:38:22,796 --> 01:38:24,697
Kathleen, any sign
of Harrington?

1443
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:27,198
No. They told me
he was with you.

1444
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,068
Tom McLaughlin,
the prisoners' leader.

1445
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:30,702
How are you,
Mrs. Quigley?

1446
01:38:30,703 --> 01:38:31,870
You all right?

1447
01:38:31,871 --> 01:38:33,938
Yes.

1448
01:38:33,939 --> 01:38:35,608
So he's not with you?

1449
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:37,376
Where is he? Do you
think he's coming?

1450
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:38,944
I have no idea.
He must be in London.

1451
01:38:38,945 --> 01:38:40,478
So what do the
prisoners think, tom?

1452
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:43,114
The prisoners will agree
if the Brits agree.

1453
01:38:43,115 --> 01:38:44,950
Oh, thank God.

1454
01:38:44,951 --> 01:38:46,719
Can I bum one of those on you?

1455
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,390
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

1456
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:52,491
Where is he?

1457
01:38:52,492 --> 01:38:55,560
You know Frankie
doesn't have long.

1458
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:57,099
Aye, I know.

1459
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:01,475
All we can do is wait,
Mrs. Quigley.

1460
01:39:08,475 --> 01:39:10,108
Yes...

1461
01:39:10,109 --> 01:39:11,910
Yes, we have a deal.

1462
01:39:11,911 --> 01:39:13,312
They'll agree.

1463
01:39:13,313 --> 01:39:15,113
No, no loss of face to anyone.

1464
01:39:15,114 --> 01:39:17,752
What's going on?

1465
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:20,759
How dare you barge in here?

1466
01:39:25,759 --> 01:39:28,294
Your career's over.

1467
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:30,562
We have a deal in place.

1468
01:39:30,563 --> 01:39:32,465
It's not a deal.
It's surrender.

1469
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:35,166
I warn you,
I have strong support.

1470
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:37,969
You'll be lucky
to get a pension.

1471
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:39,675
Get out.

1472
01:39:42,675 --> 01:39:43,475
Now.

1473
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:54,297
Cardinal's office, please.

1474
01:40:05,297 --> 01:40:06,431
Yes, your eminence.

1475
01:40:06,432 --> 01:40:10,102
I think we can reach
a compromise.

1476
01:40:10,103 --> 01:40:11,837
That's right.

1477
01:40:11,838 --> 01:40:13,839
Kathleen!

1478
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,840
Kathleen, Kathleen...

1479
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:18,046
The cardinal organized a deal.

1480
01:40:20,046 --> 01:40:22,250
What deal?

1481
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,483
What are you doing here?

1482
01:40:25,484 --> 01:40:27,251
Where'd this come from?

1483
01:40:27,252 --> 01:40:29,356
Farnsworth's office.

1484
01:40:31,356 --> 01:40:34,225
You fuckin' idiot.

1485
01:40:34,226 --> 01:40:36,862
What's wrong?

1486
01:40:36,863 --> 01:40:40,965
"The prisoners will have the
privilege of their own clothes."

1487
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:42,068
Jesus Christ.

1488
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:43,336
Privilege.

1489
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:44,804
It's only a word.

1490
01:40:44,805 --> 01:40:48,374
We have been in direct
negotiations with Harrington,

1491
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:52,377
who was prepared to accept
the 5 demands as a right!

1492
01:40:52,378 --> 01:40:56,415
There are 9 men have died
for that right, daly,

1493
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:58,951
and you have
no reason to come in

1494
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:02,622
and interfere in the work
that should come from this.

1495
01:42:44,356 --> 01:42:46,082
I'm taking him off.

1496
01:43:10,082 --> 01:43:11,525
OK, now clear the room.

1497
01:43:21,159 --> 01:43:23,596
Frankie!

1498
01:43:38,011 --> 01:43:39,684
Annie...

1499
01:43:44,684 --> 01:43:46,389
Kathleen...

1500
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:51,292
Oh, Annie, I'm so sorry.

1501
01:43:53,292 --> 01:43:56,101
Sure his sufferings
are over now anyway.

1502
01:44:02,101 --> 01:44:03,912
I took Gerard off.

1503
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:13,280
I had to do it.

1504
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,689
Somebody had to do it.

1505
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:26,595
You're lucky you had the choice.

1506
01:44:29,595 --> 01:44:32,389
OK, Mrs. Quigley, will you
come with me, please?

1507
01:44:56,389 --> 01:44:57,832
Oh, Jesus...

1508
01:45:06,832 --> 01:45:08,800
Mrs. Quigley,
how is your son?

1509
01:45:08,801 --> 01:45:10,635
Mrs. Quigley, was it
an I.R.A. Directive

1510
01:45:10,636 --> 01:45:13,339
for your son to quit
the hunger strike?

1511
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,253
Mrs. Quigley,
a few words, please!
