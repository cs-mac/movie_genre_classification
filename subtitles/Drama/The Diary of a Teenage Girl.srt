<i>Holy shit.</i>

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,604
My name is Minnie Goetze.

6
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,048
I'm a 15-year-old living in
San Francisco, California,

7
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,884
recording this onto a cassette tape

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,566
because my life has gotten
really crazy of late,

9
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,563
and I need to tell someone about it.

10
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,922
If you're listening to this
without my permission, please stop now.

11
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,722
Just stop. Okay?

12
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,891
So...

13
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,482
I don't remember being born.

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,402
I was a very ugly child.

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,004
My appearance has not improved,

16
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,130
so I suppose it was a lucky break
when he was attracted by my youthfulness.

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,007
Hey, Domino, you stupid cat, I love you.

18
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,482
Hey, Domino, do I look different
than I did yesterday?

19
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,163
In all matter of factuality,
it happened like this...

20
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,207
<i>I was wearing a ratty old nightgown,</i>

21
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,521
<i>which is embarrassing when I think about it,</i>

22
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,763
<i>but I'm not gonna change that detail
'cause it's the truth.</i>

23
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,761
<i>My mother was married for a long time
to my stepdad Pascal.</i>

24
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,286
<i>He's a science-y guy. A PhD.</i>

25
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,882
<i>He has a lot of ideas
about how the world works.</i>

26
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,362
<i>Doesn't think women should drink or smoke.</i>

27
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,523
Mom! You're so gross.
I can't even watch TV without you...

28
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,404
<i>Maybe that's why
she isn't married to him anymore.</i>

29
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,961
Wait.

30
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,883
<i>She's looser now.</i>

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,883
-You really...
-Cocaine.

32
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,689
What's his last name?

33
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,000
I thought you were gonna...

34
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,168
<i>Monroe is her boyfriend,
but they aren't possessive.</i>

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,723
I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,570
I'm crashing, you guys.

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
All right. Good night.

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,725
-Good night.
-Good night.

39
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,570
<i>I know it seems weird,
but I had this strangely calming feeling</i>

40
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,802
<i>that even if he meant to touch my tit,</i>

41
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,928
<i>it's probably all right,
because he's a good guy,</i>

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,162
<i>and he knows how it goes and I don't.</i>

43
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,846
<i>But I wonder if my breast felt small.</i>

44
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,248
Monroe. Pitter-pat.

45
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,250
You touched my tit. How was that?

46
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,642
Can I just say

47
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,566
touching your breasts was...

48
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,161
I can't even say it.

49
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,963
They're really great, Minnie.

50
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,883
Fantastic breasts. Just perfect.

51
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,520
Weirdo.

52
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,447
<i>It feels so good to imagine that
he might be thinking about me.</i>

53
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,125
<i>Not that I love him or anything.</i>

54
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,404
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

55
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,127
-You about ready, steady?
-No, I don't think I wanna go.

56
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,850
I'm already in my skivvies.

57
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,931
It's two-for-one Tuesdays.

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,445
We're gonna watch
<i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

59
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,444
-Yeah.
-No, no, no, come on. You promised.

60
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,289
I know. I'm sorry, baby.

61
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,365
-Just for a couple of drinks.
-No.

62
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,606
I need to get out.

63
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,160
I will make it up to you, I promise. I'm sorry.

64
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,161
Come on.

65
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,884
Why don't you take Minnie?

66
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,121
What?

67
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,085
-Yeah.
-No.

68
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,690
Minnie will go. Won't you, Min?

69
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,565
-She doesn't want to go.
-Yeah, I do. Where?

70
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,244
See? Told ya.

71
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,171
Worthless.

72
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,841
It was good.

73
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,641
It was not good. This is good.

74
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,721
Man. I got it.

75
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,161
I got it.

76
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,729
Shut up. Shut up.

77
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,047
Gosh, you're such a lightweight.

78
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,167
No.

79
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,410
-That doesn't hurt?
-What are you trying to do?

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,891
You're not even biting me.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,002
I'm gonna bite you so fucking hard.

82
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,570
Are you even biting down? I'm not feeling it.

83
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,887
-You're drunk.
-No, I'm not drunk.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,846
I'm just really strong,
and my fists are made of steel, that's why.

85
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,649
I feel nothing. Nothing.

86
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,044
You're not even biting.

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,570
You're far away.

88
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,488
You just gave me a hard-on.

89
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,045
I did?

90
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,083
Yeah, I'm hard.

91
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,645
You don't believe me?

92
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,801
It's hard.

93
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,441
See?

94
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,526
<i>It didn't feel too hard to me. It was still skin.</i>

95
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,286
I want you to fuck me.

96
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,966
All right. You're shit-faced, Minnie.

97
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,641
Come on.

98
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,846
I can't believe you said
you want me to fuck you.

99
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,648
Do you really want me to fuck you?

100
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,007
None of your fucking business.

101
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,007
You really do want me to fuck you,
don't you?

102
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,046
You really fucking want me to
fucking fuck you.

103
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,444
<i>I didn't know if I wanted him
or anyone else to fuck me,</i>

104
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,888
<i>but I was afraid to pass up the chance
'cause I may never get another.</i>

105
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,726
<i>The inside of his mouth was all smooth.</i>

106
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,760
<i>I tried giving him a blow job in the car.</i>

107
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,720
<i>He said he wants to fuck me,
but we can't tonight.</i>

108
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,130
Oh, my God.

109
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,089
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

110
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,530
<i>Is this what it feels like
for someone to love you?</i>

111
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,964
<i>Somebody wants me.</i>

112
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,005
<i>Somebody wants to have sex with me.</i>

113
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,361
Hey-

114
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,003
You gonna get in trouble
for skipping school?

115
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,081
No.

116
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,769
-You feel like sandwiches?
-Yeah.

117
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,566
What?

118
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,960
I didn't know you were a virgin.

119
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,245
You look good.

120
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,044
Will you take my picture?

121
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,441
Why?

122
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,163
Please. I just wanna see.

123
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,923
No, no, no. Are you crazy?

124
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,762
You better not show that to anyone.

125
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,249
Can't even see where I am.

126
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,851
<i>Ms. Hearst is still being examined by
Dr. William Sargent, a brainwash expert</i>

127
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,002
<i>flown in from London
at her parents' expense.</i>

128
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,081
<i>Findings had no bearing...</i>

129
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,844
Minnie, Minnie, come watch with us.

130
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,604
Yeah, it's history in the making.

131
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,001
<i>...by a bank camera
taking part in an armed robbery...</i>

132
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,560
She's not mentally ill. Fuck this guy.

133
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,689
Just because she left her bourgeois family
to start over.

134
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,444
I know how you feel, Patty.

135
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,283
What kind of person falls in love
with the people who kidnap them?

136
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,600
<i>...move her trial date back.</i>

137
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,411
<i>But when her trial does begin in January,
there's a good possibility</i>

138
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,720
<i>Dr. Sargent will then be called...</i>

139
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,046
Is that what you wore today?

140
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,485
Mom.

141
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,403
I'm just saying it wouldn't kill you
to show off your waist a little bit.

142
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,481
Geez.

143
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,604
<i>I had sex today. Holy shit.</i>

144
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,570
That was about an hour ago,

145
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,325
and now I can't believe
I've actually said it out loud.

146
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,331
I think this makes me officially an adult.

147
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,241
Right?

148
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,121
<i>All right, tell me.</i>

149
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,645
I can't tell you, you have to guess.

150
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,211
<i>You fucked somebody.</i>

151
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,362
What? How did you know?

152
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm so happy. Who was it?

153
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,766
Guess. Gretel is listening.

154
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,808
I am not. You're so full of yourself.

155
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,884
Wait. Was it that guy that works
at the liquor store, the cute one?

156
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,485
<i>No.</i>

157
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,164
Was it someone I know?

158
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,369
Yes.

159
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,725
Wait a minute. It's not Monroe, is it?

160
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,605
<i>My God, Minnie, that is so sick.</i>

161
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,890
Don't you think he's kind of cute?

162
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,645
<i>No, I do not think he's cute. He's so old.</i>

163
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,370
Minnie, he sleeps with your mom.

164
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,927
Only 'cause he has to,
otherwise she'll suspect something.

165
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,406
<i>I don't know, Minnie.</i>

166
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,165
<i>Don't you kind of feel like
he's taking advantage of you or something?</i>

167
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,167
<i>I mean, you're so much younger than him.</i>

168
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,810
<i>Minnie?</i>

169
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,489
I'm gonna kill you!

170
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,206
Minnie, don't!

171
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,171
Quit spying on me!

172
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,924
What were you talking about?

173
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,641
Hey-

174
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,201
Hey-

175
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,811
-ls your mom home?
-No.

176
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,523
Why? Did you come to see her?

177
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,361
No. I came to see you, silly.

178
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,804
You got a pretty good arm.

179
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,801
Wanna box?

180
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,043
-Yeah.
-Well...

181
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,048
Really? Come on then.

182
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,648
What were you doing before I got here?

183
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,201
-Nothing.
-Were you thinking about me?

184
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,169
-No.
-No?

185
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,721
-Min, I think you were.
-Hello!

186
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,491
Hey. There you are.

187
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,251
Let me get those.

188
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,931
Thank you. Hey, you look cute.

189
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,331
-Hey.
-Hi.

190
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,451
<i>What's the point of living
if nobody loves you?</i>

191
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,369
<i>Nobody sees you.</i>

192
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,250
<i>Nobody touches you.</i>

193
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,242
<i>I wish I were older than I am.</i>

194
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,365
<i>I'm so alone.</i>

195
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,042
<i>It feels like there are little weights
hanging from my heart</i>

196
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,726
<i>that swing and tug every time I move,</i>

197
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,044
<i>every time the wind blows.</i>

198
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,371
<i>I want someone to be
so totally in love with me</i>

199
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,081
<i>that they would feel like they would die
if I were gone.</i>

200
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,526
<i>Maybe Monroe could love me like that.</i>

201
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,683
What's your favorite color?

202
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,131
I don't know.

203
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,361
Blue.

204
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,921
Why are you asking me
such stupid questions?

205
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,045
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

206
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,167
<i>I am so warm all over.</i>

207
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,969
<i>I want a body pressed up next to me
so that I know that I'm really here.</i>

208
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,851
<i>Mom and Andrea got some coke
from Michael Cocaine</i>

209
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,890
<i>and it gave them the energy
to clean the whole house today.</i>

210
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,366
Hi. We're making dinner right now.

211
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,370
So far, we've got peas that are cooking.
Do you want me to make you some pasta?

212
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,363
What kind of pasta do you like? I forget.
Macaroni.

213
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,882
Do you want me to make you
a little bit of macaroni? Okay.

214
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,082
My mother's friend, Martin Chong,
wrote her a poem.

215
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,206
He's one of the many men
who's in love with her.

216
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,124
Waiting in line with a number in their hand
like at the deli counter.

217
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,041
He wrote it on a lacy purple
piece of rice paper

218
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,168
that I found crumpled in the trash.

219
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,451
I think it's beautiful.

220
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,884
"It would've been better to
have slept and dreamed

221
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,564
"than to watch the night pass
and the slow moon sink."

222
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,130
I wonder if Monroe is masturbating
thinking about me tonight.

223
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,127
Monroe says I exude sexuality.

224
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,203
Sometimes, I look in the mirror
and I can't believe what I see.

225
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,241
I just realized I've had breasts
for three full years now.

226
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,563
He's fucked me seven times now.

227
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,247
All I can think about is the fucking.

228
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,890
Monroe is a good lay
from what I know in my limited knowledge.

229
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,808
He is very tall and strong

230
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,090
and has two strong muscular thighs
and a big manly chest.

231
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,404
As for myself, I'm not really attractive at all.

232
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,047
But I do think I look different now.

233
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,051
Probably my aura.

234
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,962
And I think people are noticing.

235
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,410
But what do we make of the moment

236
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,086
when he touches Holden's forehead
while he slept?

237
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,810
Holden's attitudes about homosexuality
come into question

238
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,281
as do his ability of perception.

239
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,929
Is there something questionable going on,

240
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,843
or is that all in Holden's mind?

241
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,241
Even if she knew
what she was doing in the bank,

242
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,481
she was a prisoner.

243
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,768
Kidnapped, raped. Come on, she's a victim.

244
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,885
I don't know.

245
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,009
I guess it does seem kind of
counter-progressive or something.

246
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,923
It's bullshit.
it's fascist, misogynistic bullshit.

247
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,131
You know, you should really pay attention
to this kind of stuff.

248
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,089
Read a newspaper once in a while.

249
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,685
Yeah, you've said that.

250
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,363
I'm gonna get some ice.

251
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,689
Your mom's really gorgeous.

252
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,522
I don't know. I guess.

253
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,606
Aren't you afraid she's gonna find out
about you and Monroe?

254
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,848
What if they get married? It's so sick.

255
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,560
Obviously, I can't tell her about, you know...

256
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,725
I mean, what am I supposed to say?
Mom, I'm sleeping with your boyfriend.

257
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,281
Yeah.

258
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,847
Maybe I'll tell her
when we're both old and gray,

259
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,571
and Monroe is cold in his grave. You know?

260
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,728
Do you think I should start
ironing my hair straight?

261
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,529
Or is it sort of classic like this?

262
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,401
Kimmie's kind of white trash,
don't you think?

263
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,641
She is not.

264
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,247
No, I mean it in a good way.
You know, she's like down-to-earth.

265
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,761
I love her Farrah Fawcett hairdo.
It's so a Ia mode.

266
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,689
I mean, I'm glad your hair's not like that.
I'm just saying it looks cute on her.

267
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,611
Boys love Kimmie.

268
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,161
Really?

269
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,441
I don't know.

270
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,083
I mean, I think she looks better in pants
than she does in skirts.

271
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,128
Her ankles are sort of thick, I think.

272
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,681
Mom.

273
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,087
I don't want to brag, but I was quite a piece
when I was your age.

274
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,283
I don't know what's wrong with you.
I'd think you'd be more into boys.

275
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,124
Even Gretel has a boyfriend.

276
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,603
I mean, he's just a weird, little Italian boy
in her class, but still.

277
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,451
Don't you like anybody?

278
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,446
You can tell me.

279
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,087
-No.
-No?

280
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,202
When I was in high school,
well, boys were all over me.

281
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,650
Like my dad?

282
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,207
Yeah.

283
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,482
Yeah, your dad and I
were crazy about each other.

284
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,484
He wasn't messed up then.

285
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,322
I mean, he was just a wannabe artist
with a fuck-the-world attitude.

286
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,491
And he rode a Triumph Blackbird.

287
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,803
Have I ever told you that?
Fuck, it was fantastic.

288
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,601
And my parents hated him. It was so hot.

289
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,365
You know, you're not gonna have
that bod forever, Min.

290
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,440
I know that's not very feminist of me to say,

291
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,444
but you might be happier
if you put it out there a little bit, you know?

292
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,966
Wear some makeup?
Wear a skirt once in a while?

293
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,203
Jesus. Get some attention.

294
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,367
You have a kind of power, you know.
You just...

295
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,964
You don't know it yet.

296
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,328
No, no, no, no, no. Keep going.

297
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,008
Keep going. Keep going.

298
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,369
Come on. Come on.

299
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,524
We have to stop this.

300
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,004
Why would you say that?

301
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,210
Do you think I'm fat?

302
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,081
You're so fucking confusing
with your adult codes and bullshit.

303
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,241
Minnie.

304
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,563
I'm used to the more honest means
of communication used between children.

305
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,483
You know, I'm almost still a child.
You know?

306
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,005
Yeah, I know that.

307
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,842
That's why I said we have to stop.

308
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,091
I don't know what it is.
You have some kind of hold on me.

309
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,484
But I don't want it to stop.

310
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,602
<i>Maybe I should just ignore everything.</i>

311
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,487
<i>But I like sex. I wanna get laid right now.</i>

312
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,489
<i>I really like getting fucked.</i>

313
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,127
<i>Does everyone think about fucking
as much as I do?</i>

314
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,484
That's Aline Kominsky, man.

315
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,801
It's good shit.

316
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,963
Check it out, Girl Scout. Expand your mind.

317
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,764
<i>I've decided, Aline Kominsky
is my favorite cartoonist.</i>

318
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,850
<i>She must be beautiful and work all the time
at a little drawing table</i>

319
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,361
<i>with R. Crumb nearby at his drawing table.</i>

320
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,484
<i>And they discuss their drawings
and their pens.</i>

321
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,884
<i>I imagine they're happy.</i>

322
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,122
<i>I wish I knew someone who was happy.</i>

323
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,646
<i>I feel like all of Monroe's
excuses not to come here,</i>

324
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,250
<i>are excuses not to see me.</i>

325
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,888
<i>My mom thinks it's about her.</i>

326
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,886
<i>"Dear Monroe, I know you think I'm fat.</i>

327
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,689
<i>"But I don't care, because I know that</i>

328
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,003
<i>"black guys, the world over,
and also Italian construction workers</i>

329
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,721
<i>"and wetbacks and old men
and also some lesbians like fat girls,</i>

330
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,802
<i>"even if you don't, so there.</i>

331
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,450
<i>"Love, Little Minnie."</i>

332
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,289
-Hello?
-Minnie.

333
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,481
Pascal.

334
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,245
-Don't sound so excited.
-Sony.

335
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,763
You get that biology test back?

336
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,320
B-minus.

337
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,883
<i>And are we happy with that?</i>

338
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,445
How's New York?

339
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,767
<i>You would love it here.</i>

340
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,964
The libraries alone
elevate it far above San Francisco.

341
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,526
Sounds cool.

342
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,886
<i>New York City, it's such a great place
for a young lady.</i>

343
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,644
<i>You could live with me.</i>

344
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,884
I was your surrogate father for years,
and, you know,

345
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,645
that doesn't end just because your mother
and I are no longer legally bound.

346
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,483
I am gonna send you a book on flies.

347
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,966
<i>Where's your mother?</i>

348
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,168
I don't know. She's not back from work yet.

349
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,644
<i>Is she coming home today?</i>

350
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,568
I guess. She didn't say she wasn't.

351
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,849
She usually finishes at the library
around 6:00.

352
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,124
<i>So, who's she going out with these days?</i>

353
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,770
I didn't say she was going out with anyone.
You don't even listen to me, Pascal.

354
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,490
That's not true, Minnie.

355
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,210
Besides, Mom isn't even really partying.
She's like a monk or a nun or whatever.

356
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,683
<i>Well, don't tell her I was asking about her,
okay?</i>

357
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,570
<i>It'd just complicate things between she and I.</i>

358
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,241
<i>I just finished The</i> Final Days.

359
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,045
<i>"Dear Aline Kominsky. Hello.</i>

360
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,329
<i>"My name is Minnie Goetze,
and I'm an aspiring cartoonist.</i>

361
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,084
<i>"I'm a huge fan of yours.</i>

362
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,802
<i>"Most cartoons don't amuse me at all,
but I absolutely love yours.</i>

363
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,807
<i>"I just completed my first real comic.
It's only one page.</i>

364
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,042
<i>"It's about walking around in the city.</i>

365
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,367
<i>"I used India ink,
but I wasn't sure what kind of paper to use.</i>

366
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,041
<i>"What do you use?
With admiration, Minnie Goetze."</i>

367
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,411
it stirs up a kind of
frustrated passion in my heart

368
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,323
to think about Monroe sometimes.

369
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,721
To think about him out with my mother.

370
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,688
-Careful.
-Fine.

371
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,281
Where're you going?

372
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,521
Just one, sir.

373
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,606
No. No, no, no. Don't be such a drag.

374
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,689
We haven't even sung to you yet.

375
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,000
-I'm tired.
-Come on.

376
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,491
No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

377
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,691
All right, I'm gonna make another toast,
toast from... For his birthday.

378
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,691
To Monroe's birthday.

379
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,369
It will never get better than this.

380
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,921
What?

381
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,604
It's never gonna get any better than 35.

382
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,120
Kill me.

383
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,249
-Happy birthday.
-No. Happy birthday.

384
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,408
-It's not my birthday.
-No? But it's your...

385
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,247
You're such a fucking good woman.

386
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,640
There aren't enough women like you
in California.

387
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,290
-Thank you.
-Right, Burt?

388
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,522
-Right, Burt? Right, Burt?
-That's right.

389
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,922
Minnie! Guys, Minnie's here!

390
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,482
Such a good little shit.

391
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,091
Minnie, come.

392
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,084
It's my birthday.

393
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,961
To Minnie.

394
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,483
She's such a great kid.

395
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,447
-To Minnie.
-To Minnie.

396
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,444
<i>I wonder if anybody loves me
who I don't know about.</i>

397
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,122
-Hey, Minnie.
-Hey, Chuck.

398
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,763
I heard you got put on academic probation.
You might get kicked out.

399
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,521
Yeah.

400
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,081
Bogue.

401
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,885
I don't care.

402
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,047
I wanna be an artist, anyway,
so school is essentially pointless for me.

403
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,045
I'll be right back.

404
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,721
Slut.

405
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,204
If it isn't, Mon Chéri.

406
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,890
What are you doing right now?

407
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,084
What are you waiting for? Don't be scared.

408
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,041
Hold on.

409
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,004
Let's turn over. Turn. Just turn.

410
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,081
Okay.

411
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,448
See? See, slower.

412
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,560
Come on, fat ass.

413
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,843
Are we gonna go to your place?

414
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,729
I thought you wanted to
look at boats with me.

415
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,848
Well, yeah, I do.

416
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,641
But then are we gonna go to your place?

417
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,526
What are you?
Some kind of nympho or something?

418
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,202
No. Fuck you. You're so disgusting.

419
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,327
I don't even know why you brought me here.

420
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,281
Come on.

421
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,006
Don't get nervous in the service, okay?

422
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,361
We're just gonna look at this boat real quick.

423
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,686
You look nice today.

424
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,721
What?

425
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,281
You look pretty.

426
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,131
And you're not fat.

427
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,283
You know, you have a great body.

428
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,960
I do not.

429
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,126
Come on aboard, take a look around.

430
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,484
-I'll wait for you up on the dock.
-Thank you, sir.

431
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,005
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

432
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,885
Freeport style!

433
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,563
-I dig it. It's nice, huh?
-I guess.

434
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,323
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

435
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,605
So, you wanna take a trip around the world?

436
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,490
You can be my first mate.

437
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,561
Like Gilligan?

438
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,046
Like Gilligan.

439
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,168
I'll put you to work in the galley.
Get a little cat for the ship.

440
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,490
It's like a little house.

441
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,764
Are you really gonna get it?

442
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,564
I kind of wish it was blue.

443
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,965
Yeah, me, too.

444
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,201
Yeah, but I really am gonna
get a boat, though.

445
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,886
I just have to wait
till my vitamin business takes off.

446
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,760
See, I'm gonna build up
this mail order empire.

447
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,647
And then I'll retire when I'm 45, just sell it all.

448
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,201
Get my boat.

449
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,802
Become the captain of my own destiny.

450
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,089
-Wait. Minnie, Minnie.
-What?

451
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,730
We gotta lay low.

452
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,248
You draw too much attention to us.

453
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,322
-I can do what I want.
-No.

454
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,561
Stop it.

455
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,571
-You afraid the sailor is gonna hear us?
-No.

456
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,641
You chicken?

457
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,481
I warned you.

458
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,802
Someone is asking for it, huh?

459
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,481
You need to be

460
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,166
restrained!

461
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,282
Don't touch me, you big, fat lout!

462
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,890
You're getting feisty! Stop wiggling, woman!

463
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,521
God!

464
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,931
Yeah? Is this what you want?

465
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,651
Help! Help, I'm being raped!

466
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,366
I don't think you should
show these to anyone.

467
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,366
Why?

468
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,202
Well, they're gonna weird people out.

469
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,565
They're kind of freaky.

470
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,003
Are these supposed to be sexy?

471
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,609
All right, I gotta take you home.

472
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,488
-No.
-Yes.

473
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,245
No. No, no, no. I don't wanna go yet.

474
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,731
Well, it's time.

475
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,361
Come on.

476
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,528
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

477
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,324
Oh, my God.

478
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,011
It's not fair.

479
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,203
I never see you.

480
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,167
I am gonna run outside completely naked.

481
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,322
I bet your neighbor will see me.

482
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,723
Stop. It's not funny.

483
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,321
No.

484
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,767
Yes.

485
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,844
Will you tell me about your parents?

486
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,129
-No.
-Please.

487
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,567
You tell my mother everything
about your life.

488
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,449
Minnie, you're fucking hyper.

489
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,484
I gotta take you home. It's late.

490
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,484
Hey. Come back here.

491
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,481
Hey!

492
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,924
I think we need to
talk about our relationship.

493
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,566
Really?

494
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,005
I'm serious.

495
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,447
Well, I know you are.

496
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,047
-Don't laugh at me.
-I'm not laughing.

497
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,844
-Don't!
-I'm not.

498
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,601
Don't... Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me or...

499
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,331
-Or what?
-Or I'm gonna tell my mother!

500
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,120
Get dressed.

501
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,201
You can't take it?

502
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,487
-Get dressed, I'm taking you home.
-No!

503
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,602
You ruined it, Minnie!

504
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,003
You're a fucking child!

505
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,042
I should tell your mother!

506
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,330
You want that?

507
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,004
You're manipulating me!

508
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,169
Well, I'm not having it!

509
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,245
I hate you.

510
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,964
Yeah, well, I like you.

511
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,164
<i>Fuck Monroe. He's just a dirty old man.</i>

512
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,610
Minnie, look at me. Look.

513
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,961
Oh, my God.

514
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,851
I swear I feel Iggy Pop's dick.
You have to try this.

515
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,567
Okay. All right.

516
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,127
It does feel like he has a tiny dick in there!

517
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,843
And it's hard, too.

518
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,244
I would suck Iggy Pop's dick.

519
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,761
Too gay-

520
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,161
No, he's androgynous. It's hot.

521
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,010
Hey, you know that mixed couple
I babysit for?

522
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,001
Well, anyway, the dad, Marcus, he's black.

523
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,965
God, I love black guys.

524
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,169
They always look so tough
and smell so gutsy.

525
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,207
I give him blowjobs all the time.

526
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,320
-No way.
-Yeah.

527
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,885
He comes home early from bowling

528
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,281
while his skinny white wife
is still out with her girlfriends,

529
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,443
and I suck his dick
until tears come to my eyes.

530
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,490
I have to rub Vaseline all over my lips,
because his dick is so big,

531
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,086
it feels like my mouth is gonna rip
at the corners.

532
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,850
What? Wait. How big is it, really?

533
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,567
He wants to screw me,
but I'm way too scared.

534
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,287
<i>And now, the making of a harlot.</i>

535
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,724
<i>She was a young girl driven astray
by the lustful lure of the flesh.</i>

536
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,005
<i>She looked every bit the harlot
she was bound to become.</i>

537
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,162
<i>With her brassiere straps exposed,</i>

538
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,608
<i>her tight pants rode up snugly at the crotch,
almost like a horse,</i>

539
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,682
<i>when viewed from behind.</i>

540
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,608
<i>He was a beautiful junior,
rich and famous in high school.</i>

541
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,206
<i>His name? Ricky Wasserman.</i>

542
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,286
What?

543
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,405
It's just so intense.

544
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,771
I mean, there's something
about having sex with you, Minnie,

545
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,809
kind of scares me.

546
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,004
Look, you're just so passionate.

547
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,967
I mean, I've just never experienced
someone who has sex like that.

548
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,961
No!

549
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,801
Mom!

550
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,646
Mom?

551
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,571
Minnie. Minnie's home.

552
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,368
Come here. My girl. My girl, girl, girl.

553
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,685
-Andrea, look how pretty she is.
-Yeah.

554
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,322
She's like a little doll.

555
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,526
<i>My mother doesn't touch me
if she can avoid it.</i>

556
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,648
<i>She used to touch me a lot,
in a motherly way, when I was little.</i>

557
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,247
<i>But then...</i>

558
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,442
There's something sexual

559
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,683
about Minnie's need
for physical affection from you.

560
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,125
It's not natural.

561
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,722
Hey! Come on, lazy bones!

562
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,281
Help me.

563
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,370
Come on, Minnie.
I wanna dance with you, too.

564
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,524
We should send Minnie out
to go get us some more wine.

565
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,090
We're out of it already?

566
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,808
How long have you been home?
I thought you were working late.

567
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,724
I got fired from the library,
that's why I'm not working late.

568
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,447
Okay?

569
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,451
Does that make you happy?

570
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,640
Don't worry about it, honey. It's not you.

571
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,681
Miss Thing! You girls look so elegant.
I love your eyes.

572
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,886
Kimmie did us both.

573
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,122
I'll do you, Frankie. You'll look so hot.

574
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,247
What about you, Chuck?

575
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,800
-Do you wanna get a makeover?
-No.

576
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,964
Is Frankie your boyfriend?

577
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,651
I wouldn't blame you.

578
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,125
-Bitch, you are looking foxy.
-Thanks, baby.

579
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,246
Hey-

580
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,806
You're tough.

581
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,727
What are you, a truck driver or something?

582
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,730
I can't believe you smoked pot with Tabatha.
She's so disgusting.

583
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,167
You don't know her. She's cool.

584
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,365
Hey, boys.

585
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,606
They're cute.

586
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,242
I want them to buy me another drink.

587
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,531
Do you think that they would think
that we're prostitutes?

588
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,804
That would be amazing.

589
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,884
Hookers have all the fucking power.
Everybody knows that.

590
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,520
I've been practicing my prostitute walk.

591
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,085
-Watch.
-Okay.

592
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,481
What happened?

593
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,528
I said it was five bucks
for us to suck their dicks.

594
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,967
Fifteen for the fuck of their fucking lives.

595
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,565
They're counting their money.

596
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,002
I don't think we should have done that.

597
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,287
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.

598
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,681
I feel weird and creepy about it.

599
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,928
Yeah. I do, too.

600
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,687
Maybe we should promise each other
never to do anything like that again.

601
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,246
Agreed.

602
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,924
<i>-Bonjour.
-Bonjour, Pascal.</i>

603
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,201
No, don't you remember
how I taught you how to shake hands?

604
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,328
Come on. You do it firmly.

605
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,923
You look directly in the other man's eyes,
thinking to yourself,

606
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,208
I'm better than you, you son of a bitch.

607
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,921
Let me try.

608
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,042
<i>Bravo, bravissima.</i>

609
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,163
Sit, sit, sit.

610
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,880
I got you espressos. Yours is decaf.

611
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,411
I don't get to see you two enough.

612
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,290
Just so you know, Pascal,
I have to be at my friend's house by 3:00.

613
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,681
Gretel, call me Dad, please.

614
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,446
Geez, okay.

615
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,681
Look at you young ladies,
you look so much older.

616
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,204
-How's school?
-Fine.

617
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,240
How's your mother?

618
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,044
-She's doing really...
-She got fired.

619
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,122
-Gretel!
-What?

620
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,567
She what?

621
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,720
She got laid off. it wasn't her fault.

622
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,051
Okay, you know,

623
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,806
what you girls may not understand
about your mother

624
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,603
is she is, and has always been, incapable
of taking responsibility for her own life.

625
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,961
Don't talk about our mom like that, please.

626
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,280
Yeah, Pascal,
don't talk about our mom like that.

627
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,283
Dad. It's Dad.

628
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,045
And, okay, fine,
just stop with the inquisition.

629
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,885
I'm gonna go see if they have iced tea.
I hate coffee.

630
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,366
It's espresso.

631
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,843
You know, I'm not the bad guy here.

632
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,647
Just because your mother and I
no longer share a marital bed...

633
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,961
Oh, my God. Gross.

634
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,121
You have to understand,

635
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,089
it's difficult to go from raising you
and your sister

636
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,481
to barely having a say
in any of your decisions.

637
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,005
Whose choice was that?

638
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,923
Well, if you must know, it was your mother's.

639
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,607
And that is not to say I was without fault,

640
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,208
but she became increasingly frightening
to me in some sense.

641
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,126
She does not live life
according to rules I understand.

642
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,320
Pascal, do you really want to help?

643
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,004
Yes, I do. Of course I do.

644
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,610
Morn doesn't have a job anymore.
She's looking for another one.

645
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,967
But we kind of don't have any money.

646
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,764
She doesn't know I'm asking you.

647
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,242
I get it. You're just trying to help. But...

648
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,526
You know, Minnie, neither of us can help her.

649
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,690
That's bullshit.
You could help if you cared about us.

650
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,526
I care about you, Minnie.
I care about your well-being.

651
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,365
Why do you think it's me who's paying
for that rich, hippy school of yours?

652
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,601
'Cause you just want everyone to think

653
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,125
that your step-kid is good at science,
or something.

654
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,202
You don't really care about me.

655
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,124
Okay, this conversation is closed.
You're getting emotional.

656
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,440
Fine.

657
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,841
Fine.

658
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,164
If your mom wants something from me,
she needs to ask me herself.

659
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,607
-Ask you what, Pascal?
-Dad! For fuck's sake!

660
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,850
What are you doing here?

661
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,521
You forgot this.

662
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,804
Is Charlotte here?

663
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,971
No, sir.

664
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,169
<i>You have something she wants,
and she can be pretty grabby.</i>

665
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,564
<i>Well, I'll be horn-swaggled.</i>

666
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,406
<i>A solid gold talking flute
with a diamond skin condition.</i>

667
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,203
-Have her call me.
-Yes, sir.

668
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,326
<i>We better go see Dr. Blinky.
He's a man of great knowledge.</i>

669
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,849
<i>Also, head of my anti-smog, pollution
and witch committee.</i>

670
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,609
I feel so awkward and ugly
and naive and lonely.

671
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,284
I know how you feel.

672
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,287
I have no friends.
I don't want to go to school ever again.

673
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,205
Nobody loves me.

674
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,124
Maybe I should kill myself.

675
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,646
No. Alienation is good for your art.

676
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,202
Maybe I should paint a picture.
I should paint a picture.

677
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,843
It doesn't matter what kind of art you do,
you just have to do it.

678
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,406
I wanna discipline myself to draw every day.
That's what I have to do, right?

679
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,648
I get distracted sometimes.

680
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,247
I'm overwhelmed by my all-consuming
thoughts about sex and men.

681
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,963
I always wanna be touched.

682
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,809
I don't know what's wrong with me.

683
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,921
I don't know either.

684
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,887
Maybe you're a nympho.
I'm fucking with your head.

685
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,803
Everybody wants to be touched.

686
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,044
I bet I'll listen to these tapes
in a decade or so.

687
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,724
If I'm still alive.

688
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,971
Reminiscing over my wild teenage-hood.

689
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,242
Maybe I'll even let my husband hear.
But he may get too jealous.

690
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,846
<i>What we did gets me sick.
It was so pornographic.</i>

691
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,046
<i>The sexual nature of Kimmie Minter
is a viscous cervical mucus</i>

692
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,328
<i>that always welcomes mating.</i>

693
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,561
She didn't bring my waffles yet?

694
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,842
-Not yet.
-I'm starving.

695
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,002
So, where'd Monroe go this morning?

696
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,885
EST.

697
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,245
It's this personal growth workshop thing
he's doing in Sacramento.

698
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,410
That's hilarious.

699
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,203
He's trying to better himself.
I think it's noble.

700
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,321
-You don't understand him.
-Minnie...

701
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,970
You don't. It's not your fault.

702
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,169
I mean, I know you try,
but he's tough to get to know.

703
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,685
He doesn't let many people in.

704
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,649
Look, you don't have to be worried.

705
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,241
It's just a one-time experience,
it's no big deal.

706
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,846
I know.

707
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,728
It's not like I love him or anything.

708
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,445
I mean, not that you do.

709
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,965
I love Monroe.

710
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,086
I do.

711
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,401
Okay.

712
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,966
Hello?

713
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,606
<i>Minnie.</i>

714
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,440
<i>-It's me.
Monroe.</i>

715
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,607
How's EST?

716
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,081
I kind of got arrested for drunk driving.

717
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,889
-What?
-Yeah.

718
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,568
<i>And I didn't have any shoes on.</i>

719
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,682
<i>And I didn't have my wallet.</i>

720
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,687
Don't worry, it's fine.

721
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:29,091
'Cause, the cop was...
He was really, really nice

722
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,005
and he let me ride around in his car all night,

723
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,971
chasing bad guys until I sobered up.

724
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,130
<i>Isn't that pretty wild?</i>

725
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,525
Yeah.

726
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,371
I don't know.
I just wanted to tell you about it.

727
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,885
And, you know,

728
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,401
I knew that you would be the only one
who'd appreciate it.

729
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,210
<i>Hey, could you just talk?</i>

730
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,284
He loves me.

731
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,528
-Well, have you!
-Are you crazy?

732
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,121
She's just a kid.

733
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,726
Yeah, she may just be a kid,
but she's still got tits and ass.

734
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,087
I think you can see that as well as I can.

735
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,288
Pascal needs to have the fucking shit
kicked out of him.

736
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,005
Why do you think he would say
something like that?

737
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,330
Because he doesn't want you to be happy.

738
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,802
He can't deal with the fact
that you've moved on, and he hasn't.

739
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,689
You are so full of shit, Monroe!

740
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,047
I've seen you staring at her tits!

741
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,247
My God, are you... What are you saying?

742
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,642
I don't even know if she has tits. No.

743
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,882
I don't. Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.

744
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,689
How would I know? I don't look.

745
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,491
I was probably looking at your tits,
and you got confused.

746
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,801
-Jesus Christ.
-Honey, come sit.

747
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,087
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

748
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,841
Breathe.

749
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,166
Okay, okay, okay. Have a little sip of this.

750
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,605
Don't let Mr. PhD manipulate you like this.

751
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,881
You're an independent woman.
You don't take shit from anyone.

752
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,841
Right?

753
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,601
Yeah.

754
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,480
Look at you.

755
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,001
What else could I possibly want?

756
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,565
Nothing.

757
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,001
I guess it is kind of crazy.

758
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,289
-It's just that Pascal said that...
-I don't want to hear his name.

759
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,127
It's all in here.

760
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,641
Is it?

761
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,006
Yes.

762
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,045
Hello.

763
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,528
Yeah, there they are.

764
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,683
She's beginning to suspect.

765
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,243
You make it so obvious.

766
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,851
I'm only human,

767
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,561
whether you realize it or not.

768
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,843
And I have feelings, too, you know?

769
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,522
But I know how to keep things in check,
not let it go too far.

770
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,809
And you, you don't.

771
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,170
I'm afraid you're gonna end up getting hurt.

772
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,562
I think it's better to end it now.

773
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,124
<i>Everything is so loveless and mediocre.</i>

774
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,010
I know how you feel. Trust me.

775
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,369
I've been in love once myself.

776
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,085
<i>I hate men.</i>

777
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,847
<i>I hate men, but I fuck them hard,
hard, hard and thoughtlessly,</i>

778
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,809
<i>because I hate them so much.</i>

779
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,768
-Minnie, are you okay?
-Leave me alone, fuck face!

780
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,971
<i>I hate myself.</i>

781
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,125
<i>I fucking hate myself.</i>

782
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,805
What's wrong?

783
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,646
Nothing.

784
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,611
Can I do anything?

785
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,890
Actually, do you still have that acid
you got from your brother?

786
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,087
I'm going insane, and it's your fault!

787
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,248
Can we just take a little nap for a second?
I didn't sleep last night.

788
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,288
It's not just up to you to say this is over.

789
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,089
I have a say in this, too.

790
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,522
I hate seeing you like this.

791
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:15,644
We are gonna have a talk.
I want... I want... I want us to talk.

792
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,843
Why don't you just let me sleep
for half an hour first?

793
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,321
-No.
-I didn't sleep last night at all.

794
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,245
Half an hour and then
we'll talk about everything.

795
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,290
-Just a half an hour.
-That's it.

796
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,091
Just sleep, I swear. Come on.

797
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,843
-This is my life.
-Yeah.

798
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,247
So, did you fuck anyone this week?

799
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,684
Why do you care?

800
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,326
You haven't been calling,
so you must be getting it from somewhere.

801
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,085
Well...

802
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,962
I did meet this guy at the movies.

803
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,928
This black guy with a huge dick.

804
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,001
Yeah?

805
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,004
Well, what happened?

806
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,162
He fucked me in the back of his car.

807
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,361
Really?

808
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,560
Just like that, huh?

809
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,131
Yeah.

810
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,331
I wanted it.

811
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,006
So, some stranger comes up to you
who wants to fuck you,

812
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,889
and you say, "Yes."

813
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,003
You gotta be a bit more careful, Little Minnie.

814
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,331
You could end up fucking some weirdo
or a killer.

815
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,926
Okay.

816
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,530
If we made love, would it screw you up?

817
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,445
Honestly?

818
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,920
I won't get attached. I promise.

819
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,849
<i>This is incredible.</i>

820
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,241
<i>I see...</i>

821
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,728
Everything.

822
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,042
I knew it.

823
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,441
No, don't do that!

824
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,320
Fuck.

825
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,885
No.

826
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,891
Get off the bed. Get off the bed now!

827
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,687
It's level with the windows.
It's gonna kill you.

828
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,762
Get off the bed now.

829
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,807
Minnie.

830
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,724
-I like the bed.
-They're gonna see you.

831
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,929
Why won't you listen to me?

832
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,971
Get off the bed.

833
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,601
Quietly. Quietly, get off the bed.
Get off the bed, now. Come here.

834
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,567
Come here, that one. Come!

835
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,883
Why won't you listen to me?

836
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,166
Minnie, get off the bed now!

837
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,245
Be quiet, be quiet.

838
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,445
Get off the bed.

839
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,488
Stay low, stay low.

840
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,886
Good.

841
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,967
Good. I think we're safe.

842
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,565
Why is this happening?

843
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,968
I need you, Minnie.

844
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,120
I need you to take care of me now.

845
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,441
I love you.

846
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,206
What?

847
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,325
I love you.

848
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,610
You don't love me?

849
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,520
I do.

850
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,803
You don't love me.

851
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,406
-L...
-No! No, no, you don't love me.

852
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,806
I love you.

853
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,291
I love you.

854
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,444
I love you so much.

855
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,811
I love you.

856
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,560
I love you.

857
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,687
No.

858
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,084
No, you don't.

859
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,770
I love you.

860
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,525
I love you.

861
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,241
I love you.

862
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,448
<i>He was vulnerable and weak.</i>

863
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,123
<i>It was all I'd ever wanted,
and now I had no desire for it.</i>

864
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,168
You know, I was thinking,

865
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,925
if you can keep it together,
we could really date when you turn 18.

866
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,211
I mean, it's not that far away.

867
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,282
I might even have my boat by then.

868
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,409
I've already received my first shipment
of the vitamin power tabs.

869
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,444
Fucking far out, by the way.

870
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,645
<i>I refuse to be some sniveling cry-baby.</i>

871
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,929
<i>I'm a fucking woman, and this is my life.</i>

872
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,441
Hi.

873
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,441
Hey-

874
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,886
Your hand is hot.

875
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,649
It means you're alive.

876
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,769
You've got blood in your veins.

877
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,725
You scared?

878
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,685
To try it?

879
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,651
No.

880
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,002
I'm not afraid of anything.

881
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,289
-No?
-No.

882
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,170
I'm not afraid of knives or guns,

883
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,164
or fire or poison,

884
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,169
rape,

885
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,603
or being kidnapped and tortured,

886
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,446
or brainwashed, hypnotized
like that Patty Hearst girl.

887
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,764
Are you afraid of me?

888
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,366
A little.

889
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,489
<i>...like they would die if I were gone.</i>

890
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,887
<i>Maybe Monroe could love me like that.</i>

891
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,201
How long has this been going on?

892
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,885
What?

893
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,731
When did this start?

894
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,926
Mom...

895
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,726
How long, Minnie?

896
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,170
How long?

897
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,762
Mom? What's happening?

898
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,561
Minnie? Mom?

899
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,405
Gretel, out!

900
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,889
Who started it, you?

901
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,445
I knew it.

902
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,007
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

903
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,847
And he made me feel
like I was fucking crazy, and I knew it!

904
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,367
Mom. Mom, I wanted to tell you.

905
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,771
I can't fucking look at you.

906
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,763
Stay here.

907
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,651
Fuck!No!

908
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,721
No.

909
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,450
Mom?

910
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,370
There she is.

911
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,604
How you doin', kiddo?

912
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,926
Minnie, Monroe's got something
he has to tell you.

913
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,011
-Sit down.
-Let's just all relax, you know?

914
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,004
-Take it easy for a minute.
-No, let's just get into it.

915
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,963
Let's get right to it. Right?

916
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,926
Isn't that what people do?

917
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,526
Okay. Minnie...

918
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,089
Your mother and I, we've been talking,

919
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,522
and she, or we, thought that

920
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,363
maybe you and I should get married.

921
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,681
You're drunk.

922
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,011
I'm not drunk.

923
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,287
I mean, we get along pretty well.
Don't you think? I think we do.

924
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,761
That's not the point,
that you get along with her.

925
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,841
That's not the point.

926
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,890
The point is that you fucked my daughter,

927
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,122
and so you're gonna marry her.
That's the point.

928
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,201
Mom.

929
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,881
What?

930
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,606
It's true, right? He porked you?

931
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,601
He porked you,
and so now he's gotta marry you!

932
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,286
-People are staring.
-Who cares? Fuck you.

933
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,610
What, are you embarrassed?

934
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,282
You embarrassed
that you porked my daughter?

935
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,402
Are you crazy? Stop saying "pork."

936
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,003
Do not talk to me like that.

937
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,250
Not right now.

938
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,930
I got married when I was around your age,
it's not so bad.

939
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,445
I said I would marry her.

940
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,086
And I will.

941
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,486
I'm a man of my word.

942
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,245
All right, then.

943
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,443
Great. You can marry her,
and then you can fuck her any time you want.

944
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,090
Yeah.

945
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,446
-Minnie.
-Just let her go.

946
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,690
Hey, truck driver.

947
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,927
<i>It's not a lit-up streetlight hazy darkness
like most nights.</i>

948
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,561
<i>It is a black crisp night
and my eyes are like headlights.</i>

949
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,131
<i>I've become nothing, finally.</i>

950
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,447
<i>No home, no school, no money.</i>

951
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,967
<i>I haven't been home in days.
I don't know how it happened, really.</i>

952
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,609
Who's Mike again?

953
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,485
My friend.

954
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,167
You met him last night. He's cool.

955
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,521
He has so many stairs.

956
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,488
I wanna go back to bed.

957
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,607
We Will.

958
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,247
We just gotta make this one stop first, okay?
Like we talked about?

959
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,762
Mike's been asking about you.

960
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,362
So, I told him I'd come by.

961
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,768
He's got really good 'ludes.

962
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,001
Right.

963
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:07,642
You like that, don't you?
Don't I know how to take care of my girl?

964
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,088
I'm hungry, though.

965
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,401
Everybody thinks you're so sexy.

966
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,569
Those eyes and that ass.

967
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,681
It's a good thing I'm not insecure,

968
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,409
otherwise I might be getting
all possessive and shit.

969
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,883
Possessive of me?

970
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,007
With guys like Mike lusting after you.

971
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,450
But it's not a big deal.

972
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,122
I'm not uptight,
and you're not uptight, right?

973
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,088
What's not a big deal?

974
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,286
It'll be very quick.
He only takes a few minutes.

975
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,442
I need you to do this for me, okay?

976
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,482
You gonna do this for me, baby?

977
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,766
Yeah.

978
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,565
Good.

979
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,085
Good. You're doing good.

980
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,561
Baby, you hungry?
We're making grilled cheese.

981
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,482
Yeah, she's real young. You like that?

982
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,484
Minnie?

983
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,170
God damn it, Minnie.

984
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,080
Sorry.

985
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,808
Are you okay?

986
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,411
Are you okay?

987
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,847
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, we were so worried about you.

988
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,241
-I looked everywhere for you.
-You did?

989
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,685
Of course.

990
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,729
I've been looking all night.
I've looked every single night since you left.

991
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,450
I was so afraid...

992
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,967
-I'm so sorry.
-it's okay.

993
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,486
I'm sorry.

994
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,761
-I wanted to tell you about Monroe.
-No.

995
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,330
-I really did. I just...
-Stop.

996
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,401
-...didn't know how to tell you.
-No, please.

997
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,528
-And I knew that you would be...
-Don't.

998
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,165
Okay?

999
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,808
I can't talk about that.

1000
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,844
Ever. Okay?

1001
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,524
-OK.
-OK.

1002
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,284
<i>"Dear Minnie, thank you for your letter.</i>

1003
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,442
<i>"It is refreshing to receive a letter from a girl,</i>

1004
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,205
<i>"because most letters I get
are from greasy fan boys</i>

1005
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,044
<i>"who think that I'm cute.</i>

1006
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,681
<i>"Keep drawing those comics.
Keep drawing anything you can.</i>

1007
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,524
<i>"Just keep drawing.</i>

1008
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,251
<i>"Oh, and I use Indian ink as well.</i>

1009
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,323
<i>"Love, Aline Kominsky."</i>

1010
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:40,005
<i>Did you ever go back to your preschool
once you had gotten big,</i>

1011
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,411
<i>and everything looked miniature,</i>

1012
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,370
<i>like the chairs and the monkey bars,</i>

1013
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,200
<i>just much smaller than you remembered?</i>

1014
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,242
<i>I know nothing's changed,</i>

1015
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,005
<i>but everything looks
totally different to me now.</i>

1016
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,049
It's 50 cents.

1017
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,645
Thanks.

1018
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,963
-Hey.
-Hi.

1019
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,760
Hey-

1020
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,331
You're alone, or...

1021
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,530
No, Gretel's with me.
She went to find a bathroom.

1022
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,201
She had to pee.

1023
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,000
Yeah.

1024
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,208
So, you wanna buy a drawing?

1025
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,531
Or a 'zine?

1026
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,048
I have no money, you know?

1027
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,730
Jogging shorts and all.

1028
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,962
Here, take this one.

1029
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,249
You can give the 50 cents to my mom
the next time you see her.

1030
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,045
Thank you.

1031
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,888
Goodbye, Monroe.

1032
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,290
Goodbye, Minnie.

1033
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,843
<i>I'm better than you, you son of a bitch.</i>

1034
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,402
<i>I always thought
I wanted to be exactly like my mom.</i>

1035
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:55,366
<i>But she thinks she needs a man to be happy.</i>

1036
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,091
<i>I don't.</i>

1037
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,642
If anyone asks, we're sisters.

1038
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,327
<i>So, maybe nobody loves me.</i>

1039
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,441
<i>Maybe nobody will ever love me.</i>

1040
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,522
<i>But maybe it's not about
being loved by somebody else.</i>

1041
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,404
<i>This is for all the girls
when they have grown.</i>

1042
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,609
<i>Signing off, trusty diary.</i>

1043
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:01,162
<i>Love, Minnie Goetze.</i>
