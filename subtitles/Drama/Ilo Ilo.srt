1
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,263
Turn around.

2
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,932
Look up.

3
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,098
What happened?

4
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,675
What are you doing?

5
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,346
Stop it, or I'll take you to Principal.

6
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,849
If she sees what you've done,

7
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,511
I'll have my mum lodge a complaint.

8
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,484
Quiet.

9
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,057
Mr Tan, is everything okay?

10
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,358
Good afternoon, Chuan Shipping.

11
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,460
Hold on.

12
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,464
Leng, it's for you.

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,797
Your son.

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,931
Line 2.

15
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,202
Didn't I tell you not to call my office?

16
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,911
What's the matter?

17
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,118
I'm sorry, Mr Tan.

18
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,150
I understand.

19
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,327
Okay, thank you.

20
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,568
Lisa, tell Boss I'm taking urgent leave.

21
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,794
What happened?

22
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,197
You'll understand when you have kids.

23
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,757
Close the door.

24
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,654
Still in the mood to play?

25
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,886
How many times have I told you?

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,686
Are you a hooligan?

27
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,521
Come here, stop running.

28
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,559
Are you trying to drive me to my grave?

29
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,304
Leave the drumstick for your father.

30
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,939
Have the other packet.

31
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,184
Take this.

32
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,927
Your clothes.

33
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,790
Did you ask?

34
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,720
Yes, I did.

35
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,893
I'll collect the photos from the agency.

36
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,864
Leave out the Indonesians,
we can't speak Malay anyway.

37
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,033
Are you sure about getting someone?

38
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,832
Ah Boy is already old enough.

39
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,534
At least I'll get help with chores.

40
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,390
Like father, like son.

41
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,668
What are you doing?

42
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,204
Keeping stuff.

43
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,009
Boy, don't mess with it.

44
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,211
It's Saturday, aren't you mopping the ﬂoor?

45
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,449
The maid arrives today. If I do
the chores, what will she do?

46
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,761
Please behave when she comes.
Don't embarrass me.

47
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,780
Come in.

48
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,915
My wife, Hwee Leng.

49
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,851
Teresa?

50
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,650
You can call me Terry, Ma'am.

51
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,161
My son, Jiale.

52
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,663
He's very naughty sometimes.

53
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,022
Go on, greet her.

54
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,259
<i>No.</i>

55
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,330
Help Auntie with her bags.

56
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,965
Come on.

57
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,009
Be polite.

58
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,691
You'll be sharing the room with Jiale.

59
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,648
No!

60
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,876
Don't kick up a fuss.

61
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm always the one who
has to share my room.

62
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,544
You rather sleep in the kitchen?

63
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,657
Where are your manners?

64
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,162
This is your bed, you'll sleep here.

65
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,069
You can put your stuff here.

66
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,106
I've just cleared the space and you've
dumped newspapers in again.

67
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,842
I'll do it, Ma'am.

68
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,941
Don't touch them.

69
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,684
Move these to the storeroom.

70
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,818
Terry, give me your passport.
I'll keep it for you.

71
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,755
Make sure all the papers are kept.

72
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,070
Don't touch my grandpa.

73
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,844
Why are you phoning in the toilet?

74
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,969
It's nothing.

75
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,115
Why did you take her passport?

76
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,017
In case she tries to run away.

77
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,579
Aren't you thinking too much?

78
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,880
What's the date?

79
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,955
The 18th.

80
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,482
Why are you using her passport numbers?

81
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:15,603
You have other numbers for the lottery?

82
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,424
<i>No.</i>

83
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,774
When you bring it out...

84
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,500
you must be very careful.

85
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,599
Don't drop it.

86
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,436
Or you might kill someone.

87
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,179
You will need a cup.

88
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,720
- Red or blue?
- Red?

89
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,851
The blue's better. Plastic won't break.

90
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,488
Besides sweeping and mopping every day...

91
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,657
you need to vacuum
the house once a week.

92
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,099
The vacuum cleaner is in the storeroom.

93
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,029
Can you operate this?

94
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,265
Yes Ma'am.

95
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,807
These are my old clothes
that I want to give away.

96
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,541
Maybe you can wear them.

97
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:12,948
Thank you.

98
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,814
You're welcome.

99
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,990
If you need to call me at work,
my number is here.

100
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,949
But please don't call me
unless it's an emergency.

101
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,391
You can page Sir too,
but he's harder to reach.

102
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,170
Terry.

103
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,541
Yes, Ma'am.

104
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,240
There's no IDD on our phone.

105
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,038
So no overseas calls.

106
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,737
If you need to call home,
get a phone card.

107
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,852
Place it in the middle.

108
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,115
Boy, stop playing. It's time to eat.

109
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,029
You can sit here.

110
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,696
What's the matter with you?

111
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,241
Don't worry, we don't mind. Right?

112
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,142
Have some vegetables.

113
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,382
Where are you going?

114
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,118
He wasn't this bad when
your father was around.

115
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,422
Why are you squeezing
with us at your age?

116
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,965
I can't sleep.

117
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,965
Be a good boy, go back to your bed.

118
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,827
I want to sleep here.

119
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,136
Can't you see how big my tummy is?

120
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,140
Let's just sleep.

121
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,611
Please put these on.

122
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,040
These are our glass samples.

123
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,779
As you can see...

124
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:06,722
glass made by older
technology breaks easily.

125
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,991
But the latest tempered glass...

126
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,333
doesn't break, no matter how you hit it.

127
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,561
- Can I try?
- Sure, go ahead.

128
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,645
Sorry.

129
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,617
Terry, hold this.

130
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,273
Don't mess with my things
if you're not buying.

131
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,579
Boy, come over.

132
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,410
Don't you need to get stationery?

133
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,419
Go with Auntie.

134
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,580
Spend it wisely.

135
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,624
Terry, go with him.

136
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,795
I'm really sorry.

137
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,928
I'll bring you a new sample tomorrow.

138
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:24,898
Save the trouble.

139
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,665
Quite frankly, my new manager
speaks only English.

140
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,933
Westernized snob.

141
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,975
I understand.

142
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,441
I'll walk you out.

143
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,237
Can I use your phone?

144
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,313
Sure, this way.

145
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,979
What if I sell now?

146
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,583
If I were to hold, how much will I need?

147
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,094
Alright, let's hold.

148
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,256
I'll wire the money.

149
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,902
Stop following me.

150
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,321
Ready to go;

151
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,089
Stay here, I'll go pay.

152
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,493
Jiale.

153
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,307
Excuse me, Ma'am.

154
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,865
Can you please stop?

155
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,569
What's in your bags?

156
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,347
Sorry Ma'am, we'll need to
check those items.

157
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,384
Found it?

158
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,488
Here.

159
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,709
Is this the boy?

160
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,545
Do you know him?

161
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,046
Terry;

162
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,456
Terry, where have you been?
I've been looking around for you.

163
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,422
Sorry. I was lost.

164
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,225
Luckily you came back by yourself.
Otherwise, I'd have to call the police.

165
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,031
Sorry, Ma'am.

166
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,594
You're new here, don't run
about on your own.

167
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,550
What do you want?

168
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,921
Why did you do that to me?

169
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,885
Listen, I don't care if you like me or not.

170
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,359
You don't like me, I don't care.

171
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,360
But your mum employed me.

172
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,159
I'm here to do my work properly.

173
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,499
I am your maid...

174
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,630
but I didn't come here to be bullied.

175
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,307
Terry.

176
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,710
Yes, Ma'am.

177
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,815
Can you come to the kitchen please?

178
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,083
Coming, Ma'am.

179
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,784
Sorry.

180
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,816
Breakfast?

181
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,925
Don't want it.

182
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,688
Wait... I'll make you some bread.

183
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,405
There goes another.

184
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,742
I know.

185
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,037
I typed the letters.

186
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,706
Karen, can you come in?

187
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,670
The situation is so messy
on the ground now.

188
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,213
Do you think it will affect us admin staff?

189
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,584
We've been working here for ages.

190
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,151
We should be alright.

191
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,287
You've been here longer.
You should be fine.

192
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,351
Back to work.

193
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,809
Fuck.

194
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,804
I know you're inside.

195
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,113
Open the door please.

196
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,222
Hey.

197
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,326
Filipina?

198
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,832
Yes.

199
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,068
The whole block will be after you
if you keep pounding like that.

200
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,570
Sorry.The boy was...

201
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,302
First time?

202
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,237
Yes.

203
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,401
How old are you?

204
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,209
28.

205
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,644
Good.

206
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,408
You can work for a long time.

207
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,350
Brought your rosary?

208
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,551
Yes.

209
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,689
Forget about it.

210
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,917
There is no room for God here.

211
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,656
Thank you, class.

212
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,669
Thank you, Mrs Ong.

213
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,274
Aren't you special?

214
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,781
Your maid picks you up
from the classroom.

215
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,488
Jiale.

216
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,496
Since you're so smart...

217
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,962
<i>carry</i> my <i>bag.</i>

218
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,378
Hello?

219
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,380
Terry;

220
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,481
Yes Ma'am.

221
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,709
What took you so long?

222
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,813
<i>I was...</i>

223
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:12,918
Is Ah Boy around?

224
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,754
<i>Wait, hold on...</i>

225
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,193
Let me talk to him.

226
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,228
Terry;

227
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,662
Hold on, Ma'am.

228
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,668
He's in the toilet.

229
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,969
Okay, never mind.

230
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,507
That boy is really lazy.

231
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,270
Make sure he finishes his
homework before I'm back.

232
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,905
Okay Ma'am.

233
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,341
Jiale.

234
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,751
Your maid is calling for you.

235
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,956
Mummy asked you to do your homework.

236
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,186
Later.

237
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,574
Mummy says finish your
homework before she's home.

238
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,538
Come on.

239
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,135
Leave me alone.

240
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,541
I said come on.

241
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,668
That's enough.

242
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,682
Go up and do your work,
don't be a busybody.

243
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,248
Are you coming or not?

244
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,852
Jiale.

245
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,862
Go home.

246
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,547
Fuck. Courting death?

247
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,913
Taxi drivers these days are just reckless.

248
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,056
Are you alright?

249
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,274
Still playing when your arm's like that?

250
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,683
Tell me. How did you get hit by a taxi?

251
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,723
Terry, I don't want this to happen again.

252
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,593
Yes, Ma'am.

253
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,865
Take care of yourself.

254
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,744
Don't wander about.

255
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,981
Terry, bring him up and
start cooking dinner.

256
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,874
You're not going home?

257
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,175
Take me back to the office,
I have work to do.

258
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,982
The office? At this time?

259
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,853
No thanks to your son.

260
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,584
They must be saying things
about me stepping out so often.

261
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,198
I'll do it myself.

262
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,996
Let me help. Come on.

263
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,627
Let me do it.

264
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,506
The doctor said it mustn't get wet.

265
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,671
I know.

266
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,912
Wait.

267
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:30,987
Here.

268
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,790
Okay, you go out.

269
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,578
Auntie.

270
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,146
I thought you were very clever.

271
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,649
Why do you need my help?

272
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,677
Shut up.

273
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,722
Be careful, your knee.

274
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,236
You think I haven't seen this before?

275
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,441
I've seen bigger ones.

276
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,748
Your hair stinks.

277
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:42,923
What?

278
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,551
Your hair's very smelly.

279
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,254
Nonsense.

280
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,365
I'll help you wash your hair.

281
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,828
Stop it.

282
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,001
Give it to me.

283
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,485
Terry.

284
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,378
I'm coming, Ma'am.

285
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,490
Help me.

286
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,626
Later on, take a broom and sweep outside.

287
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,492
I wonder which idiot keeps smoking here.

288
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,965
Bastard.

289
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,948
Can I speak to him?

290
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,377
Your son is already asleep.

291
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,958
Anyway how's your Lino?

292
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,117
Still drinking.

293
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,989
Didn't he stop?

294
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,863
You will think.

295
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,500
I told him that he can
go drink himself to death.

296
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,866
Bastard.

297
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,934
They are all the same.

298
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,273
Really thanks for helping.

299
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,007
I know it's hard for you.

300
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,172
It's harder for you.

301
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,741
We know that.

302
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,828
Still out at this hour?

303
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,292
I was making a call.

304
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,393
Are you okay?

305
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,926
Yes, Sir.

306
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,499
Is there a problem?

307
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,170
No, Sir.

308
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:12,807
Terry.

309
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,006
Yes?

310
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,307
Don't tell Ma'am.

311
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,608
Yes Sir.

312
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,245
I'm sorry but we're looking for someone
with higher qualifications.

313
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:29,906
But I have 15 years <i>of...</i>

314
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,174
I understand...

315
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,040
but you're not what we're
looking for at this moment.

316
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,823
Okay, thank you.

317
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,360
By <i>the way...</i>

318
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,360
how long have you been out of job for?

319
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,623
2 months.

320
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,694
We have a temporary position
if you're interested.

321
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,405
But we pay by the hour.

322
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,305
Faster.

323
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,517
Don't touch.

324
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,447
The man from upstairs is dead.

325
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,147
What?

326
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,523
You're always full of rubbish.

327
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,220
Don't talk like that.

328
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,528
I'll take you somewhere.

329
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,371
Why are you so clever...

330
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,902
you know how to come up here?

331
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,439
It's not that I'm clever, you're stupid.

332
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,779
The news said the man jumped from here.

333
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,908
With the view so nice...

334
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,886
it's no wonder so
many come here to jump.

335
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,025
You think killing yourself is funny?

336
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:07,305
Come on, let's go home.

337
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,464
You're back.

338
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,692
Have you had dinner?

339
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,165
Yes, I had something.

340
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,502
Isn't it going to be stuffy?

341
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,104
I'll switch on the air-con.

342
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,537
And it doesn't cost anything?

343
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,710
If it wasn't for your father, we wouldn't
have taken the second ﬂoor.

344
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,545
We were thinking he could
look after our boy...

345
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,984
<i>in</i> the end it was us looking after him.

346
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,790
Can you watch your words?

347
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,326
We could have chosen a higher ﬂoor.

348
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,358
But you insisted the second ﬂoor
was easier for the old man.

349
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,729
Father isn't around anymore.

350
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,667
What's the point of making all this noise?

351
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,367
Noise?

352
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,841
Yes, the noise from the funeral downstairs.

353
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,408
But you are my sister.

354
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,515
You have to look after him.

355
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,086
You are not giving me an option.

356
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,162
Where am I going to find that money?

357
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,433
Damn it.

358
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,237
I will find a way.

359
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,702
Terry.

360
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,609
Hold on.

361
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,143
You go in first.

362
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,613
Are you off this Sunday?

363
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,648
Yes, why? You want to hang out?

364
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,977
No 'off day' this month.

365
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,815
By the way I need your help.

366
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:32,786
Sure.

367
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,449
Help me send this back home.

368
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,834
The address is on the envelope.

369
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,557
Don't you dare take the money.

370
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,394
If it doesn't get home,
I'll chop your head off.

371
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,929
You can trust me.

372
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,500
You should try to make
extra cash on your'off days'.

373
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,399
Look around Lucky Plaza.

374
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,904
You might find something.

375
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,201
Really?

376
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,911
Auntie.

377
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,109
Kid is calling, got to go.

378
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,409
Don't forget.

379
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,271
Stay outside, Jiale.

380
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,439
Your breasts are smaller
than my Mummy's.

381
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,068
You're always full of nonsense.

382
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,177
This is nice. Try it on.

383
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,415
Where is your mummy?

384
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,650
She's gone to the market.

385
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,122
Nice, right?

386
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,688
Yes, it's nice.

387
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,589
Get up, stop playing.

388
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,532
Still jumping when your arm's hurt?

389
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,404
Have more fish.

390
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,573
It's awful.

391
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,247
Just for you, I got up
early to get fresh fish.

392
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,752
Does it really taste that bad?

393
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,049
It's so bland.

394
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,684
Auntie Terry cooks better.

395
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,063
It was me who taught her to cook.

396
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,137
I'm not having it anymore.

397
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,449
Fine, if you don't want it.

398
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,923
Don't grumble when you get hungry.

399
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,386
Haircut or shampoo?

400
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,014
Are you still hiring?

401
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,822
You have experience?

402
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,857
I was a hairdresser back home
for a few years.

403
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,426
We pay four an hour.

404
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,230
But it said five outside.

405
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,829
Well, that's all I'm offering.

406
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,799
But I pay cash.

407
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,403
Can you start right away?

408
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,745
Alright.

409
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,673
Okay you can start with the basin.

410
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,109
The customer there.

411
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,237
She's the most stingy Pinoy in town.

412
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,174
You're lucky she's in a good mood.

413
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,111
Years ago she had me
starting at three dollars.

414
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,045
Domestic worker?

415
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,414
Yes.

416
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,317
So what's your plan?

417
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,821
You need to be smart about these things.

418
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,885
We only get a day off each month.

419
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,625
But if you're smart...

420
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,225
you can try making
some hours on other days.

421
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,326
The key is to not let them find out.

422
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,964
<i>You know...</i>

423
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,037
<i>it</i> is against the law.

424
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,475
He felt extremely...

425
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,478
<i>Trou...</i>

426
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,253
Trou-bled.

427
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,784
Why did he feel troubled?

428
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,625
Is that how you write it? Write it again.

429
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,061
What did you buy?

430
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,001
Sweets. From the Philippines.

431
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,169
This dress looks familiar.

432
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,903
Ma'am, you gave it to <i>me...</i>
the last time.

433
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,414
Oh really?

434
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,539
<i>Wait...</i>

435
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,012
Nice?

436
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:38,919
Very nice.

437
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,316
Terry, finish ironing all of these tonight.

438
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,957
Make sure you finish by tonight.

439
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,726
Sir is going for a business trip.

440
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:46,793
But Sir is not...

441
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,989
Where is Daddy going?

442
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,187
None of your business.

443
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,968
Still having sweets when
it's almost bedtime.

444
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:11,920
Sir?

445
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,321
Sir, I'll help you.

446
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,283
I can do it myself.

447
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,820
I can do it, Sir.

448
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,465
I said I will do it myself, Terry.

449
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,826
Go sleep.

450
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,891
I told you to be back earlier.

451
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,821
Now we are caught in peak hour jam.

452
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,656
I was still at work.

453
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,101
How much did you put in the red packet?

454
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:01,866
Do you have another hundred?

455
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,369
<i>Here... take it.</i>

456
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,779
I don't want my siblings
to think we are stingy.

457
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,913
Are we very well off?
Do we need to give that much?

458
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,718
I'm not going to argue with you.

459
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,650
What are you doing?

460
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,705
I'm thinking of starting a business.

461
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,434
With some friends.
Selling bubble tea.

462
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,270
Are you crazy?

463
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,707
Giving up a proper job for bubble tea?

464
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,342
Taiwanese bubble tea
is the craze right now.

465
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,504
My friend has a contact.
It's bound to make money.

466
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,776
You know yourself well.
You are not made for business.

467
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,577
How would I know if I don't try?

468
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,949
Are you as smart as others?

469
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,369
What if you lose all your money?

470
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,914
You are always putting me down.

471
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,050
I'm just asking you to be practical.

472
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,183
I am already out <i>of...</i>

473
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,660
Look at the economy, you still
looking to start a business?

474
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,803
- Why can't you be more...
- Let's drop the subject.

475
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:09,973
Damn chicken.

476
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,488
You're here finally.

477
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,861
Mother, here is a red packet for you.

478
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,725
What's with his arm?

479
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,390
He's fine, got bumped by a car.

480
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,831
You should wish Grandma.

481
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,228
Say Happy Birthday.

482
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,904
I wish you good health.

483
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,044
I forgot you have a maid.

484
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,743
It's okay. Miss...

485
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,349
can you add a seat here please?

486
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,357
I'm afraid not.

487
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,857
It'll be impossible to serve the food.

488
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,153
Let her sit outside.

489
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,541
We will order something for her.

490
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,030
But Siti is sitting inside.

491
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,962
My daughter won't eat without my maid.

492
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,331
It's okay for your maid to sit outside.

493
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,528
You will have to sit outside.

494
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,101
Sorry.

495
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,738
Why are you apologizing?

496
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,049
Teck, drink with me.

497
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,425
He doesn't drink.

498
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,856
Come on, just one drink.

499
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,440
Brother, it's best not let him drink.

500
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,929
Just one glass.

501
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:40,927
Just a little.

502
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,459
It's Mother's birthday.

503
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,032
Here you go.

504
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,815
Happy Birthday Mother.

505
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:02,976
Happy Birthday.

506
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,913
Cheers.

507
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,520
Eat up.

508
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,174
Why did you come out?

509
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,709
They are very noisy inside.

510
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,316
I brought you this.

511
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,280
What is it?

512
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,348
Shark's fin.

513
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,684
Why don't you eat it?

514
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,584
I don't like it. But it's very expensive.

515
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,780
Try it.

516
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,851
Good?

517
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,631
Have some.

518
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:54,966
Don't like it?

519
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,072
No, I don't.

520
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,831
Have it with the fried rice.

521
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,612
Let me tell you, Brother.

522
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,645
I've been in sales for over 10 years.

523
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,846
Give me any product and
I can sell it like hot cake.

524
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,487
I believe you.

525
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:15,718
What a noisy bunch.

526
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,486
Goodbye.

527
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,319
Say bye to your aunt.

528
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,903
Where's your father again?

529
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,507
Go check if he's in the toilet.

530
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,980
Don't forget Jiale's birthday next week.

531
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,556
He's still angry you threw
out his Tamagotchi.

532
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,385
Are you done with homework?

533
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,512
Told you not to get so much.

534
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,246
Move those chairs.

535
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,546
Move it. Come on.

536
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,791
Fried chicken again?

537
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,298
Don't you like it?

538
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,591
Don't blow the candles yet.

539
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,106
Terry, help us take a family photo.

540
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,236
Isn't Auntie Terry taking a photo with us?

541
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:02,916
Who's taking the picture then?

542
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,066
- Pass me the camera.
- Then I'll take one with her.

543
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,787
Let her stand here.

544
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,297
Come here.

545
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,596
<i>One more...</i>

546
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:26,679
Mummy will take one with you.

547
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,850
Blow out the candles.

548
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,419
Look here. 1, 2, 3.

549
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,220
What about my present?

550
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,492
Present.

551
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,084
Here's a red packet.

552
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:39,889
I'll bank it in for you.

553
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,361
It's the same every year.

554
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:42,498
Of course.

555
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,470
Is it good?

556
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:51,837
What's that?

557
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,466
This is for you, open it.

558
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,214
Like it?

559
00:52:01,896 --> 00:52:04,696
You can only keep them in the balcony.
I don't want them running about.

560
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,018
Okay, take it to the balcony.

561
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,679
I'll help you.

562
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,114
Careful with your arm.

563
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,453
Let Auntie do it.

564
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,715
He dropped one into his mouth...

565
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,311
<i>gulp it down with</i> a
<i>full</i> glass <i>of water...</i>

566
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,821
and soon fell into a deep sleep.

567
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,425
David.

568
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,264
When he woke up the next morning...

569
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,763
everyone seems to have
disappeared from the house.

570
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:55,200
Mummy, daddy, even his pet dog, Bobby.

571
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,274
He searched all around.
Upstairs, downstairs, everywhere.

572
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:00,807
Jiale.

573
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,543
Lim Jiale!

574
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,248
What are you doing?

575
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,451
Hand it to me now.

576
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,068
Stay away from the windows. Move over.

577
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,370
So you want to be a bookie
when you grow up?

578
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:40,915
What do you want?

579
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,581
Get your parents down now.

580
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:43,880
My parents are busy.

581
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,150
Then I'll ask the principal to expel you.

582
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,329
Since you're so smart, you won't
need school anyway.

583
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:50,990
Hand it over!

584
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,158
Hand me the book.

585
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:55,273
I'll give you four winning digits.

586
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:56,099
I don't believe you.

587
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:57,997
Look, 0238 was drawn multiple times.

588
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,098
Practically once every two months.

589
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,272
I'm going to stop after this month.

590
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,547
The old woman is getting suspicious.

591
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,086
Sleeping pills.

592
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,657
Are you trying to kill her?

593
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,019
Of course not.

594
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,127
That's the only way I can get out.

595
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,496
You must be careful too.

596
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,063
You don't want to be sent home now.

597
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,396
Not in these difficult times.

598
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,887
Why are you all dressed up?

599
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,548
Why not?

600
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,984
Where did you go?

601
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,157
You're so nosy.

602
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,356
Let me listen to it.

603
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,527
Do you like it?

604
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,606
Nope. You can have it back.

605
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:17,171
You don't like it? It's such a nice song.

606
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:10,893
Mummy.

607
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,187
Wait a minute.

608
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,683
Can you come to my room?

609
00:58:43,763 --> 00:58:44,963
Let me finish frying the fish.

610
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:45,750
<i>Now...</i>

611
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:46,883
<i>please.</i>

612
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:03,699
Close the door.

613
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,844
Tell me truthfully.

614
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:10,642
Yes, Ma'am.

615
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,976
Have you been smoking?

616
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,276
No, Ma'am.

617
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,755
Why did I find a cigarette in the toilet?

618
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,751
I didn't smoke, Ma'am.

619
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,519
Come on, Terry. I've been very kind.

620
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,590
I've been turning a blind eye.

621
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,794
I know you've been touching my makeup.

622
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,395
Sorry, Ma'am.

623
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,039
You've the money for cigarettes, right?

624
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,137
If you admit, I can still forgive you.

625
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:50,615
I swear I'm telling you the truth.
I'm not lying to you.

626
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,290
What's the matter?

627
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,526
Mummy and Auntie are arguing in there.

628
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:12,568
What's the problem?

629
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,801
Ask her.

630
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,211
What happened?

631
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,978
Our maid was smoking in the toilet.

632
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,072
Look.

633
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:23,428
It's a misunderstanding.

634
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,283
What's this then?

635
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,917
Terry, leave us.

636
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,321
What are you doing?

637
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,760
The cigarette is mine, alright?

638
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,665
Didn't you quit after we got married?

639
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:50,378
So the stairway cigarette butts are yours?

640
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:51,602
Yes.

641
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:57,283
You made me lose face.
I don't want to speak to you.

642
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,423
Sit down.

643
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,492
Your father never smokes in the toilet.

644
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,461
Were you the one?

645
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,259
Where are the cigarettes?

646
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,731
You hid it under my bed?

647
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,904
Do you want your mummy to fire me?

648
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,277
Stupid boy.

649
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,686
Are there not enough
problems in your family?

650
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,092
I lost a lot of money.

651
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,931
I lost money on stocks.

652
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,094
When did you start dabbling in stocks?

653
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,004
How much did you lose?

654
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,133
It's okay, I'd rather not know.

655
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,016
How much?

656
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,322
Over a hundred thousand.

657
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,791
What were you thinking?

658
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,265
Get out.

659
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,335
I said get out!

660
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,612
<i>Ah Boy's birth date...</i>

661
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,650
won a small prize at the lottery.

662
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,454
Terry, let Ah Boy eat first.

663
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:47,927
I'm heading out.

664
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,704
Is it a boy or girl?

665
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:04,542
It should be a girl.

666
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,783
Good.

667
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,351
I have enough of boys at home.

668
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,463
What did the doctor say?

669
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,994
It's just a routine scanning.

670
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,437
What's this?

671
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,541
Nothing.

672
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,104
Are you really that busy?

673
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,350
I'll take you home.

674
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:45,868
Jiale, here.

675
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,144
Terry, take this. Just follow us and pray.

676
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:10,398
That's for Grandpa.

677
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:10,694
That's for Grandpa.

678
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,960
You can only have it later.

679
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,029
Grandpa isn't that petty.

680
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,515
Please, Grandpa.

681
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,584
I've given you my pet chicken.

682
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,747
Please help my teacher strike the lottery.

683
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,189
Ma'am.

684
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,658
Hurry UP-

685
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,230
What's wrong?

686
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,537
That's the problem with old cars.

687
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,704
Boy, get down and help push.

688
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:32,745
Careful.

689
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:36,414
Push.

690
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,850
Why isn't the car moving?

691
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,683
Use more strength.

692
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,885
Wait a minute.

693
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,669
Terry, do you drive?

694
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:56,662
Yes, Sir.

695
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,233
You drive.

696
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:22,797
Leng, get in the car.

697
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:23,638
Leng, get in the car.

698
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,405
<i>8-8-6-8.</i>

699
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,735
The second prize <i>is...</i>

700
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,839
7-7-S-1

701
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,242
And now for the first prize...

702
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:48,254
<i>0-2-3-8.</i>

703
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:17,976
Do you feel life is getting tougher?

704
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,951
The economy is in a crisis...

705
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,770
the government isn't helping,
and your family doesn't understand.

706
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:27,355
This is the worst crisis we are
experiencing in 10 years.

707
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,195
But what is a crisis?

708
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,760
When the situation gets dire...

709
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,391
that's when the most
opportunities emerge.

710
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,130
To those who are here, I'm sorry.

711
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,006
Because there is nothing
I can do to help you.

712
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:40,868
Why?

713
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,905
Because only YOU can help yourselves!

714
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,480
My parents passed away when I was 10.

715
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,916
From young I learnt to support myself.

716
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,628
I started my own business at <i>18...</i>

717
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,297
and made my first million at 21.

718
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:03,698
And made my first million at 21.

719
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:09,035
But one misstep caused me everything.

720
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:13,168
When I was 30, I became bankrupt.

721
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,638
My wife and son left me.

722
01:10:17,085 --> 01:10:18,646
But I didn't give up. I was undefeated.

723
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:21,411
But I didn't give up. I was undefeated.

724
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,052
Because I believe hope is within yourself.

725
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,385
If I can do it, so can you.

726
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,897
Madam, please stand.

727
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,945
You are shouldering a huge burden.

728
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:51,847
You are not one, but two.

729
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:54,782
You are not one, but two.

730
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,518
Do you feel you're under
immense pressure?

731
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,521
I can tell you are very troubled.

732
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,021
But always remember.

733
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,630
Hope is within yourself.

734
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,690
Hope is within yourself.

735
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,059
Repeat after me.

736
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,866
Hope is within yourself...

737
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:23,405
Say it louder.

738
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,046
Hope is within yourself.

739
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,007
Hope is within yourself.

740
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:29,506
Stand up.

741
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,847
Hope is within yourself.

742
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,684
My maid saw your maid at Lucky Plaza.

743
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:10,917
So what?

744
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,324
Your Auntie was working as a hairdresser.

745
01:12:13,557 --> 01:12:14,638
She must really love money.

746
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,460
Why would she need the extra money?

747
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,326
Doesn't your mother feed her?

748
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,831
Don't insult my Auntie Terry.

749
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:21,936
You think your Auntie
Terry really loves you?

750
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,564
She only loves you because
your mother pays her.

751
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,501
She is just a maid. Idiot!

752
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,990
Good afternoon, Chuan Shipping.

753
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:47,796
<i>Mrs Lim?</i>

754
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:48,763
<i>Mrs Lim?</i>

755
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,628
Oh, Mrs Lim Hwee Leng.

756
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,892
Hold on.

757
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,639
She's very busy at the moment.

758
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,708
She can't take this call.

759
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,872
Would you like to leave a message?

760
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:19,550
Hello?

761
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,156
Mr Lim? Sir isn't home.

762
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,446
Where's the boy?

763
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,381
Mrs Davie, here.

764
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,918
And you are?

765
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:46,616
Teresa.

766
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,015
Where are the parents?

767
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:49,656
I need to speak to the parents.

768
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,589
Sir and Ma'am are not free.
They are working.

769
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,095
Why did you ask the maid to come?

770
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,290
<i>I didn't, she...</i>

771
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,898
<i>- Mrs...
- Davie.</i>

772
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,023
Mrs Davie, can you please
tell me what happened?

773
01:13:59,168 --> 01:13:59,964
<i>This boy...</i>

774
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:01,827
I'm sorry, what's his name?

775
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,093
Lim Jiale.

776
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,771
This boy, Lim Jiale...

777
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,666
actually beat up his
classmate in the toilet.

778
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:10,611
That boy is now in hospital.

779
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:10,941
That boy is now in hospital.

780
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,208
Thank God he's alright.

781
01:14:13,806 --> 01:14:15,526
I've just managed to
convince his parents...

782
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,143
<i>to</i> not call the police.

783
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,421
But we have to expel him from our school.

784
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,956
Ma'am, you cannot expel him.

785
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,061
My boy is just 10 years old.

786
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:27,426
My boy is just 10 years old.

787
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,827
He's a very naughty boy...

788
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,695
but he's actually very smart.

789
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,234
He has the worst discipline
record in our school.

790
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,537
Mrs Davie, please.

791
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,637
Jiale, say sorry.

792
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,236
Sorry.

793
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:43,811
It's not about apologizing to me.

794
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,473
It's not about apologizing to me.

795
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,783
But I have to show the parents
that I'm doing something.

796
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:53,445
Ma'am, please don't expel my boy.

797
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,412
Terry, what are you doing?

798
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:56,713
That's his mother.

799
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:59,027
Good, finally you're here.

800
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:00,028
Go out and wait for me.

801
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:00,950
Go out and wait for me.

802
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:10,267
Mrs Lim, I don't know if you know
how serious this matter is.

803
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,756
Are you driving me to my grave?

804
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,317
Aren't you ashamed?

805
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,832
Why are you dressed like that?

806
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:48,105
Teresa, I'm his mother, not you.

807
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:12,459
We, the citizens of Singapore.

808
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:17,498
Pledge ourselves as one united people.

809
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:23,110
Regardless of race, language, or religion.

810
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:23,338
Regardless of race, language, or religion.

811
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:27,178
To build a democratic society.

812
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:30,808
Based on justice and equality.

813
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:38,820
So as to achieve happiness, prosperity
and progress for our nation.

814
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,040
Discipline...

815
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:55,977
<i>is</i> an integral part of our education.

816
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:56,672
<i>Is</i> an integral part of our education.

817
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:02,845
Knowledge without discipline
is of no value to society.

818
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,153
Today, I want to take this opportunity...

819
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,951
<i>to warn all students...</i>

820
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,560
that fighting and all
unorderly behavior...

821
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,927
that fighting and all
unorderly behavior...

822
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:19,631
is not tolerated in our school.

823
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,170
Stand there.

824
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,798
Hands on the table.

825
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,477
Bear with it. The principal is watching.

826
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,571
Bear with it. The principal is watching.

827
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,194
Isn't it painful?

828
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,430
<i>No.</i>

829
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:02,443
Let's see if you still want to be naughty.

830
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,241
Let's see if you still want to be naughty.

831
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:17,956
Come on.

832
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,027
Carry me.

833
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,358
Carry me.

834
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:24,127
- You're a big boy already.
- But my butt hurts.

835
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,631
Don't touch my breast, you dirty boy.

836
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,360
Your hair really has a smell.

837
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:30,471
Nonsense.

838
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,246
How old is he?

839
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,913
Almost 12 months.

840
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,548
You left the baby and
went away to work?

841
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:56,491
So why did your mother get a stranger
to look after her son?

842
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,691
Your mother.

843
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:00,699
Shut up.

844
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:07,498
Okay, wear your pants.

845
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:15,209
Sorry.

846
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,099
Don't let my colleagues see that.

847
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,330
Why have you come to pick me today?

848
01:20:13,263 --> 01:20:14,743
I have something to discuss with you.

849
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:16,335
I have something to discuss with you.

850
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,872
What is it?

851
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,884
I'm thinking of scrapping the car.

852
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,345
Can't you sell it?

853
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:27,618
Who would buy such an old car?

854
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,820
Look how you're coughing,
I've told you to stop.

855
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,397
How much you think our ﬂat is worth?

856
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:42,565
Are you nuts?

857
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,037
You're thinking of selling
at a time like this?

858
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,240
Where are you going?

859
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,986
I'll reverse.

860
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,799
Leng, aren't you coming for lunch?

861
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:24,207
You all go ahead, I have work to do.

862
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:50,464
Hello.

863
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,836
I signed up for a 10-day course.

864
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:55,306
I was told you would contact me.

865
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,834
Wrong number?

866
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,780
That can't be right. The number's
from your brochure.

867
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,171
Hello?

868
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:28,032
Hope is within yourself.

869
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,546
Shall we not kill the last chicken?

870
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,848
I think I want to keep it.

871
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,790
Then you better learn to take care of it.

872
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:08,883
Who's there?

873
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:40,904
Hope is within yourself.

874
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,254
Not sleeping yet?

875
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,157
What's with your leg?

876
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:56,123
I hurt it accidentally.

877
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:07,207
Only people that stupid would
fall for something like that.

878
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,643
That's how stupid I am.

879
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:36,603
Are you okay?

880
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:28,015
I lost my sales job.

881
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:40,395
I've been waiting for you to tell me.

882
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,913
Are you on day or night shift tomorrow?

883
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:58,652
You need to wash your uniform?

884
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:01,948
Nope.

885
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:03,990
I quit.

886
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:40,158
Can you do it?

887
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,827
I'm always the bad cop
and you the good cop.

888
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:45,626
I won't do it.

889
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,068
How should I put it across?

890
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:55,173
I don't care. Figure it out yourself.

891
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,483
Terry, are you sleeping?

892
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,183
Can we talk?

893
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:15,789
Yes, Ma'am.

894
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,140
Do you want water?

895
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:32,039
No thanks, Ma'am.

896
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:54,694
I don't know how to say this.

897
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,268
<i>But...</i>

898
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:01,869
I understand.

899
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,051
We have something to tell you.

900
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,263
Auntie Terry is going back soon.

901
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:34,834
Are you listening?

902
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,675
We don't have much money left.

903
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,139
To hire a maid...

904
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,142
What's wrong with you?

905
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:22,247
Kids are not allowed here. Get out.

906
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:23,483
I'm buying it for my father.

907
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:25,216
No, you can't. Go away.

908
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:31,488
Uncle, can you help me?

909
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,532
Can you help me buy 4D?

910
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,403
Help me buy lottery.

911
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:40,940
Can you help me buy?
I'll give you money, please.

912
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,008
Please help me.

913
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,369
Okay.

914
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:04,158
Where are you going?

915
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:23,039
Now announcing the top prizes...

916
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:25,852
<i>Third prize...</i>

917
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:29,413
s-z-o-a.

918
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:32,348
Second prize...

919
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:36,292
3-4-5-O

920
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:38,960
<i>First prize...</i>

921
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:43,833
O-2-3-4

922
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,907
Still not sleeping?

923
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:24,943
No, not yet.

924
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:38,988
Can I have a cigarette?

925
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:44,158
I didn't know you smoke too.

926
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,494
Boy, are you coming down?
We're leaving.

927
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,916
Airport parking is expensive.
I'll wait here.

928
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:04,838
Be good.

929
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,478
Don't act like this, please.

930
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:13,013
Look at me, you're a big boy now.

931
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:18,290
Please.

932
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:21,486
Are you crazy?

933
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:26,693
Ignore him. Just go.

934
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:39,138
Learn to take care of yourself.

935
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:40,336
Terry.

936
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,533
You can't smoke here.

937
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:02,292
Sorry.

938
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,450
This is for you.

939
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:23,373
Do you want a drink?

940
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:27,048
You want a drink?

941
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,227
What are you listening to?
