00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:44,082
¶ I see trees of green ¶

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,494
¶ Red roses too ¶

3
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,829
¶ I see them bloom ¶

4
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,233
¶ For me and you ¶

5
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:58,502
¶ And I think to myself ¶

6
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,307
¶ What a wonderful world ¶

7
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:10,748
¶ I see skies of blue ¶

8
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:13,449
¶ And clouds of white ¶

9
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:17,722
¶ The bright blessed day ¶

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,285
¶ The dark sacred night ¶

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,393
¶ And I think to myself ¶

12
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:29,872
¶ What a wonderful world ¶

13
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,238
¶ Yes ¶

14
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:38,145
¶ I think to myself ¶

15
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,583
¶ What a wonderful ¶

16
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,880
Yes, dude!

17
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,619
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What are you doing?

18
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,492
I'm taking the most incredible dump of all time, man.

19
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,155
You couldn't wait till I got out of the shower?

20
00:01:54,197 --> 00:02:00,399
May I remind you that we both just ate 30
burgers and four large orders of fries?

21
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,672
Don't worry, in a little bit, I'm sure it'll hit you too.

22
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,938
It may be. But I'm gonna wait till you get out of the shower.

23
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:11,037
Well, don't wait too long. We've got
to leave for the airport in an hour.

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,069
Ooh, that burns.

25
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:15,141
- An hour?
- Hey, and, Roldy?

26
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,580
Yeah?

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,349
Nice pubes.

28
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,948
Asshole, get out of here right now.

29
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:25,688
- Wipe and leave. Wipe and leave now!
- Dude, this thing is huge!

30
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,787
I think it still has cheese on it.

31
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,967
¶ Ooh wee ¶

32
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,332
¶ Ooh wee ¶

33
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,343
¶ La, la, la, la, la, la-la ¶

34
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,675
¶ When I step into the party all the ladies wanna know ¶

35
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,908
¶ I'm hangin' with the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost ¶

36
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:48,075
¶ I can tell you what they say, haters, if you wanna know ¶

37
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:50,449
¶ They say ooh wee ¶

38
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,784
¶ When I'm rollin' my Mercedes all the ladies wanna roll ¶

39
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:55,052
¶ Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo ¶

40
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,616
¶ If you actin' menace I can pick another ho ¶

41
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,926
¶ Ooh wee, ooh wee ¶

00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,233
- ¶ Ooh wee ¶

00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,531
¶ In the middle of the summer, or even 20 below ¶

46
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,840
¶ They say ooh wee ¶

47
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:18,506
- ¶ Ooh wee ¶
- ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la-la ¶

48
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:30,889
¶ Ooh wee ¶

49
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:31,951
¶ Aiyo, aiyo ¶

50
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,962
¶ My game's here to party
just to cut up a rug ¶

51
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,429
¶ Don't make me have to cut up a thug ¶

52
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,434
¶ Now play something for me, DJ,
'cause there's nothin' but love ¶

53
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,993
¶ Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub ¶

54
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:55,279
¶ Ooh wee ¶

55
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,813
Dude. Oh, my Go... I just realized something.

56
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:58,843
What?

57
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,652
Maria's gonna think I'm a stalker, man.
I'm following her to Amsterdam.

58
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:04,956
Dude, relax. I have a med school
interview in ten minutes.

59
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,757
You don't see me freaking out.

60
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:09,026
Don't worry, man, she'll be psyched to see you.

61
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,692
Oh, psyched? You think she's gonna be psyched?

62
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,860
Totes, dude. Why wouldn't she be?

63
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:14,237
So how does this work?

64
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:17,570
We just... we show up in Amsterdam
and we start calling hotels...

65
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,507
and ask if they have a Maria staying there?

66
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,033
- I don't even know her last name.
- Dude, it's totally cool.

67
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,909
We're definitely gonna find her.

68
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,743
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be...

69
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:28,546
Sir, I need you to step aside, please.
Let me search you.

70
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,381
- Did I beep?
- No, you didn't beep.

71
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,512
Just a random security check.

72
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:34,022
If you could just step aside, please?
Just over here.

73
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,547
- Random, huh?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,220
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?

75
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,889
Kumar, just do what the guy says.

76
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,000
Sir, it's our job as airport security to search
for all possible weapons or illegal drugs.

77
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,969
So just because of the color of my skin,
you assume that I have drugs on me?

78
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,597
- No, he's...
- What are you, a racist?

79
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,768
Racist? Dude, I'm black.

80
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,278
He's black. He's not a racist.

81
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,974
Please, dude, you're barely even brown.

82
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,880
No, he didn't mean that.

83
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,646
Compared to me, you look like Matthew Perry.

84
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,653
Hey, who you calling Matthew Perry, bitch?

85
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:07,656
I'm calling you Matthew Perry,
you Matthew Perry-looking bitch!

86
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,681
No, there's nobody here who is Matthew Perry. No one!

87
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,249
What is going on here?

88
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:16,230
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks that I have
illegal narcotics on me because I'm a minority.

89
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:20,192
This is textbook racial profiling and I'd be more than
happy to call the ACLU or the government...

90
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,704
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

91
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:25,605
- You can move along.
- I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt Perry.

92
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,305
Hey, what are you doing?

93
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,312
What do you mean, what am I doing?
He called me Matthew Perry.

94
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:31,643
Well, you look like Matthew Perry.

95
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,512
- He's white!
- So what?

96
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:35,881
Why does everything have to become
a huge argument with you, man?

97
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,116
'Cause this is America, dude and as long as I have my
freedom of speech, no one's gonna shut me up.

98
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,680
Kumar?

99
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:45,854
Roldy?

100
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,955
- Vanessa.
- Oh, my God!

101
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:52,365
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you. l...

102
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:54,528
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

103
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,662
Hey.

104
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:59,141
God, it's been forever.
What are you guys doing?

105
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,643
We're actually on our way to Amsterdam.

106
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:02,871
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,641
Well, you guys haven't changed.

108
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,740
You have. You look amazing.
Your hair is diff...

109
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:10,718
- Doesn't she look amazing?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,846
Yeah, you look great.
You look awesome. Sorry.

111
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,881
What am I even saying?
You look different and...

112
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,520
- Kumar Patel, you're flustered.
- Little bit.

113
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:25,858
So, what's up with you? You still dating
the Abercrombie-wearing douchebag?

114
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,029
Actually, it's Brooks Brothers.

115
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,039
Colton! How are you, buddy?

116
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:32,665
- Good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

117
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,471
And we're not dating anymore.

118
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,876
No. We... are getting married.

119
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,747
Congratulations, you guys.

120
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,307
- You're fucking getting married?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:45,286
- When?
- Next week.

122
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,990
It's going to be a perfect day.

123
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:50,458
I mean, that's assuming we get those
Stargazer lilies for the bouquets.

124
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,484
This florist has been a complete nightmare.

125
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,428
Fucking assholes.

126
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,227
Colton's practically planning the whole wedding all by himself.

127
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,531
So, Rold, Brewster Keegan letting you
off the leash for a little vay-cay?

128
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,596
I own that place now, Colton.

129
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,436
Thank you so much for the hook-up.

130
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:08,841
Hey, I ran into Todd, at Whitaker's, of course.

131
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:11,346
He told me you got a job working for the government.

132
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,814
Yeah! Yeah, President Bush and my dad
were in the same fraternity.

133
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,180
- Oh, that's right.
- Oh, Jesus.

134
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:17,208
Yeah, yeah, when he gave my dad that
appointment at the Defense Department...

135
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,346
- I became his right-hand man.
- Douche.

136
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,548
The President's supposed to be at our wedding...

137
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,683
- but you know how busy he is.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,522
Sounds like an incredible job, man.

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,028
Hey, you really got some major connections to the top.

140
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:29,531
If you ever need anything, I'm your man.

141
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,795
- Thank you so much, buddy.
- Anytime.

142
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,563
This guy's the best.

143
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:36,163
- So, sweetheart, we should get going.
- Yes.

144
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,867
- Good to see you guys again.
- Congratulations again.

145
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:41,274
- Thank you. Take care, thank you.
- It's so nice.

146
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

147
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:00,493
Dude, I can't believe they're getting married.
We've only been broken up two years.

148
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:02,962
Plus that dude has date-rape face.

149
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,092
I don't even know what that is.

150
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,625
One who possesses the face of a date rapist.

151
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,969
Right. Listen...

152
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,475
I'm sorry, bro.

153
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,137
But we are going to Amsterdam.
Come on.

154
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:19,341
This is true. This is true, Roldy.

155
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,509
¶ Ooh wee ¶

00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:28,487
- Man, this is so not like me.
- Yeah.

157
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:32,016
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
Better, faster, stronger.

158
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,722
Nice.

159
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:38,063
Man, I've never used a sick day before.
I'm taking a whole week off from work here, man.

160
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,866
And in less than eight hours, we're gonna be in Amsterdam.

161
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,395
- This is nuts. This is nuts.
- I know, dude.

162
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,431
It's gonna be exactly like Euro Trip, only it's not gonna suck.

163
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:50,036
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.

164
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:32,785
Dude. Dude, this chick's giving me
such a boner, it's awesome.

165
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,756
Thank you. You ruined the moment.

166
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,293
She's all yours, buddy.

167
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,227
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

168
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:41,957
No, that's...

169
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,658
Enjoy.

170
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,306
Just a minute.

171
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,812
Fuc...

172
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,439
Hey, hey.

173
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:01,476
Let me in.

174
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,781
What are you doing?
I'm taking a piss, asshole!

175
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,947
- Yeah.
- Yo!

176
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,457
I'm not joining the mile-high club with you.

177
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,483
What about the really high club?

178
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:14,823
- Are you retarded?
- No.

179
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,764
You brought weed on the fucking airplane?

180
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,029
- Yep.
- What the fuck?

181
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,036
Wait a second. You were giving that security guard shit.

182
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,061
Yeah. How else was I supposed to get past him?

183
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:25,869
By not bringing drugs on an airplane?

184
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,777
- Look... What are you doing? What is this?
- You'll see.

185
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,519
Harold Lee, I would like to introduce
you to an invention of mine.

186
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,686
Meet the smokeless bong.

187
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,629
- You made this?
- You know, I did.

188
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:52,460
When you were slaving away at work I was actually
being a productive member of society.

189
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,665
- Yeah, that's really productive.
- Let me show you how it works.

190
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:59,265
So you take a little weed...

191
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:03,211
put it in the bowl right here and light
it just like a normal bong, OK?

192
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,076
Now here's the truly genius part.

193
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:10,711
Inside this mechanism, I have actually
made a little tiny, tiny fan...

194
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:16,320
and some disinfectant powder, OK, it works sort of like a
deodorizer so that anything it expunges smells like Lysol.

195
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:17,985
- Put it away.
- No, dude.

196
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,018
Can you not wait till we get to Amsterdam?

197
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,724
It's the weed capital of the world!

198
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,792
- No.
- Put the bong away!

199
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:27,666
- Take the inaugural hit, dude.
- No!

200
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:28,795
Come on, man.

201
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:32,035
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- Put it away. Put the frickin' bong away.

202
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Turb...

203
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,188
Terrorist!

204
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,221
Roldy?

205
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,592
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
- No, ma'am, not a terrorist.

206
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,496
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.

207
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,000
He said he got a bomb!

208
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,929
No, people, it's a water pipe for tobacco.

209
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,339
No, no, no, it's not a bomb. It's just a bong.

210
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,375
Poison gas!

211
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:25,785
It's marijuana! Marijuana!

212
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,025
You picked the wrong plane, you terrorist fuck!

213
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:31,032
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

214
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:35,469
There are three air marshals on board. Three!

215
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,099
We are not terrorists!
Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb.

216
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:40,938
Shut up!

217
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,138
I got this one!

218
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:44,509
- Roldy?
- Please don't!

219
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,481
I am in a great amount of pain!

220
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,714
Everybody relax. Just calm down.
Everything is under control.

221
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:56,020
Tell 'em to turn the plane around.
These two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.

222
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:23,544
Secretary Fox. Glad you could make it.

223
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,577
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack of this magnitude?

224
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,852
Not a fuckin' chance.

225
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,987
Who are these people?

226
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,329
Representatives of the different intelligence agencies.

227
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,858
I assume Secretary Whitmore's coming?

228
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:45,602
Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip in Glacier Bay.

229
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,233
I'm in charge while he's gone.

230
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,710
Well, shouldn't he be alerted?

231
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:55,047
Isn't this issue of more importance than an ice fishing trip?

232
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,314
Who are you again?

233
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:04,553
Dr. John Beecher, Vice Chairman of the NSA.

234
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,960
Yeah, well, listen, Dr... Dipshit.

235
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,324
You've obviously never been ice fishing before.

236
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,966
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating.

237
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:20,703
The last thing anyone would want while
fishing for pike is to be interrupted.

238
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,540
Now back off...

239
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,911
and let me do my job.

240
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,318
What's up with the guy with the weird eyes?

241
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:42,956
He handicapped or something?

242
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,989
We believe he's of Korean descent.

243
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,469
My God.

244
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:55,599
North Korea and al-Qaeda workin' together.

245
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,407
This is bigger than I thought.

246
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,948
You couldn't wait?

247
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,678
You couldn't fucking wait?

248
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,380
We were about to have all the legal weed we wanted.

249
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:08,686
You know, in Amsterdam, where we were going!

250
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,470
Thought you could get away with this, huh?

251
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:39,512
You thought that after 9/11 our national
security was a joke, huh?

252
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:41,981
Well...

253
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:46,087
guess what?

254
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:48,324
What?

255
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,759
We knew you fuckers would be back.

256
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:53,961
- Holy shit!
- But we're Americans, man.

257
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:56,766
- We love America. We love America!
- Very much.

258
00:15:56,805 --> 00:16:01,534
That's a convenient thing to say after you try
and blow up a plane filled with Americans!

259
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:02,805
- No.
- No, we didn't do...

260
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,370
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.

261
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:07,245
My idiot friend here brought marijuana...

262
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:08,772
- on the plane.
- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

263
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:12,878
Zip it, Hello Kitty. OK? I know your
operation's funded through drugs.

264
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,786
No. This is typical government bullshit, sir. l...

265
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:16,586
- Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. Shut up!
- l...

266
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,493
- No, I'm trying to explain it! Harold!
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!

267
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:24,959
Do we have the right to make a phone call?

268
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,762
Yeah. Yeah!

269
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:31,170
I'm sorry. You want rights now.

270
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,868
You want freedoms right now.

271
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,774
Is it time? Is it freedom o'clock?

272
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,307
- Guess what.
- What?

273
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:47,281
Where you guys are going, they have
never even heard of rights.

274
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,458
Well, where are we going?

275
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:01,567
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!

276
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:04,405
I'm an innocent man.

277
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,407
I donate blood.

278
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,343
And toys for tots.

279
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,744
And now I'm in Guantánamo Bay.

280
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,878
See why I'm against paying taxes?

281
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,684
Hey! Hey.

282
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:22,854
Fuck you!

283
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:24,859
Dude, calm down, OK?

284
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:28,556
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink. There's a toilet.

285
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,565
The pillow actually looks pretty comfortable.

286
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:36,097
OK. You don't speak to me, ever.

287
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,400
- Ever.
- OK.

288
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,669
- No! Shut up!
- OK.

289
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:43,575
So what are you guys in here for?

290
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:50,914
For giving the United States a taste of their own medicine.

291
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:56,017
- You guys are real terrorists?
- Some call us terrorists.

292
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:58,390
Others call us heroes.

293
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:02,022
Screw that. You think you guys are
heroes for killing innocent people?

294
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,191
It's 'cause of assholes like you that
we're even in this fucking place...

295
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,632
you fucking cowards!

296
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,500
Well, maybe if the people in your
country stopped eating donuts...

297
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:13,740
and started realizing what your government is doing
to the world assholes like us wouldn't exist.

298
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:16,642
- Fuck you! Donuts are awesome!
- They're delicious.

299
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,975
You like donuts?

300
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,244
Well, wait till you see what they make you eat in here.

301
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,444
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?

302
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:25,077
l...

303
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,816
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?

304
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,215
What's a cockmeat sandwich?

305
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:32,921
You're about to find out.

306
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:38,226
Right about now. Sucker.

307
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,668
All right, cockmeat sandwich time.
You know the drill.

308
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,403
What about them? They just got here!

309
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:52,837
Big Bob's taking care of them.

310
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,349
- Big Bob.
- Big Bob?

311
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,750
I hope you like donuts.

312
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:00,846
Let's go to work. Hey, listen, guys, enjoy.

313
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,487
Holy shit.

314
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,721
Oh, yeah, that's it.

315
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:11,291
- This is not good.
- No, Kumar, it is not good.

316
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,597
- I've never had to suck a dick before.
- Me neither.

317
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,626
I bet it sucks dick.

318
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,267
Shit, dude.

319
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,276
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

320
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,438
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Come on.

321
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:27,175
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

322
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:28,546
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

323
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,448
- Please don't let it be Big Bob.
- I'm Big Bob.

324
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:33,454
- Fuck.
- Yes, you are.

325
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,948
You boys ready for your cockmeat sandwich?

326
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:40,116
No?

327
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,062
Well, you better get hungry real fast...

328
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,897
'cause I got a whole lot of sandwich waitin' for ya.

329
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:48,496
Holy shit!

330
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,734
- All right, let's get goin'.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Big Bob...

331
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,300
I got to ask you a question before this all goes down.

332
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:58,245
- All the guards in Guantánamo are gay?
- Fuck, no!

333
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,874
Ain't nothing gay about getting your dick sucked!

334
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,749
You're the ones that's gay for suckin' my dick!

335
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,446
- What?
- In fact...

336
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:09,014
creeps me out just bein' around you fags.

337
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,490
- But...
- All right.

338
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,720
- Wait...
- Get down on your knees...

339
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:14,456
- and open your mouths.
- Please, Big Bob.

340
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:15,690
Why don't you just kick our ass instead?

341
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,926
- Get on your fucking knees!
- All right. All right.

342
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,732
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
- You go first, dude.

343
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,829
Hope you boys like extra mayo.

344
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,602
- Jesus, Kumar.
- Oh, I hate you so much!

345
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,074
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

346
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,544
God, his dick smells like shit, dude.

347
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,080
Holy shit!

348
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:42,687
- What the hell happened?
- That terrorist fuck bit my dick!

349
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:49,559
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait a second!

350
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,964
Should we?
What if they kill us out there?

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,661
They're gonna fucking make us suck their dicks if we don't.

352
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,101
We're gonna die in here. Come on.

353
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,433
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

354
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,977
- Shit. Shit.
- Fuck. Fuck.

355
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,070
- Shit. Shit.
- Fuck. Fuck.

356
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,081
- Oh, shit! Get out!
- Fuck!

357
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:09,379
Oh, shit. Shit.

358
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,908
Door, door.

359
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,250
Look, look, look.

360
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:18,919
What the fuck is he doing?

361
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,202
We've got to go now, now, now, now, now!

362
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:38,646
It smells like burnt asshole.

363
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,118
I can't fucking believe this.

364
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,177
Fuck!

365
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,359
My wrist is swelling, man!

366
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,362
- Shut up.
- We're gonna die in a jungle!

367
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,954
- Shut up!
- Fuck!

368
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:59,831
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.

369
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,435
- What?
- OK. Fuck.

370
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:04,962
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?

371
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,504
All right.

372
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:10,033
Hey, look, look!

373
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,511
Excuse me.

374
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:18,479
You guys going to America?

375
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,748
<i>Si, vamos.</i>

376
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,688
Yes, we're going.

377
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,190
Thank you.

378
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,283
<i>- Si, vamos.
- Vamos, vamos.</i>

379
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,383
I'm telling you, Jorge...

380
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:30,463
the first thing you have to do when you get to
America buy a device called TiVo, OK?

381
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:34,334
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular
programming I promise you that.

382
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,337
And now, how about you focus?

383
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,635
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.

384
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:41,506
We don't have wallets. We don't
have any ID. We've got nothing.

385
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:45,240
Well, I figure we're gonna land
somewhere around Miami, right?

386
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,441
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.

387
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,916
- Who do we know that... Raza.
- Yeah.

388
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,044
We gotta go see Raza.

389
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,851
<i>- Adios.
- Hasta luego.</i>

390
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,825
- Thanks again.
- What nice people.

391
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:00,225
Man, South Florida here we are.

392
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,730
OK. So, now how do we get to Raza's?

393
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,698
The professional way.
We walk. Let's go.

394
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,200
- Walk?
- Yeah.

395
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,225
So I guess Raza's...

396
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,431
- We'll find it, we'll find it.
- thataway. Yeah.

397
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,837
<i>¶ Dale aso, papi ¶</i>

398
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,704
<i>¶ Tócame ¶</i>

399
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:16,439
<i>¶ Ay ¶</i>

400
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,207
<i>¶ Papi ¶</i>

401
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,043
<i>¶ Ay ¶</i>

402
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,844
<i>¶ Papi ¶</i>

403
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:22,975
<i>¶ Ay ¶</i>

404
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:26,920
- Wow, Raza's place is pretty sweet.
- Kinda ghetto for Miami.

405
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,013
<i>¶ Para abajo ¶</i>

406
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,456
<i>¶ Toca, toca, toca, toca, toca ¶</i>

407
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,293
- Hi.
- Hey.

408
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,824
Y'all aren't here to complain about the noise, are you?

409
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,969
No. We're not... here to complain about the noise.

410
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,531
We're...

411
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:51,305
We are here to see...

412
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,644
- What is his name? We're here...
- Vagina.

413
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,049
No, we're here to see Raza.

414
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:59,315
OK. Follow me.

415
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,912
Thank you, ma'am.

416
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:04,423
We'll follow... you, I guess.

417
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,256
¶ Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk ¶

418
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:08,159
¶ She got it, she got it ¶

419
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,663
¶ Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk ¶

420
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,689
¶ She said, "Boy, go ahead" ¶

421
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,724
¶ As long as I don't touch it ¶

422
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:17,465
¶ I said, "Now, why the hell would I wanna interrupt it?" ¶

423
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:18,494
Hey.

424
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:21,435
- Very patriotic of you.
- Thank you.

425
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,579
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

426
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:29,045
- Hey, Raza!
- What?

427
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:30,312
What's up?

428
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:31,683
- Kumar and Roldy?
- What's up, man?

429
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,348
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.

430
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,947
What are you guys doing here?

431
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,653
Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?

432
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,160
- Hey, no, no, question number one...
- It's kind of a long story. l...

433
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,856
- what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?

434
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,364
There's exposed vagina all over your house.

435
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,765
Yeah. That was my idea.

436
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:50,464
I don't know about you guys,
I'm sick of all the hype over topless.

437
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,905
Really? I always liked toplessness. That's...

438
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:53,930
- That's just me.
- Yeah? Well, I'm starting...

439
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:57,570
the bottomless trend.
Hence, the bottomless party.

440
00:24:57,612 --> 00:24:58,601
So what are you guys doing in South Beach?

441
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,740
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.

442
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:02,511
- Where are you going?
- Bang bang, buddy.

443
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,882
Listen. I'm really sorry to bother you with this.

444
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,580
- You all right?
- Not really.

445
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:12,690
They were locked up for less than an hour,
and they already escaped?

446
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,560
Damn it. Make sure the press doesn't get wind of this.

447
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,565
Don't need the public thinking we're some two-bit operation.

448
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,588
Got it, sir.

449
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,498
It must have been either al-Qaeda or
North Korea who broke 'em up.

450
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:22,127
Find out if they have any relatives in the country.

451
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,196
You probably should have done that in the first place.

452
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:35,047
Do you have a problem with the way
I'm running the show, Beecher?

453
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,415
I'm just saying that...

454
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:41,286
I've looked through the files on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.

455
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:42,880
They were both born and raised in New Jersey.

456
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:44,755
Other than a couple of traffic tickets, they're clean.

457
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,125
Right. That's why they just broke out of prison.

458
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:50,029
But they... lt's not even clear that they should
have been there in the first place.

459
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,056
Shut your...

460
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,905
You see this cute, little white girl, Beecher?

461
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,273
Yeah.

462
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,246
Do you want her to get raped and murdered?

463
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,638
Of course not.

464
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:11,413
You sure? 'Cause this is America.

465
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:15,683
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.

466
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:19,160
Then stop fucking with me.

467
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:24,531
This is serious.

468
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,467
She's adorable.

469
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:31,366
So you guys are fucking fugitives?

470
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,636
It's just it's Kumar's fault.

471
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,575
If we get out of this...

472
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,977
the chances of us remaining friends is highly...

473
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:40,207
highly... boobies. Yeah.

474
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:42,273
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

475
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,785
Put that back on. And keep it on.

476
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:46,946
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?

477
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,081
Yo. What are you guys talking about?

478
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:51,149
Roldy was just letting me in on your situation.

479
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,126
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.

480
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:56,893
What about that fuckin' time we had to cover for you
lie to your ex-girlfriend about how you got crabs?

481
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:58,091
You owe us, man.

482
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,430
- Yeah, that's right.
- What?

483
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,628
- OK, that was a long time ago.
- I love crabs.

484
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,466
Speaking of ex-girlfriends...

485
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:05,234
isn't yours getting married or something?

486
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:07,207
How does everybody know about this except for me?

487
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:08,675
Wait.

488
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,838
Colton! Colton Graham can help us out.

489
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,245
- No! Fuck that!
- Yes!

490
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,977
No doubt. If anyone could clear your names, it's him.

491
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:17,712
No, I'm sorry.
That dickweed is not helping us.

492
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,686
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?

493
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,748
Not anymore. But the wedding is at his
family's estate in Hewitt, Texas.

494
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:28,383
But you don't want to bother them when they're
doing their whole wedding thing, right?

495
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:33,233
You know, that actually might be our only hope.

496
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:36,533
Fuck! How do we get there? We can't go
to the airport. They're looking for us.

497
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,163
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?

498
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:41,937
But first... y'all got to get in the spirit of the party.

499
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:45,173
- What do you mean, spirit of...
- What do you think I mean?

500
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,074
- What about you?
- Me? I've been in the spirit.

501
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:52,148
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God, dude!

502
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,415
Oh, my God!

503
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:55,285
- Love your dickdo, Raza.
- Yeah. Drink it in.

504
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:58,520
- What the fuck?
- That looks like Osama bin Laden's beard.

505
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,790
I know, right? All right, boys.

506
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,592
Your turn. Let 'em dangle.

507
00:28:04,098 --> 00:28:06,066
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.

508
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,227
Count of three?

509
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,964
One.

510
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:11,494
Two, three.

511
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:16,106
Your cocks are awesome, man!

512
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:18,476
That's not even necessary.

513
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,640
- Would you please...
- Oh, my dick!

514
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,877
¶ My dick cost a late-night fee ¶

515
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,044
¶ Your dick got the HIV ¶

516
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:27,646
¶ My dick plays on the double feature screen ¶

517
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:29,987
¶ Your dick went straight to DVD ¶

518
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:32,584
¶ My dick bigger than a bridge ¶

519
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,925
¶ Your dick look like a little kid's ¶

520
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,864
¶ My dick large like the Chargers, the whole team ¶

521
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,662
¶ Your shit look like you 14 ¶

522
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:42,135
¶ My dick locked in a cage, right ¶

523
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,297
¶ Your dick suffer from stage fright ¶

524
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:46,967
¶ My dick so hot it's stolen ¶

525
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,499
¶ Your dick look like Gary Coleman ¶

526
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:52,035
¶ My dick pink and big ¶

527
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,278
- This car is frickin' sweet.
- Yeah, yeah, it's sweet.

528
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,841
'Cause we're fugitives.

529
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:00,878
Driving a yellow convertible with the
top down, dressed like assholes!

530
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:03,914
Yo. Yo. Yo, look, he has one of these things.

531
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,949
- Would you put that down?
- No, you can hook up to the Internet.

532
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,656
You can play Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
on it. King Hippo's going down.

533
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,561
Put that away. Put that away.

534
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:14,398
I can't believe you can even think about
playing games at a time like this, man.

535
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:17,063
You realize what would happen if our
parents found out about this?

536
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,472
You have sent our sons to Guantánamo Bay?

537
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,669
This is an outrage!

538
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:27,874
You Arabs think you can just mix in with our peaceful
society and we're not gonna find you, huh?

539
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,350
I am not Arab! I am Indian!

540
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:34,879
Look, Chief. I'm not here to argue seblantics with you, OK?

541
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:36,982
I'm here to save lives.

542
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,119
Ask the Lees what they know about
their son's terrorist activity.

543
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,739
Look, we have been American citizens for over 40 years.

544
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:57,267
Now, frankly, I find this very offensive.

545
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:03,817
They're using some sort of dialect I've never heard before.

546
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:07,014
But I'm pretty sure he said something
about going on the offensive.

547
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,155
Tell them we know what their son is up to...

548
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:15,060
and if they don't cooperate, he could be sentenced to death.

549
00:30:16,664 --> 00:30:18,859
Hit 'em. Yeah.

550
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:24,771
We know what he said!

551
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:27,798
Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys.

552
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,709
I'm a pretty good translator.

553
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,511
It's total gibberish.

554
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:38,775
They may be trying to stonewall us.

555
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:41,986
Are you sure you speak Korean, Jack?

556
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:43,012
You speak Korean?

557
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:44,854
You're not fucking with Daddy, are you?

558
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:48,953
Do you have a masters in romantic Korean literature?

559
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:51,022
Because I do...

560
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:52,623
and I'm offended.

561
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:54,824
Good enough for me.

562
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,897
Look, excuse me...

563
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:02,741
we're not looking to hurt your sons but
we just wanna know where they are.

564
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,972
Do you know if they know anybody in Florida?

565
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:09,480
Their friend Raza Syed lives in Miami.

566
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,551
But why would they be there?

567
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,349
He's supposed to be in medical school.

568
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:18,553
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!

569
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:23,755
These fuckers are goin' down.

570
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,698
Dead. Or alive.

571
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:29,032
Tell them that in your fake ching-chong language.

572
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:32,537
Shut up! You're an idiot.

573
00:31:34,108 --> 00:31:37,168
I don't know what you're saying, buddy...

574
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:38,200
but fuck you.

575
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:39,338
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?

576
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,575
- Listen, no, sit down.
- Fuck me?

577
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:51,752
Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama.

578
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,191
Wow, we actually get a first-hand look at the South, huh?

579
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:58,790
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip through the South, OK?

580
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,324
This was supposed to be the most romantic week of my life.

581
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:04,065
Remember that? Before you fucked it up?
You remember that?

582
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:06,300
Just chill, OK? We'll be out of this situation.

583
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,537
You'll be up in Maria's guts in no time, all right?

584
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:13,536
Hey. She's not some skank, man.

585
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:17,779
I've never felt this way about anyone before, really.

586
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,419
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?

587
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:23,754
It's not like you would understand, so...

588
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,896
¶ I want to be happy ¶

589
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:40,732
¶ I want to be happy, just like... ¶

590
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:44,836
Excuse me, please.
Will you turn that off? This is a library.

591
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,246
What a fucking chode.

592
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:51,274
Thank you, come again!

593
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,752
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, my God.

594
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:03,954
You know, the whole reason people come to
the stacks is for some peace and...

595
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,524
quiet.

596
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,400
Look, I know, I'm sorry. I hate it
when people disturb me here too.

597
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:12,565
It's just this fucking calculus final is killing me.

598
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:18,010
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.

599
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:22,175
- You're actually very close. May I?
- Yeah.

600
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:24,013
Excuse me.

601
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,784
I touched your breast.

602
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:33,293
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

603
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,898
You just go...

604
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,835
Wow. You're good at this.

605
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,132
Thanks.

606
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:46,868
What did you, like, take calculus in high school or something?

607
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:49,900
Actually, my dad taught it to me in sixth grade.

608
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,469
What, are you like Doogie Howser?

609
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:55,744
No. Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.

610
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,274
I love that show.

611
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:00,914
What are you working on there?

612
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,856
This is just a poem for my creative writing class.

613
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,223
It's like...

614
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,057
- "The Square Root Of Three"?
- No, no, I'm sorry...

615
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:10,893
- "A poem of love by Kumar Patel."
- I need this.

616
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:12,991
- Hey, let me read it.
- No, no.

617
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:15,264
- Why?
- Because it's lame.

618
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,327
Then read it to me.

619
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,363
There's no way I'm letting you see me in
that light. Good luck with your calculus.

620
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,778
Come on, don't be embarrassed. You know,
a lot of girls find intelligence sexy.

621
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,805
Look, I'm not even gonna be showing
this to my professor, all right?

622
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,044
That's why I'm so stressed out right now.

623
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:33,315
Stressed out, huh?

624
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:35,254
Come with me.

625
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,789
- going?
- Come on.

626
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,554
What?

627
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:51,895
You're smoking drugs in the library?
What if somebody catches us?

628
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,168
Don't worry. It'll help you relax.

629
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,677
Oh, boy.

630
00:34:57,712 --> 00:35:00,180
It's illegal.

631
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:04,947
¶ I want your fish right by me ¶

632
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:08,454
¶ That's how it has to be ¶

633
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:09,683
Here.

634
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:12,318
¶... copacetic if you let it so set up ¶

635
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,989
¶ And keep the downstream down and the upstream up ¶

636
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,594
This is poison.

637
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,534
¶ My stoney, my baby ¶

638
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:23,230
Let me help you.

639
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,967
¶ Funk the groovin' thang whistlin' ¶

640
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:27,634
¶ As I rip my rhymes ¶

641
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:30,235
¶ Time and time again struttin' and in the summertime ¶

642
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:32,473
¶ So screw it, strip down and be generic ¶

643
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,947
¶ Strip down and be a passenger
Strip down and be a messenger ¶

644
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:37,610
¶ In askin' why I'm born I come up blank in the winter ¶

645
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:40,280
¶ In askin' why I'm born I come up on when I'm on her ¶

646
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:42,516
- ¶ It's time to find the kind ¶
- ¶ My summer, his summer ¶

647
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:44,148
I'm Kumar.

648
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:47,090
Vanessa.

649
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:49,494
You're still not reading that poem.

650
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,489
¶ And then I kiss my stoney baby ¶

651
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,832
¶ My stoney, my stoney ¶

652
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,168
¶ My stoney baby ¶

653
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:00,765
¶ My stoney ¶

654
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:02,833
¶ My stoney baby ¶

655
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:04,773
Kumar.

656
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:08,941
¶ My stoney baby ¶

657
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:09,972
Kumar.

658
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,848
Kumar. Kumar.

659
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:14,255
- Kumar.
- Yeah.

660
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,520
What's going on? We're in Birmingham,
Alabama. Are we supposed to be here?

661
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:19,719
What's going on?

662
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,887
- Why did you bring us here, dude?
- What do you mean, why did l...

663
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,194
You were supposed to be following the
directions, asshole. What do you mean?

664
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:27,826
There's got to be like a highway or something, right?

665
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:30,166
Yeah, there's got to be a highway.

666
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,970
What's going on up there?

667
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,372
¶ Squad up ¶

668
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,035
¶ My niggas ¶

669
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,977
¶ I see some pussy-ass niggas, so what the fuck... ¶

670
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:40,480
What the hell is this?

671
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:41,606
¶ We knock these niggas out ¶

672
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:43,708
¶ I see some pussy-ass niggas,
so what the fuck you wanna do? ¶

673
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:46,413
- I'm turning around.
- Nah, just go through, man.

674
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:49,121
Dude, we're not driving through this basketball game.

675
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:51,784
You know, Roldy, I really thought you were bigger than this.

676
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:54,158
Dude, I'm not scared 'cause they're black.

677
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:55,457
I'm scared because they're scary.

678
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:57,862
And it's not like we got Gregory Hines out there.

679
00:36:57,898 --> 00:36:58,887
They're not that scary.

680
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:03,194
It's my ball!

681
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,704
Turn around.

682
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,708
¶ Rob this motherfucker, drop his punk ass in a ditch ¶

683
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:10,643
¶ Drag this pussy nigga, slap his ass up like a bitch ¶

684
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:12,236
¶ My niggas is my niggas 'cause my niggas... ¶

685
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:14,611
- Fuck! It won't move!
- Shit, dude.

686
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:16,115
¶ Shoot him dead between his lips ¶

687
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,242
¶ I see some pussy... ¶

688
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:19,776
- That's not good.
- Now there's no music, man.

689
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,412
Shit, man.

690
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:24,390
- Motherfucker!
- My Jordans, nigga!

691
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,290
- Shit, this isn't good.
- This is not good. This is not good.

692
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:29,858
No. No. No.

693
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:31,421
They're coming over here.

694
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:36,399
- Fucking shit. Why did you do that?
- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose.

695
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:39,805
They're getting weapons, man.

696
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,273
All right, what do we do?
What do we do?

697
00:37:41,308 --> 00:37:43,606
Run, run, run. Run, run.

698
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,780
Yo. Yo.

699
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:55,587
- Where y'all going? Damn!
- We was just trying to help.

700
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:59,787
Man, somebody call the police.
We need to report this.

701
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:18,502
- Yeah, that's right. You like the ride?
- Fuck you, man.

702
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:23,176
They abandoned it last night.
It's registered to a Raza Syed.

703
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:28,586
The witnesses' description of the driver and
passenger match that of Lee and Patel.

704
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,951
We tried bringing in Syed last night,
but he's already left the country.

705
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:38,030
Well, they know we're closing in on 'em, that's why.

706
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,659
OK. No, I'll give you a call. All right.

707
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,496
No, no, no, no!

708
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:45,869
- Holy shit!
- Easy, easy!

709
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,703
- Easy.
- Easy!

710
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,470
This is our witness.

711
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,375
Put it down! Yo, put it down!

712
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,538
You all know I got one!

713
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,241
I got one too!

714
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,816
So, you saw the fugitives, huh?

715
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:03,415
Yeah. It was like I was telling the Sheriff...

716
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:07,393
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How do I know you're telling the truth?

717
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,293
I don't have a reason to lie to you, man.

718
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,695
Really?

719
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,529
- Get up in your face, man.
- We'll see.

720
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,398
That ain't right.

721
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,370
Where's he going?

722
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,801
What's going on?

723
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:25,534
Hell no!

724
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,911
Now why don't you tell me what really happened?

725
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,813
Is that grape soda?

726
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,715
What the fuck, yo?

727
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,817
- All right.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

728
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:38,290
This is so ignorant.

729
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:40,316
- Really?
- Yes.

730
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,329
Is this ignorant?

731
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,854
Yo, that's racist, man. That's racist.

732
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,026
Hey, Jon, are you gonna let him do that?

733
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:50,099
See if he got Kool-Aid.

734
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,037
Almost gone, witness.

735
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:54,006
Sure there's not something you wanna tell me?

736
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,941
I'm not stoppin' until you crack!

737
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,068
I already told you that they took off runnin'!

738
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:58,442
All right, all right, all right.

739
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,175
This isn't necessary!
Mr. White is telling you the truth!

740
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:03,775
Yeah, and how can you be so sure, Beecher?

741
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:07,253
'Cause he doesn't have a police record.
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.

742
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:13,589
OK, then, Beech. How do you propose
we find the terrorists, huh?

743
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:17,295
There was a Nokia 7710 taken from the console.

744
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,593
We have its tracking numbers.

745
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:21,760
Our satellites are running a trace on it, as we speak.

746
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:23,861
I'm serious about that Kool-Aid.

747
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:25,132
What's going on? Where are you?

748
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,571
Dude, that is a fucking long story.

749
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:29,599
We're actually in Alabama right now, heading to Texas.

750
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:33,238
What is that sound? Are you jerking off again?
What are you doing?

751
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,578
I'm taking a glorious pee-pee.

752
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:40,346
Hey, listen, you're not gonna believe this but the
other night, I ended up at that Asian party...

753
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:42,947
and I schtupped Cindy Kim.

754
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,958
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?

755
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:47,119
Yeah, man, she even gave me a blumpkin.

756
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,423
What is a blumpkin?

757
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:51,556
It's when a girl gives you head while
you're sitting on the toilet takin' a shit.

758
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,226
Really?

759
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,827
- Hello?
- Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

760
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:58,394
Hello? Come, come?

761
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:01,607
Did you go?

762
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:03,109
Yeah, I'm done.

763
00:41:03,143 --> 00:41:06,078
You said to me we were gonna cross swords. You promised.

764
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:07,910
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

765
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:12,578
Are you talking on a cellphone when
the government is looking for us?

766
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,111
Dude, it was just Goldstein.
I had something important to tell him.

767
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:16,918
It's 'cause you had something...
That's good, that's OK.

768
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:22,520
Nothing is more important than finding a way to get to Texas.

769
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,552
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

770
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:28,000
We've been walking an entire day and
we have not seen a street sign.

771
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:29,161
Do you get it?

772
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:32,468
- Can I say...
- Again. This is... I can't.

773
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:37,108
Dude, honestly you've got to be a little more
positive about these things, all right?

774
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:40,409
- Yeah?
- Positive about what? I don't...

775
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:43,848
First of all, look at this beautiful Alabama landscape, OK?

776
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:46,978
You don't get shit like this in New Jersey.

777
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:49,220
God, you...

778
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:50,756
Hey, look, dude.

779
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,691
It's a baby deer.

780
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:57,055
- Wow. Man.
- Shit.

781
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,533
Hey. Hey.

782
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:06,027
Look how cute this deer is, dude.
Not like those asshole deer in New Jersey.

783
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:07,563
I know, man.

784
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,133
- Hey, buddy.
- Dude, Alabama's awesome.

785
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:11,974
He likes you.

786
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:15,474
- Oh, my God!
- No!

787
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:21,420
Sorry about that. I was in my zone.

788
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:28,254
What the hell are y'all doing out here in them fancy clothes?

789
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,820
We were on our way to Texas and we got lost.

790
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,354
Texas?

791
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,628
You're a long way from Texas.

792
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:36,993
No!

793
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:43,336
Born in '04.

794
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:45,038
Get in here.

795
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:51,442
Yeah. The sun's about to go down.

796
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:55,285
- Y'all need a place to stay? Ya hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

797
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,381
You want to follow me?

798
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,884
Come on.

799
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:02,885
Maybe we shouldn't.

800
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:06,294
It's already dead.
You need a hand, dude?

801
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:09,528
My grandpappy bought this land in 1902.

802
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,038
Very nice, sir.

803
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:14,302
This place is gonna suck.

804
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:21,006
Honey, I'm home.

805
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,886
I'm in here.

806
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:35,193
I wish you'd told me you was bringing guests home.

807
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,094
I'da straightened up in here.

808
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:39,224
Fellas, this is my wife Raylene.

809
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:41,894
Raylene, meet Harold and Kumar.

810
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:43,402
Hello.

811
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:47,703
Can't shake. I've just got... deer head all over me.

812
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:50,039
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you boys.

813
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:52,568
- You just make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.

814
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:54,171
Honey, something's wrong with that DSL.

815
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,274
Every time I go on the online, it says, "Searching for server."

816
00:43:57,317 --> 00:43:59,182
You try unplugging the AirPort base?

817
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,346
Yeah, I done did that but it didn't work.

818
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,912
What you need to go online fors, anyways?

819
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:06,084
I was gonna get one of them new portable satellite radios.

820
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,754
What the fuck you need a satellite radio for?

821
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:11,094
Don't you be cussin' when we got company over.

822
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:12,257
- Guys.
- Please don't worry about us.

823
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:13,596
We cuss all the time.

824
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:14,965
Who do you think you is, hitting me?

825
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:17,129
Who do you think bought you that Prada bag?

826
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:19,036
I told you I wanted a Gucci one.

827
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:20,334
The Gucci bag cost more!

828
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:22,672
Well, Jan Sapperstein's husband sure could afford it.

829
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,870
Here we go again with Jan Sapperstein.

830
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,176
I don't give a rat's ass what that bitch got.

831
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:28,476
You be happy with what you have.

832
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:31,177
What I have is a husband who ain't worth a turd!

833
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:32,583
You wanna give me shit now?

834
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:34,678
- That's right!
- After everything I let you buy!

835
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:36,120
Even look at the credit card bills?

836
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:38,852
You buy?! Do you think we need another set of golf balls?

837
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:41,827
- Even worse is the credit card miles.
- Stinky, smelly, motherf...

838
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:43,659
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.

839
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:47,394
Nonsense. Don't be silly.
You're our guests.

840
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,902
You guys have got to stay for supper.

841
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,529
- No, we couldn't. That's...
- No, thank you. We really couldn't...

842
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:55,975
Of course, we're gonna have to get high first.

843
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,190
We're close.

844
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:31,036
This is news to me.
I never knew farmers smoked weed.

845
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:34,536
You ever tried farmin' not high?
It's borin' as shit.

846
00:45:34,581 --> 00:45:36,572
You know, this is great, guys.

847
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:42,119
I kind of always, you know, sort of assumed
that people from the South were kinda...

848
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:44,055
A bunch of dumb rednecks?

849
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,719
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not...

850
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,696
We do try to keep our inbred son in the
basement when we have company.

851
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:53,063
Guys, I didn't mean it like that. I was just...

852
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,035
Look at their faces!

853
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:05,367
Fuck, fuck!

854
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:07,073
Shit, they found us.
They found us. They found us.

855
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:08,706
- What do you mean, they found you?
- Listen, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

856
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,740
Are you boys in some kind of trouble?

857
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:13,617
All right. This is gonna sound crazy, but, basically...

858
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:14,916
we were on a plane to Amsterdam...

859
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:17,617
and we got mistaken for terrorists and
we got sent to Guantánamo Bay...

860
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:19,785
and then we escaped and snuck into
America with a bunch of Cubans...

861
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:21,883
and now we're trying to get to Texas where
there's a guy who can help us out...

862
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:23,829
and he's getting married to Kumar's ex-girlfriend.

863
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,593
Yes.

864
00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:29,162
OK. That's cool.

865
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:31,636
- I understand that.
- You do?

866
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:35,904
Like the government's never screwed
us over before. You know what?

867
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:38,002
Y'all come down here and hide in the
basement. I will handle this.

868
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,478
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.

869
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:41,481
Thank you, thank you.

870
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:53,792
OK. This isn't creepy.

871
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:58,764
What the hell is that?

872
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:03,363
You're walking towards the creepy music?

873
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:05,199
Ge...

874
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:06,796
This song rocks, dude.

875
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,569
Kumar.

876
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:23,851
Hey, dude, there's a lighter here with a clown on it.

877
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:26,849
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!

878
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:28,685
God!

879
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,936
Hey, you don't happen to have a Baby Ruth on you, do you?

880
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:45,536
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?

881
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:48,514
That's how Chunk won over Sloth in The Goonies.

882
00:47:48,548 --> 00:47:50,482
This thing looks like Sloth?

883
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:52,678
All I saw was the creature's hand.

884
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:54,414
The hand looks like Sloth?

885
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:58,584
The fucking hand of an evil monster,
dude. Like fucking claws and shit.

886
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,422
Shit.

887
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,829
Listen, no matter what, don't let the
creature know that it's ugly, OK?

888
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:07,766
The last thing that we want to do is
criticize it or make it feel different...

889
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,531
just because it was born with horrible deformities.

890
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:24,312
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em.
It was just my neighbors.

891
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:25,375
- There's a fricking Cyclops...
- No, you got...

892
00:48:25,419 --> 00:48:27,478
- in your basement, man!
- a fucking thing, dude!

893
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:28,715
You met Cyrus.

894
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:29,949
- Cyrus.
- You named it?

895
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,218
Our son.

896
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:34,193
You must have woke him up. He was
supposed to be asleep. I'm sorry.

897
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:38,389
I thought you were joking when you said you had
an inbred son who lives in your basement.

898
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:40,059
Well, it ain't a joke.

899
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,399
Raylene and I here are siblings, and we get it on.

900
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:45,735
But that don't mean we ought to be judged.

901
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:48,536
You boys must be awful tired after
what you've been through.

902
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:50,008
Come with me, I'll show you to your bed.

903
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:52,068
You better go back to sleep, boy!

904
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:55,104
Don't make me come down there and whip your Cyclops ass!

905
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,078
It's tough love.

906
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,110
It's the best way.

907
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,965
I don't know what I was thinking
dating that douchebag Colton.

908
00:49:22,008 --> 00:49:25,307
He is a douchebag.
What were you thinking?

909
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:29,042
But it was agony pretending his puny, little penis satisfied me.

910
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:33,644
I bet. I bet you've been missing the
thundercock too, haven't you, baby?

911
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:35,951
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

912
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:37,616
Yeah, you've been missing it?

913
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:38,783
How much?

914
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:41,726
- A lot.
- I bet.

915
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,526
Well...

916
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,193
- I kind of have this fantasy.
- What is it?

917
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,296
I thought it'd be kinda cool to bring
somebody else in bed with us.

918
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:55,372
Who?

919
00:49:55,408 --> 00:49:57,137
Hey, baby.

920
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,078
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

921
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:07,916
- Yeah.
- She's hot, right?

922
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:08,978
Let's do it.

923
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:11,513
- ¶ There's something ¶
- ¶ About that woman ¶

924
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:14,959
¶ She's got something you can't live without ¶

925
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:17,759
¶ Makes your heart sing ¶

926
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:19,389
Faster, Weedy.

927
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:21,491
¶ Something about that woman ¶

928
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:24,993
¶ If you're in doubt then you are missing out ¶

929
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:27,529
¶ On a good thing ¶

930
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:30,806
¶ I got to give it up ¶

931
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:33,574
Teeth, teeth, Weedy, teeth.

932
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:37,711
- Weedy!
- Yeah?

933
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:40,618
- Yeah!
- You like that?

934
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,960
Putting it in the ass now, Weedy.

935
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,991
Yeah, how about that?

936
00:50:55,035 --> 00:50:57,094
¶ Something about that woman ¶

937
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,573
¶ She's got something you can't live without ¶

938
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:02,575
¶ Makes your heart sing ¶

939
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,041
¶ It's just something about that woman ¶

940
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,743
¶ If you're in doubt then you are missing out ¶

941
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:13,344
¶ On a good thing ¶

942
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,883
¶ I got to give it up ¶

943
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,123
Wow.

944
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:29,533
Dude.

945
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,631
I just had the most fucked-up nightmare.

946
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,733
Come on, man.
I was having a really hot dream.

947
00:51:36,776 --> 00:51:39,438
Go back to bed, please, dude.

948
00:52:11,311 --> 00:52:14,014
Why did we have to leave?
Their Goonies child was kind of cute.

949
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:16,539
I don't care. It tried to fucking bite me.

950
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:21,415
Jesus, every time the two of us try to get anywhere
it's fucking disaster after fucking disaster.

951
00:52:21,454 --> 00:52:23,217
Jesus, dude. Here, you really need a hit of this.

952
00:52:23,256 --> 00:52:25,850
Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!

953
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,190
It's your solution to everything, you know that?

954
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,197
Think about it.
We should be at Colton's already.

955
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,496
Hey, chill, we still have two days to fuck up the wedding.

956
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:36,593
- What?
- What?

957
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:38,695
- What?
- What?

958
00:52:39,139 --> 00:52:43,473
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
You want to fuck up the wedding.

959
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,843
It's not fucking funny, Kumar.
It's not fucking funny!

960
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,373
Colton is the only guy that can help us out at this point.

961
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,044
I can't believe... I cannot believe
you're willing to fuck that up!

962
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,985
I just hate that fucking asshole, OK?

963
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,784
Yeah? I like him better than I like you right now.

964
00:52:56,823 --> 00:52:59,018
- Really?
- Yeah.

965
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:01,050
You know what he got me? A job.

966
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,030
You know what you got me?
Thrown into Guantánamo Bay.

967
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:06,760
- Your job sucks.
- Admit it.

968
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,633
You're jealous because Vanessa found
somebody better than you.

969
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:11,227
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

970
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,865
Better than you! Let me think.

971
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:17,399
Potential future president, or unemployed pothead?

972
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,969
Tough. That's tough.
That's a tough one for her, isn't it?

973
00:53:20,013 --> 00:53:24,080
Yeah, well at least Vanessa's not in Amsterdam
getting plowed by a bunch of European dudes.

974
00:53:25,152 --> 00:53:25,856
What?

975
00:53:25,856 --> 00:53:28,320
Do you really think Maria's saving herself for you, dude?

976
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:31,416
Right now, she's probably got two uncircumcised
dicks dangling in front of her throat.

977
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,916
You know what she's gonna do with them?
Down 'em into her tonsils?

978
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,392
Fucking dick.

979
00:53:44,704 --> 00:53:47,070
- That's my hat.
- That was my hat, bro.

980
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,103
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

981
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:53,001
Asshole!

982
00:53:53,046 --> 00:53:55,879
Don't you dare say a fucking word about my angel!

983
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:00,182
What the fuck was that?

984
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,279
Get up. Get up!

985
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,290
Fuck you.

986
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,092
Shit.

987
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:21,573
Isn't that a KKK bonfire?

988
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:22,768
Yeah.

989
00:54:24,144 --> 00:54:26,044
Yeah, I think it is.

990
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,041
Maybe we should get the fuck out of here.

991
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:31,107
Yeah. Yeah, dude.

992
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:33,483
Let's do that.

993
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:39,289
The other day, caught a rerun of that show Becker.

994
00:54:39,325 --> 00:54:40,758
You know that show?

995
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:44,230
Yeah, that's the one with that Jew, Ted Danson.

996
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:47,700
That blond negro they got on there, he had me in stitches.

997
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:49,292
He's actually pretty funny.

998
00:54:49,335 --> 00:54:51,565
Really? You think so?

999
00:54:51,604 --> 00:54:54,402
I'm not saying I wouldn't lynch the guy, but...

1000
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:57,239
his timing, it's priceless.

1001
00:54:57,977 --> 00:55:00,275
Hold up a second.

1002
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:02,975
I gotta go drain the main vein.

1003
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:22,161
I'll tell ya, Travis...

1004
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,568
when it comes to feeling good...

1005
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:27,630
I'd rate pissin' right up there with comin' and shittin'.

1006
00:55:29,676 --> 00:55:31,234
I like to do all three.

1007
00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:32,505
Yeah, I hear ya.

1008
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:37,808
Kenny, come on, man.
Hurry the fuck up.

1009
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,152
You were the one who made me drink that third beer.

1010
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:44,622
Hold your horses, peckerwood.

1011
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,892
Gross! You fucking pissed on me!

1012
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,225
- You racist fuck!
- What the heck?

1013
00:55:57,003 --> 00:55:59,028
What the nigger was that?

1014
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:03,668
This is fucked. We are fucked.

1015
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,610

1017

Good, you brought the keg.
Lug that thing over.

- Come on!

1019
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,717
Let's go, come on!

1020
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:29,763
Yeah, then you put little onions on 'em
and you steam 'em, they're awesome.

1021
00:56:29,802 --> 00:56:35,032
Roldy, dude, I'd never thought I'd say this in a million
years but the Klan really knows how to party.

1022
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:36,905
You gotta try these dogs.

1023
00:56:36,943 --> 00:56:37,932
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1024
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,673
Really know how to... the Klan knows how to party?

1025
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:42,738
- Dude, we've got to get out of here!
- Jeez, all right, dude, relax.

1026
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:46,240
All right, y'all! Come on over here
and we'll sit around the campfire.

1027
00:56:46,286 --> 00:56:48,754
- Shit, what do we do?
- Let's go sit down.

1028
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:50,016
Rufus. Next to them marshmallows...

1029
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:52,286
- and the graham crackers.
- Everybody sit down.

1030

that's what I'm talking about.

1032
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:03,528

me somethin'... Porch monkey, kike!

1033

that you did to a minority this week. Yeah.

1034
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,871
I tripped a beaner while I was walking down
the stairs at the Wal-Mart the other day.

1035
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:13,741
Guy crashed into a bunch of wine bottles.

1036
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,607
They made him pay for 'em! Yeah!

1037
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,149
All right, all right, let's all calm down.

1038
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:24,213
White power here, white power here, white power here.

1039
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,056
Giving him what he deserves.

00:57:27,093 --> 00:57:28,390
Hebe!

1041
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:32,887
All right, I'm back. Next.

1042
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:35,059
It better be good. Here.

1043
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,469
Come on, dude, say something.

1044
00:57:43,876 --> 00:57:45,673
You know what?

1045
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:49,338
I did knee an Indian guy in the balls.

1046
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,406
That's funny!

1047
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:54,417
Yeah, send them Indians back to Africa.

1048
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:58,583
Well, you want to hear something real
fucked-up and awesome that I did?

1049
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:03,358
I took a Korean guy's toothbrush
and I rubbed it all over my dick.

1050
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:07,332
- You did that?
- Well, that's just downright disgustin'.

1051
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:09,130
- But I like it!
- Yeah!

1052
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,601
Yeah, I love bein' white.

1053
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,775
- What the...
- Look what we got us here, brothers.

1055

1056
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,346
Come on, come on! Come on!

1057
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:32,285
Come on, boys, let's chase them back to the border!

1058

Holy shit!

1060
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,933
Should we put it out or what?

1061
00:58:44,237 --> 00:58:46,102
Are they still behind us?

1062
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:49,131
I don't think so.
Dude, the Klan is fucking slow.

Lee and Patel made a phone call to you.

1091
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:07,246
Now tell us everything you know about their terrorist plot.

1092
01:00:07,286 --> 01:00:10,312
Terrorist plot? Rold and Kumar?

1093
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,586
This is ridiculous.

1094
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,185
OK, fine. Fine.

1095
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:17,788
Mr. Rosenberg.

1096
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,663
Mr. Gold-stein.

1097
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:23,694
We'll do it your way.

1098
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,771
What's this? What do we have here?

1099
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,365
It's about seven dollars?

1100
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,066
Look, don't insult us, all right?

1101
01:01:01,107 --> 01:01:05,339
I don't know what the hell is going on here but I'm
pleading the Fifth until I speak to my lawyer.

1102
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:07,642
You're pleading the Fifth, huh?

1103
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:10,749
Beecher, give me a copy of the Bill of Rights.

1104
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,307
The Bill of Rights? Why?

1105
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,410
Just do it!

1106
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:16,387
Excuse me.

1107
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:19,613
Five, right?

1108
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:20,956
- Five alive.
- Sure.

1109
01:01:20,993 --> 01:01:23,553
OK. OK. Good.

1110
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:29,332
You wanna know what I think about the Fifth Amendment?

1111
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:38,276
There it is.

1112
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,784
That's what I think of the Fifth Amendment.

1113
01:01:50,723 --> 01:01:53,419
Why the hell is your ass so dirty?
Don't you wipe?

1114
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:57,020
Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, buddy.

1115
01:01:57,063 --> 01:01:58,052
What do ya got?

1116
01:01:58,097 --> 01:02:01,157
Turns out the FBI was already tapping Mr. Goldstein's phone.

1117
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,963
- We got what we need.
- Wait a second.

1118
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:05,334
You were tapping my phone?

1119
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:06,360
You want to hear the tape?

1120
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:10,637
No. I'm sick of listening to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?

1121
01:02:10,676 --> 01:02:13,144
Lee and Patel are on their way to Texas as we speak.

1122
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,340
I knew they'd trip up.

1123
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:19,181
Ready the plane. These fuckers are goin' down.

1124
01:02:26,225 --> 01:02:29,854
Neil, can you just focus on driving?
You've had... Focus on the road.

1125
01:02:29,896 --> 01:02:32,456
You've had dozens of shrooms, my friend.

1126
01:02:33,132 --> 01:02:36,226
Dude, I was able to perform an appendectomy at age 14.

1127
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:39,432
I think I can handle a couple mushrooms.

1128
01:02:39,472 --> 01:02:42,999
- Wasn't that just a TV show?
- Jesus Christ!

1129
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,840
Did you see that unicorn?

1130
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:47,641
lts horn was so shiny.

1131
01:02:48,648 --> 01:02:52,140
So, why are you guys headed to Texas?

1132
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:55,085
Let's just say my ex-girlfriend's getting married.

1133
01:02:58,324 --> 01:03:00,292
The one that got away, huh?

1134
01:03:00,326 --> 01:03:01,987
Yep.

1135
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,019
Sounds to me like you need a drink.

1136
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,162
Road. Neil, please, can you pay attention...

1137
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:09,133
Dude, I've got it!

1138
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:12,069
- Yeah, but...
- He's a good driver. Stop.

1139
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:15,164
Thanks, man. Cheers, dude.

1140
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:16,333
Really? Drinking?

1141
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:25,742
I have a lost-love story of my own.

1142
01:03:25,785 --> 01:03:26,774
Yeah?

1143
01:03:27,486 --> 01:03:29,750
Happened on the set of Clara's Heart.

1144
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:31,279
Sure, sure, yeah.

1145
01:03:31,324 --> 01:03:34,816
I'll never forget her.
Her name was Tashonda.

1146
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,691
She was Whoopi Goldberg's stand-in.

1147
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:40,722
Her skin was so soft, her lips were so sweet.

1148
01:03:41,834 --> 01:03:46,737
She had these tiny, little Hershey Kiss nipples...

1149
01:03:47,506 --> 01:03:50,634
that you just wanted to suck on all night long.

1150
01:03:51,143 --> 01:03:54,408
Anyway, last day of shooting, I told her.

1151
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,210
I said...

1152
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:59,979
"T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up."

1153
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:01,611
Why did you do that?

1154
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,523
I didn't think I could take on that kind of responsibility.

1155
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:10,118
It was such a big mistake.

1156
01:04:10,162 --> 01:04:14,863
Why? I mean, with T-Bird gone couldn't you
have sex with whoever you wanted?

1157
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,094
Let me be clear.

1158
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:18,000
There is nothing on the planet...

1159
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:20,335
that I love more than a hot, new pussy.

1160
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:21,897
- Sure.
- Nothing.

1161
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,034
What does the P.H. stands for in N.P.H.?

1162
01:04:25,311 --> 01:04:26,403
Patrick Harris.

1163
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,073
No, common mistake. Poon handler.

1164
01:04:29,982 --> 01:04:31,643
The point is, boys...

1165
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:36,280
even though I love havin' sex with some hot, random trim...

1166
01:04:36,322 --> 01:04:41,282
a day hasn't gone by where I haven't thought of Tashonda.

1167
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:47,463
Every time I see a bag of Hershey's Kisses,
my balls get so wet.

1168
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,563
Here's to you, Tashonda.

1169
01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:58,903
- I hope you kept the baby.
- Wow.

1170
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,964
¶ Free on my own ¶

1171
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,067
¶ That's the way I used to be ¶

1172
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,668
¶ But since I met you, baby ¶

1173
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,872
Hey, honey.
What's up?

1174
01:05:34,914 --> 01:05:37,542
I found something in your purse.

1175
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:39,884
Why would you go through my purse?

1176
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:41,580
Why would you have a joint...

1177
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:44,714
when you know it could ruin my political career?

1178
01:05:44,757 --> 01:05:45,815
I'm sorry.

1179
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:50,124
What with all the wedding plans,
I've just been a little stressed.

1180
01:05:50,162 --> 01:05:52,096
It helps me relax?

1181
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:55,589
Marijuana is illegal, Vanessa.

1182
01:05:55,634 --> 01:05:57,465
Now, I thought that part of your life was in the past.

1183
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,937
- It is.
- Good.

1184
01:06:01,307 --> 01:06:02,399
That's all I need to hear.

1185
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,842
Hey, baby.

1186
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,213
Look, I know things can be hectic with the wedding.

1187
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:15,619
But, you know, if you get stressed out, just do what I do.

1188
01:06:15,654 --> 01:06:17,679
Snort Zoloft, OK?

1189
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:27,595
What the fuck?

1190
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:28,622
Shit.

1191
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:32,125
Dude, they set up a fucking roadblock!
They're gonna find us.

1192
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:33,340
What are you talking about?

1193
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,201
Neil, I don't know how to say this any
other way, man, but we're fugitives.

1194
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,834
Cool.

1195
01:06:39,178 --> 01:06:41,476
OK, well, we've got to find a way to get out of this.

1196
01:06:41,514 --> 01:06:43,141
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please.

1197
01:06:43,182 --> 01:06:47,084
You act like I've never smuggled a
fugitive across state lines before.

1198
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,417
Here. Hide in that.

1199
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:51,821
Sorry. It's a little sticky.

1200
01:06:54,226 --> 01:06:56,023
Shit.

1201
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,390
Yeah.

1202
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,764
What the... When were you gonna show me these?

1203
01:07:15,014 --> 01:07:16,948
Excuse me.

1204
01:07:17,716 --> 01:07:18,876
Wait, Officer!

1205
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:22,252
- Shit.
- Hold that car!

1206
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:40,138
Neil Patrick Harris.

1207
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,464
Yo.

1208
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:47,709
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

1209
01:07:47,746 --> 01:07:50,237
Yeah. I would imagine so.

1210
01:07:52,284 --> 01:08:01,125
I'm sure you get this all the time but your part in
Starship Troopers truly, truly changed my life.

1211
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,457
Really?

1212
01:08:02,494 --> 01:08:04,291
How?

1213
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:09,529
Well, no one thought the war against the
arachnids of Klendathu could be won.

1214
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:11,001
- But you showed the starship troopers...
- Neil!

1215
01:08:11,036 --> 01:08:12,970
that those bugs could be destroyed.

1216
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:19,473
A lot of people think the war on terror
is a war that can't be won, right?

1217
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:23,339
That's why I joined the Department of Homeland Security.

1218
01:08:23,382 --> 01:08:28,012
My friend, two words.
Starship fuckin' Troopers.

1219
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:32,251
If you want to know the secret of being,
you will come with us.

1220
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:35,617
Please. I really need to go.

1221
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:39,529
Yeah, of course. I'm so sorry to bother you. You move along.

1222
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:44,703
Bye.

1223
01:08:45,337 --> 01:08:46,702
I love you.

1224
01:08:49,942 --> 01:08:51,773
I love you too, Mr. Patrick Harris.

1225
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,439
What the...

1226
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:03,617
Holy fucking shit, that was awesome.

1227
01:09:04,623 --> 01:09:06,716
Try having that conversation on shrooms.

1228
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:08,624
I deserve an Oscar for that performance.

1229
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:09,650
- You do!
- Dudes...

1230
01:09:09,695 --> 01:09:11,560
I'm gonna take a little detour on the way, all right?

1231
01:09:11,597 --> 01:09:12,586
- No.
- Neil, no.

1232
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:13,620
But we're almost there, man.

1233
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,793
- No buts. No buts!
- What do you do...

1234
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:18,769
I'm going to a whorehouse and I'm gonna get my fuck on.

1235
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:23,332
If you two don't want to get your
dicks wet, that's fine with me.

1236
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:26,170
I'll get my dick wet.

1237
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:36,551
¶ Don't need nothin' but a good time ¶

1238
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:39,216
¶ How can I resist? ¶

1239
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:43,194
¶ Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time ¶

1240
01:09:43,228 --> 01:09:47,062
¶ And it don't get better than this ¶

1241
01:09:47,566 --> 01:09:50,933
Pussy, I'm home!

1242
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:52,436
Hello?

1243
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:58,403
Well, well, well. I thought you'd never
show your face around here again.

1244
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,208
What's the matter, Sally? I thought
I was one of your top customers.

1245
01:10:01,246 --> 01:10:04,340
Have you forgotten what happened
the last time you were here?

1246
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:07,618
Because of you, my best girl quit.

1247
01:10:07,653 --> 01:10:09,450
Hey, I paid her good money.

1248
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:11,115
It's not my fault she didn't lube up.

1249
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,853
Besides, I bring you new customers.

1250
01:10:14,893 --> 01:10:18,021
- New customers?
- No, Neil, that's all.

1251
01:10:18,063 --> 01:10:20,088
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

1252
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:22,362
Sally. Bring on the lineup.

1253
01:10:25,104 --> 01:10:27,095
Line up in the chutes, girls.

1254
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,972
Longhorns coming through.

1255
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:31,100
Neil.

1256
01:10:35,047 --> 01:10:37,880
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.

1257
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,781
Hello, ba...

1258
01:10:40,919 --> 01:10:43,683
- What's your name, miss?
- Tits Hemingway.

1259
01:10:43,722 --> 01:10:45,280
How'd you come up with that?

1260
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,258
Well, I have huge tits.

1261
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:49,692
And my favorite book is A Moveable Feast.

1262
01:10:49,728 --> 01:10:52,288
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

1263
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,889
Well, I hope you're ready for me, Tits...

1264
01:10:53,932 --> 01:10:57,999
'cause I'm gonna rock out with my cock out and
you're gonna jam out with your clam out.

1265
01:10:58,036 --> 01:10:59,731
It's gonna be magical.

1266
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:02,573
- The whores are on me, fellas.
- No, Neil...

1267
01:11:02,608 --> 01:11:04,405
- thank you, but we... that's...
- Thanks, dude.

1268
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:09,345
Screw that, Roldy. I don't know about you but, no offense
to the rest of you ladies, I am gonna be taking you two.

1269
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:12,016
No, Kumar. Kumar!

1270
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,540
Roldy, you're missing out, brother.

1271
01:11:14,453 --> 01:11:16,478
Yo, we need to get back on the road, buddy.

1272
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:17,955
We need...

1273
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,395
Well, now, you know, we also supply...

1274
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:28,059
in-room films or a magazine.

1275
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:32,696
Well, if you'd like some self-satisfaction...

1276
01:11:32,738 --> 01:11:34,831
we do have some...

1277
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,941
electronic devices right over there.

1278
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,975
Just have some coffee. Yeah?

1279
01:11:45,017 --> 01:11:47,850
Why don't you lie on the bed?

1280
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,377
And tell us what you want us to do.

1281
01:11:50,422 --> 01:11:52,788
OK. OK.

1282
01:11:54,126 --> 01:11:55,753
Well...

1283
01:11:57,296 --> 01:11:59,127
how about...

1284
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:02,600
How about you take off your clothes
and make out with each other?

1285
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:05,034
- We've done that before.
- We can do that.

1286
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,162
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1287
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:07,968
¶ Pussy real good ¶

1288
01:12:08,006 --> 01:12:09,667
- ¶ That pussy ¶
- ¶ Pussy real good ¶

1289
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,040
- ¶ That pussy ¶
- ¶ That pussy off the chain ¶

1290
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,238
- ¶ That pussy ¶
- ¶ Go on and do yo thang ¶

1291
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:16,611
- ¶ That pussy ¶
- ¶ Pussy real good ¶

1292
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:18,707
- ¶ That pussy ¶
- ¶ That pussy real good ¶

1293
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,684
¶ That pussy ¶

1294
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,516
¶ Yo' mama don't like ¶

1295
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,189
¶ She say I'm no good ¶

1296
01:12:25,224 --> 01:12:27,158
¶ What she don't know is ¶

1297
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:29,524
¶ I got you pussy-whooped ¶

1298
01:12:29,561 --> 01:12:31,825
¶ He need this pussy ¶

1299
01:12:31,864 --> 01:12:34,128
¶ He smell this pussy ¶

1300
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:36,259
¶ He wanna taste this pussy ¶

1301
01:12:36,301 --> 01:12:38,701
¶ He gotta pay for pussy ¶

1302
01:12:38,737 --> 01:12:40,534
Can you use tongue?

1303
01:12:40,572 --> 01:12:42,802
¶ That pussy, pussy ¶

1304
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:44,502
¶ Pussy, pussy ¶

1305
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,840
Bump your titty on her titty.

1306
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,313
¶ Police pull me over ¶

1307
01:12:49,348 --> 01:12:51,339
¶ They don't write no tickets ¶

1308
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,351
Boner achieved!

1309
01:12:55,387 --> 01:12:58,914
Great. Now let's get those pants off.

1310
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,288
OK.

1311
01:13:00,826 --> 01:13:04,091
- You are benevolent human beings.
- Yeah, I know.

1312
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,494
- Yeah?
- We get that a lot.

1313
01:13:05,597 --> 01:13:07,360
Yeah. You know what that means, benevolent?

1314
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:08,991
Yeah, I do, actually.

1315
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:10,296
What?

1316
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:12,496
It means we're gonna fuck you so hard...

1317
01:13:12,538 --> 01:13:14,904
your dick's gonna be sore for two weeks.

1318
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:18,068
That is exactly, exactly what it means.

1319
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:22,045
You know what bothers me the most, though?

1320
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,208
He never once apologized for getting me into all this trouble.

1321
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:30,244
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my
Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?

1322
01:13:30,289 --> 01:13:33,725
But it's cool. He doesn't know how to say "I'm sorry."

1323
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,956
Why do you think that is?

1324
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:40,431
Sparkle, because it's all about what
he wants. It's about him, him, him.

1325
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:43,662
You know. I don't even care because... You know...

1326
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:46,466
if he can't be a good friend to me,
I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.

1327
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,666
- It's done.
- Don't say that.

1328
01:13:49,107 --> 01:13:51,075
A good friend is hard to come by.

1329
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:52,542
Venus, come on.

1330
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:55,809
Yeah, but if he was a real friend,
he would know how to say, "I'm sorry."

1331
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:57,212
That's right.

1332
01:13:57,249 --> 01:13:59,240
Thank you, Agnes.

1333
01:14:00,152 --> 01:14:01,141
Nail on the head.

1334
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:08,092
It's like right now after all the shit that we
have been through in the last few days...

1335
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:13,325
you know, he's in there having the time of his life, having sex.

1336
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:19,226
I never should have left her.

1337
01:14:19,805 --> 01:14:21,466
I don't even know...

1338
01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:23,906
I don't even know what I was thinking.

1339
01:14:23,942 --> 01:14:26,775
I loved her so much.

1340
01:14:26,812 --> 01:14:29,007
She was my little baby.

1341
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,912
She was my little baby.

1342
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:32,109
Why did I let my little baby go?

1343
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:34,414
Why did I let her go?

1344
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:36,353
You'll find someone else.

1345
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,083
No, I won't. Not like Vanessa.

1346
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:40,523
You'll find love again someday.

1347
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,789
Yeah, you will.

1348
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,693
Did you guys?

1349
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:49,665
No, we're whores.

1350
01:14:49,701 --> 01:14:51,999
- Remember?
- Yeah.

1351
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,841
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

1352
01:14:59,878 --> 01:15:01,675
What the hell is going on here?

1353
01:15:01,713 --> 01:15:04,614
That prick fucking branded me!

1354
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:07,041
- Stop it.
- I warned you, Neil.

1355
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:09,519
Bring it.

1356
01:15:09,554 --> 01:15:11,886
- Neil! Neil!
- Time to put your dick in the dirt.

1357
01:15:11,923 --> 01:15:14,323
- What... Neil! What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

1358
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:15,348
- But...
- No, Neil.

1359
01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:16,861
Neil!

1360
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,197
- What about Neil, man?
- No, fuck Neil. He just fucked us.

1361
01:15:20,232 --> 01:15:22,757
- Neil! Neil!
- Come on, come on, come on!

1362
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:24,462
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Neil!

1363
01:15:24,503 --> 01:15:25,970
Come on!

1364
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:28,863
- N.P.H.!
- No!

1365
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:31,904
Stop! Stop!

1366
01:15:33,078 --> 01:15:34,773
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We've got to get Neil.

1367
01:15:34,813 --> 01:15:36,474
- Why?
- Look, we're stealing his car!

1368
01:15:36,515 --> 01:15:39,382
- We can't leave him back there.
- He stole your fucking car last week!

1369
01:15:40,385 --> 01:15:42,046
What was that?

1370
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:43,710
- Hurry up.
- Neil!

1371
01:15:43,755 --> 01:15:45,518
- Hurry up. Come on, man.
- Guys.

1372
01:15:45,557 --> 01:15:47,491
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Neil, Neil, come on! Come on, man!

1373
01:15:47,526 --> 01:15:49,357
- Guys!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

1374
01:15:49,394 --> 01:15:50,861
It's not even funny.
Hurry up, dude, hurry up.

1375
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:52,693
You can make it, dude.

1376
01:15:52,731 --> 01:15:56,189
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

1377
01:15:57,102 --> 01:16:00,071
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ!

1378
01:16:00,105 --> 01:16:02,300
- Neil's dead! Neil's dead!
- No!

1379
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:06,910
- Oh, my God!
- Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!

1380
01:16:09,214 --> 01:16:15,676
¶ How do I say goodbye ¶

1381
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:17,450
It's the dawn of a new day.

1382
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:22,385
And Neil Patrick Harris isn't around to see it, man.

1383
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:23,416
Dude, I told you.

1384
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:24,952
Will you please stop saying that?

1385
01:16:26,031 --> 01:16:27,521
God.

1386
01:16:27,566 --> 01:16:30,034
He's gone.

1387
01:16:30,702 --> 01:16:33,694
Maybe he's got some family contact info in here.

1388
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:35,934
Dude, I know I'm not calling Neil's parents.

1389
01:16:36,775 --> 01:16:38,800
What's in the bag?

1390
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,369
- Holy fuck.
- Creepy mask.

1391
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:44,908
A jar with hair in it.

1392
01:16:47,385 --> 01:16:50,445
And, like, 12 cans of Mace.

1393
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,958
- Look, dude.
- Holy shit.

1394
01:16:55,994 --> 01:16:58,360
Holy shit, we actually made it.

1395
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,400
This is where Colton grew up, huh?

1396
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:09,737
Smell that? That smells like douche.

1397
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:18,916
No, you will remain in this car.

1398
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:22,181
I will go inside alone and, if we're lucky,
Colton will help us out.

1399
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,122
- Why can't I just...
- No. Let me put it another way.

1400
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,889
You leave this car, and our friendship is over.

1401
01:17:29,928 --> 01:17:32,396
- But, Roldy, I just...
- Kumar.

1402
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:35,422
Open the door and I will cut your fucking balls off.

1403
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:36,593
Jesus. OK.

1404
01:17:40,338 --> 01:17:42,329
- Balls.
- Go.

1405
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:56,644
Hi, I'm a friend of Colton's.

1406
01:17:56,688 --> 01:17:58,212
Thank you.

1407
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:42,696
God damn it.

1408
01:18:42,734 --> 01:18:45,032
Vanessa? You OK?

1409
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:48,403
- Kumar? What are you doing here?
- Yeah, let me help you up.

1410
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:54,041
I thought you were going to Amsterdam.

1411
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:56,741
Yeah, me too. It didn't work out.

1412
01:18:57,749 --> 01:18:59,011
You all right?

1413
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,610
- Now, does this hurt when I touch it?
- Yeah.

1414
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,245
- It does?
- Yeah.

1415
01:19:03,288 --> 01:19:07,190
This is just what I need.
A limp during the wedding.

1416
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:09,420
Can you move it around in a circle?

1417
01:19:10,428 --> 01:19:13,625
OK, that's what I figured. It's just your
ATFL. I don't think you tore it, though.

1418
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:17,226
So a little ice and massage should do the trick. You'll be fine.

1419
01:19:17,269 --> 01:19:19,396
Are you gonna tell me why you're here?

1420
01:19:19,437 --> 01:19:25,409
Roldy and I ran into some trouble and we figured
that maybe your Colton could help us out.

1421
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:28,606
- Still getting into trouble, huh?
- A little bit.

1422
01:19:28,647 --> 01:19:31,639
You remember that time that you broke into the animal lab...

1423
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:34,709
and, like, stole that monkey and put it
in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?

1424
01:19:34,753 --> 01:19:36,448
OK, first of all, that was Goldstein's idea...

1425
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:40,219
and second of all had I known that the monkey
had AIDS, I never would have done that.

1426
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:41,247
What about you?

1427
01:19:41,293 --> 01:19:44,729
You put those disgusting used tampons
in Professor Konop's purse.

1428
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:46,321
- Remember that?
- Come on.

1429
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,763
She was a bitch and you know it.

1430
01:19:51,603 --> 01:19:53,935
What's going on here?

1431
01:19:53,972 --> 01:19:56,964
Hey, she actually fell and broke her heel here.

1432
01:19:57,008 --> 01:20:01,240
Yeah, I twisted my ankle.
Kumar was just looking at it.

1433
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,338
- Why aren't you in the car, Kumar?
- Dude, I heard her yell.

1434
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:04,973
I thought I told you to stay in the car, man.

1435
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:06,947
It's OK, man.

1436
01:20:06,985 --> 01:20:08,475
No worries.

1437
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,114
Listen, Roldy filled me in on the situation.

1438
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:13,920
But don't worry. I'll make sure my
dad takes care of everything.

1439
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:16,082
Thanks, man.

1440
01:20:16,127 --> 01:20:19,119
In the meantime, you are going to the doctor.

1441
01:20:19,164 --> 01:20:21,291
Ramón!

1442
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:25,667
Ramón. Please bring Vanessa
to Dr. Harris immediately.

1443
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:30,132
Bye, Vanessa. Hope you feel better.

1444
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:34,710
- Bye.
- Bye.

1445
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,883
Guys.

1446
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,350
All right.

1447
01:20:42,153 --> 01:20:45,645
All right, guys. Jet's all fueled.
You should be home in no time.

1448
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,089
Sweet.

1449
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:56,759
Hey, Colton, I can't believe you're doing this for
us on the night before your wedding day.

1450
01:20:56,801 --> 01:21:00,430
- I really appreciate it. Thank you.
- Please don't mention it.

1451
01:21:00,472 --> 01:21:03,339
Just want to make sure
everything works out smoothly.

1452
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,002
Are all these planes yours?

1453
01:21:05,043 --> 01:21:07,341
No. OK.

1454
01:21:07,379 --> 01:21:08,971
Rold, come on, of course they are.

1455
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:12,508
This guy's funny. You're funny.

1456
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,711
- Yeah?
- Hey, Colton, man.

1457
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:19,015
Listen, I was wrong about you, dude.
You're not a douchebag.

1458
01:21:19,057 --> 01:21:20,217
Dude.

1459
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:21,885
You know what I mean.
I mean, you're a good dude.

1460
01:21:21,926 --> 01:21:24,087
And I'm happy for you and Vanessa.

1461
01:21:26,865 --> 01:21:28,662
That's big of you, Kumar.

1462
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,565
- I really appreciate it.
- Sure.

1463
01:21:30,602 --> 01:21:32,763
I just can't wait to get back, man.

1464
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,438
You're going back all right.

1465
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,338
This time you're not escaping.

1466
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:42,039
Now!

1467
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,547
Go! Move, move, move!

1468
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:50,679
You are a douchebag...

1469
01:21:50,722 --> 01:21:53,088
- No.
- you fucking douchebag, fuck you!

1470
01:21:53,124 --> 01:21:55,957
Yeah. The last thing I was letting
you guys do is ruin my wedding.

1471
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:58,724
- You did this?
- Of course he did this.

1472
01:21:58,763 --> 01:22:01,197
I thought we were friends, man.
How could you betray me like this?

1473
01:22:01,232 --> 01:22:03,223
Come on, Rold. You and me?

1474
01:22:03,268 --> 01:22:05,293
You let me cheat off you in Advanced Accounting.

1475
01:22:05,336 --> 01:22:07,031
Other than that, I could give a shit about you.

1476
01:22:07,072 --> 01:22:08,471
Take 'em away, guys.

1477
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:11,407
When we get out of this I'm gonna
fucking kick your fucking ass, man!

1478
01:22:11,443 --> 01:22:13,104
Boy, you're scaring me.

1479
01:22:13,144 --> 01:22:17,746
Well, come on, you're not one of those kung-fu Asians
you're a fucking pussy banker, for Christ's sakes.

1480
01:22:17,782 --> 01:22:19,875
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- I'm gonna rip you up, bitch!

1481
01:22:19,918 --> 01:22:22,546
- You'd best watch your back, bitch!
- Fuck you, dude!

1482
01:22:22,587 --> 01:22:24,782
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1483
01:22:25,723 --> 01:22:27,884
I'm awesome.

1484
01:22:32,897 --> 01:22:35,798
Looks like you boys picked the wrong side, huh?

1485
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:38,268
Where's your Koran now?

1486
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:44,136
We're not even Muslim, you moron and even
if we were, that doesn't make us terrorists.

1487
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,775
Hey! I'm talking to you.
Get back here!

Now do you see why I hate Colton Graham?

1492
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:03,587
Now do you see why I hate you?

1493
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:07,053
I asked you specifically to stay in the car.

1494
01:23:07,098 --> 01:23:09,760
I told you our friendship was at stake.

1495
01:23:09,801 --> 01:23:11,325
Vanessa fell down.
And I was helping her.

1496
01:23:11,369 --> 01:23:13,394
- I don't want to hear the excuses!
- It's not an excuse!

I don't want to hear the excuses!

1498

- I heard her yelling!
- I don't want to hear it.

1499
01:23:22,881 --> 01:23:24,644
I'm sorry.

01:23:27,852 --> 01:23:29,285
Look at this. Look at this.

1502
01:23:30,321 --> 01:23:32,448
I fucked up, OK?

1503
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:36,256
I fucked up and I always fuck up.
I am a fuck-up.

1504
01:23:36,294 --> 01:23:37,659
You think?

1505
01:23:38,663 --> 01:23:40,153

1506
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:42,463
you're my best friend, dude.

1507
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:46,167
You mean the world to me, man. I love you.

1508

Queers.

1509
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:50,570
And I promise you, if we figure out a way
to get out of this, I'm gonna change, OK?

1510
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:52,542
It's not just gonna be about Kumar all the time.

1511
01:23:52,577 --> 01:23:55,375
It'll be about Kumar and Harold.

1512

Harold and Kumar.

1513
01:24:01,553 --> 01:24:02,850
I kind of like the first way better.

01:24:16,701 --> 01:24:19,693
Yeah, it is. I brought weed on the plane.

1519
01:24:19,737 --> 01:24:22,865
- You got weed?
- No. The other plane.

1520

No, I wish Neil Patrick Harris were still alive,
that guy fucking loves him.

1521
01:24:29,948 --> 01:24:32,712
He totally would have been able to bail us out.

You just gave me an idea, man.

1523
01:24:36,688 --> 01:24:38,087
- What?
- I got this.

1524

Hey, Burl...

1525

- I actually still have some weed.
- You do?

- Yeah. It's in my pants.

can treat me like some dork in gym class?

01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:31,300
Fuck!

1554
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:34,304
I don't wanna die!

1555
01:26:34,339 --> 01:26:35,533
Kumar!

1556
01:26:35,573 --> 01:26:38,201
- What?
- I have the parachute!

1557
01:26:38,242 --> 01:26:39,573
Come over here.

1558
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:42,340
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

1559
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,870
Swim!

1560
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,756
Holy shit.

1561
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,883
It's fucking working!

1562
01:26:59,564 --> 01:27:01,532
Yeah!

1563
01:27:02,867 --> 01:27:04,732
I love you, dude.

1564
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,569
Shit!

1565
01:27:12,243 --> 01:27:14,677
Don't worry about him. I have an idea.

1566
01:27:14,712 --> 01:27:17,010
- What?
- Hang on.

1567
01:27:22,553 --> 01:27:24,521
Fuck you!

1568
01:27:28,459 --> 01:27:31,257
Man, that was so fuckin' extreme.

1569
01:27:32,663 --> 01:27:34,858
It was.

1570
01:27:37,301 --> 01:27:38,996
- Kumar?
- Yeah.

1571
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:43,203
Our dicks are touching, aren't they?

1572
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:46,870
Yeah, I guess they are.

1573
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:49,209
- Yeah.
- OK, I was just checking.

1574
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:54,284
Roldy, can you move us out of the way?
There's a house coming up down here.

1575
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:58,116
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1576
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:06,590
Dude!

1577
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:13,201
The glass hurt my dick.
The glass hurt my dick.

1578
01:28:15,273 --> 01:28:17,241
I think I'm OK. Yeah.

1579
01:28:18,309 --> 01:28:20,641
- Dude. Dude.
- Oh, my God.

1580
01:28:20,678 --> 01:28:23,442
- No, shit, dude. You all right?
- Fuck! I think so!

1581
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:25,745
We gotta get out of here before
the people who live here find us.

1582
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:27,410
I know. They're gonna be...

1583
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,113
Dude? Dude?

1584
01:28:31,155 --> 01:28:32,486
What's up?

1585
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:39,655
- No.
- Holy shit!

1586
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:42,632
What the hell are y'all doing in my office?

1587
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:46,393
You'd better start giving me some answers!

1588
01:28:46,437 --> 01:28:48,564
George? We're gonna be late for that wedding.

1589
01:28:48,606 --> 01:28:51,973
Shit. It's Cheney. Come on, you guys.
Keep quiet. Follow me.

1590
01:28:52,009 --> 01:28:55,342
That guy scares the crap out of me.
Let's go hide in the guesthouse.

1591
01:28:55,379 --> 01:28:58,143
- Come the fuck on.
- I'm coming.

1592
01:29:15,466 --> 01:29:17,366
¶ Yeah ¶

1593
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:21,596
- This is a cool room.
- Yeah.

1594
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:25,370
Yeah, this is where I come to escape from work.

1595
01:29:25,409 --> 01:29:28,071
- Here?
- Yes, sir.

1596
01:29:29,547 --> 01:29:32,641
- So who the heck are you guys?
- All right.

1597
01:29:32,683 --> 01:29:36,010
My name is Harold Lee, sir and this is Kumar Patel.

1598
01:29:37,822 --> 01:29:42,020
Anyway, we were on a parachute and
we sort of landed on your ranch.

1599
01:29:42,059 --> 01:29:43,720
Dude, this is weed.

1600
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:46,290
That's Alabama Kush.

1601
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:47,592
That's only the finest.

1602
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:50,328
So you get high and then you put other
people who smoke weed in jail?

1603
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:52,866
- That's so hypocritical.
- Dude, look...

1604
01:29:52,904 --> 01:29:55,771
Yeah? Well, let me ask you something, Kumar.

1605
01:29:55,806 --> 01:29:58,366
- You like giving hand jobs?
- No, sir.

1606
01:29:58,409 --> 01:30:01,105
- You like getting hand jobs?
- Yeah.

1607
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:04,239
All right. Well, that makes you a fucking hypocriticizer too.

1608
01:30:04,282 --> 01:30:07,615
So shut the fuck up and smoke my weed.

1609
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:25,658
Hey, love.

1610
01:30:25,703 --> 01:30:30,140
What are you doing here? It's bad luck.
The ceremony starts in a hour.

1611
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:31,971
I just want to let you know...

1612
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:35,134
I had catering get an extra case of Coors
Light in case the President comes.

1613
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:36,510
It's his favorite beer.

1614
01:30:36,547 --> 01:30:39,482
- Do you think that'll be enough?
- I don't know. Yes?

1615
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,246
Who cares?

1616
01:30:42,219 --> 01:30:46,280
Look, were you able to work everything
out with Kumar and Harold?

1617
01:30:46,324 --> 01:30:49,657
Don't worry, Chestnut.
I took complete care of 'em.

1618
01:30:57,935 --> 01:31:00,597
They thought you guys were terrorizers.

1619
01:31:01,172 --> 01:31:04,869
Wait. That's not funny, man.
They sent us to Guantánamo Bay.

1620
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:07,639
Fuck! G. Bay?

1621
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:10,405
Tell me you didn't eat that cockmeat sandwich.

1622
01:31:11,649 --> 01:31:15,881
No. No, we did not eat the cockmeat
sandwich. We escaped, thank God.

1623
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,321
That cockmeat sandwich.
That's my favorite.

1624
01:31:19,357 --> 01:31:20,551
Oh, my God.

1625
01:31:22,126 --> 01:31:24,788
- This is good shit.
- I know. I know.

1626
01:31:24,829 --> 01:31:26,797
- I laced it with blow.
- Fuck.

1627
01:31:26,831 --> 01:31:29,629
So it knocks you out, and it keeps you going at the same time.

1628
01:31:31,168 --> 01:31:34,467
If you like weed so much, why don't you just legalize it?

1629
01:31:34,505 --> 01:31:36,666
Are you fucking kidding me?

1630
01:31:36,707 --> 01:31:39,733
You know how pissed off my dad would get if I did that?

1631
01:31:39,777 --> 01:31:42,041
Holy shit, dude.

1632
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,377
My dad's all up in my shit too, about this whole...

1633
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:45,404
- med school thing, right?
- I know.

1634
01:31:45,449 --> 01:31:47,713
And it's not that I don't want to be a doctor, but like...

1635
01:31:48,185 --> 01:31:51,313
fucking... sometimes I wonder if he's just encouraging me...

1636
01:31:51,355 --> 01:31:56,849
because he knows it'll make me happy or because
he wants me to carry on his legacy, you know?

1637
01:31:57,928 --> 01:31:59,987
You just blew my fuckin' mind.

1638
01:32:11,142 --> 01:32:13,736
- Hi.
- Hi. You look good.

1639
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,769
Daddy.

1640
01:32:15,813 --> 01:32:17,440
Yeah, it's W.

1641
01:32:19,316 --> 01:32:21,750
I don't need your friends to tell me what to do anymore.

1642
01:32:23,421 --> 01:32:26,083
- No, I'm not being disrespectful.
- That's what I say.

1643
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:29,058
I'm just saying that I can handle my own shit, all right?

1644
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:32,028
I mean, I don't need them to tell me
how to do what I have to do.

1645
01:32:32,063 --> 01:32:33,928
Yeah, dude!

1646
01:32:33,964 --> 01:32:36,762
Yeah, well you know what?
Yeah, well, fuck you, Dad.

1647
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,894
Fuck you!

1648
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,937
- Dude, that was awesome.
- You guys are awesome.

1649
01:32:43,974 --> 01:32:44,963
- No. No.
- You're awesome!

1650
01:32:45,009 --> 01:32:47,637
- You are awesomer.
- Sir, you are awesome.

1651
01:32:47,678 --> 01:32:49,145
Seriously.

1652
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:51,978
Listen, about our situation...

1653
01:32:52,016 --> 01:32:56,544
Fuck that. Listen, guys, guys, guys.
I am the fucking President, all right?

1654
01:32:56,587 --> 01:32:59,317
That means I get to pardon whoever I want.
You guys are in the fuckin' clear.

1655
01:32:59,356 --> 01:33:00,414
Don't worry.

1656
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:04,588
- Holy shit. Are you serious? Thank you.
- Oh, my God. Thank you, Mr. President.

1657
01:33:04,628 --> 01:33:05,652
Yeah.

1658
01:33:05,696 --> 01:33:08,961
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1659
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:17,797
But, listen, to be honest, after all the shit that we've been through
I don't know if we can trust our government anymore.

1660
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,901
- Trust the government?
- Yeah.

1661
01:33:19,944 --> 01:33:22,845
Heck. I'm in the government and I don't even trust it.

1662
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,283
You don't have to believe in your
government to be a good American.

1663
01:33:31,388 --> 01:33:33,652
You just have to believe in your country.

1664
01:33:34,425 --> 01:33:35,915
Exactly.

1665
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,292
- Exactly.
- Right.

1666
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:39,990
This is good shit, isn't it?

1667
01:33:41,665 --> 01:33:43,360
Yeah, it is.

1668
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,927
If you guys need anything else, just let me know, all right?

1669
01:33:46,971 --> 01:33:50,429
Actually, Mr. President, there is one thing.

1670
01:33:52,476 --> 01:33:55,001
- This really came out great.
- Yeah, it did, man.

1671
01:33:55,045 --> 01:33:56,774
I lit a lot of these candles.

1672
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:11,785
Great.

1673
01:34:14,098 --> 01:34:16,328
- All clear.
- Safe to proceed.

1674
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:19,566
He's here! I knew he'd come.

1675
01:34:23,941 --> 01:34:25,374
All right, let 'em in.

1676
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:31,408
- What is happen...
- Who is that?

1677
01:34:31,448 --> 01:34:34,076
- Harold?
- Kumar?

1678
01:34:34,118 --> 01:34:38,350
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for
interrupting this beautiful ceremony.

1679
01:34:38,389 --> 01:34:43,085
But there is no way in hell that I'm letting the only
woman I've ever loved marry that piece of shit.

1680
01:34:44,862 --> 01:34:47,296
Security, get them out of here, please.

1681
01:34:47,331 --> 01:34:50,858
These guys? No, see, they're with us. Yeah.

1682
01:34:50,901 --> 01:34:53,893
Looks like I got a little more pull with
the President than you, bitch.

1683
01:34:56,974 --> 01:35:00,068
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

1684
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:02,704
Your fiancé promised to get us out of trouble.

1685
01:35:02,746 --> 01:35:06,546
But instead he arranged for us to be
sent back to Guantánamo Bay...

1686
01:35:06,584 --> 01:35:10,020
where we'd be forced to suck Big Bob's fat dick.

1687
01:35:13,224 --> 01:35:15,351
- Is this true?
- Yeah, it's true.

1688
01:35:15,392 --> 01:35:17,121
I'll take care of this myself.

1689
01:35:19,597 --> 01:35:20,689
- OK, wait.
- No...

1690
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,567
You son of a bitch.

1691
01:35:26,403 --> 01:35:27,927
I loved you, man.

1692
01:35:32,009 --> 01:35:34,569
- I can't believe this.
- Vanessa, let me explain...

1693
01:35:34,612 --> 01:35:36,512
Explain?

1694
01:35:36,547 --> 01:35:40,314
Explain why you're putting me through the
most embarrassing moment of my life?

1695
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:46,916
Well, what if I did something embarrassing to myself?

1696
01:35:46,957 --> 01:35:47,981
Would that make you feel better?

1697
01:35:48,025 --> 01:35:50,755
There's nothing you can do that would be this embarrassing.

1698
01:35:55,299 --> 01:35:59,702
I fear that I will always be A lonely number like root three

1699
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,531
A three is all that's good and right

1700
01:36:05,576 --> 01:36:09,945
Why must my three keep out of sight
Beneath a vicious square-root sign?

1701
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,675
I wish instead I were a nine

1702
01:36:11,715 --> 01:36:15,446
For nine could thwart this evil trick
With just some quick arithmetic

1703
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:18,177
I know I'll never see the sun

1704
01:36:18,222 --> 01:36:20,122
As 1.7321

1705
01:36:20,157 --> 01:36:22,352
You fucking tool.

1706
01:36:22,393 --> 01:36:24,623
Quiet, anus.

1707
01:36:27,197 --> 01:36:31,190
Such is my reality A sad irrationality

1708
01:36:31,235 --> 01:36:33,795
When, hark, just what is this I see?

1709
01:36:34,638 --> 01:36:36,629
Another square root of a three

1710
01:36:36,674 --> 01:36:39,268
Has quietly come waltzing by

1711
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:41,039
Together now we multiply

1712
01:36:41,078 --> 01:36:43,603
To form a number we prefer

1713
01:36:43,647 --> 01:36:45,638
Rejoicing as an integer

1714
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,985
We break free from our mortal bonds

1715
01:36:49,019 --> 01:36:50,884
And with a wave of magic wands

1716
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:53,321
Our square-root signs become unglued

1717
01:36:53,357 --> 01:36:55,621
And love for me has been renewed

1718
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,532
You were right.

1719
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:09,368
- That was pretty lame.
- Told you.

1720
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:15,508
Look, I can't promise you the kind of lifestyle that Colton could.

1721
01:37:15,546 --> 01:37:18,344
And I can't promise you that I'm gonna mature overnight.

1722
01:37:18,382 --> 01:37:20,816
But what I can promise you is that...

1723
01:37:27,191 --> 01:37:30,790
Sorry, I smoked weed with the President.
I totally forgot what I was going to say.

1724
01:37:33,297 --> 01:37:35,925
I can promise you that I will always love you.

1725
01:37:35,966 --> 01:37:38,901
And I'll never try and make you into
something that you're not.

1726
01:37:40,237 --> 01:37:44,503
So, what do you say you take a brother back?

1727
01:37:50,247 --> 01:37:53,373
Only if you promise to get me out of this
awkward situation as soon as possible.

1728
01:37:54,418 --> 01:37:55,510
Come here.

1729
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,548
Yeah!

1730
01:38:04,995 --> 01:38:07,088
That's my boy!

1731
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,359
Ku!

1732
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:16,536
Come on. Let's get the hell back to Jersey.

1733
01:38:16,573 --> 01:38:20,009
All right, hold on. First we gotta do
something for my buddy here.

1734
01:38:20,044 --> 01:38:21,944
- Got to go somewhere.
- Where?

1735
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:27,214
¶ Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth? ¶

1736
01:38:27,251 --> 01:38:30,914
¶ Ooh, heaven is a place on earth ¶

1737
01:38:30,954 --> 01:38:35,118
¶ They say in heaven love comes first ¶

1738
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:38,959
¶ We'll make heaven a place on earth ¶

1739
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:43,126
¶ Ooh, heaven is a place on earth ¶

1740
01:38:54,111 --> 01:38:55,738
- Hey.
- Hey.

1741
01:38:57,381 --> 01:38:59,281
- No luck, huh?
- No.

1742
01:39:01,151 --> 01:39:03,984
Called every hotel in the city.
I walked all around.

1743
01:39:04,688 --> 01:39:06,087
I just can't find her anywhere.

1744
01:39:06,123 --> 01:39:07,590
- We'll find her.
- We'll find her, dude.

1745
01:39:12,763 --> 01:39:14,424
What?

1746
01:39:14,465 --> 01:39:16,592
Oh, my God, there she is.

1747
01:39:21,271 --> 01:39:23,637
- Roldy, she's hot.
- Dude, go get her!

1748
01:39:29,346 --> 01:39:32,406
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

1749
01:39:32,449 --> 01:39:33,814
- So fuck it. Forget about that.
- Yeah.

1750
01:39:33,851 --> 01:39:35,375
It's probably just some Amsterdam fling, all right?

1751
01:39:35,419 --> 01:39:36,477
We'll go back to the Jerz...

1752
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,317
- in a couple of days, all right?
- No.

1753
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:42,058
No, fuck it.

1754
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:43,389
I came way too far.

1755
01:39:43,427 --> 01:39:45,019
We went through too much shit to...

1756
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,495
I'm gonna talk to her.

1757
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:47,622
No, no, no, dude, don't go in there.

1758
01:39:47,664 --> 01:39:48,790
- Come on.
- Just wait.

1759
01:39:48,832 --> 01:39:50,629
Come on, man.
Wait till we get back to Jersey.

1760
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,362
What the fuck are you doing?

1761
01:39:53,403 --> 01:39:55,894
<i>- C'est quoi ton putain de problème, toi?
- Harold!</i>

1762
01:39:55,939 --> 01:39:57,804
I didn't understand what you said.

1763
01:39:57,841 --> 01:40:00,537
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing, man?

1764
01:40:00,577 --> 01:40:03,205
- You're ruining my shot.
- You what?

1765
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,306
Get off my set!

1766
01:40:05,349 --> 01:40:07,249
I'm so confused. What's...

1767
01:40:07,284 --> 01:40:09,650
- What's going on?
- Harold, I'm doing a photo shoot.

1768
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:12,179
For High Times magazine.

1769
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:16,987
Of course, you're a model.
You're very hot. You're a model.

1770
01:40:17,027 --> 01:40:19,222
Right. I always wondered what you did for a living.

1771
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,164
I'm sorry. So, wait a second.
So you're not with this dude?

1772
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:23,962
Are you kidding? Me?

1773
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:26,333
- Yeah.
- No.

1774
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:28,736
Anton is like totally gay.

1775
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:36,738
Harold, what are you doing here?

1776
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:42,175
I didn't want to wait ten days to see you so
I thought I would come and surprise you.

1777
01:40:43,787 --> 01:40:45,914
That is so sweet.

1778
01:40:45,956 --> 01:40:47,890
OK. It's sweet.

1779
01:40:47,925 --> 01:40:50,860
I've been thinking about you this whole time.

1780
01:40:50,894 --> 01:40:52,384
- You have?
- I have.

1781
01:40:52,429 --> 01:40:55,921

fucking high since we're in Amsterdam?

- Yeah.
- Shall we?

1790
01:41:29,132 --> 01:41:32,124
- Sounds like a plan.
- Let's do it.

1791
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:35,332
¶ So in the beginning there was hum from a poet ¶
