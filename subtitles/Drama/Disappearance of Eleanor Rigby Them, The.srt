1
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,738
Okay.

2
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:43,131
Help me. Help me. Let me go.

3
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,013
Help me.

4
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,263
Well? Did you send it?

5
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,372
Did you send the e-mail?

6
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,800
Pictures.

7
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,027
Yes. I sent them.

8
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:48,986
I sent them.

9
00:09:57,324 --> 00:10:00,221
We need to keep you high, Drakie.
Understand?

10
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:02,835
Please nod if you understand.

11
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:06,953
Now, for you to drink, I
need to take off the gag.

12
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,289
Please.. do not scream.

13
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,342
We do not want to hurt you.

14
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:13,844
And we certainly don't
wanna kill you.

15
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:17,182
Now we are absolutely prepared to
do either or both of these things..

16
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:21,033
if we need to. Do you understand?
- Yes.

17
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,718
Please don't hurt me.

18
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,167
Please, please let me go.

19
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:33,441
- I have a daughter and she needs me.
- Shh..

20
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:35,000
Please..

21
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,000
We know you don't
have a daughter.

22
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:38,532
We know everything about you.

23
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,263
Now I'm sure it's a
natural response.

24
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,566
You're trying to reason with us..
you're just..

25
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:49,714
Now you listen to me!

26
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:53,496
The only people that can get you
out of here are him and me.

27
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:55,709
We are your only friends.

28
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,746
I owe it to you to do as we say.

29
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:02,732
Now, are you gonna be quiet
and drink from the bottle?

30
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,439
Good.

31
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,018
Whenever you need the bathroom, wait
till we come in and give us this signal.

32
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,798
Try to hold it in,

33
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,013
because we won't be changing
your sheets or your clothes.

34
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,589
Do you understand?

35
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:31,956
Good.

36
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,820
- We should keep a clear head!
- Need a drink.

37
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:04,340
Just one.

38
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:08,919
Make sure it's not
your breath in there.

39
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:10,207
Make sure she can't
smell any on you.

40
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:11,134
Why?

41
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,315
Because we are not a bunch
of fucking amateurs.

42
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,914
Okay. I'll chew some gum after.

43
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,667
You should eat. Keep
your energy up.

44
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,573
I'm not hungry.

45
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,347
I do not care. Eat.

46
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,858
- I said eat!
- I don't want to.

47
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:39,385
What?

48
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:40,654
Eat!

49
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:45,982
Eat it!

50
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,199
I said I'm not hungry.

51
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,369
Fuck! Shit!

52
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,626
That far I told you
I'm not hungry.

53
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,671
You haven't eaten for nine hours,
you've been doing physical work..

54
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:00,487
- and you're still not hungry?
- No. No.

55
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,833
If you are not hungry, it means
that something is not right.

56
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,170
Maybe you're thinking too much.

57
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,932
About whether we have
done everything right,

58
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:11,186
or whether we have made a mistake
on the way that will get us caught?

59
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,204
That can get us
20 years in jail.

60
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:18,366
Or maybe you think about whether
we had to rough up that girl?

61
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:20,349
Or perhaps even kill her?

62
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,387
Or worse..

63
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:26,979
Maybe you are getting senti-fuckin'-mental.
Now this girl isn't just theoretical?

64
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,253
Now, you've looked
into her eyes.

65
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,284
Maybe you're having
second thoughts?

66
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:36,488
Maybe your conscience is eating
away at your conviction?!

67
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,885
And maybe you are
persuading yourself..

68
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,621
the best thing to do is just go in
there, untie her, and let her go?

69
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:45,994
Would you listen to me?

70
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:48,957
Fuck that!

71
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,536
You understand?

72
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:53,350
Look at me.

73
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:54,683
Look at me!

74
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,134
Fuck that!

75
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:02,682
We are in this. We are too far
along to get fucking squeamish.

76
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:06,793
Now, any doubts that you
have, are just bullshit.

77
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,732
They are just major
bullshit, and you know it.

78
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,219
You know it. You
know you know it.

79
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,919
So you say it.

80
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:18,765
Say what?

81
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:21,111
Fuck that!

82
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,824
- Fuck that.
- Again.

83
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,599
Fuck that!

84
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,384
Now don't think.

85
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,155
Eat.

86
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,295
We got a long night ahead.

87
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,840
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

88
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,022
We should check on
her before I leave.

89
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,443
Well?

90
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,068
How come I always have to
do the fucking dogwork?

91
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:02,492
Because that's your role.

92
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,188
Now go and check on her.

93
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,529
Bathroom alert.

94
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:24,275
Do you need a number
one, or a number two?

95
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:26,163
Show me with your fingers.

96
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:45,413
Ready?

97
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:14,538
Done?

98
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,106
- You're going already?
- Yeah.

99
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,190
It's time.

100
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,391
Be careful.

101
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:51,373
Remember to dump the phone.

102
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,530
I'm not stupid.

103
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,472
Just reminding.

104
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:04,591
Don't sleep, check on
her, and don't drink.

105
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,109
Sure. Whatever.

106
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:13,516
No! Not whatever.
You just do it.

107
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,132
You keep your head
in the fucking game.

108
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:20,604
Do you understand?

109
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,322
Yup.

110
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,439
Fuckin' dick.

111
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:47,714
What happened?

112
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,801
- Did you make the call?
- Yeah.

113
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:51,895
I made it.

114
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:53,432
So how did it go?

115
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:56,560
- It went fine.
- So he is going to pay?

116
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,522
- He said yes, but..
- But what?

117
00:19:58,638 --> 00:19:59,964
There was a click.

118
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,971
The police were there.
They were listening in.

119
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:02,753
Police?

120
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,123
Ok. We knew this would
happen eventually.

121
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,421
Yeah, but not so fucking soon.

122
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,583
We planned this. That's
why we dumped the phone.

123
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:11,102
We planned for this,
so calm down.

124
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,629
So what did he say?

125
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,192
He said he wanted to
speak to his daughter,

126
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:15,818
and make sure she
was still alive.

127
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:16,481
And?

128
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:19,376
And I said no. He was just playing for
time so they could trace the call.

129
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,363
Trace? Fuck me!

130
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,150
Calm!

131
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:25,878
- We are okay.
- But he agreed?

132
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:27,344
He agreed to the
money, to the timing?

133
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,464
Yes. He said he'd get the money
first thing in the morning.

134
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:32,681
No sequential notes, no
traces, no paybonds.

135
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,375
Good.

136
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,313
I want to be sure.

137
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,246
We need to make sure he goes to
that bank as soon as it opens,

138
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:44,842
and gets that money as
fast as he fucking can.

139
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,490
We need you to do something.

140
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:56,266
He is going to untie you.
When he does,

141
00:20:56,467 --> 00:21:01,119
you're gonna to sit on the edge of
the bed, and stay very very still.

142
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:02,308
Understand?

143
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,333
You are going to look into this
camera, and speak to your father.

144
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,139
Tell him, that he
must pay the money.

145
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,611
He must do exactly as we
ask, or we will kill you.

146
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:47,065
You tell him that you have no
doubts that we will kill you.

147
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,622
Understand?

148
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,286
Yes.

149
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,647
Good.

150
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:54,343
Take: 1.

151
00:21:58,638 --> 00:21:59,533
Daddy..

152
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,141
I'm okay.

153
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,566
They just took me..

154
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,944
I was leaving the house,
and they just took me.

155
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:13,701
I do not know where I am.

156
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:15,458
Stop!

157
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,315
I don't want a narrative. I just
want you to look into the camera..

158
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:23,738
and tell him that unless he pays
the money, we will kill you.

159
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:27,041
Any deviation from our
instructions, we will kill you.

160
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:30,905
Any piss, we will kill you!

161
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,936
Understand?

162
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,404
Yes.

163
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,171
No. She is not scared enough.

164
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,023
Give her some motivation.

165
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:50,631
That's better.

166
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:54,722
Now, get yourself
together and try again.

167
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,394
Daddy..

168
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:12,318
I love you.

169
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:13,932
Please..

170
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:15,968
Pay.

171
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,172
Pay them the money.

172
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:21,730
Just do exactly as they
say, or they will kill me.

173
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,725
Daddy, they will kill
me if you don't.

174
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:28,483
Please, Daddy.

175
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,533
Just do exactly as
they say, please.

176
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,589
Just pay them the money.

177
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,259
I want to come home.

178
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:41,150
Just give them the
money, please.

179
00:23:53,853 --> 00:23:55,261
Thank you.

180
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,189
No, no, please. I won't cry.

181
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,144
My arms hurt.

182
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,201
Uncuff her.

183
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,647
Move them around a bit.

184
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,330
Go on.

185
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:22,949
Better?

186
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:25,554
A little.

187
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:27,303
Tie her up.

188
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,769
Please Daddy.

189
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,919
They just pay them the money.
I want to come home.

190
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:42,162
Just give them the
money, please.

191
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:49,107
This is good.

192
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,820
This'll work.

193
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:56,431
- She did well.
- She did.

194
00:24:57,778 --> 00:24:59,488
She was a good choice.

195
00:25:01,123 --> 00:25:03,305
She was a good find, then.

196
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,134
Don't fall asleep.

197
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:13,009
These will keep you awake.

198
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,267
Keep an eye on her.

199
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:16,999
She's worth a lot
of money to us.

200
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,646
I know.

201
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:21,166
Take care.

202
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:34,777
No.

203
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,654
No.

204
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:40,531
Get this off.

205
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,282
I can't.

206
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,341
I can't go with you watching me.

207
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:07,098
Could you just leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

208
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,953
I can't shit with you
staring at me, just..

209
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,373
Please.

210
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:15,058
I can't do it with you standing
there and looking at me.

211
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:00,995
Let me go! Let me go!

212
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,944
Give me the fucking keys
and cut the machine!

213
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,666
I'll kill you when I get the
keys from you.. bloody..

214
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,916
It's Danny. It's Danny.

215
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:12,546
It's me, Danny.

216
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,876
What?

217
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,218
It's me, Alice.

218
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,354
- It's me.
- Danny.

219
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:21,981
- What the fuck are you doing.
- Put the gun down.

220
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:24,057
- The gun Alice, the gun.
- Was it you? Was it you?

221
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:26,921
- There is a plan.
- A plan? Fuck!

222
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,000
- Danny!
- Just put the fucking gun down
before you kill me, Alice.

223
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:34,247
Just get me the fuck out of here.
Unlock me right fucking now.

224
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:36,564
Hold on, alright, okay.
Just listen to me first.

225
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,458
- We're getting some
money from your dad.
- What?

226
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:39,320
A lot of money.

227
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:40,735
You always sayin' how
much you hate your dad.

228
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:42,163
What the fuck are
you talking about?

229
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:44,512
You hate him Alice,
he cut you off.

230
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:47,419
He's got all that fucking money,
and he's never gonna get..

231
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:50,158
You've always talked about a way
of getting his money off him.

232
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,628
This is it, Alice.

233
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,230
This is how.

234
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,063
This is how we can
get his money.

235
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:57,669
But, you've fucking
kidnapped me.

236
00:28:57,827 --> 00:28:59,715
Yes. I kidnapped you for us.

237
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,461
- The money is for us. It's all for us.
- What?

238
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,821
Look, this is a
good thing, Alice.

239
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:06,257
Good?

240
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,839
You've fucking kidnapped me.

241
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:13,637
You've fucking stripped me naked, you
made me piss in a fucking bottle ..

242
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,792
in front of.. who?

243
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:17,271
Who the fuck is the other man?
Do I know him too?

244
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:19,394
No no. It's Victor. It's Vic.

245
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:21,282
He's no one. He's no one.

246
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:23,843
I met him on the other side.
He doesn't know.

247
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:24,539
About what?

248
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:25,595
About us.

249
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:29,343
He thinks you're just a random rich girl.
He hasn't got the whole picture.

250
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,035
He thinks all this is his plan.

251
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,387
He doesn't suspect that we're
gonna take all the money.

252
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:38,922
All of it, me and you.

253
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:42,748
You've fucking kidnapped me, so I
can get some of my dad's money.

254
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:45,346
Uh.. yeah.

255
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:49,003
Then why the fuck didn't
you ask me first?

256
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:52,269
I thought I was gonna fucking die, here.
I was fucking terrified.

257
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:53,669
I know, I know. I
am sorry, right.

258
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:57,446
But it had to look real.
Feel real.. for Vic.

259
00:29:57,584 --> 00:29:58,600
For you.

260
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,024
Look real?

261
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:03,497
Can't fucking do that
to somebody, Danny.

262
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,942
You can't make them think
they're gonna fucking die.

263
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:07,689
You can't fake it, Alice,

264
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:08,971
not properly.

265
00:30:09,112 --> 00:30:12,008
He would have seen if you're pretending.
He would have known.

266
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:16,241
You told me you loved me.

267
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,727
You told me that you loved me.

268
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,237
I do, baby.

269
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,051
That's why. That's why I did
this, because I love you.

270
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:28,073
I was gonna tell the
truth out, I was.

271
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:29,484
What would you have said?

272
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:32,304
Sorry I fucking kidnapped you. Sorry,
I've totally fucking humiliated you.

273
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:34,049
But we will be rich, Alice.

274
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:35,960
Rich!

275
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:37,531
How much?

276
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:39,341
How much am I worth?

277
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,802
Two million.

278
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:45,550
And he is gonna pay..
2 million, cash.

279
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:47,001
Untraceable.

280
00:30:47,898 --> 00:30:49,880
All you have to do
is lie in that bed.

281
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:51,477
Tied down..

282
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:54,514
humiliated, abused.

283
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,178
It will only be for
another day or so.

284
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:57,995
Not too much to ask
for 2 million?

285
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,316
For a whole new life.

286
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:02,349
Alice..

287
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,831
I love you, truly.

288
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:10,089
So, can I have my gun back?

289
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:14,450
Alice, please.

290
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:16,514
Just do this.

291
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,121
Fuck!

292
00:31:21,165 --> 00:31:24,627
It's him. He's back. He's back.

293
00:31:24,852 --> 00:31:26,219
You have to give me the gun.

294
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,554
If I do not answer the
door, he'll kick it in.

295
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,946
If he comes in here and
sees us like this..

296
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,779
he'll go fucking crazy.

297
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:35,804
He'll fucking kill us both.

298
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:39,084
You won't escape, Alice.

299
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:40,181
He'll kill ye.

300
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:41,793
I'm not joking.

301
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:44,098
Don't be stupid.

302
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:45,456
Give me the gun.

303
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:47,658
Please.

304
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:52,006
Let him fucking hurt me.

305
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,342
I won't.

306
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,056
Danny.

307
00:32:08,854 --> 00:32:10,356
Promise me.

308
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,793
I promise.

309
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:35,895
Where the fuck were you?

310
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:37,706
She's taking a shit. I had
to keep the gun on her.

311
00:32:37,824 --> 00:32:38,980
And you did it by yourself?

312
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,295
It's no problem. I
just watched her.

313
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:42,203
Look at me! Look at me!

314
00:32:42,447 --> 00:32:43,469
Is she ok?

315
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:44,423
Yeah.

316
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:46,113
Go look if you like.

317
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:06,420
Speak to her dad? Saw the video?

318
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:09,226
I think he now understands the
gravity of the situation.

319
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:10,446
So when is the exchange?

320
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:11,992
Tomorrow.

321
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:13,599
- You made the arrangement?
- No.

322
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:15,494
He don't have time to prepare.

323
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,999
As soon as he gets the money,
then we start it moving.

324
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:19,961
- So it's all ok?
- Yeah.

325
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:22,586
- This is gonna work?
- Of course it is.

326
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:29,279
You should get some sleep.
We have a busy day tomorrow.

327
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,482
You don't want to?

328
00:33:30,483 --> 00:33:33,276
No. There is too much
adrenaline running through me.

329
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:34,379
You sleep first.

330
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,694
You need me to check on her?

331
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,705
I think I can handle
it for a while.

332
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:41,034
- Are you sure?
- Oh yeah.

333
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:51,568
Use this!

334
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,898
Thanks.

335
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:01,933
Sleep tight.

336
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:34,158
Fuck!

337
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:36,439
What time is it? Why
didn't you wake me up?

338
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,761
I didn't need to fucking
fall asleep, did I?

339
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:40,287
Shit! The girl.

340
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,637
Wake up!

341
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:19,686
Wake up, Ms. Creed.

342
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,615
It's breakfast time.

343
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,063
It's minestrone.

344
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:48,468
It's hot.

345
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,758
Oops.

346
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:57,348
Got it.

347
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:13,587
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

348
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:37,620
What are you doing?

349
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,196
Go back to the other side
and keep her in the eye.

350
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:11,831
Finished.

351
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:13,515
Good.

352
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:15,109
Open up!

353
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,459
Give it to me.

354
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:31,470
Give me the spoon.

355
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:00,341
- What's gone into you?
- Nothing.

356
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:01,606
I'm fine.

357
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:02,775
You don't look fine.

358
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:07,089
Don't start thinking.

359
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,614
I need you focused.

360
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,605
I am.

361
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:15,217
Are you sure?

362
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:16,795
Absolutely.

363
00:38:17,152 --> 00:38:19,517
Good. Cause I need you.

364
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,797
I can't do this without you.

365
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:25,883
You got me.

366
00:38:28,962 --> 00:38:30,099
Good boy.

367
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:35,867
Where you going?

368
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:41,015
Take a piss. Is that alright?

369
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:32,238
You okay in there?

370
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:37,860
Danny, what's wrong?

371
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,488
Everything is fine.

372
00:39:41,854 --> 00:39:42,398
Are you sure?

373
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:44,605
But.. I'll just be a second.

374
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:46,945
Danny, are you okay in there?

375
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:50,169
Danny?

376
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:51,104
Danny?

377
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:53,332
Danny!

378
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:55,348
What the fuck are
you doing in there?

379
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:56,326
Nothing.

380
00:39:56,502 --> 00:39:59,644
Danny, open this door right
now, or I'll kick it in.

381
00:40:00,347 --> 00:40:01,770
Open this fucking door!

382
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:03,978
Open this fucking door, now!

383
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:05,949
Right, I'm coming in!

384
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:11,880
- Jesus fuck.. What the fuck..?
- Why the fuck don't you open the door?

385
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:14,070
I do not know what you..

386
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:16,634
I was worried.

387
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,237
I said I would be
out in a second.

388
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,197
Something wouldn't go down.

389
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,823
You said you just
needed to piss.

390
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,341
Thought I did.

391
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,977
It's gone now.

392
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:35,324
Sometimes a jam.

393
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,019
What?

394
00:40:42,382 --> 00:40:44,245
Doesn't smell of
any stink of you.

395
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,295
My shit don't stink.
What can I say?

396
00:40:50,468 --> 00:40:52,972
Jus' wash your hands and
stop fucking about!

397
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,563
It's the adrenaline.

398
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:07,292
Suddenly you shit.

399
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:10,068
Bad taste in your mouth.

400
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:12,258
Because of the adrenaline.

401
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:14,322
Happened to me when I
made the first call.

402
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:19,329
Just relax, Danny.

403
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:22,552
We need air.

404
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,501
Not long till the bank opens.

405
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:29,673
And after that.. showtime.

406
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,206
We're gonna be rich.
Me and you.

407
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:36,272
We're gonna be millionaires.

408
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:39,468
We're nearly there, Dan.

409
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:42,375
We're nearly there.

410
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:44,106
You're all up?

411
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:45,757
I'm good.

412
00:41:48,312 --> 00:41:52,699
- Are you sure?
- Why is that?

413
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:56,668
Two days..

414
00:41:57,509 --> 00:41:59,930
we're gonna be on the
other side of the world.

415
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,774
Just me and you.

416
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,715
Just me and you.

417
00:42:06,714 --> 00:42:09,837
Away from this shit.
Away from the past.

418
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:13,090
And we're startin' new lives,

419
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:14,924
and new people,

420
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:19,816
being happy.

421
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:25,138
But the first two weeks,
we'll hardly get out a bit.

422
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:31,172
We'll just order room service,
and fuck each other senseless.

423
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,528
That sounds perfect.

424
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,560
Destiny.

425
00:43:08,495 --> 00:43:10,564
Gotta go.

426
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:12,922
I see you soon.

427
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:16,233
You take care.

428
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:17,842
You too.

429
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:27,330
I love you.

430
00:43:29,177 --> 00:43:31,129
I love you too, baby.

431
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:12,284
- Are you alright?
- Where is he?

432
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,424
It's gonna happen soon.

433
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,542
That fucking bullet case.
I thought he'd seen it.

434
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:19,320
It's Ok. Got rid of it.

435
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:20,597
How long until he comes back?

436
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:21,888
An hour I guess.

437
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:23,857
Maybe less.

438
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:25,624
Untie me.

439
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:29,278
Come on, Danny. Untie me.

440
00:44:29,855 --> 00:44:31,036
He's gone.

441
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:52,726
Danny?

442
00:44:52,953 --> 00:44:54,193
The other one?

443
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:56,636
Danny? What's wrong?

444
00:44:57,556 --> 00:44:59,330
Come on, Danny. Unlock it.

445
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:01,166
- Do you fucking trust me?
- Of course, but..

446
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:04,351
But what? I let you gag me,
tie me back up, that..

447
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:07,010
I fucking trusted you, so
you can fucking trust me.

448
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,224
I do trust you too.

449
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:09,403
But what?

450
00:45:09,765 --> 00:45:11,671
- You think I'm gonna run?
- No, I do not.

451
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:13,240
Look, place the end right.

452
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:16,573
As soon he comes back, we're
taking it to the exchange..

453
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:17,959
Are we gonna get the money?

454
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,948
Yeah.

455
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,693
Why would I run?

456
00:45:25,983 --> 00:45:27,153
I am sorry.

457
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:31,278
I'm just jumpy.

458
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,366
This is fucking stressful.

459
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:41,248
You think?

460
00:45:50,753 --> 00:45:51,737
Thanks.

461
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:58,055
Those things are very
fucking painful.

462
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:02,913
- Pins and needles in my fingers and toes.
- Yeah

463
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,379
- Better?
- Ok.

464
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:17,728
Danny, what if your friend..

465
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:20,532
think.. what if he..

466
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:23,521
- What if he is onto us?
What if he suspects us?
- He doesn't.

467
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:26,815
- Yeah, but what if he does?
- Believe me, he hasn't got a clue.

468
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,745
How did you do it?

469
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:32,446
- What?
- How did you get him to
agree to pick me for this?

470
00:46:32,576 --> 00:46:34,525
You fit his criteria.

471
00:46:34,945 --> 00:46:40,097
Attractive Female. In
her 20s, only child.

472
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:44,229
- Slim enough to cat easy.
- Jesus.

473
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:46,458
Vic's been planning
this forever.

474
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,875
Old-timer in prison
talked about it.

475
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:51,505
I never really thought
he would do it, but..

476
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:54,653
When he got out,
he contacted me.

477
00:46:55,136 --> 00:46:57,152
He set about looking
for a target.

478
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:02,194
Of course, then afterward..

479
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:04,035
So he tested me?

480
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:07,617
But you did not tell him that
we knew each other from before?

481
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:08,690
Of course not.

482
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:12,641
Dad's on the rich list.

483
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:15,664
He said just write your name in
that newspaper article though.

484
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:17,693
I even cut it out
and gave it to Vic.

485
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:19,998
He went for you right away.

486
00:47:20,115 --> 00:47:23,137
He said you were "Perfect".

487
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:28,026
- Where is he now?
- Arranging the exchange.

488
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:28,861
At the..?

489
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,852
Near the river. Driving nearby.

490
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:34,199
So he can escape, and
dad can find you.

491
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:35,714
And Vic gets the money.

492
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:38,149
- By himself?
- I stay with you.

493
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,976
But he could just steal
it and disappear.

494
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:40,856
Ah no, he wouldn't.

495
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,880
How can you be sure?

496
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:43,530
I just am.

497
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:44,761
Trust me.

498
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,769
It's not even considered.

499
00:47:48,143 --> 00:47:50,208
And when he's getting the money,
I'll be setting you free.

500
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,724
And once he has money, I'm
going to take it from him,

501
00:47:55,522 --> 00:47:56,826
and we meet up,

502
00:47:57,816 --> 00:47:59,173
get the fuck out of here.

503
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,702
How you take the money?

504
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:03,281
He trusts me.

505
00:48:04,107 --> 00:48:05,076
It will be easy.

506
00:48:05,568 --> 00:48:08,339
- He trusts you?
- Completely.

507
00:48:13,564 --> 00:48:15,240
- Danny?
- What?

508
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,413
I'm scared.

509
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:20,232
- Don't let me..
- I am sorry.

510
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,918
It's ok.

511
00:48:23,915 --> 00:48:25,786
I won't let anything
happen to you.

512
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:27,708
Trust me.

513
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:30,475
Everything's going to be fine.

514
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:40,833
- Danny?
- What?

515
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:51,771
I love you so much.

516
00:48:53,194 --> 00:48:55,241
I love you too, baby.

517
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:19,108
Alice, this isn't fucking funny.

518
00:50:19,235 --> 00:50:20,115
I'm warning you.

519
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:22,413
What the fuck! What the
fuck are you doing?

520
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:23,637
What the fuck do you
think I'm doing?

521
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,662
- Alice, you can't do this.
- Fuck you!

522
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:26,982
I was so close.

523
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,611
- Close what?
- You fucking kidnapped me, you cunt.

524
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:31,601
You do not expect me to sit
around and just let it happen?

525
00:50:31,736 --> 00:50:34,002
- But we had a plan.
- No, you had a plan.

526
00:50:34,194 --> 00:50:35,781
This is my plan.

527
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:38,593
Alice, Alice come back!

528
00:50:51,513 --> 00:50:53,662
Police! Quick. I
need the police.

529
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:55,660
Why don't you come and get me?
I have been kidnapped.

530
00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:58,278
I haven’t got much time.
I don't know where I am.

531
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:00,827
No, I've been locked here.
I can't get out.

532
00:51:04,577 --> 00:51:06,290
No. I don't recognize anything.

533
00:51:06,425 --> 00:51:07,444
I'm up high.

534
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:10,746
Can't you trace the call?

535
00:51:10,794 --> 00:51:12,889
Yeah. Ah, thank God.

536
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,462
How long will that take?

537
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,010
How long?

538
00:51:16,138 --> 00:51:18,145
No, no-no-no. You have
to come get me now.

539
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:20,190
If the other guy's coming
back, he'll kill me.

540
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:22,204
He's gonna come back. He's
gonna fucking kill me.

541
00:51:22,328 --> 00:51:24,312
You're have to come right now,
right now, right fucking now!

542
00:51:24,446 --> 00:51:27,265
Calm down? He's gonna
fucking kill me.

543
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:35,466
Wait a second.

544
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:37,598
I think, I can get the keys.

545
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:01,801
I love you.

546
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,522
I fucking love you.

547
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,227
And you love me, I know you do.

548
00:52:05,364 --> 00:52:07,071
- I know you do.
- Where are the keys?

549
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:09,631
Alice, you can't do this.

550
00:52:10,338 --> 00:52:11,425
I love you.

551
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:13,001
No, Danny.

552
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:18,355
When you love someone, you do
everything you can to care for them.

553
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:23,445
What you don't do,
is kidnap them.

554
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:25,081
Understand?

555
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:27,661
You don't fucking jump
them in the streets,

556
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:29,771
and put them in the
back of a van.

557
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:32,485
You don't put a fucking
knife to their throats.

558
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:34,547
The keys!

559
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:40,450
I swear it to God, Danny.

560
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:43,091
You need to tell me
where the keys are.

561
00:52:44,298 --> 00:52:46,887
In my pocket, right-hand pocket.

562
00:52:52,927 --> 00:52:54,551
Go back on the bed!

563
00:52:56,182 --> 00:52:58,257
Get back on the fucking bed!

564
00:53:02,035 --> 00:53:04,011
Don't fucking move!

565
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:46,864
The safety was on.

566
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:50,448
Not anymore.

567
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:52,194
The keys?

568
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,595
Throw me the fucking keys!

569
00:54:29,554 --> 00:54:32,673
Oh, c'mon.. fuck.. c'mon

570
00:54:38,185 --> 00:54:39,674
I'm fucked.

571
00:54:41,787 --> 00:54:42,801
Fuck!

572
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:53,507
Why didn't you
just listen to me?

573
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,068
All would have been alright
if you just listened to me.

574
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:53,525
Is everything okay?

575
00:56:55,013 --> 00:56:56,539
- Top-notch.
- She still in there?

576
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:58,848
- Where else would she be?
- Yeah..

577
00:56:59,721 --> 00:57:00,961
Yes of course. It's just..

578
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:05,879
It's time. It's on.

579
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:06,977
- He's got the money?
- Yeah.

580
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:08,783
He's just waiting
at the location.

581
00:57:08,946 --> 00:57:11,302
This is really quite
a fucking work.

582
00:57:12,658 --> 00:57:15,414
Right. We have to move her outta
there & put her in the warehouse.

583
00:57:15,447 --> 00:57:16,737
- When do we leave?
- Now!

584
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:18,214
We move now.

585
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:28,476
This is it.

586
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:31,974
We're gonna have to move you now.
Understand?

587
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,672
Nod if you understand.

588
00:57:38,011 --> 00:57:40,649
Hey! Wake up!

589
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:43,933
She's air-cold.

590
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:45,621
What the fuck did you do?

591
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:46,856
Nothing. I thought
she was sleeping.

592
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:48,596
Fuck! Must be the gag that's
complicated her throat.

593
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:49,947
Is she alright?

594
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,262
Wait here.

595
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:07,999
Thank God.

596
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,633
I thought we had killed her.

597
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:12,719
Wake up, Miss Creed.

598
00:58:13,172 --> 00:58:13,987
Wake up.

599
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:15,124
Say something.

600
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:17,611
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Are you okay? Say something.

601
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:19,178
You need to calm down.

602
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:20,603
She's alright.

603
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:22,677
Everything is fine.

604
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:26,227
She's got a minute to breathe.

605
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:30,812
Come on. Let's just
have a minute together,

606
00:58:30,983 --> 00:58:32,129
to re-focus.

607
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,464
Come on.

608
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,994
Look at me.

609
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:40,253
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

610
00:58:41,823 --> 00:58:43,212
Shit. Fuck.

611
00:58:47,097 --> 00:58:48,805
Will you do something for me?

612
00:58:50,149 --> 00:58:51,083
What?

613
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:54,341
Tell me what to do.

614
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:57,114
I need you to stop worrying.

615
00:58:57,239 --> 00:58:58,407
And just be back.

616
00:58:58,899 --> 00:59:02,023
Makes confident.
That pushes me on..to be mean.

617
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:02,812
Me?

618
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:05,262
Meanest fuck.

619
00:59:06,534 --> 00:59:07,900
That's the back I want.

620
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,925
That's the guy they want.

621
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:12,101
So c'mon,

622
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:13,718
push me right.

623
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:15,503
Tell me what to do.

624
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,385
Stand the fuck up.

625
00:59:26,282 --> 00:59:28,020
Go, put on your coat.

626
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,963
I can't put the van
into position.

627
00:59:40,632 --> 00:59:42,002
The van?

628
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:44,491
- Now?
- Yes, fucking now!

629
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:46,665
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna pack the bag.

630
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:49,048
- But don't unpack.
- Just fucking do it!

631
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,462
Now!

632
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,298
Go on!

633
01:00:04,903 --> 01:00:05,806
No! Please.

634
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:08,108
No, wait. Please wait.
Wait a second.

635
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:14,417
What the fuck?

636
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:15,664
How did you get this?

637
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:17,279
How the fuck did you get this?

638
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:19,855
Quietly.

639
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:21,320
Tell me how you got it.

640
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:22,721
Tell me!

641
01:00:22,846 --> 01:00:23,846
I don't know.

642
01:00:24,164 --> 01:00:25,401
How did you fucking get it?

643
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:26,555
I don't know.

644
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:28,386
Please let.. I don't want
to cause any trouble.

645
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,353
I just wanna do
exactly as you say.

646
01:00:30,474 --> 01:00:31,456
999.

647
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,273
Police.

648
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,234
Did you call the police?

649
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:38,478
- The fucking police..
did you call the police?
- I don't know, I just..

650
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:40,073
Tell me the truth.

651
01:00:41,144 --> 01:00:43,566
How could I? I've been up
tied up since I got here.

652
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,135
Then how did you get
that fucking phone?

653
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:46,581
- Don't know.
- Tell me the truth.

654
01:00:46,766 --> 01:00:47,637
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

655
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,247
I don't know it. Don't know.

656
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:51,549
Please don't.

657
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:53,389
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

658
01:00:53,512 --> 01:00:56,197
Tell me! Tell me!
Fucking tell me!

659
01:00:56,322 --> 01:00:58,329
Please stop it! No!

660
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:02,163
Danny, help me. Danny. Danny!

661
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:04,257
Danny!

662
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:05,725
How do you know that name.

663
01:01:06,189 --> 01:01:09,182
Help me, please, Danny.

664
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,179
How did you know his name.

665
01:01:12,481 --> 01:01:13,123
Do you know him?

666
01:01:13,243 --> 01:01:14,657
No, I..

667
01:01:14,778 --> 01:01:16,223
He just told me his name.

668
01:01:16,365 --> 01:01:18,369
- He gave you the phone.
- No.

669
01:01:19,082 --> 01:01:19,980
You phoned?

670
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:21,598
And you throw it down?

671
01:01:23,761 --> 01:01:24,825
What else is there?

672
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:29,478
- I don't know. Please. Please..
- Fuck!

673
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:32,530
Fuck!

674
01:01:33,009 --> 01:01:34,799
Please, please
just take me home.

675
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:36,176
Shut up!

676
01:01:59,003 --> 01:02:01,527
- What happened here?
- Nothing.

677
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,109
Just take me home, please.

678
01:02:03,249 --> 01:02:04,077
Please.

679
01:02:04,749 --> 01:02:06,145
- This is a bullet.
- I don't know.

680
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,041
I don't know.

681
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:08,609
Who fired the gun?

682
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:12,485
Who fired the gun?

683
01:02:13,379 --> 01:02:16,723
Please just take me home. I don't..
I've done nothing!

684
01:02:16,758 --> 01:02:19,112
You tell me, or I
swear to God ..

685
01:02:19,262 --> 01:02:21,674
you'll never see
your family again.

686
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,483
Tell me!

687
01:02:28,084 --> 01:02:29,379
I fired.

688
01:02:32,637 --> 01:02:35,101
I needed the toilet.

689
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:37,403
He turned his back,

690
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:39,939
I hit him, and took his gun.

691
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:41,821
Well, if you got the gun,

692
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:44,604
then why you still here?

693
01:02:44,742 --> 01:02:48,469
Because.. because
he's gonna fuck you.

694
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:50,882
He's gonna take the money.

695
01:02:51,019 --> 01:02:52,349
The whole two million.

696
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,365
I am still here because
he made a deal with me.

697
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:57,636
He said if I went
along with the Plan..

698
01:02:57,769 --> 01:02:58,635
he would..

699
01:02:59,223 --> 01:03:01,742
He would give you
some of the money.

700
01:03:04,066 --> 01:03:05,884
It all went so quickly, and

701
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,460
you were coming back.

702
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:09,338
I couldn't get away, so..

703
01:03:09,547 --> 01:03:10,898
I agreed.

704
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:14,816
I am sorry.

705
01:03:19,536 --> 01:03:21,235
But now you know.

706
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:22,493
You can..

707
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:25,368
You can go along with the plan.

708
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,247
You can just pick up the money..

709
01:03:28,676 --> 01:03:30,551
and you can disappear.

710
01:03:31,297 --> 01:03:33,426
He can fuck him instead, right?

711
01:03:34,673 --> 01:03:36,570
You can take the
money, all of it.

712
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:40,752
Fuck him, right?

713
01:03:41,293 --> 01:03:45,194
You can just take me
back to my father.

714
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:48,978
You can take me
back to my family.

715
01:03:49,234 --> 01:03:51,835
All I want is to go
back to my home.

716
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:56,917
Please, please, please..

717
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,982
What is my name?

718
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:04,355
What?

719
01:04:05,747 --> 01:04:08,320
I.. I don't know.

720
01:04:09,165 --> 01:04:10,409
I don't know your name.

721
01:04:10,503 --> 01:04:11,796
Yes, you do.

722
01:04:12,813 --> 01:04:14,172
He told you.

723
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:19,671
Tell me now, please.

724
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,474
He didn't tell me your name.

725
01:04:24,703 --> 01:04:25,235
Please.

726
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:26,539
You're lying.

727
01:04:26,674 --> 01:04:28,288
Please. I just want to go home.

728
01:04:28,418 --> 01:04:30,971
- I can see you're lying..
- I just wanna to go home.

729
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:22,661
What's wrong?

730
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:24,829
Why would anything be wrong?

731
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:28,586
You just seem a bit..

732
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:29,844
A bit what?

733
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:32,006
Shall we go, get her up?

734
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:34,379
I already did it.

735
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:36,112
I was just in there.

736
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:37,550
You were?

737
01:05:49,015 --> 01:05:50,104
Is she alright?

738
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,403
Vic, is she alright?

739
01:06:11,857 --> 01:06:13,566
I'm going for a piss.

740
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,880
Wait here.

741
01:06:46,216 --> 01:06:47,861
Danny, tell me something?

742
01:06:48,023 --> 01:06:50,059
Why did you choose her?

743
01:06:52,888 --> 01:06:54,284
I didn't choose her.

744
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,894
You choose her?

745
01:06:56,036 --> 01:06:57,477
Yes, but you suggested her.

746
01:06:57,826 --> 01:06:58,797
Why?

747
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:02,246
You know why?

748
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:04,431
I read about her
in the newspaper.

749
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,370
What's this all about, Vic?

750
01:07:06,506 --> 01:07:08,980
Jus'.. something doesn't
feel quite right.

751
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:10,256
What d'you mean?

752
01:07:10,389 --> 01:07:11,740
Just now..

753
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:14,368
she was acting funny.

754
01:07:14,722 --> 01:07:16,578
Why? What did she say?

755
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:18,055
Say?

756
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:23,156
Why would you think
she'd say anything?

757
01:07:24,022 --> 01:07:25,531
I don't.. Ah..

758
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:29,209
- You said she was acting funny.
- Yeah.

759
01:07:29,323 --> 01:07:31,411
I didn't say she said anything.

760
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:33,149
What could she say?

761
01:07:34,308 --> 01:07:36,475
What do you think she would say?

762
01:07:38,841 --> 01:07:40,223
Come here.

763
01:07:41,377 --> 01:07:44,089
I said, come here!

764
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:06,707
- Tell me you love me.
- What?

765
01:08:06,907 --> 01:08:08,603
Tell me..

766
01:08:08,766 --> 01:08:10,638
you love me.

767
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,973
I love you, babe.

768
01:08:15,277 --> 01:08:16,912
Truly.

769
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:21,421
Let's get this thing done!

770
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:17,523
Wait here.

771
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:17,473
What happened to her face?

772
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:18,399
I told you.

773
01:11:18,536 --> 01:11:19,928
She was acting funny.

774
01:11:20,029 --> 01:11:21,845
So I had to give her a slap.

775
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:31,518
Bryce, give me your set-keys.

776
01:11:31,549 --> 01:11:32,778
You got your own set,
why do you want mine?

777
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:35,573
Because you don't need
them anymore, do you?

778
01:11:36,222 --> 01:11:38,057
Why? Is there a problem?

779
01:11:38,198 --> 01:11:39,080
No problem.

780
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:41,069
Then give them to me.

781
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:56,437
Bryce, let's go.

782
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:57,909
To where?

783
01:11:58,233 --> 01:11:59,502
Let's go and get the money.

784
01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:00,851
Both of us?

785
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,219
The plan was I would stay here.

786
01:12:02,344 --> 01:12:03,953
- Plan has changed.
- Changed?

787
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,644
I need you to meet.

788
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:06,870
In case there's any surprises.

789
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:09,383
- Like what?
- If I knew that, they won't
be surprises, would they?

790
01:12:09,516 --> 01:12:11,230
But what if something happens?

791
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:12,401
What if we don't make it back?

792
01:12:12,593 --> 01:12:14,576
- We'll make it.
- But if we..?

793
01:12:15,141 --> 01:12:17,182
If we don't, she'll
be stuck here.

794
01:12:17,331 --> 01:12:19,473
- She'll die.
- So?

795
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:20,900
If we don't make it,

796
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,975
why do you care if
she don't make it?

797
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:28,155
I don't care.

798
01:12:28,392 --> 01:12:29,914
Good.

799
01:12:29,967 --> 01:12:31,991
Now, let's get the
fuck out of here!

800
01:13:19,284 --> 01:13:21,618
- You think it's there?
- Yeah.

801
01:13:22,271 --> 01:13:23,479
It's there.

802
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:25,416
Go out and get it!

803
01:13:25,548 --> 01:13:26,513
Me?

804
01:13:26,593 --> 01:13:27,529
Danny,

805
01:13:27,714 --> 01:13:29,564
just go and get the
fucking money!

806
01:13:32,285 --> 01:13:33,391
Now!

807
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:37,658
There's no fucking money.

808
01:14:38,217 --> 01:14:39,728
They fucked us over.

809
01:14:40,524 --> 01:14:43,270
- We're fucked up.
- No, they didn't fuck up.

810
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:47,457
The money is not here because I
didn't say it was at this location.

811
01:14:50,088 --> 01:14:51,289
The hole.

812
01:14:54,222 --> 01:14:56,764
- This hole is for the money.
- No.

813
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,958
Now, this hole is
for you, Danny.

814
01:15:01,868 --> 01:15:03,068
I didn't fuck up.

815
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,510
You did.

816
01:15:07,486 --> 01:15:08,733
Please.

817
01:15:08,878 --> 01:15:10,464
Don't do this.

818
01:15:16,565 --> 01:15:18,412
What did you tell her about me?

819
01:15:18,902 --> 01:15:19,963
Nothing.

820
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:21,775
You told her my name.

821
01:15:25,162 --> 01:15:26,939
Only your first name.

822
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:31,347
- Only that we met in prison,
that it, that's all.
- You fucking dealed.

823
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,132
You killed her, Danny.

824
01:15:34,981 --> 01:15:36,893
You've not only killed yourself,

825
01:15:37,756 --> 01:15:39,428
but you've killed her too.

826
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:42,013
You do not have to do this.

827
01:15:42,815 --> 01:15:44,610
We can just finish this,

828
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,464
like we planned.

829
01:15:48,072 --> 01:15:49,527
We'll go away.

830
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:51,991
We'll be happy.

831
01:15:52,206 --> 01:15:54,358
I'll do everything
you want me to.

832
01:15:55,132 --> 01:15:56,949
It'll just be you.

833
01:15:58,024 --> 01:15:59,576
That's what we wanted.

834
01:16:00,586 --> 01:16:01,995
I love you.

835
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:04,470
Close your eyes.

836
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:05,228
Danny,

837
01:16:05,348 --> 01:16:06,739
close your eyes.

838
01:16:07,197 --> 01:16:09,076
Do you remember when we met?

839
01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:11,478
Can you remember?

840
01:16:12,556 --> 01:16:14,961
We slept in the cell.

841
01:16:15,634 --> 01:16:17,265
I was scared.

842
01:16:18,169 --> 01:16:20,429
I was so fucking scared.

843
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:22,646
You protected me.

844
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:25,309
You.. helped me.

845
01:16:26,552 --> 01:16:28,302
I will never forget that.

846
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,213
I will never..

847
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:19,660
It's almost over.

848
01:20:21,132 --> 01:20:23,651
Please be still Miss Creed.

849
01:20:24,789 --> 01:20:27,152
It'll all be over very quickly.

850
01:20:27,493 --> 01:20:29,367
You will feel no pain.

851
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,868
Danny.

852
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:45,812
Danny, you're bleeding.

853
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:48,795
I can get you to a hospital.

854
01:20:49,889 --> 01:20:51,456
I'll get you fixed up.

855
01:20:58,403 --> 01:20:59,993
You'll die, Danny.

856
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:02,471
Listen!

857
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:04,598
You'll die.

858
01:21:06,764 --> 01:21:08,308
Let me help you.

859
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:09,479
Danny..

860
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,193
Let me protect you.

861
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,525
- Stand against the fucking wall!
- Ok.

862
01:21:17,428 --> 01:21:18,981
Whatever you want.

863
01:21:19,966 --> 01:21:20,805
Danny!

864
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:33,988
Ah, Danny..

865
01:21:35,267 --> 01:21:36,673
Get me off here.

866
01:21:40,086 --> 01:21:41,207
Keys?

867
01:21:41,794 --> 01:21:42,949
Toss the keys.

868
01:21:43,086 --> 01:21:44,246
Danny,

869
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:46,065
don't do this, please.

870
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:47,717
Give me the fucking keys!

871
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,896
Danny, you love me.

872
01:21:56,864 --> 01:21:57,723
I know you do.

873
01:21:57,855 --> 01:21:58,815
Shut up!

874
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:01,059
I felt him.

875
01:22:02,909 --> 01:22:04,398
When you held me..

876
01:22:06,503 --> 01:22:09,198
and you kissed me..
- Shut the fuck up.

877
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,459
When you made love me,

878
01:22:14,927 --> 01:22:16,511
there was no fucking doubt.

879
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:19,916
You love me.

880
01:22:21,857 --> 01:22:23,098
You love me.

881
01:22:23,793 --> 01:22:27,577
You give me the gun, and
I'll get you fixed up.

882
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:34,758
Give me the gun.

883
01:22:36,193 --> 01:22:38,916
Danny, don't give him the gun.

884
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:41,108
It's Ok my little Danny-boy.

885
01:22:41,237 --> 01:22:42,047
No!

886
01:22:42,632 --> 01:22:43,740
Don't give him the gun.

887
01:22:43,874 --> 01:22:44,670
It's Ok.

888
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:47,298
Get me out of here.
Don't, don't..

889
01:22:49,274 --> 01:22:50,448
Don't cry.

890
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,638
Don't, don't.. don't
give him the gun.

891
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:56,639
- Danny, don't listen to him.
- What I'm gonna do.. Danny!

892
01:22:59,652 --> 01:23:00,956
Danny!

893
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:37,936

01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:48,073

01:23:48,351 --> 01:23:50,068

- Shoulda listened.
- No.

898
01:23:58,085 --> 01:23:59,573
It's alright, babe.

899
01:24:00,838 --> 01:24:02,929

01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:08,640
No, Danny. Come back!

903
01:24:09,739 --> 01:24:12,347
Danny! Don't you

904
01:24:12,837 --> 01:24:14,485
Don't leave me here!

01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:19,362
Danny, come back.
Please come back.

906
