1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,949
Jane!

2
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,949
Jane!

3
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,551
Jane, it's me! Open up.

4
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Did you tell anyone?

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,589
Did I...

6
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,631
About the name.
The name?

7
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,234
Yeah, I told Rick.
He thought it was funny.

8
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,199
Just Rick and nobody else?

9
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,554
No.

10
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,031
Why, what's the matter?

11
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,918
Larry, what's wrong?

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,719
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,596
You have no idea
how sorry I am.

14
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,830
Larry, you're scaring me.

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,552
What are you doing?

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,353
Rick!

17
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,674
Ricky!

18
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,992
Rick, the name!

19
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,479
Janey!

20
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,150
Did you tell
anyone? Anyone!

21
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,029
Larry, please,
please! I...

22
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,156
Rick, he's coming!

23
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,514
The name!

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,917
Giselle. I told Giselle!

25
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,917
I'm going to stop you!

26
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,034
Giselle!

27
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,359
- Larry...
- Mom!

28
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,919
Who did you tell?

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,479
He killed them!

30
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,633
Don't think it.

31
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,176
- Mom, come on!
- Don't say it.

32
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,390
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

33
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,229
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

34
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,995
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

35
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,478
Giselle! Did you say the name?

36
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,835
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

37
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,548
Don't say it.

38
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,989
Don't say it.

39
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,595
Who did you say
the name to, Giselle?

40
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,990
What the hell are you...

41
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,195
Larry!

42
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,473
What's up, playboy?

43
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,879
How's it going?
Good.

44
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,838
Today is a good day.

45
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,268
You got the key?
No, it's under the mat.

46
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Oh! Come on.

47
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,793
It's only 20 minutes.

48
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,952
This is the first time he's rented the
place. The guy says it's fantastic.

49
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,936
What else would he say,
"It's a dog house"?

50
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,776
No, I'm trying to convince her,
let's go. Come on, man, work with me.

51
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,836
- Sash?
- Yeah. I'm up for it.

52
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,670
It's a little creepy. Right?

53
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,273
Nah, it's just cold.

54
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,188
Heat's off.

55
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,397
I've got to piss
like a race horse.

56
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,715
Cute.

57
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,519
Dude,
this place is sweet, bro.

58
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,189
Hey.

59
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,029
Right?

60
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,800
We could put
the desk over there.

61
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,157
We could put the bed here.

62
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,116
Well, maybe if
there was a bed.

63
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,433
I know, the landlord said
it was fully furnished.

64
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,310
Yo, El, come and check this out, man.
This is crazy.

65
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,436
Come on down.

66
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,719
Yo, El, come in here, man.

67
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,872
See, you can't get this
in the dorms, right?

68
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,030
Now, that's classic.

69
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,477
John, you really think Sasha
wants to see that, or that?

70
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,277
You got the whole upstairs
to make girly, okay?

71
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,508
I've definitely seen bigger.
See? You're awesome.

72
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,511
Bro, she's awesome, man.

73
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,468
Oh, yeah, you guys must've
been hilarious when you were young.

74
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,232
"Must've been"? Are.

75
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,992
Tier 1.

76
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,913
Hey, he made me look smart,
and I made him look ugly.

77
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,956
But after the crash,
he took care of me.

78
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,273
Talk shit about my
boy's folks, you're done.

79
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,275
Okay, when
the Tier 1 s are both ready

80
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,635
to cook and clean and help me
do this place up right.

81
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,554
'Cause I'm not going
to be your guys' maid.

82
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,279
Of course not.
I told him. Right?

83
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,200
Well, I never cooked you
my butter pasta-nette.

84
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,153
That is not a thing.

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,432
That's 'cause I invented it.
Okay.

86
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,794
And I clean, too.

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,233
I promise.

88
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,508
Yo, what does this do?

89
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,635
Yeah, you cook.

90
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,154
Yes, I cook, okay?
I don't bake.

91
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Found the furniture.

92
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,550
I've heard about
you and all the girls.

93
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,109
And that's exactly why we
need to get out of the dorms.

94
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,228
This is perfect.

95
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,151
Whoa. Easy.

96
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,679
You all right?

97
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,757
Yeah, thanks.

98
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,355
So, it looks like
the landlord wasn't lying.

99
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,839
Wow.

100
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,079
Damn, son.

101
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,353
Hey, I like this.

102
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Ow. Fuck.

103
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,435
So?

104
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,749
Don't you want to?

105
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,634
Well, yeah, yeah.
I do. Now I know you...

106
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,075
Yo, all the dishes in here,
they're white.

107
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Just saying.

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,038
He touches everything.

109
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,349
It's up to you, Bear.

110
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,016
I can't afford it without him.
I know you can, but I don't...

111
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,314
Elliot. Elliot.

112
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,792
Yeah?
We're doing it. Obviously.

113
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,393
Yeah?
Yeah.

114
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,192
I see she approves, huh?

115
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,873
Hey, you need a hand?
No, I got this.

116
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,754
Okay, don't break yourself.
Better than going to the gym, right?

117
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,151
Hey, Elliot?
Yeah?

118
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,835
Hey, did you hear that banging?
Yeah.

119
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,635
The radiators sound worse.

120
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,432
Okay, Bear,
here it is.

121
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,190
Rilke says, "Coins symbolize the
wonder and terror of fortune.

122

127
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,949
Hmm.

128
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,631
Thanks for
finding me that quote.

129
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,915
You wanna watch
something stupid?

130
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Mmm-hmm.

131
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,915
Just us, yeah.

132
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,872
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

133
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,678
Hey, what's on the bed?

134
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,878
"You look like
a model from the '70s.

Elliot?

147

Hey.

148
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,953
What's wrong?

149
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,395
Hey!

150
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,068
What's up, man?

151
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,496
Oh, Little brother!
How's it going?

152
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,720
Look at this place. Fantastic.

153
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,955
Hi, darling.
Hey.

154
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,993
Hi, Uncle Elliot!

155
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,991
Hey, Niece Alice!
Hey, hey.

156
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Hey, there.
Hey.

157
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,708
Sorry we're so early,
your brother's pathological.

158
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,756
It's called being
prompt and professional.

159
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,432
Virgil's awesome.
Thank you.

160
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,831
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

161

Here's your
housewarming present.

162
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,719
You going to help me drink it?

No!

Look at this.

165
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,069
So, a house off-campus with John
Henry and a live-in girlfriend.

166
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,229
You ready for this?

167
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,038
She's the one, Virgil.

168
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,712
She did all this herself.

169
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,792
That's great, it's just,
you know... Be smart.

170
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,438
Be a student, man.

171
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,432
It's the last time to have no
responsibilities. Enjoy it.

172
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,351
I don't want that.
I want what you have.

173
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,908
An amazing wife,
an amazing daughter.

174
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,279
Well,
just don't rush it.

175
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,918
That's all out
there waiting for you.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,912
Believe me,
what I have is great. It is.

177
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,830
But I missed out on all this.

178
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,957
I mean, what a college edu-ma-cation
could have done for me.

179
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,634
You have a scholarship, man.

180
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,472
You should be
upstairs studying right now.

181
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,678
Jesus. It's a good
thing you're not jealous.

182
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
It is good.

183
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,496
Come on, man,
you got this. You got this!

184
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,536
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

185
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,754
All right, all right.

186
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,549
Baby!

187
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,352
Bam!
Thank you! Thank you!

188
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,671
An oldy-old
gold coin, huh?

189
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,794
Yeah, I put it back on the
little table next to the bed.

190
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,029
I didn't want to keep it.

191
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,792
It's 'cause you're the best,
most honest,

192
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,474
smartest, cutest, heaviest,
oldest person here.

193
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,028
I'm not the heaviest,
or the oldest.

194
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,736
Dad's the oldest
and he's the heaviest.

195
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,909
What?

196
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,874
She ratted me out.

197
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,634
Here.

198
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,994
Head-bump.

199
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,834
Fist-bump.

200
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,835
That's John's room,
we're upstairs.

201
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,360
All right,
we're out of here.

202
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,556
Buddy, great party.

203
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,755
Be good.

204
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,674
Bye, guys. Bye, Alice.

205
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,230
Kim? She's in my Lit class.

206
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,078
Girls who wear hats inside are crazy,
you know that, right?

207
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,520
She's going to do a psychic
cleansing after everyone leaves.

208
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,670
Cool, can I leave, too?
No.

209
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,433
She's just gonna burn some sage,
and you are going to be nice.

210
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,871
Maybe you need a hat.

211
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,069
It's a twist-off.

212
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,513
Oh, thank you.

213
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,591
John, do you think
this house is creepy?

214
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,999
Mmm.
Yup.

215
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,036
I don't, but I'm not a girl.

216
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,112
And I think you should get dressed,
'cause we're playing baseball.

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,515
Why do jocks always have to
play games, even at a party?

218
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,750
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

219
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,951
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

220
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,152
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

221
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,351
"Don't think it. Don't say it.

222
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,835
"Don't say it.
Don't think it."

223
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,836
Miss Sasha steps
up to the plate.

224
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,874
She's going long!
She's going long!

225
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,996
Okay, all right, all right.
You got this?

226
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,115
All right.

227
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,515
Oh! Yes!

228
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,672
Oh, you all right?
Yeah.

229
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,829
You're drunk.

230
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,472
So, you thought
there were sounds and what?

231
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,516
"Bad vibrations"?
Yeah.

232
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,950
And now if they're gone,
then what's the big deal?

233
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,110
We burned all that
bad shit away, right?

234
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,314
That's tight.

235
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,992
You're actually psychic?

236
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,513
Sensitive,
my mother says.

237
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Oh, "Sensitive," huh?

238
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,439
So, what, your mom locked you under
the stairs when you were a kid?

239
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,669
You shoot knives at her.

240
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,477
Yeah. No.

241
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,794
But I could find stuff.

242
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,080
I always knew when people were
coming over to the house.

243
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,033
You know what I'm thinking?

244
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,754
Yes. I might just do that.

245
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,951
Damn, you are psychic.

246
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,273
Sensitive there, for sure.

247
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,311
Elliot...
It's okay, Sasha.

248
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,550
People have
doubted me my whole life.

249
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,959
Elliot, you can go ahead

250
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,077
and live a sheltered, shallow,
physical existence.

251
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,794
Well, a non-physical existence
would be kind of tough.

252
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,189
What Aristotle is
trying to say is...

253
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,514
Well, he needs proof.

254
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,199
Yeah, is that crazy?

255
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,517
Okay, let's just
take some deep breaths.

256
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Okay.

257
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,392
So, if nothing happens,
I should believe, 'cause it means

258
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,708
you got rid of the spirit.

259
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,193
Elliot, come on.
What?

260
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,240
We all know you don't believe
in this stuff, okay?

261
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,271
But can you just
please let her do it?

262
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,476
Right. Sorry.
No being rational.

263
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,709
I give over. I do.

264
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,189
Yo, El, just loosen up
the grip a little bit,

265
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,396
I'm trying to
concentrate on my breathing.

266
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,797
Are you ready, ladies?

267
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,632
Okay, let's do
this thing. Come on.

268
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,633
Now, I have no ego about it,
but I do know this stuff.

269
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,275
Okay, cool.
Well, what do you know?

270
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,519
Okay.

271
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,157
I know your
parents died in a crash.

272
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,908
Dude...

273
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,592
He didn't tell me.

274
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
They did.

275
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,317
Bro, I didn't say anything.
Swear.

276
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,680
I would never
tell anyone that.

277
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,833
They're worried
about you, though.

278
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,230
All right, I'm sorry I laughed at
you before, but that's not funny.

279
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,994
I'm not being funny, Elliot.
This is just what I'm getting.

280
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,313
Okay, how did they die?

281
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,954
What kind of accident was it?

282
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,358
Your brother will do anything in
his power to protect you now.

283
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,998
But they worry that
he's taking on too much.

284
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,674
All right. So, you talked
to my brother tonight.

285
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,389
Sasha, your...

286
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,190
Your grandmother has some
biscuits or rolls or something.

287
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,749
Gam's Rolls?

288
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,759
Come on, everybody's grandma
bakes biscuits.

289
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,116
Yeah.
He's not wrong about that.

290
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,509
This is...
This is... You know what?

291
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,874
You want to blindfold me, too?

292
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Just hang on.

293
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,799
I'll take you up
on that, though.

294
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,136
I'm all down for
the blindfolding,

295
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,832
whatever you got...
Of course.

296
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,032
Okay, what'd I hide?
Where'd I hide it?

297
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,599
Oh, come on. That's crazy.
Elliot...

298
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,954
Shh.

299
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,918
You know what? I...

300
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,512
I don't like this.

301
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,473
Yeah, I don't want
to do this anymore.

302
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,552
Maybe this was a bad idea.

303
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,868
Nah, come on.

304
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,479
You're a good faker,
I admit it.

305
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,636
You put the keys in
a pot on the stove.

306
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Did you?

307
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
You heard.

308
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,280
You were listening
for it, weren't you?

309
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,672
Well,
I didn't hear that, did you?

310
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,795
No.

311
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,236
- Something's coming.
- What?

312
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,152
They're saying,

313
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,154
"Don't...

314
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,438
"Don't think it.

315
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,509
"Don't say it.

316
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,276
"Don't say it. Don't think it.

317
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,757
"Don't say it. Don't think it.

318
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,832
"Don't say it! Don't think it!

319
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,829
"Don't say it! Don't think it!
Don't say it! Don't think it!

320
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,148
"Don't say it!
Don't think it!"

321
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,517
Don't say or think what?

322
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,314
The Bye Bye Man.

323
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,716
Jesus! What the fuck?

324
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,150
Kim! Oh, my God.

325
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Hey...

326
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,148
What happened, Kim?
Kim?

327
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,593
Are you all right?

328
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,478
Sorry.
What are you doing?

329
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,835
Nothing. Nothing. Sorry.

330
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,393
Are you sick?

331
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,397
Good night. Love you.

332
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,912
I love you, John.

333
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,349
What?

334
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,795
Hey. You're joking, right?

335
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,195
Sasha, you're kidding, right?

336
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,035
What?

337
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,717
What the hell is that?

338
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Come on!

339
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,872
John, let's go!

340
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,712
Look, I'm trying...

341
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,834
Like this?

342
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Hey.

343
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,229
Shh.

344
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,873
What are you doing?
Do you hear that?

345
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,358
What the hell is that?

346
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,959
You ready?

347
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,669
Thanks for being
nice to me last night.

348
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,829
That was pretty crazy.

349
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,593
It was. Definitely.

350
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,631
You want to go inside?

351
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,676
My roommate's car isn't here.

352
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,753
We could try again.

353
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,110
These things happen, right?

354
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,673
Actually,
not to me, they don't.

355
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,509
Yeah.

356
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,035
Actually, not to me, either.

357
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,275
A guy not finishing up, I've
never had that happen before.

358
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Come on.

359
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,839
I'm hungry.

360
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,474
Jesus.

361
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
What?

362
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Nothing.

363
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,435
Nothing, okay?

364
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,240
Kim, I need to go.

365
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,995
Now.

366
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,157
Fuck.

367
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,038
Dude, check this out.

368
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,753
They were
already there, right?

369
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
No.

370
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,518
It was Colin or one of
those douches from last night.

371
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,238
No, listen, I heard it.

372
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,359
I heard something after the
party outside, scratching.

373
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,871
What do you mean,
you heard something?

374
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,788
Morning.

375
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,990
See, you are
clean and beautiful.

376
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,154
That's nice.

377
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,469
What was that?

378
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,591
John, you drive Kim home?
Yeah.

379
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,193
And now I gotta wash her off.

380
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,272
The girl's gross, man.
Total pig.

381
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,400
Come on, man, that's not cool.
Don't say that.

382
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,176
Oh, sure, yeah,
it's easy for you to say.

383
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,031
Your girlfriend is perfect.

384
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,436
Oh, God.

385
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,874
You okay?

386
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,958
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't
be playing baseball in the cold.

387
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
That's the problem
with being an alcoholic.

388
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,597
Oh, shut up, I didn't
even drink that much.

389
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,398
Maybe that was the mistake.

390
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,192
I'll make you some tea.

391
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Come on.

392
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,472
Fuck him.

393
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,479
Bear, you went away
there for a second.

394
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,428
I did?

395
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,233
Yeah. Where'd you go?

396
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,388
God, you're shivering.

397
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,151
I was just thinking.

398
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,309
About John?

399
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,176
No, little brother, it's cool.

400
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,794
You can call me any time,
you know that.

401
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
Are you really
taking on too much?

402
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,192
Are you worried
about protecting me?

403
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,918
What is going on?

404
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,149
Is it Sasha?

405
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,119
Yeah, she's been
really sick and scared.

406
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,513
And John's been acting weird.

407
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,559
You guys seemed
like you were great.

408
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,993
Were we? You saw
them dancing together.

409
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,676
Talk to me,
buddy, what's going on?

410
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,594
Elliot?

411
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,629
What?

412
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,480
You wanna go get lunch
tomorrow or something,

413
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,839
we'll talk about this then?

414
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,278
You know what,
listen, I gotta go.

415
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,672
There's something I gotta...

416
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,751
I gotta deal with something.

417
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,429
El...

418
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,954
Guys?

419
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,034
Guys,
what are you doing up there?

420
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,638
Hello? Anyone down there?

421
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,309
Hello?

422
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,189
Hello?

423
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,835
Guys! Help!

424
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,555
No!

425
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,708
Guys!

426
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,277
What are you doing, Elliot?

427
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,029
You were here the whole time?
Yes.

428
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,189
That's bullshit.

429
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,679
But we were, Elliot.

430
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,034
You didn't answer me.

431
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,509
We didn't hear you!
What were you doing?

432
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,876
Studying, talking...

433
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,840
You didn't hear me? You didn't hear me?
We weren't doing anything.

434
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,792
Elliot, for the last time, bro,
we wouldn't do that to you!

435
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,029
Why are you lying to me?

436
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,189
We're not!
Jesus Christ.

437
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,440
Then what just happened, huh?

438
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,388
And there were sounds...
I mean, come on!

439
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,438
I told you there was
something happening.

440
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,033
Now do you believe me?

441
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,677
Hey, don't worry, okay?

442
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,080
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

443
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,189
Don't do what?
Don't...

444
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,656
Elliot... No, no, no.
Don't touch her.

445
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,715
What?
Don't touch her!

446
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,392
You are a crazy paranoid, bro!

447
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,192
Yeah, you're a little warm.

448
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,309
Okay,
so you weren't with John.

449
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,350
Am I hearing things?
Am I seeing things?

450
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,509
Tonight you thought the house
was empty when we were here.

451
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,991
You went away, Elliot.

452
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,871
I kind of went away, too.

453
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,675
What?

454
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,598
I sat down to study...

455
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,150
I don't remember
doing any of that.

456
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,878
It's like now
that I know his name,

457
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,154
he's coming for me.

458
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,313
And the more I try to get rid
of it, the bigger it gets.

459
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,389
It's horrible.

460
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,752
Hey, babe.

461
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,318
Bye Bye Man's not real.

462
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,675
It's just something
that's in our heads.

463
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,918
That's real.

464
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,877
Ideas are real.

465
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,236
If it's not,

466
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,316
then, Elliot, we're all losing
our minds at the same time.

467
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,909
And what are
the chances of that?

468
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,068
What the hell is that?
What is it?

469
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,469
What...

470
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,913
Elliot, there's nothing here.

471
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,156
So, you're not
going to be late, right?

472
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,277
No, I'll meet you at 2:00 sharp,
right where we parked.

473
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,319
I'm going to find out how real
this thing is. The name...

474
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,976
You're going to talk to the
landlord about the furniture?

475
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,399
And the house.

476
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,914
Maybe he can
find somewhere else.

477
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,595
You're feeling better, though?

478
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,874
I guess.

479
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,671
It's hard to be scared
in the middle of the day.

480
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,116
I'm going to take care of you.

481
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,153
Oh, my God.

482
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,273
You're shivering.

483
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,555
I'm going to figure
this out, I promise.

484
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,232
I'll see you at 2:00.

485
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,754
I love you.

486
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,236
"Register Archive.
Dead File 69. Redmon."

487
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,119
Here,
put these on.

488
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,198
- Really?
- Yeah.

489
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,999
They're originals
and we don't want

490
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,396
your sweaty palms messing up
the documents in the box.

491
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,996
Now, the dead file
has dead articles,

492
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,390
material that got
killed before going to press,

493
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,029
but still saved for posterity.
And it was written by Redmon.

494
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,795
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

495
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,118
Thank you, Dennis.

496
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,714
Mr. Daizy?
Yes, how are you doing?

497
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,593
Not so great, actually.

498
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,039
Uh, me and my friends

499
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,473
are renting your place

500
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,835
out in Sun Prairie.
37 Oakdale.

501
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,911
Oh, yeah,
the two handsome guys.

502
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,069
Are you with them?

503
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,840
You have a weird house,
Mr. Daizy.

504
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,279
Really, it's awful.

505
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,472
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that
way, but they did sign a lease.

506
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,914
Bless you.

507
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,149
Sorry.

508
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,318
You okay?
It's really cold in here.

509
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,834
It's a hothouse. It's actually
not cold at all, honey.

510
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,399
Maybe you should
be home in bed?

511
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,391
Look, Mr. Daizy.

512
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,552
There was an old nightstand
in the basement.

513
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,551
And it has this
writing inside it.

514
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,159
Where did it come from?

515
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,834
A nightstand?

516
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,353
Let's begin by
considering this wall...

517
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,358
Now, we can all agree
that the sentence...

518
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,237
Sorry.
Yeah, have a seat.

519
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,078
Now, we can all
agree that this sentence,

520
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,869
"This is a wall,"
is a truth claim.

521
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,909
This wall is real.
I see it, you see it.

522
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,399
We can touch it.

523
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,349
Likewise, if I were to brush
a few atoms from this wall,

524
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,829
it would still be here.
It would still be here before us.

525
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,070
It would still be "the wall."

526
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,596
But what if I continued

527
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,676
to slowly brush the atoms,
one by one, away from this wall?

528
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,714
Well, at first,
you'd say it's still a wall.

529
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,429
I brush a few more,
well, it's still a wall.

530
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,152
But what if I remove every single
atom from this wall except for one?

531
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,672
And you've seen me brush every
single atom from this wall

532
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,637
except for that one atom,

533
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,793
and I point to it, and I say,
"There, that's what's left."

534
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,468
That's the wall.

535
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,076
Now, is it?

536
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,955
Is that the wall?

537
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
What the...

538
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,035
All right, John?

539
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,033
Welcome back.

540
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,078
Language and reality

541
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,794
inform each other
as we construct...

542
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,310
Okay, I'm looking up
The Bye Bye Man, right?

543
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,776
There's nothing online,
so I type in,

544
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,074
"Don't say it,
don't think it,"

545
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,993
and it led me here,
the dead archives and Redmon.

546
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,432
Here's what was in his folder.

547
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,832
I think you write it and repeat
it to try and keep from saying...

548
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,955
The Bye Bye Man.

549
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,957
Okay, but why is
that in the dead files?

550
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,158
"October 18,
1969, byline, Larry Redmon.

551
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,593
"Deerfield, Iowa.

552
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,070
"A teenager,
accused of murdering

553
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,270
"his own family and
four other youths.

554
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,035
"When asked by this reporter why he
would do such a thing, he replied,

555
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,678
"'The Bye Bye Man
made me do it."'

556
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,797
It's an article about
a kid who went crazy.

557
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,071
But it was never published.

558
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,071
And Larry Redmon,
the writer...

559
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,230
He was pretty
infamous locally.

560
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,994
After he killed this piece
about the kid in Deerfield,

561
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,719
Larry Redmon took a shotgun

562
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,030
and murdered eight friends
and family members

563
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,519
right here in Madison.

564
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,990
- Don't say it. Don't think it.
- Mom!

565
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,469
Don't say it. Don't think it.
Mom!

566
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,948
Don't say it.

567
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,034
Mom, shut the door!

568
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,720
Giselle! Who did you tell?

569
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,034
No one!
We didn't tell anyone, Larry!

570
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,680
Mommy!

571
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Stop!

572
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,109
We didn't tell anyone!

573
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,758
I swear we didn't say anything!

574
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,398
Get back! Please!

575
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,072
Maybe he got inspired by
what he was writing about.

576
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,878
You won't win.

577
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,038
I won't let you.

578
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,632
There are no other mentions
of these cases anywhere else.

579
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,679
It's like someone redacted the whole
story, so no one else could read it.

580
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,758
Why would anyone do that?

581
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,071
Well, obviously he
was bat-shit crazy.

582
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,832
But, if you
remove all references

583
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,751
to something in the past,

584
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,910
that past no longer exists.

585
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,515
Even the idea of it is gone.

586
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,517
Maybe somebody wanted to make this
Bye Bye Man disappear permanently.

587
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,909
And you've got the
last record of it right there.

588
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,988
I'll be back.

589
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,672
Good, I have time.

590
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,439
Don't write it either, idiot.

591
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,269
What are you doing, boy?

592
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
Are you out of your mind?

593
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
I, um...

594
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,429
What is wrong with you, Elliot, huh?
What the...

595
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,430
I'm sorry,
I need to go. I'm late.

596
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,749
Elliot!

597
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,474
Oh, my God.

598
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,434
Sasha!

599
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,029
Hey, John!

600
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,314
Sasha!

601
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,840
Hey.

602
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Hello.

603
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,355
Kim, it's Elliot.

604
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,557
Elliot... God, I was just
thinking about you guys.

605
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,433
You wanna come up?
Listen. Listen.

606
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,520
Um, what are you doing?

607
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,149
You mean, right now?
Or since the party?

608
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,872
Isn't that why you're here?
Kim, can you come down?

609
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,080
I want to do another séance.

610
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,392
Right now, with all
four of us, at the house.

611
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,712
Listen, you were right.

612
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,199
I was wrong.

613
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,635
Sure.

614
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,117
I'll be down in a sec.

615
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,481
The Bye Bye Man doesn't exist
anywhere else that I could find.

616
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,511
You don't have to
look for him, Elliot.

617
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,559
He's found us.

618
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,555
You can't help
thinking about him.

619
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,789
And the more you think about him,
the closer he gets.

620
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,189
You see things
that aren't there.

621
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,630
You don't see
things that are there.

622
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,229
Or hear things.

623
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,110
Like a coin rolling.
Yeah.

624
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,160
Like a train.

625
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,792
Some people catch
it and it spreads.

626
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,957
Some go crazy sooner,
but they all die in the end.

627
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,275
The word spreads
and he comes to you with...

628
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,270
With that thing.

629
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,399
I told Katie.

630
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,278
I didn't want to.

631
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,950
What can you do with
cancer but cut it out?

632
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,470
You have to stop it before it
spreads and every cell dies.

633
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,156
This could spread everywhere
if we don't cut it out.

634
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,109
Did you tell anyone?

635
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,714
Ms. Watkins, the librarian.

636
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,672
We have to get to her, too.

637
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,360
What do you mean,
you have to get to her?

638
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,795
Stop!

639
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,949
Oh, my God!

640
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,870
Stop! Elliot, stop!

641
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,828
Let me help you!

642
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,039
Kim! Wait!

643
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Kim!

644
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,591
Kim! Kim!

645
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,435
No!

646
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,869
We have to help them!

647
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,871
What do you see?
It's a family!

648
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,313
It's in your head!

649
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,758
No, Kim! There's a train,
a real train!

650
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,355
No!

651
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,711
Kim! Move! It's in your head!

652
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,992
Kim! No!

653
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,070
Elliot, what happened?

654
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,559
Kim, she's dead.

655
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,233
Shit. Jesus.

656
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,033
Oh, my God. It was him.
He killed her.

657
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,077
You were right,
he's trying to get inside us.

658
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,921
He got in her. He's going to drive
us crazy and he's going to kill us.

659
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,951
You mean the...
Yeah.

660
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,554
He's why I was
late to get you.

661
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,954
He's why you're feeling sick.

662
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,216
Have you said
the name to anyone?

663
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,958
The name... No. No.

664
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,115
Have you?

665
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,595
No, I haven't said...

666
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,880
Good. Don't. We can't say the
name to anyone else, ever.

667
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,776
You going to tell
me what to do now?

668
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,656
Swear you won't say the name
so we don't spread it.

669
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,238
- No...
- John, please.

670
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,435
Please.

671
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,357
Bro, swear it. You just
need to cut this shit.

672
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,668
You swear!

673
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,115
Swear!
No.

674
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,872
Swear!
Elliot, stop it!

675
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,552
Swear!
What's wrong with you, Elliot?

676
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,776
What's wrong with you?
Elliot, stop it!

677
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,711
Hey, guys!
Hey, break it up!

678
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,279
I said break it up right now!

679
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,520
Back up.

680
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,456
He got to you, didn't he?
No one got to me, all right?

681
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,869
Admit it.
He's making you feel angry.

682
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,313
- He's making you sick.
- Yeah?

683
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,400
He's making you crazy.

684
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,480
You on something?

685
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,875
No, I'm upset.

686
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,296
We're just having
a little argument.

687
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,673
You call that
a "little argument"?

688
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,832
John, please.

689
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,148
Please don't say it.

690
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,594
Don't say what?

691
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,955
Sasha?
I won't.

692
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,671
J, you can't.

693
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,356
This name of some stupid shit
Elliot thinks is dangerous.

694
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,514
Yes. I was talking about Kim.

695
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,319
There was a hammer in her bag.

696
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,719
It was covered with blood.

697
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,915
Oh, my God.

698
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,994
Train's engineer said
that you were chasing Kim,

699
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,354
with the hammer.

700
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,189
He said she was
crying for help,

701
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,317
and that she jumped out of
your car to get away from you.

702
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,594
Jesus Christ.
Elliot?

703
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,789
That's not what happened.

704
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,031
No? They found Kim's roommate,
Katie Williams.

705
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,391
She was killed by a hammer,
too, but...

706
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,118
You knew that, didn't you?

707
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,714
I... Sasha,
no! I was at the library.

708
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,473
He made me lose track of time.
You have...

709
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,560
Sasha?

710
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,616
Do you want to
talk to me here?

711
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,776
You want to tell
me what's going on?

712
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,216
Don't say it. Don't
think it. You were right!

713
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Quiet.

714
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,696
Sasha, what doesn't
he want you to say?

715
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,756
Yeah, Sash.
You! Shut it!

716
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,720
It just
happened, John.

717
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,514
You see that? It's him.

718
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,840
No.

719
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
Sasha.

720
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,750
What? What is it?

721
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,040
Blood.

722
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,760
Blood?

723
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
Where?

724
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,671
What do you see?
He makes you see things.

725
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,633
Fuck.

726
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,352
Oh, my God.
Hey! Hey! Hey!

727
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,351
Back away.
I need you over here.

728
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,793
She's fine. Stay back.

729
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,198
Wait, there he is!

730
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,040
Hey!

731
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,435
Hey, bud. Somethin' wrong?

732
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,795
I'm sorry. I thought...
What?

733
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,388
Hey, are you all right?

734
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,072
Wait! Wait! Sasha!

735
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,513
He's gonna take her home

736
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,936
and she's going to
lie down for a bit.

737
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,518
I'm her boyfriend.
She needs me.

738
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,874
Maybe. Maybe later.

739
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,656
But right now,
you're going to come with me.

740
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,159
We're going to
talk a little bit.

741
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,756
Did you say
the name to anyone?

742
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,432
She didn't, man.

743
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,518
Neither of us did.

744
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,671
It's gonna be all right.

745
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,136
Don't say it. Don't think it.

746
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,176
Don't say it. Don't think it.

747
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,792
Don't think it.
Don't think it.

748
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,350
Good news for you. Maybe.

749
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,949
Kim Hines wrote
a suicide note,

750
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,435
taking responsibility
for her roommate

751
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,513
and for the deaths of you and the
other two living at your house.

752
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,391
So, I guess she was
planning on killing you, too.

753
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,395
Is that what happened, Elliot?

754
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,914
You found out
and you chased her?

755
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,154
I don't think that's murder.

756
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,913
Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

757
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,519
You want to write it?

758
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,155
No.

759
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,816
You're going to
tell me, you know that.

760
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,114
I hope not.

761
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,148
Why did you chase Kim?

762
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,992
I told you,
I was trying to help her.

763
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,433
So you chased
her into a train?

764
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,349
What are you doing?

765
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,668
You could lose everything.

766
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,990
Your scholarship,
that pretty girl.

767
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,638
You are a smart kid.

768
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,439
Talk to me and I can help you.

769
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,833
Otherwise,
it'll be out of my hands

770
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,433
and you'll be
wishing that you had.

771
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,428
You might find
yourself wishing I hadn't.

772
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,312
Well, you let me
worry about that.

773
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,953
You really want to know?

774
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,870
You really think the truth,
honesty, is the best policy?

775
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,878
I do.
Always?

776
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,995
When wouldn't it be?

777
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,554
You have kids?

778
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,835
Maybe.

779
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,389
You have kids.

780
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,518
Don't think it. Don't say it.

781
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,270
What if you saw
the worst crime scene ever?

782
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,356
A mass murder at a school.

783
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,869
With dead bodies and
brains and students

784
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,389
and sneakers
with blood on them.

785
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,835
And you go home,
and your kids say,

786
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,480
"Tell us about
your day, Mommy."

787
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,311
You could be honest.

788
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,471
You could tell the truth.

789
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,917
You could describe every
awful nightmare thing you saw,

790
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,991
and what was
burned into your head

791
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,151
would be burned into
their heads forever.

792
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,509
Or...

793
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,353
You could hug them tight,

794
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,360
and spare them
your honest truth.

795
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,198
What would you do?

796
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,673
I'd hug them.

797
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,110
Please don't make me say it.

798
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,031
I haven't hurt anyone.

799
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,197
But I'm afraid of
putting this into your head.

800
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,710
All I have to do is talk to you,
and you and your kids...

801
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,358
You're all dead.

802
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,195
Hey! Elliot!

803
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,315
Your friend died?

804
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,719
What the hell
is going on, man?

805
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,216
Thanks for coming to
get me, but I gotta go.

806
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,309
Was it Sasha and John...

807
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,879
Hey, talk to me.
Let me help you.

808
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,639
Whatever is going on,
there's nothing you can do, okay?

809
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,796
I literally can't tell you.

810
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,680
I'm not going to let it
happen to you, Virgil.

811
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,954
Especially not you.

812
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,792
What are you talking about?

813
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,956
You've got a family.
Go take care of them.

814
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,508
Elliot, hey!
You are my family. Elliot!

815
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,990
Shit!

816
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,789
Fuck!

817
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,789
Yeah!

818
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,039
Oh, my God.

819
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,789
What are you doing, Elliot?

820
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,633
What's... What's wrong
with you, Elliot?

821
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,153
What the...

822
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,679
I'm so sorry.

823
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,834
Elliot?

824
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,591
Hi, Ms. Watkins.
Hi. Elliot?

825
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,513
I've been having
some really strange thoughts

826
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,955
about that Bye Bye Man
since we talked.

827
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,675
Ms. Watkins...

828
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,951
Ms. Watkins, you can't
talk to anyone about it.

829
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,315
Well, maybe I can
come over to your house later.

830
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,152
I'm so sorry.

831
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,039
I'm sorry, too.

832
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,830
Believe me, but I've just been
having the most vivid thoughts. I...

833
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,120
Elliot?

834
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,480
Elliot?

835
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,880
Redmon...

836
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,793
Larry Redmon.

837
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,314
The writer.

838
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,072
It was his nightstand.

839
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,714
Ms. Watkins.

840
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,240
Okay,
maybe I'll see you later,

841
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,456
maybe I'll have
a fix for this.

842
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,914
I gotta go. Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome...

843
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,032
I'll be there soon.

844
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,478
He almost got us, man.

845
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,075
Oh, fuck! I almost killed you with a bat,
but, fuck, he's not going to get us.

846
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,160
He's not going to get us.

847
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,909
I'll figure this out.

848
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,353
I'm really sorry, but...

849
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,159
I'm sorry, I can't call an ambulance,
'cause you're gonna say it.

850
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,992
You will. You will.
'Cause I messed you up.

851
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,995
I'll be back as soon as I can.

852
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,118
I'm taking this.

853
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,438
You found her and now
I'm going to go talk to her.

854
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,314
I love you.

855
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,152
And don't touch him.

856
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,916
Bye-bye, happiness

857
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,996
Hello, loneliness

858
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,509
I think I'm gonna cry

859
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,148
Bye-bye, love

860
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,788
Bye-bye, sweet caress

861
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,390
Hello, emptiness

862
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,988
I feel like I'm gonna die

863
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,230
Bye-bye, my love, goodbye

864
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,029
Hello?

865
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,439
Mrs. Redmon?

866
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,829
Leave.

867
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,993
Ms. Redmon?

868
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,353
I said, leave! Are you deaf,
or just defective?

869
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,876
Ms. Redmon, did your husband write
for The Register a long time ago?

870
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,748
You're too young
to remember that.

871
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,274
Ms. Redmon.
You're still alive.

872
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,833
I know your husband
killed a lot of people.

873
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,160
But I don't
think he was crazy.

874
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,193
I need your help,
whatever you remember.

875
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,874
There's a train, gold coins...

876
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,640
A hound...

877
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,435
He came to Larry.

878
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,755
With the hound.

879
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,469
What Larry told me
gave me nightmares.

880
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,959
I made him stop.

881
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,840
I understand.

882
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,750
But I need you to tell me
everything Larry said.

883
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,594
Please.

884
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,112
Larry was on a story of a
teenager who killed his family.

885
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,834
Poked around like a good nosy
reporter and heard rumors...

886
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,474
Whispers about an evil,

887
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,155
some kind of a reaper
that drove the teenager mad.

888
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,800
Larry had to go nosing around
and writing it down.

889
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,880
And then it
came to Larry, too,

890
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,715
this nightmare, this name
we must not think or say.

891
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,153
But just three days after
Larry got back from Iowa,

892
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,071
I came home from work.

893
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,232
October 20th, 1969.

894
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,835
The day my life
went turn-turn-turn...

895
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,438
Don't say it. Don't think it.

896
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,273
Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

897
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,912
Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

898
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,117
Don't say it. Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

899
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,918
Don't say it. Don't think it.

900
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,873
Oh, my God.

901
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,315
Don't say it.

902
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,957
Larry... Oh, my God.

903
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,588
I was just doing my job.

904
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,070
That's what I do.
I track down the story.

905
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,957
And that's what I was doing.

906
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,789
See...

907
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,834
Once you know his name,
you can't escape him.

908
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,479
You see,
he gets in your head and...

909
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,549
He makes you do
horrible things.

910
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,198
Okay. Okay.

911
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,351
What horrible things?

912
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,635
Who makes you do this?
What are you talking about?

913
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,096
Let's get you to bed,
okay, sweetheart?

914
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,796
Listen. Listen, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.

915
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,513
And then the hound...

916
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,999
That's how you
know he's coming.

917
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,355
When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,

918
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,192
that's when you
know he's close by.

919
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,236
- You understand?
- No, I...

920
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,789
Larry...

921
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,030
I don't know what's happened,
but I'm trying...

922
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,593
He listens for his name.

923
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,830
Anyone could say it.
It could be you.

924
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,069
Or it could be me.

925
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,109
And it's just dumb luck
like the flip of a coin.

926
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,230
And I heard the name
and I told Janey the name.

927
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,354
"Don't think it.
Don't say it."

928
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,954
What does this mean?
What did you write?

929
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,519
I don't understand.

930
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,151
He makes
you see things.

931
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,631
And he makes you do things.

932
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:08,190
Who knows how many good people he's
made do horrible things like this.

933
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,589
No! Oh, God, no! Please.

934
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,954
Please, don't.

935
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,758
Please put it down.

936
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,631
You think it's me?

937
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,517
You think I did this?

938
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,953
This is what happens.

939
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,992
They say people snap.
They say people go crazy.

940
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,399
No, it's him.

941
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,074
It's him that's doing it!

942
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,473
Just put it...
Put it down. Okay?

943
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,629
No.

944
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,840
I love you.

945
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,559
But in the end,
Larry was a hero.

946
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,198
You tell people that.

947
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,191
Larry erased him, you see.

948
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,909
He did away with everyone who'd heard
it before they could pass it on.

949
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,399
But not you.

950
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,834
You're here.

951
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,716
How did you
survive all this time?

952
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,074
Survive?
Yes.

953
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,709
How did you beat it?

954
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,993
I didn't beat it.

955
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,433
I never knew it.

956
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,669
What?

957
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,159
If my husband had
told me the name,

958
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,696
he'd have had to
kill me with the rest.

959
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,358
My husband controlled himself.

960
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,399
Your fucking husband wrote the name in
the nightstand you sold and I read it.

961
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,199
He typed it in a dead article
and I read that, too!

962
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,280
Don't you say it!

963
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,311
Your husband spared
you and he got me.

964
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,152
He's in me now.
He's in my friends.

965
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,798
You want my help?
Yes.

966
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,080
Here.

967
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,551
Kill all of the ones you told
first and then kill yourself.

968
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,914
It's the only way.

969
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,074
No!
There has to be another way.

970
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,799
"Don't say it.
Don't think it." It's a clue.

971
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,033
Look.

972
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,277
Oh, my God. He's coming!

973
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,794
What are you talking about?
You didn't bring him here.

974
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,472
Don't you see it?
See what?

975
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,155
The light... Hear the name...
He's in your head.

976
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,949
He makes us see things,
hear things, tricks to make us afraid.

977
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,270
He makes us afraid.
Then he grows.

978
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,590
The more scared we are,
the more real he gets.

979
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,278
We make him
real with our fear.

980
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,396
We make him more powerful.

981
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,112
Yeah, we give him the power

982
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,400
and he gets closer and he hears
us when we think of him.

983
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,874
But maybe, if we're not afraid,
we take his power.

984
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,235
Maybe, if we're not afraid,
he's nothing!

985
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,189
How could you figure it out
and my Larry not?

986
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,589
Help me!

987
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,075
Shoot me!

988
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,788
Shoot me now!

989
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,275
No, no! It's not real!

990
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,349
No, it's not real.

991
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,953
Help me!

992
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,071
I have you now, don't I?

993
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,632
Come on, try another trick.
Come on, try it!

994
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,908
Where are you?

995
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,235
Where are you?

996
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,269
Oh, my God.

997
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,309
Sasha!

998
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,068
Pick up.

999
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,513
Sasha?

1000
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,936
Hey. It's Sasha.
Leave a message...

1001
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,200
You better not
fuckin' hurt her!

1002
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
Thanks.

1003
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,954
Sasha. I'm coming.

1004
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,074
I know it's hard,
but don't be afraid.

1005
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,752
And don't believe
anything you see.

1006
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,079
Whoa, what the...

1007
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,880
What?

1008
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,073
No, you're not real.

1009
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,880
Not real!

1010
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,469
Ha! I knew it!

1011
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,952
Okay. Tricks.

1012
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,758
You want to play tricks?

1013
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,509
Okay. I'm ready.

1014
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,114
Elliot!

1015
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,829
John!

1016
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,313
Where are you guys?

1017
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,434
Elliot?

1018
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,269
Sasha!

1019
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,869
Elliot!

1020
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,120
Sasha?

1021
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,079
I'm in here.

1022
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,879
Oh, God.

1023
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,874
You look like hell.

1024
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,149
Jesus.

1025
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,799
There you are.

1026
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,996
Elliot...
Thank God. You're back.

1027
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,673
I'm not...

1028
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,829
Oh, my God.

1029
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,276
Hey, what's the matter?

1030
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,679
Elliot, what are you doing?

1031
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,960
Shit.

1032
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
Get away.

1033
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,431
Hey, come on,
it's all going to be okay.

1034
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,590
We're going to be okay.
I feel better.

1035
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,829
Get away!

1036
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,232
Elliot! It's me!

1037
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,353
What the hell?

1038
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,954
Elliot, I don't understand.
What are you doing?

1039
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,109
Help!

1040
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,633
Elliot! Come on.

1041
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,313
Come here, John.

1042
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,919
Please, Elliot!
Help!

1043
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,596
I don't understand.
Please.

1044
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,040
No.

1045
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,199
Come on.
No!

1046
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,355
Please.

1047
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,355
Stop. Elliot, please stop!
Will you just stop?

1048
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,517
Get away from me!

1049
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,080
Get away!

1050
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,909
Guys!

1051
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,715
Sasha, John, it's a trick.
It's not real.

1052
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,119
Listen to me!

1053
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,428
Sasha, John.
Listen to me, it's not real.

1054
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,640
John, no!

1055
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,792
Elliot! Shoot! Shoot!

1056
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,200
No!

1057
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,193
Go ahead. Kill me.

1058
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,308
You win.

1059
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:10,915
No.

1060
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,749
You leave them alone!

1061
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,672
Come on, guys.
It's freezing out here.

1062
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,909
Hey, man. Anybody home?

1063
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,393
I've got Alice here.
She's here to cheer you up, buddy.

1064
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,154
Elliot!
No!

1065
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,991
Hey! Anybody home?

1066
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,600
Guys, come on!
We know you're in there.

1067
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,950
I hear something. Hello!

1068
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,256
Open the door, you guys.
We're turning into popsicles out here.

1069
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,032
Go away!
Elliot?

1070
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,229
Go away!

1071
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,277
No, no. We're not
going anywhere, Elliot.

1072
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,191
Uncle, open up!

1073
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,456
Please, get her out of here.
Both of you, you need to go!

1074
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,616
Elliot, open the goddamn door
or I'm calling the police.

1075
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,039
Good. Do it!

1076
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,917
Honey, why don't you
go wait in the truck?

1077
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,038
No! Daddy, I got to pee!

1078
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,593
Go to the truck, please.

1079
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,954
Open the door, man, come on.

1080
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,394
Go. Go.

1081
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,959
Elliot!
Bye... Bye...

1082
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,880
No!

1083
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,999
Elliot,
what the hell is going on?

1084
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,480
Virgil,
please, get her out of here.

1085
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,713
Uncle Elliot!

1086
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,117
Okay, Peanut, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

1087
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,599
I need you to go to the truck.

1088
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,193
No, Daddy, I got to go!

1089
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,561
Go someplace close where I can
see ya, and be quick, okay?

1090
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,600
Outside?

1091
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,056
No one is going to see you,
baby. It's okay.

1092
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,513
Go. Go. Go.

1093
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,914
Elliot. Elliot,
what is going on in there?

1094
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,640
Don't think it. Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

1095
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,231
Elliot, what are
you saying? What?

1096
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,833
I have to do this.
I'm not crazy.

1097
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:58,995
Let me help you.

1098
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,992
No, you can't. But I
can help you, if you go!

1099
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,638
But I'm not going
to let you catch it!

1100
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,518
Bye...
Don't say it! Don't think it!

1101
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,438
What? Don't say what?
Just go!

1102
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,336
Jesus Christ, what was that?
Elliot, what was that?

1103
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,393
The Bye Bye Man. Bye Bye...

1104
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,552
Bye Bye?
What is that? Bye Bye?

1105
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,914
What is it,
what are you saying?

1106
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,434
Bye Bye what?

1107
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,515
What is that?
Elliot? Bye Bye what?

1108
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,272
I love you so much.

1109
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:15,874
Elliot!

1110
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,155
Alice.

1111
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,756
Alice? Alice!

1112
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,789
Alice?

1113
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,349
Alice?

1114
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,277
Where are you, baby?

1115
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,595
Alice!

1116
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,711
Alice? Alice?

1117
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,154
Honey?

1118
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,949
Alice?

1119
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,469
Alice?

1120
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,312
Alice!

1121
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,198
Honey! Come here!

1122
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,395
I was cold!

1123
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,273
Oh, I know, honey,
but you scared me so much!

1124
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,191
Oh, no! Look!

1125
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,079
Uncle Elliot!

1126
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,235
It's okay.

1127
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,868
It's okay.

1128
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,155
The fire can't
hurt him anymore.

1129
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,674
So, this
boy ran a librarian over,

1130
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,950
mutilated and
murdered her children,

1131
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,429
and then killed his
roommates and himself

1132
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,796
and you had him in custody
today, but you let him go?

1133
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:05,711
Yes. But this is not some creepy
kid pulling a Columbine, okay?

1134
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,153
I talked to him.

1135
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,754
Something is going on here.
I can feel it.

1136
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,190
I wanted to say goodbye.

1137
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,719
I know, baby. Me, too.

1138
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,871
At least he gave me the coins.

1139
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,878
What are you talking about?

1140
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,112
He must've left them
out there for me to find.

1141
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,430
Left them out where, honey?

1142
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,431
In the little table.

1143
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,038
Outside, next to the trash cans.

1144
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,918
Well, was there
anything else in this table?

1145
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,675
No.

1146
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,438
Just some writing.

1147
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,794
Writing?

1148
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,350
What did this writing say?

1149
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,877
Daddy. You know I
can't read in the dark.

1150
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,953
What do you think I am?
A flashlight?

1151
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:55,994
We got one alive!

1152
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,720
Get me a tool,
a line and morphine!

1153
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,472
Wait, wait!
He's trying to say something!

1154
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,869
Hey, I'm listening, go ahead.

1155
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,120
It won't matter.

1156
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,275
It does matter.

1157
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,631
Okay, take your time.

1158
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,269
It's okay. I'm here.

1159
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,112
And I want to know.

1160
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,509
Please. Please tell me.

1161
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,471
Bye Bye Man...
