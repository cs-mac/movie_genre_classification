00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,570
Tony Jaa

2
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:42,031
- Tom Yum Goong: Honor of the Beast -

3
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:44,445
...Then hunters came out from the shadows...

4
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:48,034
And the Guardians were
surrounded from all directions...

5
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:52,098
The Guardians can beat them
with their sword skill!

6
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:57,506
The Guardians lost their swords,
they must fight with their bare hands.

7
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,112
Dady, will they die?

8
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:04,595
No no no ... Don't worry,
the hunter's weapons were useless ...

9
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:08,449
Boom ... Kick ... Punch ... Hack...

10
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,675
What did the hunters attack, father?

11
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:12,156
I will tell you later.

12
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:16,286
But l'm going to be an Imperial Guardian!
I want to know!

13
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:21,497
It's time to sleep Kham, tomorrow,
Alright?

14
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:35,003
Bathe in the water, Kid.

15
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,936
Bathe, bathe, bathe...

16
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,574
Did you see? He plays with me!

17
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:44,383
Yes... He likes you

18
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:47,524
You play like an elephant!

19
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:09,713
Dad, look!

20
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,365
Be careful...

21
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,108
Dad, why is she touching him all the time?

22
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:28,609
Oh...When you grow up i'll tell you.

23
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,454
Come on, come on...

24
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,003
Go from the back, from the back...

25
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,184
Quickly...

26
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,240
Look out!

27
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:02,295
Run!

28
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:43,580
As a light of a soul has faded...

29
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:47,284
And it passes into the beyond...

30
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:51,015
The holy one... The holy one...

31
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:57,807
Please take care of the soul
of this innocent creature...

32
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:41,265
When i was in the army, I was
assigned to a base near the city.

33
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,959
They had Kid there,
he was in very poor condition.

34
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:54,600
They treat animals very badly in the city,
so I took him to our village.

35
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:19,749
Korn...

36
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:22,450
Look...

37
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,753
I brought you a mango.

38
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,824
Want it?

39
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,016
She is so lucky...

40
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,906
Whay can't it happen to me once?

41
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:45,444
I have no luck, I'll never find a decent man.

42
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:52,217
Don't worry, you're beautiful, you'll will find someone.
He looks nice but you don't know how he is really like.

43
00:08:52,218 --> 00:09:02,428
I hope I'll meet someone at the festival,
or I'll end up depressed as this elephant!

44
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,106
It's hard to see him like this.

45
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:13,277
So sad...

46
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,874
I felt the same after your mother died.

47
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:19,395
So I know what it feels like.

48
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,383
There is no cure.

49
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,406
Other than time.

50
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,540
Sir!

51
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,537
Veterinary permit.

52
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:57,722
Good day.

53
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,360
Over there, come on...

54
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,244
Sergeant Gahb...

55
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:07,898
Please step inside for a short check,
come on...

56
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:15,359
This shall take a while,
you can come back in 15 minutes, ok?

57
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,275
Cheif Veterinary,
this is Sergeant Gahb.

58
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:24,332
Honored Sergeant Gahb.

59
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:31,223
We served in the army togeter,
give him speacial treatment.

60
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:35,976
Bell necklace...
Bell necklace...

61
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:43,095
Hello.

62
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,308
How much does it cost?

63
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:50,484
Very cheap, only 2 Baht.

64
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:54,715
Holiday spirit... For only 2 Baht...

65
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,399
Thank you.

66
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:30,366
Load the elephant, go on..

67
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:33,133
What? Wh... What is...

68
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,379
Your elephant is sick, see?

69
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:43,520
But don't warry, you'll get it back
from quarantine in a week, ok?

70
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:46,546
What's that?

71
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:47,695
Security!

72
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,009
Watch it...

73
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:55,124
Crooks!

74
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:56,826
Call the Police!

75
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:57,707
Crooks!

76
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,707
Call the Police!

77
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:02,733
Police!

78
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,530
Come on!

79
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,039
Move aside!

80
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:36,642
Hey! Thieves!

81
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,191
Get out of may way!

82
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,462
Pull away!

83
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:52,597
Father!

84
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:55,311
Father!

85
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:57,063
Who did this?

86
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,019
Father!

87
00:14:58,182 --> 00:15:01,032
Kham... They took him...

88
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:06,604
Hey!

89
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,080
Emotional Boy!

90
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,721
Get out of my house!

91
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,109
Guards!

92
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,220
Get him!

93
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:46,414
Don't stand there! Go!

94
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,926
Help! He hit me!

95
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,457
You emotionless lowlife!

96
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,410
- You know what I want!
- I do... I do..

97
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:24,251
- I'll kill you!
- No!

98
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:27,817
Your elephant, is in Sydney.

99
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:32,582
Hey! Let him go...

100
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:35,022
No! He'll kill me!

101
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,560
Come on!
This way!

102
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:03,195
While NGOs were gathering to protest
the transfer of Thai elephants to Sydney.

103
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:06,378
There's a report,
that the elephant was stolen.

104
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:08,739
Mr. Witia Tamarat...

105
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:13,357
The owner of a well known
Thai restaurant "Tom-Yum-Goong".

106
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,602
Has been killed.

107
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:18,169
The motive of the murder is believed
to be that Witia was involved...

108
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,850
with a Chinese mafia gang

109
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,123
and many illegal activities

110
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:25,371
that can lead to business conflit
with them.

111
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:27,491
For the missing elephant.

112
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:31,586
There is no report or information
from the authorities at the moment

113
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:32,805
if this connects to the mother case

114
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:35,131
the elephant belongs in Thailand!

115
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:40,209
The best way to enrich this elephant's
evironment is to put him with other elephants!

116
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,916
So the can live! With his family!
In his home!

117
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:48,615
We don't want the elephant in Australia,
The elephant belongs in Thailand!

118
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:51,515
Yeah! Send him home!
Send him home!

119
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:56,503
Reporters have asked the consulate for
more information about the incident.

120
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,210
We are very sorry for
the incident that happened today.

121
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,990
We also would like inform you that.

122
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:06,592
In Thailand we have a very strict law for the
protection and conservation of elephants.

123
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:09,670
At first we thought that... the...

124
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:14,353
Giving of the elephants to the zoo
is done by donation.

125
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:21,904
We later found out that there's
criminal activity behind the scenes.

126
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:26,206
And this is the main Asian market in Sydney.

127
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:28,513
Most of the people here are Asians.

128
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:34,024
You know? Chinese, Thai, Vietnam
Oh! And Laos!

129
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:41,521
So, Officer here needs to understand
Asian square, like me for instance.

130
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:49,162
It is how I do my job, it's important
to same as with people.

131
00:24:49,498 --> 00:24:51,158
Oh, very good.

132
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,730
Yeh, these are fresh from today...

133
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:56,958
Oh, These look great
mmm....ripe!

134
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,709
Yeh, Thery in season...

135
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,438
Take and be healthy.

136
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,609
How much?

137
00:25:03,661 --> 00:25:04,831
Oh..Gift!

138
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,980
Then I'll take some more!

139
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,782
Thanks alot! Thanks!

140
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:14,466
It's just the way we do things here.

141
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:20,746
Asians in foreign place need
to stick together, like fireman.

142
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:23,287
Why? Do you miss me?

143
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,936
Take it easy baby!

144
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:33,947
I'll give you a kiss first!
Ok?

145
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,139
I love you.

146
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:38,112
Bye.

147
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:45,894
Hey! Jusy in time!

148
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:48,635
It is my partner, Rick.

149
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,995
He's a young little bit hard up rook.

150
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:53,294
A little less hard-working
than I am.

151
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:57,543
Hey! That's enough!
Mark has to work right now.

152
00:25:57,544 --> 00:26:01,874
You see, Public services is a part
of our job as police officers.

153
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:05,705
You know?
To serve and protect!

154
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,878
I'm a damn babysitter.

155
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:15,249
Sergeant Mark, there's a robbery
at Mini-Mart on Rogan street.

156
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,586
Why did you call police?

157
00:26:21,587 --> 00:26:24,427
You are in toruble now!

158
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:27,283
Please...Please...I'm sorry.

159
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:29,234
Do you hear me?

160
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,173
I want to get out!

161
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:39,286
Apparently the robber is a teenager.

162
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:43,234
Only the shop owner and his
wife are in the shop...

163
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,895
Oy! Get that?

164
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:47,534
I want you to drop your weapon...

165
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:50,104
Mik, Mik! No no no...

166
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:52,055
Leave him to me.

167
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:04,098
Hey hey hey...

168
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:06,542
Take it easy...

169
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:12,471
Is that you?
Ichi's son?

170
00:27:12,472 --> 00:27:13,789
What are you doing?

171
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,502
I'm robbing a store.

172
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:20,313
This gun can hurt someone,
put it down!

173
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,085
I need money.

174
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:27,645
Hey... I just came in...
Aim it back at them.

175
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:31,283
Ok, you give me some money then.

176
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:33,334
Here's a dollar!

177
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,550
- You son of a bitch!
- No, No!

178
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:41,893
Hey! Hey!

179
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,770
You have the right to remain silent...

180
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:51,990
He has been charged with Entry.

181
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:56,311
Anyway, enough fun for now, ok?
Bye.

182
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:04,549
Excuse me Mark! Mark!
Another question please!

183
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,497
Bye bye bye.

184
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:26,213
Go home! Straigt away!

185
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:30,233
How could you do that Sarge?

186
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:31,581
It's against procedure!

187
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:33,515
There's no use arresting a young junky minor.

188
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:36,532
- Yeah but we should go by the rules..
- Who the fuck is it?

189
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:38,166
I'll be right there.

190
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,427
Let's go!

191
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,108
Oh, I can hardly hear a thing ...

192
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:56,608
Why aren't you working?

193
00:28:57,033 --> 00:29:00,033
When the hell are you
going to work this debt? Hu?

194
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:01,604
Witin Yahh...

195
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:03,245
Remember him?

196
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:04,773
Or you want to die like him?

197
00:29:04,774 --> 00:29:05,752
I know i can pay...

198
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:07,601
You know you can pay?

199
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:11,166
How the hell are you going to pay?

200
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,653
Thai students only have 2 jobs here.

201
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:16,343
One, you can be a waitress.

202
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:18,557
Or you can be a call girl.

203
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:20,608
What can you do?

204
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:26,213
You've got 2 ways,
That's it.

205
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:35,267
As you saw in the presentation.

206
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:38,121
We are a step away from
dominating the market.

207
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:39,302
Thereby...

208
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:42,248
Increasing our profit by 200 percent.

209
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:46,683
With a rise in stock value 15 times fold.

210
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,459
Benefiting stock owners.

211
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,016
The agreement will allow us to use
eastern resources.

212
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:55,588
The important of which is life.

213
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:59,119
Life...That can be very tasty.

214
00:30:10,513 --> 00:30:13,363
This tastes like rodents.

215
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:16,026
Stop! Stop for a moment and think.

216
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:18,767
This is a rotten deal!

217
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:22,605
True I am also a business man.

218
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:24,297
I make money.

219
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:27,836
Own property, sometimes I win and...

220
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:30,667
Wait I'm not done yet!

221
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:33,601
...Sometimes, lose.

222
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:36,219
But why do I do all that?

223
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,299
What is the purpose of this effort?

224
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,059
The answer is simple, I want a better life!

225
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,387
But...Better life is not just money.

226
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,298
It is a good society to live in.

227
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:57,775
A society which your company steps on!

228
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:01,371
They want to buy my health.

229
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:02,980
And want to buy my morals.

230
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:05,520
Buy law, nature, the air I breath.

231
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:08,561
All for some "Big money"!

232
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:12,835
I can make money in many ways.

233
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:16,508
By selling my children's future,
all I can do is...

234
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:17,189
Lose.

235
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:24,398
Bastard.

236
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:28,530
Ruining all I have built so hard.

237
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:31,439
An interesting fact is...

238
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,090
That our new friend...

239
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:39,349
Is a regular customer of ours!

240
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,930
See?

241
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:52,703
I think it's time we treat our
customers more personally.

242
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,810
Sorry, sorry.

243
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,363
Hey, good day mate!

244
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:58,045
Where is a pretty boy like you from?

245
00:32:58,046 --> 00:32:59,307
Ok, next question.

246
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:00,929
Where we're go...

247
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,170
Europe, hu?
OK ride ahead.

248
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,179
Tom-Yum-Goog.

249
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:15,347
Yeah I know this place, great food,
beautiful girls, you like girls?

250
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:19,257
Did you get into this country legally or illegally?

251
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:21,998
You've got a passport?

252
00:33:31,415 --> 00:33:33,175
Change of plan.

253
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:34,324
Hang on!

254
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:40,936
Come on!

255
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:47,344
Go!

256
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:54,101
Look at him, you're good for nothing!
Nothing!

257
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,976
Mark, we found Jimmy heading to Thai Town,
requesting backup immediately.

258
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:06,427
I'm on it.

259
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:14,151
(I'm falling asleep...)

260
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,422
Stop here!

261
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,653
Is that the best you can do?

262
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:24,114
I'm trying!

263
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,273
Now some action!

264
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,992
Shit! Come on Boy! Come one!

265
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:01,391
Get out of the car!

266
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:04,622
Come on! Get away from me!

267
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:07,631
If you come any closer he's dead!
Get away from me!

268
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:08,783
Hey! Jimmy!

269
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:11,434
Calm down!
Calm down!

270
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:13,185
Let's talk, ok?

271
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:14,190
I don't want to talk!

272
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:18,716
Just get away you...Hey!
Drop the hand and piss off!

273
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:19,858
You want me to shoot him?

274
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,689
I'll shoot the little bastard...

275
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:28,544
Do you want to piss off?
You want me to shoot him you wanker?

276
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,285
Hey! I'll shoot him...

277
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,306
- Ok ok!
- I'll go! I give up!

278
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:47,066
What the hell are you doing?

279
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,844
He's the one that was hit.

280
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:52,755
No, he wasn't.
Now go get him!

281
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:55,262
I said, go get him.

282
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,780
What am I charged for?

283
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:42,326
I will handle this.

284
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:57,398
Vincent didn't have to shoot him.
Don't you think he went too far?

285
00:36:57,399 --> 00:37:01,169
Jimmy was no ordinary thief,
I know him well.

286
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,679
And this guy was no victim.

287
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,973
How do you know?

288
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:08,784
I don't.
I just have a hunch.

289
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,795
What were you doing there?

290
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:16,184
You understand!
Help me find my elephant!

291
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:19,103
Of course I'm Thai!
That's why I'm handsom!

292
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,569
Elephants in Sydney, are you sure?

293
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,428
Yes, yes, they brought him here.

294
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,489
- Big one?
- Yes

295
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:29,689
- Gray colored?
- Yes of course.

296
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,720
Animals... Animals...
Where can animals be?

297
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:39,833
Let's go to the station,
maybe I'll remember later.

298
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:42,663
Tom-Yum-Goong
OTOP (Thai export program)

299
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:43,834
Hey Mark!

300
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:47,041
How are you doing?

301
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:50,847
You're here? Oww...
How's work?

302
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:55,414
- I feel great at this new job.
- Yes, fancy Tom-Yum-Goong.

303
00:37:55,415 --> 00:38:02,269
- I give out dinner invitations, have one.
- Oh, thank you very much.

304
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,520
Ahh, no Thai pride.

305
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:10,648
Even Tom-Yum-Goong is full of gangsters now,
it used to be a respectable place.

306
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:13,706
- It's him! It's him!
- Shut up!

307
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:15,709
Ok, great seeing you!

308
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,572
- Yes.
- We should meet soon.

309
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:21,293
- Let me out!
- I said shut up! Be quiet!

310
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:22,894
Hey hey, what's going on?

311
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:27,395
- It's him, he took him!
- No no no.

312
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:31,233
I remember him,
he was in the picture with the traders.

313
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:34,413
No we can't do that now,
you should press charges.

314
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,531
Let me out, I'll take a Taxi.

315
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:40,742
No, we'll go to the station first.

316
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,280
Stop!
Or I'll shoot!

317
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,960
You're going to see the secretary...

318
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:16,029
Johnny!

319
00:39:16,194 --> 00:39:18,744
Where is my elephant?

320
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,407
Where is my elephant?

321
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,949
He's asking for his elephant.

322
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:42,869
Johnny!

323
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:44,883
Feeling lucky?

324
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:57,983
Fellow, you don't know who you're
dealing with, they will kill you.

325
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:37,181
This is top quality.

326
00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:53,648
Kill them.

327
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,560
Shit!

328
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,894
You think this is a game?

329
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:14,825
What are you doing? James? James!

330
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,910
Make sure he's dead.

331
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:23,466
The Thai government says that
it is trying to resolve the issue.

332
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:27,105
Of elephants wandering around
Bangkok streets.

333
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:32,740
Ordering the evacuation of the
pachyderms out of the capital.

334
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:35,188
What should I do with the two of you?

335
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,163
You've lost the suspect.

336
00:47:37,164 --> 00:47:40,747
And managed to cause all that
racket on the road.

337
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:42,985
I'm taking you both off the case.

338
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,047
It's been assigned to someone else.

339
00:47:45,048 --> 00:47:45,946
As of now,

340
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,700
the two of you can help inspector Vincent,

341
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:51,751
with security for the Secretary General's
meeting with Mr. Sim

342
00:47:51,752 --> 00:47:55,285
- Aren't you being slightly...
- I'm not racking with you!

343
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:58,225
I patched you up with Mark hoping
you'd be able to keep him in line,

344
00:47:58,226 --> 00:48:01,500
I didn't expect you to start
acting like him.

345
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:03,164
We've had a report from area 3.

346
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:06,318
About drugs and an Asian shoot-out.

347
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,269
Everybody split the scene.

348
00:48:09,445 --> 00:48:14,202
There's evidence that needs
to be collected.

349
00:48:14,203 --> 00:48:16,999
I don't understand why this
area is so buggered up.

350
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,400
The area that you Mark,
is so proud to protect.

351
00:48:27,435 --> 00:48:30,175
Where is Jimmy's body?

352
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:33,036
Wow...

353
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:36,496
Any evidence?

354
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,997
Look. Don't take anything.

355
00:48:44,998 --> 00:48:46,468
Peep show...

356
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:52,302
Usually there are prettier bodies.

357
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:58,587
Ok, thanks!

358
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:00,451
Alright...

359
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,034
I got it.

360
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:05,986
I know.

361
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,159
I'll leave now!

362
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,235
The hunters were many.

363
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,380
The battle was fierce.

364
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:54,997
But the power of the guardians...

365
00:49:57,983 --> 00:50:02,503
Was never in numbers, but their heart.

366
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:09,229
Why steal the elephants, Dad?

367
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:16,255
Some people eat animals, Kham.

368
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,953
At the scene of the crime.

369
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:51,124
Police have found a passport
belonging to the suspect.

370
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:57,572
Who authorities believes was involved
in the drug deal in the warehouse.

371
00:50:57,573 --> 00:51:00,270
The suspect was seen wearing a red scarf.

372
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:08,151
If anyone have seen this man,
please contact the police immediately.

373
00:52:16,121 --> 00:52:19,114
Alright, ok, let me get back to
you on that.

374
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:20,975
Bye. Thank you.

375
00:52:28,284 --> 00:52:29,944
Is life good?

376
00:52:31,812 --> 00:52:32,882
Come in!

377
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:00,297
My medicine!

378
00:54:01,995 --> 00:54:02,965
Go! Go!

379
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,725
Hit the alarm!

380
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:40,971
It's you?

381
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,786
What the hell are you involved in?

382
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:47,017
They made me do this or...
