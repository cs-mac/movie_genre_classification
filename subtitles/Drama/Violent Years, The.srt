1
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:12,832
VIOLENT COP

2
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:58,147
What are you doing, mister?

3
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,908
I'll go home.

4
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:32,570
Me, too.

5
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,139
Hello.

6
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:42,974
What is it?

7
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,342
Your son home?

8
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:47,949
Police.

9
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:49,585
Upstairs?

10
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,515
Excuse me.

11
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:53,419
What for?

12
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,753
Let us alone.
Don't worry.

13
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,664
Yeah?

14
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:13,341
Don't bother about me.

15
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:37,495
Give yourself up tomorrow.

16
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,304
What did I do?

17
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,477
I did nothing.

18
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:49,138
Nothing?

19
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:52,410
Nothing?

20
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:56,920
Then I did nothing, either.

21
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,771
Ass!

22
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,596
As your new chief,

23
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:32,233
I'd like to say this:

24
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:36,272
Police are sacred.
Keep it in mind.

25
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,112
Be proud of your job.
Have self- respect...

26
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:54,823
Azuma.
The kid gave himself up.

27
00:08:55,061 --> 00:09:00,226
But you should've caught
him in the act last night.

28
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:12,905
Azuma.

29
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:16,240
Our new boss wants you.

30
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:45,074
Azuma.
Our new boss wants you.

31
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:56,353
I'm Kikuchi, the rookie.

32
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:02,861
You saw it?

33
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:04,891
Coincidence.

34
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,895
You kept silent?

35
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,566
What could I do?

36
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:15,602
Nothing but breaking in his house
and forcing him to talk?

37
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,905
I'd like that, but

38
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:24,947
behave yourself for a year,
while I'm chief.

39
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,551
I'm no fool.

40
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,815
I know who lives here,

41
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:36,821
and the kind of cops
we need.

42
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:42,157
You've got to be smart.
That's all.

43
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,136
It tires me.

44
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,734
Because you act wild.

45
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,322
Was he mad?

46
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:06,456
No.

47
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:20,134
I'll go to the hospital.

48
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:22,305
Akari?

49
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,435
She's going to be released.

50
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,703
Thanks.

51
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,811
If there's anything
I can do...

52
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:34,042
Come see
my wife sometimes.

53
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:35,550
Thanks.

54
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:56,533
Let me.

55
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:03,738
I'm Kikuchi, the rookie.

56
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,148
Coach me.

57
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,261
I want the document later.

58
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:54,952
A festival.

59
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:49,910
Let's go.

60
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,897
Did she say that?

61
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,165
She's a liar.

62
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:20,511
She's pregnant.
Take care of her.

63
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,443
So I told her not to dance.

64
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,042
You told me
to get an abortion.

65
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:29,711
I didn't.

66
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,080
Who's the father, anyway?

67
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,122
You. Who else?

68
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:38,695
You're a couple.
Be nice to each other.

69
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:41,458
Not a couple.

70
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:46,234
I live with her because
she begged me to.

71
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,565
All you want is my money.

72
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:52,974
Why else would
anyone lay you?

73
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,076
Don't be mean to her.

74
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,148
Why did you send
for me, anyway?

75
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:03,145
Why don't you go bugger
a thief instead?

76
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,921
What's that?

77
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,155
What's what?

78
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:22,671
A gigolo must take
care of his girl.

79
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:25,272
Or work yourself.

80
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:31,478
Let her go, but not him.

81
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:38,152
Drink?

82
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:39,324
No.

83
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,483
How's Akari?

84
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:48,656
It's like you had
your own daughter.

85
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:52,363
I'll have mine soon.

86
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:28,797
Where to?

87
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,133
Home.

88
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,809
I'll walk you home.

89
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,739
Care for a drink?

90
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,075
What'll it be?

91
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,007
Anything.

92
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,483
Two Wild Turkeys.

93
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,457
You come here often?

94
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:20,920
Sometimes.

95
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,162
How's business?

96
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,101
So-so.

97
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:37,809
Your pal?

98
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:39,503
Name's Azuma.

99
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:42,805
What do you do?

100
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,477
We sell guns.

101
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:45,774
Guns?!

102
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,866
Welcome.

103
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:16,232
Dope?

104
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,274
Money first.

105
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:23,638
Why don't you give me
a little discount?

106
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:26,249
Why?

107
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,719
We can't keep this
business forever.

108
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,924
After all, it's us
who take risks.

109
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:39,293
Then go to someone else.

110
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,589
That's a good idea, but...

111
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,000
Kiyohiro.

112
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,569
Let me make a profit.

113
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,645
I know where you get it.

114
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:00,447
Safe and sound.

115
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:02,642
Police?

116
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,616
Exactly.

117
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,583
Then, no other way.

118
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:36,312
Don't ask for
too much, punk.

119
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:40,655
You must know your limit.

120
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:07,142
Kikuchi, lend me money.

121
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,709
5,000 yen?

122
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:10,546
Good.

123
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:12,981
A bet?

124
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,686
No! Gambling is a crime.

125
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:17,826
No.

126
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:33,203
This one's no good.

127
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:36,505
How is it?

128
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,748
Your machines never
let me win.

129
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,347
They do.

130
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,549
No. Few customers.

131
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:46,050
Usually the house is full.

132
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,584
Where are they?

133
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,290
What're you doing?

134
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,229
No bets.

135
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,101
You know how to play?

136
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:58,801
No. Sorry.

137
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:03,105
I'll give you back
what you lost.

138
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:06,971
No! It can send me to jail.
Give it to him.

139
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,877
No! I can't take it!

140
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:14,916
You aren't doing funny
business anymore, are you?

141
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,148
"Funny?"

142
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:17,913
Backdoor.

143
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:20,254
No more gun-smuggling.

144
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:22,285
This, at best.

145
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:30,931
Azuma.

146
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,500
Never mind.

147
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:36,833
Which way?

148
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,304
Tell him.

149
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:40,239
I can't.

150
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:46,681
Follow that prowl car.

151
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:17,511
Azuma. So soon!

152
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:18,815
I did it.

153
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:21,515
Azuma, the cab fare.

154
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,781
I'm broke.

155
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:27,180
Will you pay him off?

156
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:32,655
Carry money.

157
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,215
Kikuchi, it's 1,760 yen.

158
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:55,175
Azuma, it's 1,760 yen.

159
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:18,205
He was stabbed
with a knife.

160
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:24,172
He was convicted for dope.

161
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:25,314
A pusher?

162
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:28,916
Yes. I'll ask the man
who found his body.

163
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:30,183
Mori.

164
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:34,951
Kikuchi.

165
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,351
Help them.

166
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,459
Honma.

167
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:45,030
Give me a loan.

168
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:28,505
Welcome home.

169
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,778
Who's there?

170
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,739
A friend of mine.

171
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,292
Coffee?

172
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:50,364
No.

173
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:59,666
Akari, which way is
the nearest station?

174
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:01,539
Bus?

175
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,345
Never mind.

176
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:04,104
Come.

177
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:05,282
No thanks.

178
00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:06,616
By bus?

179
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,978
No. I'll take a taxi.

180
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,346
Bus.

181
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:11,544
Taxi.

182
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:14,856
Don't bother about me.

183
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:48,420
Name?

184
00:27:49,027 --> 00:27:49,857
Mine?

185
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:52,757
Say your name.

186
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:53,555
Yamada.

187
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:55,830
Where from?

188
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:56,895
Chiba.

189
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:58,866
To lay my sister?

190
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,403
No. I work around here.

191
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:03,941
Where?

192
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:09,679
Shinagawa Machinery.

193
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:13,945
Since when?

194
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,078
Yesterday.

195
00:28:15,787 --> 00:28:19,052
Where did you pick her up?

196
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,084
A discotheque.

197
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:27,992
Damn punk!

198
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,432
Will you marry her?

199
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:37,836
Get a go-between.

200
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:39,809
Go-between?

201
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:41,339
Engagement first.

202
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,107
You won't dump her?

203
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,749
No.

204
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:32,288
Wait! Sorry.

205
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,870
We won't use it.

206
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,812
Maybe we will.

207
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:00,852
It happened before.

208
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:06,027
It was a round-up. Your
bullet hit a neighbor's kid.

209
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:07,798
I aimed to.

210
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:17,630
I've been wondering...
How come you became a cop?

211
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,107
Scouted.

212
00:30:26,818 --> 00:30:28,012
Come on!

213
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:29,216
Sorry.

214
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,036
Hello.

215
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:57,507
A cop and a greenhorn.

216
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,646
A cop and what?

217
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,250
A greenhorn.

218
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,218
What do you mean?

219
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:06,687
The greenhorn.

220
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:08,753
He meant me.

221
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:11,593
Of course.
You and who else?

222
00:31:11,796 --> 00:31:13,229
Cut it out.

223
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:15,223
Look over there.

224
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:18,662
His woman called us.

225
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,900
The murdered
dope- pusher's customer.

226
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:26,567
Let's go.

227
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:29,843
Come on.

228
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:45,960
I'll stay here.

229
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:47,695
Dangerous.

230
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:12,483
No smoking.

231
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:34,106
Him?

232
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:37,679
Who?

233
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:48,855
That's what I meant.

234
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:28,163
Azuma! He got away!

235
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:23,578
A cop needs an ambulance!

236
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:25,578
Send an ambulance!

237
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:28,581
It's an accident!
Emergency!

238
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:29,753
Come!

239
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:53,875
Go quick!

240
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:05,836
No beeping.

241
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:08,443
Don't tell him
where we are.

242
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:09,169
Sorry.

243
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:19,256
He's gone.

244
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:21,957
You can't find him here.

245
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:24,622
Turn.

246
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,995
Would a criminal run here?

247
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:29,026
Sorry.

248
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:34,829
Find an alley and go in.

249
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,175
Turn right.

250
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:42,277
One way.

251
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,710
Never mind. Turn!

252
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:48,480
Stop!

253
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:52,713
Turn when I say "Turn."
It's an emergency.

254
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,956
You must listen to me.
Who said to come here?

255
00:38:58,095 --> 00:38:59,119
He's gone.

256
00:39:00,698 --> 00:39:01,289
There!

257
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:03,492
Go get him!

258
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:17,314
Let me drive.

259
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:49,572
One way.

260
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:04,090
This way.

261
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:17,803
There!

262
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:19,236
I know.

263
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,880
You're going to
run over him.

264
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:54,978
Why did you hit him?

265
00:40:55,613 --> 00:40:56,910
He might be dead.

266
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:12,928
Does he look dead
to you, stupid?

267
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,028
Go back.

268
00:41:52,403 --> 00:41:54,803
Did you have to
run over him?

269
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,872
Write an apology.

270
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:03,175
How?

271
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:05,372
The usual.

272
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:26,226
Did you write an apology?

273
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:28,428
Yes, in your name.

274
00:42:28,973 --> 00:42:30,031
Oh, no!

275
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:01,304
Alone?

276
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:04,573
Drugs?

277
00:43:06,276 --> 00:43:06,970
What kind?

278
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:09,006
Special.

279
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,174
A bargain.

280
00:43:15,452 --> 00:43:15,918
How much?

281
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:21,252
Let's talk in the toilet.
Let's go.

282
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:29,595
I hear you have a sister.

283
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:30,924
Yes.

284
00:43:31,135 --> 00:43:34,434
She was in a hospital.
What was wrong?

285
00:43:35,506 --> 00:43:36,200
Her head.

286
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:37,841
Not again!

287
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:13,176
Stay there.

288
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:15,845
Hashizume!

289
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:20,984
Yes.

290
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,414
What is it?

291
00:44:24,888 --> 00:44:26,856
You tell me. What is it?

292
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:29,219
What's that?

293
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:32,528
Dope. You're pushing it,
aren't you?

294
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,153
No.

295
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:36,255
He had it.

296
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:42,631
You still push dope?
I told you not to.

297
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:50,313
Stop acting, punk.

298
00:44:53,584 --> 00:44:54,846
Emoto died.

299
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:55,881
So what?

300
00:44:58,155 --> 00:44:59,122
I don't know.

301
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,018
Who sells you the stuff?

302
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:04,989
Who?

303
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:08,554
Who?

304
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,329
Go home.

305
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:21,143
Who?

306
00:45:28,886 --> 00:45:30,478
Who?

307
00:45:55,312 --> 00:45:56,574
You know who.

308
00:45:57,815 --> 00:45:59,248
Iwaki, your pal.

309
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:01,347
What did he do?

310
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:03,352
He sells it.

311
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:06,689
You, too?

312
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:25,403
No arrest?

313
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:26,466
No.

314
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:37,983
He meant lwaki of
the vice squad?

315
00:46:42,826 --> 00:46:44,225
Did he talk?

316
00:47:04,348 --> 00:47:05,246
So?

317
00:47:14,524 --> 00:47:15,923
Thanks.

318
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:33,567
Dope?

319
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:35,260
What?

320
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:36,734
Stop acting.

321
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:41,602
We'll sell it and run.

322
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:45,248
What?

323
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,281
What are you saying?

324
00:48:48,986 --> 00:48:51,887
Don't give me that.
Why are you here?

325
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,015
Dope!

326
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:59,360
What can punks
like you do?

327
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:08,533
Go ahead. Try.

328
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:10,762
Nito will kill you.

329
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:14,406
A cop named Azuma is
checking on you.

330
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:23,751
Azuma.

331
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:32,320
Come.

332
00:50:32,456 --> 00:50:34,481
You can fish here.

333
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:38,226
Did you have fun?

334
00:50:38,595 --> 00:50:40,392
No. I stayed home.

335
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:43,793
Feel better?

336
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:46,131
This is not the sea.

337
00:51:17,234 --> 00:51:18,166
What do you want?

338
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:22,836
Iwaki's your old friend?

339
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:24,867
I think so.

340
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:28,106
Has he changed lately?

341
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:29,841
Why?

342
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:34,676
The press wants to know
about him.

343
00:51:35,785 --> 00:51:37,719
I must do something.

344
00:51:39,189 --> 00:51:40,520
Why not ask him?

345
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:42,716
He lost contact.

346
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,522
Not at home. He's missing.

347
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:50,927
Do you know?

348
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:53,497
No, I don't.

349
00:52:25,502 --> 00:52:27,231
Nothing's definite.

350
00:52:29,072 --> 00:52:31,563
Don't worry. I'm all right.

351
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:34,906
Thanks.

352
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:46,248
I'm sorry to have
troubled you, Azuma.

353
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:48,922
Any message?

354
00:52:49,826 --> 00:52:50,622
No.

355
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:55,494
I don't know.

356
00:52:56,766 --> 00:52:58,461
I can't read papers.

357
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:04,438
What's he doing?

358
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:06,932
He should call me.

359
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:54,523
May I ask you a question?

360
00:53:57,927 --> 00:53:59,451
Was it suicide?

361
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:07,129
You were his best
friend, weren't you?

362
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,348
I'll go home.

363
00:54:45,475 --> 00:54:46,533
Brother.

364
00:54:47,143 --> 00:54:48,167
Hello.

365
00:54:48,945 --> 00:54:50,173
Let's go home.

366
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:24,039
No?

367
00:56:24,207 --> 00:56:25,174
No.

368
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:30,169
Maybe there.

369
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:33,883
Up there. That one.

370
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:41,153
"Narcotics."

371
00:56:54,604 --> 00:56:56,128
Let's find them.

372
00:56:58,575 --> 00:56:59,564
Wait.

373
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,303
Ryuji, come here.

374
00:57:05,515 --> 00:57:06,573
You know him?

375
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:13,184
The guy hurt in the
toilet-- his pal.

376
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,187
His address?

377
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:20,828
We don't know.

378
00:57:21,764 --> 00:57:22,696
No news?

379
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:23,933
Nothing.

380
00:57:24,267 --> 00:57:25,029
No?

381
00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:26,398
Thanks.

382
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:30,672
I haven't seen him lately.

383
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:32,906
His address?

384
00:57:33,243 --> 00:57:36,872
I don't know.
Somewhere around here.

385
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:40,276
If he comes again, call us.

386
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:30,732
I think I saw him.

387
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:32,568
Criminal?

388
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:34,294
No, not that.

389
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:38,801
He's a dick.
Have you seen this guy?

390
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,334
No.

391
00:58:42,312 --> 00:58:44,007
He was around here.

392
00:58:46,549 --> 00:58:49,450
If you see him, call us.

393
01:01:54,203 --> 01:01:54,999
He's here.

394
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:21,685
Sir?

395
01:02:28,671 --> 01:02:32,038
I told you to kill only
Emoto and lwaki.

396
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:40,204
Didn't I?

397
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:43,118
Yes, sir.

398
01:02:50,193 --> 01:02:52,161
Why did you
kill Hashizume?

399
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:05,472
Don't act unless ordered.

400
01:03:09,045 --> 01:03:09,875
Yes, sir.

401
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:17,813
You may go.

402
01:03:35,972 --> 01:03:43,003
Shinkai, do we have anybody
who can take care of him?

403
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:30,586
Was he here?

404
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:34,627
I don't know.
I'm new here.

405
01:05:12,902 --> 01:05:14,426
You asked for it.

406
01:05:16,973 --> 01:05:18,600
Hashizume was killed.

407
01:05:21,744 --> 01:05:22,540
By whom?

408
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,942
Kiyohiro.

409
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,283
No one else.

410
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:32,044
Kiyohiro? What is he?

411
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:35,047
Nito's henchman.

412
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:37,784
Did he kill lwaki, too?

413
01:05:38,661 --> 01:05:40,026
He's crazy.

414
01:05:41,998 --> 01:05:44,660
He'll do anything for Nito.

415
01:05:46,268 --> 01:05:48,327
Nito told him to kill?

416
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:50,504
Not only that.

417
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,235
He likes killing.

418
01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:57,210
You'll be next.

419
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:01,209
Only after you, idiot.

420
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:54,980
I'm Nito.

421
01:08:57,092 --> 01:09:00,220
Won't you come in?

422
01:09:00,496 --> 01:09:03,829
A restaurant with
dope-pushers and killers?

423
01:09:05,568 --> 01:09:06,364
Pardon?

424
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:08,503
You know what I mean.

425
01:09:13,409 --> 01:09:14,205
Kiyohiro?

426
01:09:16,212 --> 01:09:19,045
Kiyohiro? Who is he?

427
01:09:19,348 --> 01:09:21,407
Your assassin.

428
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:29,757
If you want to question me,
get a warrant first.

429
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,020
Our gift.

430
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:40,765
I'm afraid it doesn't
become your tie.

431
01:09:44,873 --> 01:09:47,034
I'll return your favor.

432
01:09:49,945 --> 01:09:53,847
Come for dinner next time.

433
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:57,348
Use the backdoor.

434
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:07,358
Arrest?

435
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:13,962
So you tailed me?

436
01:10:14,403 --> 01:10:15,563
Bedroom.

437
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,980
Good taste.

438
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:38,891
Dope?

439
01:10:42,798 --> 01:10:44,561
Do I have dope?

440
01:10:45,834 --> 01:10:46,926
Where?

441
01:10:48,137 --> 01:10:48,865
Here.

442
01:10:56,278 --> 01:10:58,109
Shame on you!

443
01:11:01,116 --> 01:11:02,174
Get dressed.

444
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,454
What're you doing?

445
01:11:46,995 --> 01:11:48,155
Nothing.

446
01:11:58,507 --> 01:11:59,667
Who's in there?

447
01:13:16,618 --> 01:13:18,711
That's a dirty trick.

448
01:13:21,089 --> 01:13:22,852
It won't work on me.

449
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:28,257
You killed lwaki?

450
01:13:29,832 --> 01:13:31,322
He killed himself.

451
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,330
Then, kill yourself.

452
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:37,963
If you want to
kill me, go ahead.

453
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:51,982
Aim at me.

454
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,989
You're nuts
like your sister.

455
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:48,566
You're fired!

456
01:14:50,746 --> 01:14:52,680
You framed him,

457
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:56,516
Iocked him up, and
tortured him.

458
01:14:58,086 --> 01:14:59,519
That's enough.

459
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:02,346
You're fired.

460
01:15:06,128 --> 01:15:08,323
You even shot at him.

461
01:15:09,698 --> 01:15:11,859
You're wild! Stupid!

462
01:15:12,935 --> 01:15:15,165
Write your resignation!

463
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:19,240
Now!

464
01:15:53,408 --> 01:15:58,869
If you make more trouble,
I'll be finished.

465
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:07,386
You should get the ax,
but I'll save your honor.

466
01:16:08,123 --> 01:16:10,114
Just quit the force.

467
01:16:14,162 --> 01:16:16,790
Consider what you've done.

468
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:23,164
Your investigation is
useless. Iwaki killed himself.

469
01:18:07,743 --> 01:18:13,181
Give her a thrill. You're
not screwing a Dutch wife.

470
01:18:13,381 --> 01:18:16,077
It's her fault.
She doesn't move.

471
01:18:18,453 --> 01:18:20,614
She's keeping cool.

472
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:24,857
Where did he find her?

473
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:25,958
A bakery.

474
01:18:26,161 --> 01:18:27,753
Who knows?

475
01:18:28,597 --> 01:18:32,897
Why don't you let me do it?

476
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:37,134
You know how
to screw a girl?

477
01:18:37,339 --> 01:18:39,273
I'm bi, you know.

478
01:18:41,576 --> 01:18:44,602
She needs a shot.

479
01:18:44,946 --> 01:18:48,143
Don't waste it on her.

480
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,908
Give it to me.

481
01:18:50,118 --> 01:18:54,077
You took too much junk
and went goofy.

482
01:18:54,523 --> 01:18:58,960
What? How mean!

483
01:20:13,568 --> 01:20:17,368
This stuff is expensive.

484
01:24:49,744 --> 01:24:52,838
No! Let go of me!

485
01:24:53,715 --> 01:24:54,704
Hold him.

486
01:24:56,985 --> 01:24:58,077
Water?

487
01:24:58,286 --> 01:25:01,187
Junk is too good for you.

488
01:25:02,757 --> 01:25:05,749
I'm not your woman. Why?

489
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:40,325
She's dumb.
We wasted a shot on her.

490
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,270
You attacked
the detective?

491
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,111
Why?

492
01:26:02,217 --> 01:26:06,950
He's on your tail.
Someday he'll finish you.

493
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:16,528
It's you who's
going to finish me.

494
01:26:18,733 --> 01:26:20,598
How can I save your ass?

495
01:26:22,203 --> 01:26:23,465
How can you?

496
01:26:26,574 --> 01:26:28,166
I want to kill you.

497
01:26:57,272 --> 01:26:59,297
Never see me again.

498
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:34,166
An ex-cop wanting
an illegal gun?

499
01:27:34,442 --> 01:27:35,909
Here's one.

500
01:27:43,785 --> 01:27:44,945
What for?

501
01:27:47,055 --> 01:27:48,613
Never mind.

502
01:27:48,956 --> 01:27:50,583
Let's be friends.

503
01:28:24,525 --> 01:28:30,054
You suspect me,
but you're wrong.

504
01:28:31,799 --> 01:28:32,993
I'm innocent.

505
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:37,594
He's nuts. We're through.

506
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:08,925
Please! Give me a shot!

507
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:10,822
Beat it!

508
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:43,095
Her brother's coming.

509
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:50,598
He'll kill you.

510
01:30:59,914 --> 01:31:02,576
You raped her. Don't run.

511
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:12,957
If you do, I'll kill you.

512
01:31:23,504 --> 01:31:26,735
Either way, you're
going to die.

513
01:31:50,064 --> 01:31:51,531
No kidding!

514
01:35:52,139 --> 01:35:52,901
Dope...

515
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:07,751
Dope...

516
01:37:16,557 --> 01:37:18,752
Everybody's crazy.

517
01:39:02,896 --> 01:39:04,659
You replace Iwaki?

518
01:39:08,235 --> 01:39:09,827
I'm much smarter.
