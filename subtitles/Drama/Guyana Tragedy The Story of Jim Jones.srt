1
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,671
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

2
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,572
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

3
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,956
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning or in rain?

4
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:23,692
When the hurlyburly's done.
When the battle's lost and won.

5
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,133
- That would be ere the set of sun.
- Where?

6
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,218
Upon the heath.

7
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:33,806
There to meet with Macbeth.

8
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:05,587
- What bloody man is that?
- Hail, friend!

9
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:09,758
Say to the king thy knowledge
of the broil as thou left it.

10
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:16,014
The merciless Macdonwald led
his rebellion from the Western Isles.

11
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:19,247
And fortune on
his damned quarrel smiled.

12
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,896
- But, brave Macbeth...
- He deserves that name.

13
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,233
- Carved out a passage
till he faced the slave.

14
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,257
And ne'er shook hands
nor bade farewell...

15
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:33,428
...till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops.

16
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:35,722
Valiant cousin!

17
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,059
Upon this chance did
the Norwegian king...

18
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,812
...with new supplies of men,
begin a fresh assault.

19
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:47,296
Dismayed not this our captains,
Macbeth and Banquo?

20
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:51,884
Yes. As sparrows eagles,
or the hare the lion.

21
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:56,785
So well thy words become thee as
thy wounds. They smack of honour.

22
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:59,496
Go get him surgeons.

23
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:13,260
- God save the king.
- What news, worthy thane?

24
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,763
Norway, in terrible numbers...

25
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:19,725
...assisted by this traitor,
the Thane of Cawdor...

26
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,314
...began a dismal conflict till
Bellona's bridegroom, Macbeth...

27
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:29,214
...confronts the king arm against arm,
curbing his lavish spirit.

28
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:32,864
And to conclude,
the victory fell on us.

29
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:38,808
Great happiness! No more that thane
shall deceive our bosom interest.

30
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:42,353
Go pronounce his present death.

31
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:48,297
And with his former title,
greet Macbeth.

32
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:13,176
So foul and fair a day
I have not seen.

33
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,789
What are these?

34
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:46,648
So withered and wild
in their attire...

35
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,193
...that look not like
inhabitants of the Earth.

36
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:55,302
Speak, if you can.
What are you?

37
00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:02,184
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.

38
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,754
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.

39
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:13,237
All hail, Macbeth,
that shall be king hereafter.

40
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,622
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
which outwardly you show?

41
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,106
My partner you greet with grace
and great prediction...

42
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:29,713
...that he seems rapt withal.

43
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:32,841
To me you speak not.

44
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,386
If you can look into
the seeds of time...

45
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:42,017
...and say which grain will grow
and which will not, speak to me...

46
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:46,814
...who neither beg nor fear
your favours nor your hate.

47
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:51,610
Hail! Lesser than Macbeth,
and greater.

48
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,573
Not so happy, yet much happier.

49
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,848
Thou shalt beget kings,
though thou be none.

50
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:02,663
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.

51
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:06,730
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail.

52
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:12,256
Stay, you imperfect speakers!
Tell me more.

53
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:18,304
By Sinel's death,
I know I am Thane of Glamis.

54
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,328
But how of Cawdor?

55
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:25,082
Say from whence you owe
this intelligence.

56
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:31,026
Or why upon this heath you stop
our way with such prophetic greeting?

57
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:39,368
Whither are they vanished?

58
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,894
Into the air.

59
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:57,928
And what seemed corporal melted,
as breath into the wind.

60
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,559
Were such things here
as we do speak about?

61
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:08,982
Or have we eaten of the insane root
that takes reason prisoner?

62
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,641
Your children shall be kings.

63
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:26,604
You shall be king.
And Thane of Cawdor. Went it not so?

64
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,045
To the selfsame tune and words.

65
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,349
The Thane of Cawdor lives.

66
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,790
And to be king...

67
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:49,857
... stands not within
the prospect of belief.

68
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,028
No more than to be Cawdor.

69
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:25,519
The king hath happily received
the news of thy success.

70
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:30,524
Thick as hail came post with post,
and everyone did bear thy praises.

71
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:36,885
We are sent to give thee from
our royal master thanks, not pay thee.

72
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:41,264
And for an earnest of a greater
honour, he bade me call thee...

73
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:44,288
...Thane of Cawdor.

74
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:47,208
What?

75
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,961
Can the devil speak true?

76
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:54,924
He lives. Why do you
dress me in borrowed robes?

77
00:13:55,237 --> 00:14:00,555
Who was the thane lives yet,
but that life he deserves to lose.

78
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:05,351
Treasons capital, confessed
and proved, have overthrown him.

79
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:19,845
Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor.

80
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:22,869
The greatest is behind.

81
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,789
Thanks for your pains.

82
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:34,339
Do you not hope
your children shall be kings?

83
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:38,719
Those that gave Cawdor to me,
promised no less to them.

84
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,288
That, trusted home, might yet
enkindle you unto the crown...

85
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:48,312
...besides the Thane of Cawdor.

86
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:55,611
Often, to win us to our harm,
instruments of darkness tell truths.

87
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,929
Win us with honest trifles,
to betray us in deepest consequence.

88
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,670
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill...

89
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:14,172
... cannot be good.

90
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:21,680
If ill, why hath it given me earnest
of success, commencing in a truth?

91
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:25,851
I am Thane of Cawdor.

92
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,776
If good, why do I yield
to that suggestion...

93
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:38,572
... whose horrid image doth unfix
my hair and make my seated heart...

94
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:42,118
... knock at my ribs
against the use of nature?

95
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:48,583
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.

96
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:54,213
My thought, whose murder yet
is but fantastical...

97
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:57,759
... shakes so my single state of man...

98
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:02,138
... that function is smothered
in surmise...

99
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,954
... and nothing is but what is not.

100
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:15,902
I thank you, gentlemen.

101
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:27,790
Look how our partner's rapt.

102
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:33,733
If chance will have me king,
chance may crown me without my stir.

103
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:38,843
Worthy Macbeth.
We stay upon your leisure.

104
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:48,227
Give me your favour, my dull brain
was wrought with things forgotten.

105
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:50,521
Let us to the king.

106
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:12,585
Long live the king.

107
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:25,619
Nothing in his life became him
like the leaving it.

108
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:31,250
He threw away the dearest thing he
owed as if it were a careless trifle.

109
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:35,630
There's no art to find
a mind's construction in the face.

110
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,653
On him I built an absolute trust.

111
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,628
"Hail, king that shalt be.

112
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:18,799
This have I thought good
to deliver thee...

113
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:22,553
...my dearest partner of greatness...

114
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:28,601
...that thou might not be ignorant
of what greatness is promised thee.

115
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:34,440
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."

116
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:39,132
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor...

117
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:42,782
...and shalt be what thou art promised.

118
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,327
Yet I do fear thy nature.

119
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,167
It is too full of the milk of human
kindness to catch the nearest way.

120
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,129
Thou wouldst be great...

121
00:19:56,442 --> 00:20:01,551
... art not without ambition, but
without the illness should attend it.

122
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:05,305
What thou wouldst highly,
thou wouldst holily.

123
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:09,685
Wouldst not play false,
yet wouldst wrongly win.

124
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:15,941
Hie thee hither, that I may pour
my spirits in thine ear.

125
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,529
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, Thane of Cawdor!

126
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:25,639
Worthiest cousin! The sin of
my ingratitude was heavy on me.

127
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:31,999
Only I have left to say, more is
thy due than more than all can pay.

128
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:36,275
The service and the loyalty
I owe pays itself.

129
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,464
Your part is to receive our duties.

130
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:45,138
Welcome. I have begun to plant thee
and will labour to make thee grow.

131
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:48,370
Noble Banquo,
that has no less deserved...

132
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:52,228
...let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart.

133
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,191
There if I grow,
the harvest is your own.

134
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:07,244
Sons, kinsmen, thanes, and you
whose places are the nearest...

135
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:10,998
...know we will establish our estate...

136
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:14,335
...upon our eldest, Malcolm.

137
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:22,885
Whom we name hereafter
the Prince of Cumberland.

138
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,071
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!

139
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,825
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!

140
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:50,518
Go hence to Inverness
and bind us further to you.

141
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:58,338
I'll go and make joyful the hearing
of my wife with your approach.

142
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:03,343
- So humbly take my leave.
- My worthy Cawdor.

143
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,078
It is a peerless kinsman.

144
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,728
The Prince of Cumberland!

145
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:18,776
That is a step on which I must
fall down, or else o'erleap.

146
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,383
For in my way it lies.

147
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,198
Macbeth! Macbeth!

148
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,516
Stars, hide your fires.

149
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:34,417
Let not light see my black
and deep desires.

150
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:18,421
Great Glamis. Worthy Cawdor.

151
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:24,886
Greater than both
by the all-hail hereafter.

152
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:28,014
Thy letter transported me
beyond this present...

153
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:33,645
...and I feel the future
in the instant.
My dearest love...

154
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:36,981
...Duncan comes here tonight.

155
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:46,992
- And when goes hence?
- Tomorrow, as he purposes.

156
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:57,002
Never shall sun that morrow see.

157
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:10,140
Your face is as a book
where men may read strange matters.

158
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,164
He that's coming must be provided for.

159
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:17,231
You shall put this night's
business into my dispatch.

160
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,421
We will speak further.

161
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:23,905
Look like the innocent flower,
but be the serpent under it.

162
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:26,616
Leave all the rest to me.

163
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:35,958
The raven croaks the fatal entrance
of Duncan under my battlements.

164
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:41,067
Come, you spirits that tend on
mortal thoughts. Unsex me here.

165
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,073
Fill me from the crown to the toe
top-full of direst cruelty.

166
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:50,869
Make thick my blood. Stop up
the access and passage to remorse...

167
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:55,353
... that no compunctious visitings
of nature shake my purpose.

168
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,652
This castle hath a pleasant seat.

169
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:08,596
The air nimbly and sweetly recommends
itself unto our gentle senses.

170
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:07,406
Come, thick night, pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell...

171
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:11,786
... that my keen knife
see not the wound it makes...

172
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:15,540
... nor heaven peep through
the dark to cry, "Hold!"

173
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:43,172
Fair and noble hostess,
we are your guest tonight.

174
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:45,779
Your servant ever.

175
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,557
Give me your hand.

176
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:58,501
Conduct me to mine host.

177
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:03,297
We love him highly and shall
continue our graces towards him.

178
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:59,605
If it were done when 'tis done,
then 'twere well it were done quickly.

179
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:05,549
If the assassination could
trammel up the consequence...

180
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:10,241
... and catch,
with his surcease, success.

181
00:29:10,554 --> 00:29:16,080
That but this blow might be
the be-all and the end-all here.

182
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:20,668
But here, upon this bank
and shoal of time...

183
00:29:20,877 --> 00:29:23,588
... we'd jump the life to come.

184
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:27,133
Health to this household!

185
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:43,192
But in these cases,
we still have judgement here...

186
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,528
... that we but teach
bloody instructions...

187
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:50,595
... which, being taught,
return to plague the inventor.

188
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,681
He's here in double trust.

189
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:57,748
First, as I am his kinsman
and his subject...

190
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,980
... strong both against the deed.

191
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:04,525
Then as his host...

192
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:11,616
...who should against his murderer shut
the door, not bear the knife myself.

193
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:20,375
Besides, this Duncan hath borne
his faculties so meek...

194
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:23,295
... hath been so clear
in his great office...

195
00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:28,508
... that his virtues will plead
like angels, trumpet-tongued...

196
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:32,679
... against the deep damnation
of his taking-off.

197
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:39,249
And pity, like a newborn babe striding
the blast, or heaven's cherubin...

198
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:44,254
... horsed upon the sightless couriers
of the air, shall blow...

199
00:31:44,462 --> 00:31:49,363
... the horrid deed in every eye,
that tears shall drown the wind.

200
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:54,577
I have no spur to prick
the sides of my intent.

201
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:57,288
But only vaulting ambition...

202
00:31:57,497 --> 00:32:01,668
...which o'erleaps itself
and falls on the other side.

203
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:07,298
- Why have you left the chamber?
- Hath he asked for me?

204
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:10,009
Know you not he has?

205
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:14,597
We will proceed no further
in this business.

206
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,228
He hath honoured me of late.

207
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:24,608
And I have bought golden opinions
from all sorts of people...

208
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:30,239
...which would be worn in their newest
gloss, not cast aside so soon.

209
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:44,003
Was the hope drunk,
wherein you dressed yourself?

210
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,695
Hath it slept since?

211
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:54,430
And wakes it now to look so green
and pale at what it did so freely?

212
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,104
From this time
such I account thy love.

213
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,242
Art thou afeard to be the same
in act as in desire?

214
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:21,854
Prithee, peace.
Wouldst thou live a coward, letting
"I dare not" wait upon "I would"?

215
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:24,461
Like the poor cat in the adage?

216
00:33:24,774 --> 00:33:30,718
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares do more is none.

217
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:39,477
What beast was it then, that made you
break this enterprise to me?

218
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,439
When you durst do it,
then you were a man.

219
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:48,444
To be more than what you were,
you would be so much more the man.

220
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:06,379
Hail, Thane of Cawdor.

221
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,812
If we should fail?

222
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,817
We fail.

223
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:33,282
But screw your courage to
the sticking-place and we'll not fail.

224
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:39,434
Duncan's two chamberlains
will I with wine so convince...

225
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:43,814
...that memory, the warder
of the brain, shall be a fume.

226
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:47,463
I'll drug their possets.

227
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:55,909
When in swinish sleep their drenched
natures lie as in a death...

228
00:34:56,118 --> 00:35:01,019
...what cannot you and I perform
upon the unguarded Duncan?

229
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,563
Bring forth men-children only...

230
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:48,985
... for thy undaunted mettle
should compose nothing but males.

231
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:57,806
How goes the night?

232
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:01,351
The moon is down.
I have not heard the clock.

233
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:06,148
- She goes down at 12.
- I take it 'tis later, sir.

234
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,527
Take my sword.

235
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:16,679
There's husbandry in heaven.

236
00:37:16,888 --> 00:37:19,703
Their candles are all out.

237
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,874
Take thee that too.

238
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:31,695
A heavy summons lies like lead
upon me, and yet I would not sleep.

239
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,828
Merciful powers, restrain the thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose.

240
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:41,601
Who's there?

241
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,686
A friend.

242
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,961
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The king's abed.

243
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,777
He hath been in unusual pleasure...

244
00:37:51,507 --> 00:37:54,531
...and sent great largess
to your offices.

245
00:37:54,739 --> 00:38:00,162
Being unprepared, our will
became the servant to defect.
All's well.

246
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,442
I dreamt last night
of the three weird sisters.

247
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:15,073
- To you they have showed some truth.
- I think not of them.

248
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:18,409
Yet, when we can entreat
an hour to serve...

249
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:23,415
...we would spend it in words upon
that business if you'd grant the time.

250
00:38:23,623 --> 00:38:25,917
At your kindest leisure.

251
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,837
It shall make honour for you.

252
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,155
So I lose none in seeking to
augment it. I shall be counselled.

253
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:43,122
Good repose the while.

254
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:47,502
Thanks, sir. The like to you.

255
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:20,974
Is this a dagger
which I see before me...

256
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:24,415
... the handle toward my hand?

257
00:39:32,757 --> 00:39:34,634
Come...

258
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:38,179
...let me clutch thee.

259
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:46,730
I have thee not,
and yet I see thee still.

260
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:50,692
Art thou not, fatal vision...

261
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:54,446
...sensible to feeling as to sight?

262
00:39:57,783 --> 00:39:59,972
Or art thou but a dagger
of the mind...

263
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:04,665
...a false creation, proceeding
from the heat-oppressed brain?

264
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,295
I see thee yet...

265
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:16,552
...in form as palpable as this
which now I draw.

266
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:22,704
Thou marshal'st me the way
that I was going.

267
00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:26,562
And such an instrument I was to use.

268
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,278
Mine eyes are made the fools
of the other senses...

269
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:37,407
...or else worth all the rest.

270
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:41,265
I see thee still!

271
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:45,436
And on thy blade and dudgeon,
gouts of blood...

272
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,834
...which was not so before.

273
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:53,256
There's no such thing.

274
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:58,679
It is the bloody business
which informs thus to mine eyes.

275
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,480
Now o'er the one half-world
nature seems dead...

276
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:15,884
... and withered murder,
alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf...

277
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:19,116
... whose howl's his watch.

278
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:24,226
Thus with his stealthy pace,
with Tarquin's ravishing strides...

279
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:28,918
... towards his design
moves like a ghost.

280
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:35,383
Thou sure and firm-set earth...

281
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:39,554
... hear not my steps,
which way they walk...

282
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,829
... for fear the very stones prate
of my whereabouts.

283
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:53,214
Hear it not, Duncan...

284
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:57,698
... for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven...

285
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,992
... or to hell.

286
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:09,666
I'm afraid they have awaked,
and 'tis not done.

287
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,524
The attempt and not the deed
confounds us.

288
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,027
Hark!

289
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:22,388
Peace! It was the owl that shrieked...

290
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:27,080
... the fatal bellman, which gives
the sternest good night.

291
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:30,000
My husband?

292
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:57,841
I have done the deed.

293
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:03,159
Didst thou not hear a noise?

294
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:06,808
I heard the owl and the crickets.

295
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:10,145
- Did not you speak? Now.
- As I descended?

296
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:13,169
- Ay.
- Hark!

297
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:17,757
- Who lies in the second chamber?
- Donalbain.

298
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:28,393
This is a sorry sight.
A foolish thought,
to say a sorry sight.

299
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:33,711
Methought I heard a voice cry,
"Sleep no more.

300
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,943
Macbeth does murder sleep."

301
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:43,513
The innocent sleep, sleep that
knits up the ravelled sleave of care.

302
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:49,248
The death of each day's life, sore
labour's bath, balm of hurt minds.

303
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:52,897
Nature's second course,
chief nourisher in life's feast.

304
00:46:53,106 --> 00:46:59,362
Still it cried to all the house,
"Glamis hath murdered sleep...

305
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:04,785
...and Cawdor shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more!"

306
00:47:04,993 --> 00:47:07,809
Who was it that thus cried?

307
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:13,127
These deeds must not be thought
after these ways so...

308
00:47:13,335 --> 00:47:15,942
...it will make us mad.

309
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:24,701
Get some water, and wash
this filthy witness from your hands.

310
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:39,404
Why did you bring these daggers
from the place?

311
00:47:41,385 --> 00:47:44,304
They must lie there.

312
00:47:44,617 --> 00:47:46,598
I'll go no more.

313
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:50,874
I am afraid of what I have done.
Look on it again I dare not.

314
00:47:51,082 --> 00:47:53,898
Infirm of purpose!

315
00:47:55,462 --> 00:47:57,860
Give me the daggers.

316
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:10,790
If he do bleed...

317
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:15,378
...l'll gild the faces
of the grooms withal...

318
00:48:15,587 --> 00:48:18,715
...for it must seem their guilt.

319
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:48,954
Whence is that knocking?

320
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:54,585
How is it with me,
when every noise appals me?

321
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:10,435
What hands are here?
They pluck out mine eyes!

322
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:15,857
Will great Neptune's ocean wash
this blood clean from my hand?

323
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:20,028
No, this my hand will rather...

324
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:24,616
...the multitudinous seas
incarnadine...

325
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:28,266
...making the green one red.

326
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:36,712
My hands are of your colour...

327
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:44,011
...but I scorn to wear
a heart so white.

328
00:49:47,244 --> 00:49:50,476
A little water clears us of this deed.

329
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:56,315
How easy is it, then!

330
00:50:04,032 --> 00:50:06,117
Retire we to our chamber.

331
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:10,809
Get on your nightgown,
lest occasion show us to be watchers.

332
00:50:11,644 --> 00:50:14,459
Be not lost so poorly
in your thoughts.

333
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:19,047
To know my deed,
'twere best not know myself.

334
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:26,763
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!

335
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,892
I would thou couldst.

336
00:50:40,528 --> 00:50:43,447
Here's a knocking indeed!

337
00:50:43,656 --> 00:50:48,452
If a man were porter of hell gate,
he'd have less turning the key.

338
00:50:48,765 --> 00:50:53,666
Who's there, in the name of Beelzebub?

339
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:06,805
Knock, knock. Who's there,
in the other devil's name?

340
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:12,748
Knock, knock.
Never at quiet. What are you?

341
00:51:12,957 --> 00:51:18,692
One that goes the primrose way
to the everlasting bonfire?

342
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,678
I'll devil-porter it no further.

343
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:29,015
This place is too cold for hell.

344
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:32,665
Anon, anon!

345
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,694
Was it so late ere you went to bed,
that you lie so late?

346
00:51:40,694 --> 00:51:44,135
We were carousing
till the second cock...

347
00:51:44,343 --> 00:51:48,201
...and drink, sir, is a great provoker
of three things.

348
00:51:48,514 --> 00:51:53,207
- What three things?
- Nose-painting, sleep and urine.

349
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,899
Lechery, sir, it provokes
and it unprovokes.

350
00:51:58,212 --> 00:52:03,321
It provokes the desire
but takes away the performance.

351
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,701
It makes you, it mars you,
it sets you on...

352
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:13,123
...it takes you off, it persuades you,
it disheartens you...

353
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:17,085
...it makes you stand to
and not stand to.

354
00:52:17,294 --> 00:52:20,839
- Drink gave thee the lie last night.
- That it did.

355
00:52:21,048 --> 00:52:24,802
- Is thy master stirring?
- Good morrow.

356
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,347
- Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
- Not yet.

357
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:33,978
He did command me to call timely.
I have almost slipped the hour.

358
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,940
I'll bring you to him.

359
00:53:01,923 --> 00:53:03,800
This is the door.

360
00:53:04,009 --> 00:53:07,762
I'll make so bold to call,
for 'tis my appointed service.

361
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:16,626
- Goes the king hence today?
- He does. He did appoint so.

362
00:53:16,939 --> 00:53:20,901
The night has been unruly.
Our chimneys were blown down.

363
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:27,053
And, as they say, lamentings heard
in the air, strange screams of death.

364
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:29,764
Some say the earth was feverous.

365
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:33,205
- 'Twas a rough night.
- Oh, horror!

366
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:40,504
Horror, horror! Confusion now
hath made his masterpiece!

367
00:53:40,713 --> 00:53:44,780
Murder hath broke open
the Lord's anointed temple.

368
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:48,846
- What is it you say?
- Mean you His Majesty?

369
00:53:49,055 --> 00:53:51,349
Do not bid me speak.

370
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:55,728
See, and then speak yourselves.

371
00:53:57,397 --> 00:53:59,274
Awake!

372
00:53:59,587 --> 00:54:03,758
Awake! Ring the alarm bell!

373
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,990
Murder and treason!

374
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,265
Malcolm and Donalbain!
Banquo! Awake!

375
00:54:12,308 --> 00:54:17,730
Shake off this downy sleep, death's
counterfeit, and look on death itself!

376
00:54:17,939 --> 00:54:21,693
Up! Up!
And see the great doom's image.

377
00:54:21,901 --> 00:54:26,802
Fleance! Banquo!
Rise up as from your graves...

378
00:54:27,011 --> 00:54:30,765
...and walk like spirits
to countenance this horror.

379
00:54:30,973 --> 00:54:32,746
Ring the bell!

380
00:55:25,404 --> 00:55:28,532
What's the business,
that a hideous trumpet calls...

381
00:55:28,845 --> 00:55:32,703
...to parley the sleepers
of the house? Speak!

382
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:36,666
Gentle lady, 'tis not for you
to hear what I speak.

383
00:55:36,874 --> 00:55:41,671
Banquo, our royal master's murdered.

384
00:55:41,879 --> 00:55:43,965
Woe, alas!

385
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:48,970
What, in our house?

386
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,473
Too cruel anywhere.

387
00:55:53,245 --> 00:55:56,895
I prithee, contradict thyself,
and say it is not so.

388
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:01,379
Had I but died before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time.

389
00:56:01,587 --> 00:56:04,403
There is nothing serious in mortality.

390
00:56:04,507 --> 00:56:07,739
All is but toys.
Renown and grace is dead.

391
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:12,015
- What is amiss?
- You are, and do not know it.

392
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:15,247
Your royal father's murdered.

393
00:56:23,693 --> 00:56:24,945
By whom?

394
00:56:25,153 --> 00:56:27,656
Those of his chambers, it seemed,
had done it.

395
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:31,722
They were all badged with blood.
So were their daggers.

396
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:36,519
O, yet I do repent me of my fury
that I did kill them.

397
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:52,994
Wherefore did you so?

398
00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:56,331
Who can be wise, amazed,
temperate and furious...

399
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,772
...loyal and neutral
in a moment? No man!

400
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:03,317
Here lay Duncan,
his skin laced with his blood.

401
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:08,010
There the murderers, steeped
in the colours of their trade.

402
00:57:08,218 --> 00:57:11,764
Who could refrain,
that had a heart to love?

403
00:57:11,972 --> 00:57:16,143
And in that heart, courage
to make his love known?

404
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:56,289
Let's briefly put on manly readiness
and meet in the hall together...

405
00:57:56,497 --> 00:58:00,772
...to question
this most bloody piece of work.

406
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:04,213
Fears and scruples shake us.

407
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:07,446
In the great hand of God I stand.

408
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:12,034
Against the undivulged pretence
I fight of treasonous malice.

409
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:15,371
- So do I.
- So all.

410
00:58:19,854 --> 00:58:22,461
What will you do?

411
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,798
Let's not consort with them.

412
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:29,969
- I'll to England.
- To Ireland, I.

413
00:58:30,282 --> 00:58:34,453
Our separated fortune shall
keep us both the safer.

414
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:37,998
Where we are,
there's daggers in men's smiles.

415
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:43,108
This murderous shaft that's shot
hath not yet lighted.

416
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:46,757
Therefore to horse.

417
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:52,909
And let us not be dainty
of leave-taking.

418
00:58:56,246 --> 00:58:58,332
Shift away.

419
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:40,875
- How goes the world, Macduff?
- Why? See you not?

420
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:44,838
Is it known who did
this more than bloody deed?

421
00:59:47,132 --> 00:59:52,450
- Those that Macbeth hath slain.
- What good could they expect?

422
00:59:52,658 --> 00:59:58,811
They were suborned. Malcolm and
Donalbain, the king's sons, are fled...

423
00:59:59,123 --> 01:00:02,564
...which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed.

424
01:00:03,086 --> 01:00:06,944
Then 'tis most like the sovereignty
will fall upon Macbeth.

425
01:00:07,048 --> 01:00:10,593
He's already named
and gone to Scone to be invested.

426
01:00:10,802 --> 01:00:14,869
- Will you to Scone?
- No, cousin, I'll home to Fife.

427
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,371
Well, I will thither.

428
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:23,211
May you see things well done there.
Adieu.

429
01:00:47,402 --> 01:00:49,696
Thou hast it now.

430
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:54,180
King, Cawdor, Glamis...

431
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:57,830
... all as the weird women promised.

432
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:03,043
And I fear thou play'dst
most foully for it.

433
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:14,201
Yet it was said it should not
stand in thy posterity.

434
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:18,997
But that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.

435
01:01:19,206 --> 01:01:22,438
If there comes truth from them...

436
01:01:22,647 --> 01:01:25,879
... may they not be
my oracles as well...

437
01:01:26,088 --> 01:01:28,903
... and set me up in hope?

438
01:01:33,283 --> 01:01:38,184
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!

439
01:01:38,392 --> 01:01:43,189
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!

440
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:05,295
Here's our chief guest.

441
01:02:05,503 --> 01:02:10,196
If he had been forgotten, it'd have
been a gap in our great feast.

442
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:19,163
Tonight we hold a solemn supper,
and I'll request your presence.

443
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,979
Let Your Highness command upon me...

444
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:27,505
...to the which my duties are with
a most indissoluble tie forever knit.

445
01:02:27,818 --> 01:02:30,946
- Ride you this afternoon?
- Ay, my lord.

446
01:02:31,155 --> 01:02:33,032
Is it far you ride?

447
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,724
As far as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper.

448
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:41,895
- Fail not our feast.
- My lord, I will not.

449
01:02:45,336 --> 01:02:48,569
We hear our bloody cousins are
in England and Ireland...

450
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:51,801
...not confessing
their cruel parricide.

451
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:56,911
But of that tomorrow. Hie you to
horse. Adieu till you return at night.

452
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:01,811
- Goes Fleance with you?
- Ay, my lord.

453
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:07,442
I wish your horses swift
and sure of foot. Farewell.

454
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:21,311
- Attend those men our leisure?
- They do.
Bring them before us.

455
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:27,567
To be thus is nothing,
but to be safely thus.

456
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:32,051
Our fears in Banquo stick deep.
In his royalty of nature...

457
01:03:32,259 --> 01:03:36,952
...he hath a wisdom that doth guide
his valour to act in safety.

458
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,184
There is none but he
whose being do I fear.

459
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:43,938
And under him my genius is rebuked.

460
01:03:48,526 --> 01:03:53,844
We'll keep ourself till suppertime
alone. Till then, God be with you.

461
01:03:56,764 --> 01:04:01,560
He chid the sisters, when first
they put the name of king upon me...

462
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:05,106
... and bade them speak to him.

463
01:04:05,314 --> 01:04:08,860
Then, prophet-like they hailed him...

464
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:12,301
... father to a line of kings.

465
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:15,220
Upon my head,
they placed a fruitless crown...

466
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:18,453
... and put a barren sceptre
in my grip.

467
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:24,292
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal
hand, no son of mine succeeding.

468
01:04:25,439 --> 01:04:27,629
If it be so...

469
01:04:27,837 --> 01:04:31,383
... for Banquo's sons
have I defiled my mind.

470
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:36,179
For them the gracious Duncan
have I murdered.

471
01:04:36,388 --> 01:04:42,019
To make them kings.
The seeds of Banquo kings.

472
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,243
Stay within call.

473
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:03,395
- Was it not yesterday we spoke?
- It was, Your Highness.

474
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:14,031
Well then now, have you
considered of my speeches?

475
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,619
Know that it was he in times past
which held you under fortune...

476
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:24,145
...which you thought had been
our innocent self.
You made this known to us.

477
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:30,715
Is patience so predominant in
your nature that you can let this go?

478
01:05:30,923 --> 01:05:35,407
Are you so gospelled to pray
for this man and for his issue...

479
01:05:35,616 --> 01:05:40,934
...whose heavy hand has bowed you to
the grave and beggared yours forever?

480
01:05:43,332 --> 01:05:46,043
We are men, my liege.

481
01:05:47,398 --> 01:05:51,778
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men.

482
01:05:52,508 --> 01:05:57,722
As hounds and greyhounds,
mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs...

483
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:02,935
...water-rugs and demi-wolves are
clept, all by the name of dogs.

484
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:05,646
And so of men.

485
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:15,448
Now, if you have a station
in the file...

486
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:21,183
...not in the worst rank
of manhood, say it.

487
01:06:21,392 --> 01:06:24,833
And I will put that business
in your bosoms...

488
01:06:25,563 --> 01:06:28,587
...whose execution takes
your enemy off...

489
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,132
...grapples you to the heart
and love of us...

490
01:06:32,132 --> 01:06:35,677
...who wear our health
but sickly in his life...

491
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:38,597
...which in his death were perfect.

492
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:43,811
I am one whom the vile blows and
buffets of the world have so incensed...

493
01:06:44,124 --> 01:06:47,877
...that I am reckless what I do
to spite the world.

494
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:50,067
And I another.

495
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,778
Both of you know
Banquo was your enemy.

496
01:06:53,091 --> 01:06:56,532
- Ay, my lord.
- So is he mine!

497
01:06:57,783 --> 01:07:02,163
Though I could with barefaced power
sweep him from my sight...

498
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:05,604
...and bid my will avouch it.

499
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,045
Yet I must not, for certain friends...

500
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:15,093
...that are both his and mine,
whose loves I may not drop.

501
01:07:15,301 --> 01:07:19,994
And thence it is, that I to
your assistance do make love...

502
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:25,520
...masking the business from the
common eye for sundry weighty reasons.

503
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:31,985
- We shall perform what you command.
- Your spirits shine through you.

504
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:38,450
It must be done tonight,
and some way from the palace.

505
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:42,830
And with him, to leave no rubs
nor botches in the work...

506
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:47,314
...Fleance, his son
that keeps him company...

507
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:52,423
...whose absence is no less material
to me than is his father's...

508
01:07:52,632 --> 01:07:56,490
...must embrace the fate
of that dark hour.

509
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:08,690
- Resolve yourselves apart.
- We are resolved, my lord.

510
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:16,406
Advise them where
to plant themselves.

511
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:52,964
How now, my lord?

512
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:59,220
Why do you keep alone...

513
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:04,225
...of sorriest fancies
your companions making?

514
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:09,960
Things without all remedy should be
without regard. What's done is done.

515
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:16,530
We have scorched the snake,
not killed it.

516
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:23,620
But let the frame of things disjoint.
Ere we'll eat our meal in fear...

517
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:29,877
...and sleep in the affliction of the
terrible dreams that shake us nightly.

518
01:10:31,128 --> 01:10:33,318
Better be with the dead...

519
01:10:33,526 --> 01:10:38,636
...than on the torture of the mind
to lie in restless ecstasy.

520
01:10:40,721 --> 01:10:43,015
Duncan is in his grave.

521
01:10:43,224 --> 01:10:48,333
After life's fitful fever,
he sleeps well.

522
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:51,566
Treason has done his worst.

523
01:10:51,774 --> 01:10:55,111
Not steel, nor poison...

524
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:00,012
...malice domestic, foreign levy,
nothing can touch him further.

525
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:03,766
Come on. Gentle, my lord.

526
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:07,415
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.

527
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:12,421
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

528
01:11:13,985 --> 01:11:16,592
So shall I, love.

529
01:11:17,426 --> 01:11:20,137
And so, I pray, be you.

530
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:42,347
Full of scorpions is my mind,
dear wife.

531
01:11:47,561 --> 01:11:51,628
Thou knowst that Banquo
and his Fleance live.

532
01:11:54,234 --> 01:11:57,884
But in them nature's copy
is not eterne.

533
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:04,558
There's comfort yet.
They are assailable.

534
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:09,771
Then be thou jocund.

535
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:14,881
Ere the bat hath flown
his cloistered flight...

536
01:12:15,089 --> 01:12:17,696
...ere to black Hecate's summons...

537
01:12:17,696 --> 01:12:23,640
...the shard-borne beetle
with his drowsy hums...
...hath rung night's yawning peal...

538
01:12:23,848 --> 01:12:28,749
...there shall be done a deed
of dreadful note.

539
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:31,669
What's to be done?

540
01:12:36,257 --> 01:12:41,888
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest
chuck, till thou applaud the deed.

541
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:50,959
Come, seeling night...

542
01:12:51,168 --> 01:12:55,443
...scarf up the tender eye
of pitiful day.

543
01:12:55,652 --> 01:13:00,761
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
cancel and tear to pieces...

544
01:13:01,074 --> 01:13:04,932
...that great bond
which keeps me pale.

545
01:13:07,226 --> 01:13:12,648
Light thickens, and the crow
makes wing to the rooky wood.

546
01:13:13,274 --> 01:13:18,071
Good things of day begin
to droop and drowse...

547
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:22,554
...while night's black agents
to their prey do rouse.

548
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:42,054
- Who did bid thee join with us?
- Macbeth.

549
01:13:43,305 --> 01:13:47,372
He needs not our mistrust
since he delivers our offices...

550
01:13:47,685 --> 01:13:51,543
...and what we have to do
to the direction just.

551
01:13:51,855 --> 01:13:57,278
Well, stand with us. The west yet
glimmers with some streaks of day.

552
01:13:57,486 --> 01:14:00,615
And near approaches
the subject of our watch.

553
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:11,042
By the clock 'tis day...

554
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:15,317
...and yet dark night strangles
the travelling lamp.

555
01:14:15,526 --> 01:14:19,697
Is it night's predominance
or the day's shame...

556
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:25,745
...that darkness does
the face of earth entomb...
...when living light should kiss it?

557
01:14:25,953 --> 01:14:28,560
It will be rain tonight.

558
01:14:30,124 --> 01:14:32,939
Let it come down!

559
01:14:35,546 --> 01:14:37,215
Treachery!

560
01:15:13,815 --> 01:15:17,047
Fly, good Fleance, fly!

561
01:15:19,341 --> 01:15:21,218
Fly!

562
01:15:28,205 --> 01:15:29,977
Fly!

563
01:16:22,531 --> 01:16:25,451
There's blood upon thy face.

564
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:30,978
- 'Tis Banquo's then.
- Is he despatched?

565
01:16:30,978 --> 01:16:34,210
His throat is cut.
That I did for him.

566
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:39,737
Thou art the best of the cutthroats.
Yet he's good that did
the like for Fleance.

567
01:16:39,945 --> 01:16:42,969
If thou didst that,
thou art the nonpareil.

568
01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:46,723
Most royal sir, Fleance is escaped.

569
01:16:47,974 --> 01:16:51,207
Then comes my fit again.

570
01:16:51,415 --> 01:16:56,108
I had else been perfect, whole as
the marble, founded as the rock.

571
01:16:56,316 --> 01:17:01,738
But now I am cabined, confined,
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.

572
01:17:01,947 --> 01:17:04,137
- But Banquo's safe?
- Ay, my good lord.

573
01:17:04,345 --> 01:17:09,350
Safe in a ditch he bides,
with 20 trenched gashes on his head.

574
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:13,521
There the grown serpent lies.

575
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:18,527
The worm that's fled hath nature
that in time will venom breed.

576
01:17:18,735 --> 01:17:21,133
No teeth for the present.

577
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:25,930
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again.

578
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:40,590
You know your own degrees. Sit down.
At first and last, a hearty welcome.

579
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,884
Thanks to Your Majesty.

580
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:45,387
Our hostess keeps her state.

581
01:18:45,491 --> 01:18:50,600
Ourself will mingle with society
and play the humble host.

582
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:56,336
- My lord, you do not give the cheer.
- Sweet remembrancer.

583
01:19:02,383 --> 01:19:06,659
I drink to the general joy
of the whole table...

584
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:13,228
...and to our dear friend Banquo,
whom we miss. Would he were here.

585
01:19:13,437 --> 01:19:15,731
Banquo!

586
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:21,257
Now good digestion wait on
appetite, and health on both!

587
01:19:21,466 --> 01:19:24,385
May it please Your Highness, sit.

588
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:33,353
Please it Your Highness to grace us
with your royal company?

589
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:39,088
- The table's full.
- Here is a place reserved, sir.

590
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:41,799
- Where?
- Here, my good lord.

591
01:20:12,038 --> 01:20:17,774
- Which of you have done this?
- What, my lord?
Thou canst not say I did it.

592
01:20:18,503 --> 01:20:23,926
- Never shake thy gory locks at me.
- His Highness is not well.

593
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:28,514
Sit, friends. My lord is often thus
and hath been from his youth.

594
01:20:28,722 --> 01:20:34,562
Keep seat. The fit is momentary.
Upon a thought he will again be well.

595
01:20:35,813 --> 01:20:37,377
Are you a man?

596
01:20:37,481 --> 01:20:41,965
Ay, a bold one that dare look
on that which might appal the devil.

597
01:20:42,174 --> 01:20:43,842
O, proper stuff!

598
01:20:44,051 --> 01:20:46,553
This is the very painting
of your fear.

599
01:20:46,762 --> 01:20:51,871
This is the air-drawn dagger you said
led you to Duncan. Shame itself!

600
01:20:53,331 --> 01:20:58,023
Why do you make such faces? When
all's done, you look but on a stool.

601
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:01,673
Prithee, see there!
Behold! Look! How say you?

602
01:21:01,881 --> 01:21:07,199
Avaunt, and quit my sight! Thy bones
are marrowless, thy blood is cold.

603
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:12,309
Thou hast no speculation in those
eyes which thou dost glare with.

604
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:14,499
What man dare, I dare.

605
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:19,295
Take any shape but that,
and my nerves shall never tremble.

606
01:21:19,504 --> 01:21:23,362
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!

607
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,993
What?

608
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:32,747
Quite unmanned in folly.

609
01:21:46,094 --> 01:21:50,786
- Lf I stand here, I saw him.
- Fie, for shame!

610
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:55,895
Blood hath been shed ere now,
in the olden time.

611
01:21:56,104 --> 01:22:00,692
And since too, murders have been
performed too terrible for the ear.

612
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:04,967
Time has been that when the brains
were out, a man would die...

613
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:06,844
...and there an end.

614
01:22:06,948 --> 01:22:12,475
But now they rise again, with
20 mortal gashes on their crowns.

615
01:22:12,684 --> 01:22:18,523
You've displaced the mirth, broke the
meeting with most admired disorder.

616
01:22:22,798 --> 01:22:26,969
Can such things be and overwhelm us
like a summer's cloud...

617
01:22:27,178 --> 01:22:29,680
...without our special wonder?

618
01:22:29,993 --> 01:22:35,311
You make me strange, even
to the disposition that I owe.

619
01:22:35,624 --> 01:22:39,273
When now I think
you can behold such sights...

620
01:22:39,482 --> 01:22:43,757
...and keep the natural ruby
of your cheeks...

621
01:22:44,591 --> 01:22:47,615
...when mine is blanched with fear.

622
01:22:47,824 --> 01:22:51,161
What sights, my lord?

623
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:57,104
I pray you, speak not,
he grows worse and worse.

624
01:22:57,104 --> 01:23:00,545
Question enrages him.
At once, good night.

625
01:23:02,318 --> 01:23:06,385
Stand not upon the order of
your going, but go at once.

626
01:23:08,157 --> 01:23:12,537
Good night. And better health
attend His Majesty.

627
01:23:12,745 --> 01:23:15,665
Kind good night to all.

628
01:23:16,082 --> 01:23:20,566
It will have blood.
They say blood will have blood.

629
01:23:20,774 --> 01:23:25,154
Stones have been known to move
and trees to speak.

630
01:24:04,674 --> 01:24:06,864
What is the night?

631
01:24:08,532 --> 01:24:13,641
Almost at odds with morning,
which is which.

632
01:24:30,534 --> 01:24:35,747
How sayst thou, that Macduff denies
his person at our great bidding?

633
01:24:35,956 --> 01:24:38,771
How know you this, my lord?

634
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,004
I hear it by the way.

635
01:24:42,212 --> 01:24:47,322
There's not a one of them, but
in his house I keep a servant paid.

636
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:56,498
You lack the season
of all natures, sleep.

637
01:24:57,541 --> 01:25:00,877
Come, we'll to sleep.

638
01:25:20,585 --> 01:25:26,007
I must again to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak.

639
01:25:26,216 --> 01:25:31,325
For now I am bent to know,
by the worst means, the worst.

640
01:25:31,847 --> 01:25:36,018
For mine own good,
all causes shall give way.

641
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:43,108
I'm in blood, stepped in so far
that should I wade no more...

642
01:25:43,317 --> 01:25:47,279
...returning were
as tedious as go o'er.

643
01:25:49,886 --> 01:25:54,996
Strange things I have in head
that will to hand...

644
01:25:55,204 --> 01:25:59,792
...which must be acted,
ere they may be scanned.

645
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:05,527
We are yet but young in deed.

646
01:27:40,312 --> 01:27:46,777
By the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes.

647
01:27:48,967 --> 01:27:53,242
How now, you secret, black and
midnight hags? What is it you do?

648
01:27:53,451 --> 01:27:55,432
A deed without a name.

649
01:27:55,536 --> 01:28:00,437
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn, cauldron bubble.

650
01:28:00,646 --> 01:28:04,817
Toad that under cold stone,
days and nights has 31.

651
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:10,552
Sweltered venom sleeping got,
boil thou first in the charmed pot.

652
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:16,287
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
wool of bat and tongue of dog.

653
01:28:16,495 --> 01:28:22,126
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
lizard's leg and howlet's wing.

654
01:28:22,335 --> 01:28:27,549
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
slivered in the moon's eclipse.

655
01:28:27,757 --> 01:28:32,658
Fillet of a fenny snake,
in the cauldron boil and bake.

656
01:28:32,867 --> 01:28:38,289
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
gall of goat and slips of yew.

657
01:28:38,497 --> 01:28:42,564
I conjure you, by that which you
profess, howe'er you know it.

658
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:45,588
- Answer me to what I ask you.
- Speak!

659
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:47,882
- Demand.
- We'll answer.

660
01:28:47,986 --> 01:28:53,617
Say if thou'dst hear it from
our mouths, or from our masters.

661
01:28:53,826 --> 01:28:56,641
Call them, let me see them.

662
01:29:05,713 --> 01:29:12,386
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
then the charm is firm and good.

663
01:29:52,740 --> 01:30:00,144
- Tell me, unknown power...
- He knows thy thought.
Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth.

664
01:30:00,352 --> 01:30:04,211
Beware Macduff.
Beware the Thane of Fife.

665
01:30:04,419 --> 01:30:07,234
Thou hast harped my fear aright.

666
01:30:07,547 --> 01:30:11,405
- But one word more...
- He will not be commanded.

667
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:30,383
Be bloody, bold and resolute.
Laugh to scorn the power of man.

668
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:33,616
For none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

669
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:37,891
None of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

670
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:42,583
Then live Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

671
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:48,110
But I'll make assurance double sure
and take a bond of fate.

672
01:30:48,423 --> 01:30:51,238
Thou shalt not live!

673
01:31:04,481 --> 01:31:08,965
- Macbeth shall never vanquished be.
- Never, never.

674
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:11,467
Until Great Birnam Wood...

675
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:16,681
...to high Dunsinane Hill
shall come against him.

676
01:31:22,729 --> 01:31:27,734
That will never be!
Who can recruit the forest?

677
01:31:27,943 --> 01:31:31,488
Bid the tree unfix
his earth-bound root?

678
01:31:31,696 --> 01:31:34,825
Sweet bodements, good!

679
01:31:36,597 --> 01:31:39,830
Yet my heart throbs
to know one thing:

680
01:31:40,038 --> 01:31:44,626
- Shall Banquo's issue ever reign?
- Seek to know no more.

681
01:31:44,835 --> 01:31:50,361
I will be satisfied! Deny me this
and an eternal curse fall on you!

682
01:31:52,343 --> 01:31:58,182
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.

683
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:23,521
What, will the line stretch out
to the crack of doom?

684
01:32:23,729 --> 01:32:25,919
Now I see 'tis true.

685
01:32:27,587 --> 01:32:31,445
For the blood-boltered Banquo
smiles upon me...

686
01:32:31,654 --> 01:32:34,886
...and points at them for his!

687
01:32:58,974 --> 01:33:01,059
Where are they?

688
01:33:05,647 --> 01:33:07,733
Gone!

689
01:33:26,711 --> 01:33:29,526
Infected be the air whereon they ride!

690
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:32,759
And damned all those that trust them!

691
01:33:56,846 --> 01:33:59,140
Macduff is fled.

692
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:05,083
- Where does he bestow himself?
- In the English court.

693
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:07,482
Where lives the son of Duncan.

694
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:11,966
Thither Macduff is gone to pray
the holy king upon his aid...

695
01:34:12,174 --> 01:34:16,345
...to wake Northumberland
and warlike Seyward.

696
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:21,976
By the help of these, we may again
give to our tables meat...

697
01:34:22,184 --> 01:34:27,398
...sleep to our nights,
our feasts free from bloody knives.

698
01:34:27,607 --> 01:34:30,318
Some holy angel fly to England...

699
01:34:30,526 --> 01:34:35,636
...that a swift blessing may soon
return to this, our suffering country.

700
01:34:38,347 --> 01:34:40,432
Gentle lady.

701
01:34:42,518 --> 01:34:45,438
Gracious Duncan's dead.

702
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:56,178
Gracious Duncan was pitied
of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead.

703
01:34:56,386 --> 01:34:59,097
The valiant Banquo walked too late.

704
01:34:59,306 --> 01:35:02,851
Whom, you may say, Fleance killed,
for Fleance fled.

705
01:35:02,956 --> 01:35:05,771
Man must not walk too late.

706
01:35:05,979 --> 01:35:10,359
How monstrous it was for Malcolm
and Donalbain to kill their father.

707
01:35:10,463 --> 01:35:13,487
Damned, indeed.
How it did grieve Macbeth.

708
01:35:13,696 --> 01:35:19,222
- Had he Duncan's sons under his key...
- As, an't please heaven, he shall not.

709
01:35:19,431 --> 01:35:22,663
They should find what
it were to kill a father.

710
01:35:22,663 --> 01:35:24,853
So should Fleance.

711
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:26,730
Peace.

712
01:35:34,029 --> 01:35:35,489
What news?

713
01:35:41,224 --> 01:35:44,769
Macduff is fled to England.

714
01:35:44,978 --> 01:35:48,419
- Fled to England?
- Ay, my good lord.

715
01:35:49,149 --> 01:35:53,424
Time, thou anticipat'st
my dread exploits.

716
01:36:18,867 --> 01:36:23,664
The castle of Macduff
I will surprise. Seize upon Fife.

717
01:36:23,872 --> 01:36:27,835
Give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes...

718
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:33,048
... and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.

719
01:36:33,257 --> 01:36:35,447
No boasting like a fool.

720
01:36:35,655 --> 01:36:39,513
This deed I'll do
before the purpose cool.

721
01:36:52,026 --> 01:36:54,007
You must have patience.

722
01:36:54,007 --> 01:36:58,387
He had none. His flight was madness.
Our fears do make us traitors.

723
01:36:58,595 --> 01:37:01,411
You know not if it was wisdom or fear.

724
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:07,354
To leave his wife and his babes in
a place from whence himself does fly?

725
01:37:07,667 --> 01:37:11,525
He loves us not.
He wants a natural touch.

726
01:37:11,734 --> 01:37:15,071
The wren, the most diminutive bird,
will fight...

727
01:37:15,071 --> 01:37:17,469
...her young in the nest,
against the owl.

728
01:37:17,678 --> 01:37:23,308
- All is the fear, nothing is the love.
- Dear coz, pray, school yourself.

729
01:37:24,143 --> 01:37:27,792
But for your husband,
he is noble, wise, judicious...

730
01:37:28,001 --> 01:37:31,025
...and best knows the fits
of the season.

731
01:37:31,963 --> 01:37:36,655
I take my leave of you. Shall not
be long but I'll be here again.

732
01:37:36,864 --> 01:37:39,575
Things at their worst will cease...

733
01:37:39,784 --> 01:37:43,329
...or else climb upward
to what they were before.

734
01:37:45,623 --> 01:37:49,794
My pretty cousin,
blessing upon you.

735
01:37:50,002 --> 01:37:53,131
Fathered he is,
and yet he's fatherless.

736
01:37:53,339 --> 01:37:56,155
I take my leave at once.

737
01:38:44,955 --> 01:38:48,709
- How wilt thou do for a father?
- How will you do for a husband?

738
01:38:48,917 --> 01:38:52,984
Why, I can buy me 20 at any market.

739
01:38:56,738 --> 01:39:00,909
- Was my father a traitor?
- Ay, that he was.

740
01:39:02,264 --> 01:39:06,435
- What is a traitor?
- Why, one that swears and lies.

741
01:39:06,644 --> 01:39:08,834
Be all traitors that do so?

742
01:39:08,938 --> 01:39:12,900
Everyone that does so is a traitor
and must be hanged.

743
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:15,611
- Who must hang them?
- The honest men.

744
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:21,764
The liars are fools, for there are
enough of them to hang the honest men.

745
01:39:21,972 --> 01:39:27,394
- God help thee, poor monkey.
- Lf he were dead, you'd weep for him.

746
01:40:17,446 --> 01:40:19,427
Where's your husband?

747
01:40:19,636 --> 01:40:25,266
I hope in no place so unsanctified,
where such as thou mayst find him.

748
01:40:26,413 --> 01:40:29,020
He's a traitor.

749
01:40:30,897 --> 01:40:36,007
- Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!
- What, you egg?

750
01:40:37,988 --> 01:40:41,220
Young fry of treachery!

751
01:40:47,581 --> 01:40:50,501
He has killed me, Mother.

752
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:46,183
Besides her walking and other actual
performances, what has she said?

753
01:41:46,392 --> 01:41:52,961
That which I will not report after her.
You may to a doctor.
'Tis most meet you should.

754
01:41:53,169 --> 01:41:59,634
Neither to you, nor anyone, having
no witness to confirm my speech.

755
01:42:10,062 --> 01:42:14,754
- Her eyes are open.
- Ay, but their sense is shut.

756
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:23,617
- What is it she does now?
- An accustomed action.

757
01:42:23,617 --> 01:42:26,850
To seem thus washing her hands.

758
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:45,411
Yet here's a spot.

759
01:42:48,018 --> 01:42:50,937
Out, damned spot.

760
01:42:51,146 --> 01:42:53,753
Out, I say!

761
01:42:56,985 --> 01:42:58,549
One.

762
01:43:00,218 --> 01:43:01,886
Two.

763
01:43:03,659 --> 01:43:06,683
Why then 'tis time to do it.

764
01:43:09,811 --> 01:43:12,418
Hell is murky.

765
01:43:12,835 --> 01:43:17,423
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier and afeard?

766
01:43:17,631 --> 01:43:22,219
What need we fear who knows it, when
none can call our power to account?

767
01:43:24,722 --> 01:43:29,310
Yet who'd have thought the old man
to have so much blood in him?

768
01:43:29,519 --> 01:43:31,500
Well, well!

769
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:34,941
The Thane of Fife had a wife.

770
01:43:35,879 --> 01:43:38,486
Where is she now?

771
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:44,430
What, will these hands
ne'er be clean?

772
01:43:45,264 --> 01:43:49,539
No more of that, my lord.
You mar all with this starting.

773
01:43:49,852 --> 01:43:52,355
Go to. You have known
what you should not.

774
01:43:52,563 --> 01:43:56,943
She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that.

775
01:43:57,568 --> 01:44:01,218
Here's the smell of blood still.

776
01:44:04,346 --> 01:44:10,081
All the perfumes of Arabia will not
sweeten this little hand.

777
01:44:16,338 --> 01:44:21,447
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.

778
01:44:21,864 --> 01:44:26,139
Wash your hands,
put on your nightgown.

779
01:44:26,348 --> 01:44:28,746
Look not so pale.

780
01:44:28,955 --> 01:44:32,917
I tell you, Banquo's buried.
He cannot come out of his grave.

781
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:35,003
Even so?

782
01:44:36,671 --> 01:44:40,112
To bed, to bed.

783
01:44:40,321 --> 01:44:43,240
Come. Come.

784
01:44:43,449 --> 01:44:46,473
Come, give me your hand.

785
01:44:46,681 --> 01:44:50,122
What's done cannot be undone.

786
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:54,085
To bed, to bed.

787
01:44:56,483 --> 01:45:00,028
More needs she the divine
than the physician.

788
01:45:00,237 --> 01:45:04,408
God! God forgive us all.

789
01:45:05,138 --> 01:45:11,186
Look after her. Remove from her means
of annoyance and keep eyes upon her.

790
01:45:11,603 --> 01:45:15,148
- Good night.
- Good night, good doctor.

791
01:45:31,728 --> 01:45:34,126
How does your patient, doctor?

792
01:45:34,335 --> 01:45:40,278
Not so sick, as she's troubled with
fancies that keep her from her sleep.

793
01:45:40,487 --> 01:45:42,364
Cure her of that.

794
01:45:47,682 --> 01:45:51,331
Canst thou not minister
to a mind diseased?

795
01:45:51,644 --> 01:45:54,772
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow?

796
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:59,152
Raze out the written troubles
of the brain?

797
01:45:59,777 --> 01:46:04,783
And with some sweet,
oblivious antidote...

798
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:10,830
...cleanse the bosom of that perilous
stuff which weighs upon the heart?

799
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:15,731
Therein the patient
must minister to himself.

800
01:46:17,504 --> 01:46:20,424
Throw physic to the dogs.

801
01:47:32,268 --> 01:47:36,961
Bring me no more reports.
Let them fly. All!

802
01:47:37,169 --> 01:47:42,800
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear.

803
01:47:43,009 --> 01:47:48,327
What's the boy, Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?

804
01:48:05,845 --> 01:48:10,224
The spirits that know all mortal
consequences pronounced me thus:

805
01:48:10,433 --> 01:48:16,481
"Fear not. No man that's born of woman
shall e'er have power upon thee."

806
01:48:17,315 --> 01:48:19,713
Then fly, false thanes...

807
01:48:19,922 --> 01:48:23,988
...and mingle
with the English epicures!

808
01:48:55,896 --> 01:49:02,048
Our country sinks beneath the yoke.
It weeps, it bleeds.

809
01:49:02,257 --> 01:49:06,949
And each new day
a gash is added to her wounds.

810
01:49:07,262 --> 01:49:11,642
Each new morn new widows howl,
new orphans cry.

811
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:14,770
New sorrows strike heaven
on the face...

812
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:18,107
...that it resounds as if
it felt with Scotland.

813
01:49:24,989 --> 01:49:26,657
Who comes here?

814
01:49:31,037 --> 01:49:34,895
A countryman
who seems a stranger to us.

815
01:49:40,421 --> 01:49:42,924
My ever gentle cousin.

816
01:49:45,843 --> 01:49:47,929
Welcome hither.

817
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:59,086
- Stands Scotland where it did?
- Alas, poor country.

818
01:49:59,191 --> 01:50:04,717
Afraid to know itself. It cannot
be called our mother, but our grave.

819
01:50:05,447 --> 01:50:09,826
- What's the newest grief?
- Each minute teems a new one.

820
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:13,059
- How does my wife?
- Well.

821
01:50:13,372 --> 01:50:15,040
- And my children?
- Well too.

822
01:50:15,249 --> 01:50:20,775
- The tyrant has not battered at them?
- No. They were well at peace.

823
01:50:21,714 --> 01:50:24,633
Be not a niggard of speech.
How goes it?

824
01:50:24,842 --> 01:50:29,013
Your eye in Scotland will create
soldiers, make our women fight.

825
01:50:29,013 --> 01:50:31,515
We are coming thither.

826
01:50:35,582 --> 01:50:41,630
Gracious England hath lent us
good Seyward and 10,000 men.

827
01:50:52,266 --> 01:50:56,854
An older and a better soldier none
that Christendom gives out.

828
01:51:06,343 --> 01:51:09,680
Would I could answer
this comfort with the like.

829
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:14,789
But I have words that
will be howled out...
...where hearing should not catch them.

830
01:51:14,998 --> 01:51:19,690
- What concern they?
- The main part pertains to you.

831
01:51:20,524 --> 01:51:25,321
If it be mine, keep it not from me.
Quickly, let me have it.

832
01:51:25,529 --> 01:51:29,492
Your castle is surprised,
your wife and babes slaughtered.

833
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:32,099
Merciful heaven.

834
01:51:40,649 --> 01:51:43,047
What, man!

835
01:51:44,194 --> 01:51:47,740
Ne'er put your hat upon your brows.

836
01:51:51,494 --> 01:51:54,100
Give sorrow words.

837
01:51:57,646 --> 01:51:59,314
My children too?

838
01:51:59,523 --> 01:52:04,632
Wife, children, servants.
All that could be found.

839
01:52:06,613 --> 01:52:10,472
- And I must be from thence. My wife?
- I have said.

840
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:14,642
Be comforted. Let's make us
medicines of our great revenge...

841
01:52:14,747 --> 01:52:17,562
...to cure this deadly grief.

842
01:52:17,771 --> 01:52:20,690
He has no children.

843
01:52:22,567 --> 01:52:26,113
All my pretty ones!

844
01:52:26,321 --> 01:52:28,511
Did you say all?

845
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:34,350
Hell-kite! What, all my chickens
and their dam at one fell swoop?

846
01:52:34,559 --> 01:52:37,061
Dispute it like a man.

847
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:41,754
I shall do so, but I must
also feel it as a man.

848
01:52:42,588 --> 01:52:47,176
I cannot but remember
such things were...

849
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:50,930
...that were most precious to me.

850
01:52:51,138 --> 01:52:55,414
Did the heaven look on
and would not take their part?

851
01:52:55,622 --> 01:52:58,333
Sinful Macduff,
they were struck for thee.

852
01:52:58,542 --> 01:53:03,964
Not for their own demerits, but for
mine, fell slaughter on their souls.

853
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:07,092
Heaven rest them now.

854
01:53:07,301 --> 01:53:13,453
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief convert to anger.

855
01:53:13,662 --> 01:53:17,937
Blunt not the heart, enrage it!

856
01:53:33,265 --> 01:53:38,687
Gentle heavens,
cut short all intermission.

857
01:53:38,896 --> 01:53:42,858
Front to front bring thou
this fiend of Scotland and myself.

858
01:53:43,171 --> 01:53:46,508
Our power is ready.
Macbeth is ripe for shaking.

859
01:53:46,612 --> 01:53:49,532
Within my sword's length set him.

860
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:53,494
If he escape, heaven forgive him too.

861
01:54:06,946 --> 01:54:11,429
- What does the tyrant?
- Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

862
01:54:11,638 --> 01:54:16,956
Some say he's mad. Others, that
lesser hate him, call it valiant fury.

863
01:54:17,269 --> 01:54:20,814
Those he commands move in command.
Nothing in love.

864
01:54:21,023 --> 01:54:23,525
He feels his title
hang loose about him...

865
01:54:23,734 --> 01:54:26,132
...like a giant's robe
upon a dwarfish thief.

866
01:54:26,341 --> 01:54:29,364
All that is within him
does condemn itself.

867
01:54:29,364 --> 01:54:33,431
The English power is near,
led by Malcolm, Seyward and Macduff.

868
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:39,583
Near Birnam Wood shall we meet them.
That way are they coming.

869
01:54:40,730 --> 01:54:45,318
The devil damn thee black, thou loon!
Where gotst thou that goose look?

870
01:54:45,527 --> 01:54:47,925
There is 10,000...

871
01:54:48,134 --> 01:54:51,366
- Geese? Villain?
- Soldiers, sir.

872
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:56,997
Thou lily-livered boy.
What soldiers, patch?

873
01:54:57,206 --> 01:55:00,855
Those linen cheeks of thine
are counsellors to fear.

874
01:55:01,064 --> 01:55:04,192
What soldiers, whey-face?

875
01:55:04,401 --> 01:55:08,676
The English force, so please you.

876
01:55:14,202 --> 01:55:18,790
Seyton! Take thy face hence.

877
01:55:21,189 --> 01:55:26,298
I am sick at heart, when I behold...
Seyton, I say!

878
01:55:34,431 --> 01:55:37,455
I have lived long enough.

879
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:41,731
My way of life is fallen
into the sear, the yellow leaf.

880
01:55:41,939 --> 01:55:47,779
And that which should accompany
old age, as honour, love...

881
01:55:47,987 --> 01:55:52,679
... obedience, troops of friends...

882
01:55:53,722 --> 01:55:56,642
... I must not look to have.

883
01:55:57,789 --> 01:56:01,856
But in their stead, curses...

884
01:56:02,377 --> 01:56:06,861
... not loud, but deep.

885
01:56:07,069 --> 01:56:09,780
Mouth-honour...

886
01:56:09,989 --> 01:56:15,098
... breath which the poor heart
would fain deny and dare not.

887
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:20,208
- Seyton!
- What's your gracious pleasure?

888
01:56:20,312 --> 01:56:25,004
- What news more?
- All is confirmed which was reported.

889
01:56:25,213 --> 01:56:29,697
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh
be hacked! Give me my armour!

890
01:56:29,905 --> 01:56:34,180
- 'Tis not needed yet.
- I'll put it on.

891
01:56:37,726 --> 01:56:40,645
Send out more horses,
scour the country.

892
01:56:40,854 --> 01:56:43,669
Hang those that talk of fear.

893
01:56:43,878 --> 01:56:47,528
Come, put mine armour on,
give me my sword.

894
01:56:47,736 --> 01:56:53,680
Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, despatch.

895
01:56:54,827 --> 01:56:59,415
If thou couldst, doctor,
cast the water of my land...

896
01:56:59,623 --> 01:57:04,316
...find her disease and purge it
to a sound and pristine health.

897
01:57:05,046 --> 01:57:09,217
I would applaud thee to the very echo
that should applaud again.

898
01:57:09,425 --> 01:57:11,406
Pull it off, I say.

899
01:57:12,449 --> 01:57:16,724
What rhubarb, senna
or what purgative drug...

900
01:57:16,933 --> 01:57:20,895
...would scour these English hence?
Hearst thou of them?

901
01:57:21,104 --> 01:57:27,882
Ay, my good lord. Your royal
preparation makes us hear something.

902
01:57:30,697 --> 01:57:33,617
I will not be afraid
of death or bane...

903
01:57:33,617 --> 01:57:37,579
...till Birnam Forest come
to Dunsinane.

904
01:57:44,148 --> 01:57:46,964
Were I from Dunsinane
away and clear...

905
01:57:47,068 --> 01:57:50,822
...profit again should
hardly draw me here.

906
01:58:31,697 --> 01:58:36,181
- What wood is this before us?
- The wood of Birnam.

907
01:59:09,444 --> 01:59:14,137
"They met me in the day of success.

908
01:59:15,075 --> 01:59:18,516
And I have learned by
the perfect'st report...

909
01:59:18,725 --> 01:59:22,062
...they have more in them
than mortal knowledge.

910
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:27,275
While I stood rapt
in the wonder of it, came...

911
01:59:27,484 --> 01:59:33,845
...missives from the king,
who all-hailed me, Thane of Cawdor...

912
01:59:34,053 --> 01:59:39,580
...by which title, before,
these weird sisters saluted me...

913
01:59:39,788 --> 01:59:44,585
...and referred me to
the coming on of time with:

914
01:59:45,836 --> 01:59:49,486
'Hail, king that shall be! '

915
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:55,325
This have I thought good to
deliver thee, my dearest partner...

916
01:59:55,534 --> 01:59:59,392
...that thou mightst not be...

917
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:06,065
...ignorant of what greatness
is promised thee.

918
02:00:07,525 --> 02:00:13,990
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."

919
02:00:18,891 --> 02:00:21,915
Hang out our banners
on the outward walls.

920
02:00:22,123 --> 02:00:25,460
The cry is still, "They come!"

921
02:00:28,067 --> 02:00:32,029
Our castle's strength
will laugh a siege to scorn.

922
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:36,930
Here let them lie till famine
and the ague eat them up.

923
02:00:41,935 --> 02:00:45,585
Were they not stuffed with
those that should be ours...

924
02:00:45,689 --> 02:00:49,860
...we might have met them dareful,
and beat them backward.

925
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:54,031
What is that noise?

926
02:01:01,748 --> 02:01:05,606
I've almost forgot the taste of fear.

927
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:19,683
The time has been, my senses would
have cooled to hear a night-shriek.

928
02:01:22,498 --> 02:01:24,688
My fell of hair...

929
02:01:24,896 --> 02:01:30,736
...would at a dismal treatise
rouse and stir as life were in it.

930
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:36,471
I have supped full with horrors.

931
02:01:41,059 --> 02:01:44,083
Wherefore was that cry?

932
02:01:44,604 --> 02:01:48,149
The queen, my lord, is dead.

933
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:57,221
She should have died hereafter.

934
02:01:57,534 --> 02:02:01,392
There would have been
a time for such a word.

935
02:02:04,312 --> 02:02:08,796
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...

936
02:02:09,004 --> 02:02:12,341
... creeps in this petty pace
from day to day...

937
02:02:12,445 --> 02:02:16,095
... to the last syllable
of recorded time.

938
02:02:16,408 --> 02:02:22,768
And all our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.

939
02:02:35,907 --> 02:02:39,035
Out, out, brief candle.

940
02:02:43,832 --> 02:02:47,273
Life's but a walking shadow.

941
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:51,757
A poor player struts and frets
his hour upon the stage...

942
02:02:51,965 --> 02:02:54,989
...and then is heard no more.

943
02:02:56,136 --> 02:03:00,516
It is a tale told by an idiot...

944
02:03:00,724 --> 02:03:06,146
...full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.

945
02:03:06,355 --> 02:03:08,128
Gracious, my lord!

946
02:03:08,128 --> 02:03:13,133
Thy story, quickly!
I should report that which I saw,
but know not how.

947
02:03:13,341 --> 02:03:15,323
Well? Say, sir.

948
02:03:15,531 --> 02:03:18,138
As I did stand my watch,
I looked toward Birnam.

949
02:03:18,346 --> 02:03:21,475
And anon, methought,
the wood began to move.

950
02:03:21,683 --> 02:03:24,082
Liar and slave!

951
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:28,461
Within a mile may you see it coming.
A moving grove.

952
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:53,695
If thou speakst false, upon the next
tree shalt thou hang alive...

953
02:03:53,904 --> 02:03:56,719
...till famine cling thee.

954
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:23,726
Fear not till Birnam Wood
do come to Dunsinane.

955
02:04:23,935 --> 02:04:29,044
And now a wood comes
towards Dunsinane.

956
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:36,552
Every soldier hath downed a bough
and bears it before him.

957
02:04:36,761 --> 02:04:39,576
Thereby they shadow the number
of their host...

958
02:04:39,784 --> 02:04:44,060
...and make discovery err
in report of them.

959
02:04:53,966 --> 02:04:57,928
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun.

960
02:04:58,658 --> 02:05:04,497
And wish the estate of the world
were now undone.

961
02:05:08,877 --> 02:05:11,692
Ring the alarum bell!

962
02:05:12,109 --> 02:05:17,323
Blow, wind! Come, wrack! At least
we'll die with harness on our back.

963
02:07:22,348 --> 02:07:25,372
Make all our trumpets speak.

964
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:07,811
Worthy Macduff, you, with young
Seyward, lead our first assault.

965
02:08:49,208 --> 02:08:53,170
Tyrant, show thy face!

966
02:09:01,304 --> 02:09:05,266
Let me find him, Fortune.
And more I beg not.

967
02:09:13,712 --> 02:09:16,840
If thou be slain and
with no sword of mine...

968
02:09:17,049 --> 02:09:21,116
...my wife and children's ghosts
will haunt me still.

969
02:09:28,415 --> 02:09:33,733
- What is thy name?
- Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

970
02:09:33,941 --> 02:09:40,615
No, though thou callst thyself
a hotter name than any in hell!
My name's Macbeth!

971
02:09:41,032 --> 02:09:44,473
The devil could not pronounce
a title more hateful.

972
02:09:44,577 --> 02:09:48,748
- No, nor more fearful.
- Thou liest, abhorred tyrant!

973
02:09:48,957 --> 02:09:52,502
With my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speakst.

974
02:10:37,757 --> 02:10:40,468
Thou werest born of woman.

975
02:11:25,932 --> 02:11:28,956
They have tied me to the stake.

976
02:11:29,686 --> 02:11:35,525
I cannot fly. But bearlike
I must fight the course!

977
02:11:36,568 --> 02:11:40,634
Why should I play the Roman fool
and die on mine own sword...

978
02:11:40,843 --> 02:11:45,744
...while I see lives
that gashes do better on them?

979
02:11:46,057 --> 02:11:48,872
What's he that was not born of woman?

980
02:11:49,393 --> 02:11:52,939
Such a one am I to fear, or none.

981
02:11:53,147 --> 02:11:57,527
Turn, hell-hound! Turn!

982
02:12:01,698 --> 02:12:05,139
Of all men else, I have avoided thee.

983
02:12:05,347 --> 02:12:08,058
I have no words.

984
02:12:10,457 --> 02:12:13,793
My voice is in my sword.

985
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:21,927
Thou bloodier villain
than terms can give thee out!

986
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:48,517
My soul...

987
02:12:48,725 --> 02:12:52,896
...is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

988
02:12:55,503 --> 02:12:59,987
Let fall thy blade
on vulnerable crests.

989
02:13:01,655 --> 02:13:04,158
I bear a charmed life...

990
02:13:04,471 --> 02:13:08,224
...which must not yield
to one of woman born!

991
02:13:09,893 --> 02:13:14,794
Despair thy charm and let the angel
whom thou hast served tell thee...

992
02:13:15,002 --> 02:13:19,695
...Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripped.

993
02:13:23,344 --> 02:13:26,368
Accursed be that tongue
that tells me so...

994
02:13:26,368 --> 02:13:29,809
... for it hath cowed
my better part of man.

995
02:13:30,018 --> 02:13:34,919
And be these juggling fiends no more
believed that palter with us.

996
02:13:35,127 --> 02:13:40,445
That keep the word of promise
to our ear and break it to our hope.

997
02:13:41,488 --> 02:13:43,782
I will not yield...

998
02:13:44,095 --> 02:13:47,744
...to kiss the ground
before young Malcolm's feet...

999
02:13:47,953 --> 02:13:51,602
...and to be baited
with the rabble's curse!

1000
02:13:54,731 --> 02:13:58,693
Though Birnam Wood be come
to Dunsinane...

1001
02:13:58,902 --> 02:14:03,281
...and thou opposed being
of no woman born...

1002
02:14:03,594 --> 02:14:06,618
...yet I will try the last.

1003
02:14:07,973 --> 02:14:10,685
Lay on, Macduff.

1004
02:14:10,893 --> 02:14:16,107
And damned be him that first cries,
"Hold, enough!"

1005
02:16:40,735 --> 02:16:44,384
So great a day as this
is cheaply bought.

1006
02:16:44,593 --> 02:16:48,243
Hail, king, for so thou art.

1007
02:16:48,555 --> 02:16:52,414
Behold where lies
the usurper's cursed head.

1008
02:16:53,978 --> 02:16:56,480
The time is free.

1009
02:17:08,576 --> 02:17:11,391
Hail, King of Scotland!

1010
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:15,354
Hail, King of Scotland!
