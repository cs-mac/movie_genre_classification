1
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,014
Hello, Michele.

2
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,777
Roberto.

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,751
- Come in.
- Give it to me please.

4
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,222
Some water please, Rita.

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,426
How's Elsa?

6
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,792
Fine. And Giovanna?

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,455
Fine.

8
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,601
Listen, Roberto.

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,176
I know your choices

10
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,906
were imposed by necessity

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,847
and maybe our tempers

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,213
got the better of us.

13
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,776
And so...

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,353
perhaps we should reconsider
our relationship.

15
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,119
- Here's the water.
- Thank you.

16
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,931
I certainly didn't expect
to hear this.

17
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,944
Life's full of surprises.

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,281
Of course,
now the situation's a bit different.

19
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,915
And the new organization...

20
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,925
you know that Morelli's

21
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:36,258
changing the structure completely.

22
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,025
We're aiming

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,363
for compactness

24
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,902
and we have to be united

25
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,530
and firm on everything.

26
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,234
You should see yourself.

27
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,510
You're terrified.

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,912
Don't hide behind Morelli.

29
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,643
It's you.

30
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,515
It's you who's acting
like a piece of shit and you know it.

31
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,418
I'm in deep shit,

32
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,787
but you really are
a piece of shit

33
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,348
and I don't even know
why the fuck I came!

34
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,327
Now I recognize it.
I recognize

35
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,193
the old dick-head.

36
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,290
- You had me fooled for a second.
- Now you've pissed me off!

37
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,010
Michele?

38
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,292
Michele.

39
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,383
Wait, Luciano.

40
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,296
Careful.

41
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,639
Watch out for the door.

42
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,407
Let's put this in the middle.
Then we'll see.

43
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,005
Excuse me, wait a second.
Can I go through?

44
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,244
Luciano, go back!

45
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,588
Let's find a place
for it right now.

46
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,124
Elsa, it'll never fit.
There's no room.

47
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,285
Should we sell this one too?

48
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,659
Will you please make
up your minds?

49
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,756
- Yes.
- Okay. Let me through.

50
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,358
Luciano, go back again.

51
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,846
Alice called earlier.
She told me to give you a kiss.

52
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,052
She doesn't call me, does she?

53
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,149
You could call her.

54
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,474
Maybe with earplugs we'd be able
to sleep. What do you think?

55
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,346
Remember that house
at Santarém?

56
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,788
We got there late at night,

57
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,587
then the next morning
we took a boat

58
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,491
and the boatman said,

59
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,962
"You're staying there.

60
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,762
This house will fall
apart soon." Remember?

61
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,635
I wonder if it's still standing
or if it's just rubble.

62
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,971
Brazil. What a wonderful trip.

63
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,504
Elsa...

64
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,143
we'll make this place nice,
you'll see.

65
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,067
Why is this taking
longer than yesterday?

66
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,503
This room's bigger.

67
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,440
Well, we don't have
anything else to do.

68
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,171
The longer it takes,
the better.

69
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,543
But the money's
the same, Luciano.

70
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:25,050
- Sorry, but l...
- He's not talking about that.

71
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,918
Luciano never talks about money,
don't worry. Seriously.

72
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,263
This kitchen's kind of small.
And dark, too.

73
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,031
Why the hell didn't they make
an opening in this wall?

74
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,096
We could put a table there.
It'd be nicer, wouldn't it?

75
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,507
You know, Mr. Oliveri,
that's a great idea.

76
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,670
Eh, Luciano?
What's to stop us?

77
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,478
- What do you want to do?
- We're deciding whether to make a hole.

78
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,746
It might be
a load-bearing wall.

79
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,085
- You think so?
- Load-bearing.

80
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,885
- It's about 10cm thick.
- No more than that.

81
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,828
- What if there are pipes?
- Going where, Luciano?

82
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,423
The bathroom's
on the other side.

83
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,469
Well, maybe we should
ask the owner.

84
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,767
For a permit?
Well, in that case...

85
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,103
Most of the time,
if they're improvements...

86
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,203
It isn't load-bearing.

87
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,751
This part's still
at an intermediate stage

88
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,788
and here there's just a sinopia.

89
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,222
Who knows if the central
part was finished?

90
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,487
I wonder what the face is like.

91
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,157
Girls, I'm too curious.

92
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,099
Don't know about you,
but I'm staying late.

93
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,467
Then I'll stay too.
I just have to make a phone call.

94
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,269
Lucky you.
I don't even have to bother.

95
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,469
Sandra, I can't stay
this evening.

96
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,570
Okay. Next time.

97
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,138
There'll soon
be another chance.

98
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,516
Actually, I think
I'll have to stop coming.

99
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,317
What are you
talking about, Elsa?

100
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,290
Are you kidding?

101
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,185
It's a difficult situation.
I'll explain some other time.

102
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,207
- Good evening.
- Good evening to you.

103
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,178
Almost finished?

104
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,805
We need another day.

105
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,612
- I know it's a nuisance.
- No, not at all.

106
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,618
What floor are you working on?

107
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,381
The third.
Will you excuse me?

108
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,618
- Oh, the third one.
- Goodbye.

109
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,421
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.

110
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,429
- Wait, let me help you.
- Thank you.

111
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,933
- Hi, how are you? Tired?
- So-so.

112
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,597
- What about you?
- Fine.

113
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,732
Vito and Luciano are
real professionals.

114
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,800
You're too nice!

115
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,705
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

116
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,912
Whose idea was it?

117
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,548
It won't stay like this,
it needs more work.

118
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,986
Well, we can put a shelf here.

119
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,690
There you go!
I knew the lady would like it!

120
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,427
Fortunately.

121
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,669
For example, I've never done

122
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,466
wallpapering or plastering.

123
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,004
Thanks.

124
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,169
Anyway... thank you...

125
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,679
this counts as skills

126
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,874
down at the job center.

127
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,781
What do you mean?

128
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,980
I'm registered
at the employment agency, right?

129
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,387
But while I'm waiting for work,

130
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,187
I do the job center courses.

131
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,252
They help us not to give up
or get depressed.

132
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,595
Every once in a while,
they even find you a job.

133
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,534
There are lots of us.
It's like going to school.

134
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,096
There are the troublemakers, the ones
who come once and never come back.

135
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,938
They lie to their wives
and go to the beach instead.

136
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,173
There are also managers,
but they do separate courses.

137
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,681
Everyone has their own skills.

138
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,216
How can you do anything else?

139
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,481
Well, we all have
other skills too.

140
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,079
Somehow you learn
what they are.

141
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,717
You could be a welder,
but you might be good at cooking too,

142
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,454
so you find work in a restaurant.

143
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,930
If I could cook like you, ma'am,
I'd have found a job ages ago.

144
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,728
This pasta is wonderful.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,894
My compliments. Very good.

146
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,838
- Don't overdo it. Is it really good?
- Yes. Delicious.

147
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,842
See you tomorrow then?

148
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,502
Okay, Mr. Oliveri. Thanks.

149
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,012
Sorry, sir.

150
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,071
This is a bit embarrassing.

151
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,243
Could you advance us 100 euros?

152
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,220
Of course, Vito.
I'll be right back.

153
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,052
Thank you.

154
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,988
Elsa,

155
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,726
do you have 100 euros for Vito?

156
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,563
He asked me for an advance.

157
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:13,196
Yes, sure, in my purse there.

158
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,810
- Here you go.
- Thanks, sir.

159
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,221
- Good night.
- Good night to both of you.

160
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,695
Let me do it.

161
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,494
Listen, Michele,
I was thinking.

162
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,268
Since you aren't getting
many interviews

163
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,606
and everything's
at a standstill...

164
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,544
We decided that
I'd take care of moving,

165
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,309
of the house,
doing work here.

166
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,407
- I know, that's what we said.
- So?

167
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,214
Maybe in the meantime,

168
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,721
these courses for managers
that Vito mentioned,

169
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,952
might be a good way for you
to meet other people,

170
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,722
- talk to them.
- We just had dinner with two people

171
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,160
and talked to them, didn't we?

172
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,164
We're all in the same boat,
aren't we?

173
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,563
No, I'm sorry. No.

174
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,898
Sure, they're nice and kind,
whatever you want,

175
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,698
but they used to be
your ex-employees.

176
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,763
It doesn't make much difference
for them to be cooks or laborers,

177
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,433
but it does for you, damn it!

178
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,739
You don't go out anymore.
You don't see anybody anymore.

179
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,210
How do you see it then?

180
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,804
You suggest I go and take a course
for unemployed managers?

181
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,611
Is that how you see it?

182
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,892
I've had another job offer,
as secretary

183
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,228
in a naval brokers' office

184
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,733
from 6:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.

185
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,965
They pay well and I can still keep
the call center job.

186
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,303
And what about
your restoring work?

187
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,901
How can you even think
I can keep that on?!

188
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:21,231
When a fax or email arrives,

189
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,597
all you have to do is
advise whoever's on duty.

190
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:25,363
If they ask you
to take it to them, do it,

191
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:27,461
otherwise put it
with the incoming mail.

192
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,472
Then there's the telephone.

193
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,100
If it rings at this hour, 90% of the time
you'll have to speak English.

194
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:33,803
But you don't have problem, right?

195
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,812
No problem at all.

196
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,905
I'm available to help
you with anything.

197
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,609
I'm just pregnant, not sick.

198
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,413
Call whenever you want, okay?

199
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:45,115
For example, this is a draft
of the Hong Kong contract.

200
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,123
We have to notify Salviati
right away.

201
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:49,625
He's the agent on duty
in the evening.

202
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,628
- Why don't you call him?
- Me?

203
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:54,358
Yes. Dial extension 3-2-5.

204
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,230
- 3-2-5.
- Perfect.

205
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,928
- Salviati?
- Salviati.

206
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,937
I'm making a hot drink.
Would you like something?

207
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,439
- Yes, a coffee, thanks.
- One for me too, thanks.

208
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,635
Oh, I apologize,
I didn't hear you answer.

209
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,406
- This is not Cristina.
- No, I'm her substitute,

210
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,913
- but I start tomorrow.
- Oh, yes! Because of the baby.

211
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:14,383
- Well, good luck then.
- Thanks, good luck to you too.

212
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,046
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

213
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,289
- Yes?
- Salviati speaking.

214
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,529
- How may I help you?
- Did you need anything when you called?

215
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:32,967
Oh yes,

216
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,631
the draft of the Hong Kong
contract has arrived.

217
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:38,198
Yes, good. I'll check it later.

218
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:41,370
- Keep it there, please.
- Of course. That's fine, sir.

219
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:44,108
How stupid of me.

220
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,682
- Here. How many sugars?
- One.

221
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,392
- You answer. It'll be Salviati.
- Me?

222
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,291
Again?

223
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,953
- Yes?
- It's me again.

224
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,225
You didn't tell me your name.

225
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,824
- Elsa.
- Thank you, Elsa.

226
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,028
You're welcome.
Good evening.

227
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:11,075
Thanks.

228
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,007
...an estimate since
the job will last more.

229
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,637
- Hi. Good evening, Vito.
- Good evening, ma'am.

230
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,409
I'm sorry it's so late.
We're almost done.

231
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,041
How did it go?

232
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:22,052
I'm dead tired,

233
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,350
but go ahead.
I'm going to bed.

234
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:27,016
Remember the retired man,
the one with the dog? The nice one?

235
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:30,492
- He's asked us to do his kitchen over.
- Really?

236
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:31,653
He thinks we're professionals.

237
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,890
Really? Poor guy!

238
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:37,423
- Not because of you, Vito.
- Because of me.

239
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:39,265
So?

240
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:42,795
So let's add another half-day, sir.

241
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,865
- Four, five hours, not more.
- Yeah.

242
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,877
- That should be enough.
- So how much should we ask for then?

243
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:49,845
I'm no good at this.

244
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,383
Don't worry, I'll do it.

245
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,021
It's far.
The office is at the port.

246
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,565
Yes?

247
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,788
Careful, Luciano.

248
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:34,689
Sir, did Luciano tell
you the news?

249
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,159
- What news?
- He's going to be a grandfather.

250
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:38,923
Congratulations, Luciano!

251
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:41,157
Yes. Too bad there's no father.

252
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:42,859
Luciano, come on.

253
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:46,233
As my wife would say,
that's not necessarily a disadvantage.

254
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,397
You need to introduce me
to your wife.

255
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:51,339
- Sure.
- Good morning, sir.

256
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,671
Good morning.
How are things going?

257
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:54,142
Pretty well, I'd say.

258
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,409
We put everything
in the middle, like you said,

259
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,847
and we're putting
the shelf in the hall.

260
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:02,147
Yes, but no more
than two days though.

261
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,383
Sure, unless you want us
to give the bathroom a coat of paint.

262
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:08,050
It wouldn't hurt.

263
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,390
- I can't spend any more money.
- We'll meet you halfway...

264
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,157
Since we're already at it.

265
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,756
Believe me. Let's go take
a look at the bathroom.

266
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,495
- Seriously.
- Let's take a look at it.

267
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,477
It will only be
one more day at the most.

268
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:33,310
Certainly with a nice coat of paint...

269
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,249
Look at the mold.

270
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:40,549
- It's not load-bearing, is it?
- Luciano.

271
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,222
Bye, see you later.

272
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,097
How much time do we have?

273
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:54,035
I have to be
at the office by 6:00.

274
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,868
We can go for a stroll
in the town center.

275
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,033
No. I'm going to
take you somewhere.

276
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,207
- Feel like it?
- Yes.

277
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,926
You can give it
to me next time.

278
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:22,261
I want you to read it right away.
I only have half a page left.

279
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:34,135
Done.

280
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,612
It's wonderful.

281
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,743
Thanks.

282
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,582
It's been so long
since I last came here.

283
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:51,184
I didn't remember
how beautiful it was.

284
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:54,197
Nadia came
to the bistro yesterday.

285
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:56,961
Why don't you call her?
She's your friend. She cares about you.

286
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:59,594
I know, but right now

287
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,729
everything exhausts me.

288
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:08,640
How's Dad?

289
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:11,682
Pretty good.

290
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:14,946
He's doing odd jobs
with Vito and Luciano.

291
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,317
- His former employees?
- Yes.

292
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:20,551
They paint, put up shelves.

293
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:23,024
I don't know how he feels.

294
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,892
They called him for an interview,
a cookie factory.

295
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:28,227
Let's hope it goes well.

296
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,761
And how are you?

297
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,931
So-so.

298
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,943
What about you?
Everything okay with Riki?

299
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,775
Yes.

300
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:47,144
When you finish the book,
will you give it to Dad?

301
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:51,086
Yes. Except by the time I finish it,

302
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:54,147
it'll be Easter.

303
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,985
Goodbye.

304
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:26,286
- Good morning.
- Good morning, ma'am.

305
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:29,326
- Can I help you?
- I'd like some ricotta.

306
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:31,418
How much?

307
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:33,429
- There's two of us.
- 200g?

308
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,965
Sure.

309
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,660
By the way,

310
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,032
are you Mr. Oliveri?

311
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:40,730
Yes.

312
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:44,138
Mr. Terzetti was very pleased

313
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,903
with the work
you did at his house.

314
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:48,171
I'm glad.

315
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:50,770
Are you expensive?

316
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:52,509
I wouldn't say so.

317
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,108
I need to repaper my living room

318
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,211
and put up shelves,
but my budget's limited.

319
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,550
How much will it cost?

320
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:01,989
If you want,
I'll come and make an estimate.

321
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,721
I live on the same floor
as Terzetti.

322
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:07,059
Would you like anything else?

323
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:10,066
I need some bread.

324
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,036
Thank you.

325
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:34,588
- May I come in?
- Yes.

326
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:38,895
Here's the pizza and the beer.

327
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,397
Thank you.
Please give it to me.

328
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,700
Thank you.
Yes, put it there.

329
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:49,900
Don't go away.
Please stay.

330
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,272
Are you hungry?
Did you order one for you as well?

331
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:54,243
I've already eaten, thanks.

332
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:57,610
Really? When?
At 7:00 like kids do?

333
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:00,047
It's 9:30 now.

334
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,846
I'll cut a slice for you.

335
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,581
- No, thanks, really.
- A sip of beer then.

336
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:07,451
All right.

337
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:13,156
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

338
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:16,895
Sit down.

339
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:25,038
Thanks.

340
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,742
Those are our ships
going around the world.

341
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,310
Lucky them!

342
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:43,118
- Do you like traveling?
- Yes, a lot.

343
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:45,492
I don't like it at all.

344
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:47,963
- No? Really?
- Yes.

345
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:49,659
You never travel?

346
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,928
All the time.

347
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:54,664
I'm always going around the world
chasing something...

348
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:56,832
often ships.

349
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:03,312
Where are you from?

350
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,314
I was born in Cagliari.

351
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:07,316
I won't tell you the rest,

352
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,284
it would bore you.

353
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:11,878
I've lived in too many
different places.

354
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:15,520
And then you ended up here.

355
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:18,688
Better than many places.

356
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:27,000
So I chase
and you run away,

357
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,663
but, in the end, here we are.

358
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,969
Does it look like
I'm running away?

359
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:33,438
No, it seemed like it.

360
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,741
Anyway, you look nice.

361
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:38,076
You think so?

362
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:42,513
This isn't one
of the best periods of my life.

363
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,295
No no no. What's wrong?

364
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,462
Oh, God.

365
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:03,801
What now?

366
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:33,563
Hi. What time is it?

367
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:35,798
Almost midnight.

368
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:38,706
The car broke down.
I left it in the middle of the road.

369
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:44,412
Fuck. What was the problem?

370
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,312
I don't know.
It started making noises

371
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:47,850
and then
the engine stopped.

372
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:50,409
- I had to take a taxi.
- Why didn't you call me?

373
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:53,115
What would you have done?

374
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:17,003
Alice's book is great.

375
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,481
The stories are lovely.

376
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,916
Why don't you tell her so?

377
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:24,453
What did you do today?

378
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:30,353
Nothing.

379
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:42,162
We could do it in two days.

380
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,833
The lady said she'd like it
all done for next Saturday.

381
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:46,808
Yes, but I don't want
to do it wrong.

382
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:50,711
I've never done it before.
Does it take longer with wallpaper?

383
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,181
The living room is
more or less the size of Terzetti's.

384
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,582
- Listen, I have to tell you something.
- Tell me.

385
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:57,449
Luciano didn't come today

386
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,422
because he was hired
at the shipyards,

387
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:02,959
the Voltri shipyards.

388
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,824
- A job?
- Finally.

389
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:08,421
- Good for him.
- At least he has a secure job.

390
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:12,433
Well then,
it's just the two of us.

391
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:14,494
I wanted to tell you
that they hired me too.

392
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:15,936
I start Monday.

393
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:25,848
I'm really sorry, Michele.

394
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,749
- Seriously.
- It's better this way, better for you.

395
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,844
No problem at all, Vito.

396
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:32,271
So how is it going?

397
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:35,182
- Fine.
- How nice!

398
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,880
- Would you like a coffee?
- Why not?

399
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:39,354
I'll have it ready soon.

400
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:42,017
- Thanks, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

401
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:39,733
What the fuck am I doing?

402
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,569
Here they are!

403
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:54,105
You didn't need to come
all the way here.

404
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:57,881
Next time you can make a transfer
with the bank, as usual.

405
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:02,620
Okay. Goodbye.

406
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:08,395
- How are you?
- It's Michele, Dad.

407
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:12,094
I know you're Michele.

408
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,194
So how are you?

409
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:16,364
So-so.

410
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,465
Some issues at work.

411
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,635
I'm not doing
that great either.

412
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,805
By now it's the others
who tell me when I'm well.

413
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:28,013
I have to trust them.

414
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:32,286
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore, Dad.

415
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,749
It isn't just work.

416
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:39,387
Everything has become
so difficult and exhausting.

417
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,121
Elsa looks at me
but doesn't see me.

418
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,724
I'm like a ghost.

419
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:47,770
- Elsa?
- Yes, Elsa.

420
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:49,999
There she is, see her?

421
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,837
The almost white one,
with the long tail.

422
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:55,673
Do you see her?

423
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,180
That's Elsa.

424
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:02,845
Now she's coming to the center
and you can see her better.

425
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,945
Look.

426
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,467
The apartment needs tidying.
It's a big mess.

427
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:23,062
I ironed your shirt.

428
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,871
Come on get up, please.
It's late.

429
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:28,604
Michele!

430
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:30,509
Go there by taxi.

431
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,343
Is the car ready?

432
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:35,680
It's fucked. They wanted
1,600 euros to fix it, so I just left it.

433
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:38,585
Perfect.

434
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:43,958
- What's that?
- What do you think it is? It's the doorbell.

435
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:45,517
It's the first time I've heard it!

436
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:48,359
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

437
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:56,097
- Yes?
- Good morning, I'm Bianca Carminati.

438
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:57,401
I'm looking for Mr. Oliveri.

439
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:58,907
He's my husband.

440
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,909
Isn't he feeling well?

441
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,672
Why? Yes.

442
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:06,614
He was working in my apartment,
but he disappeared two days ago.

443
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:10,084
The place is a mess, and my
granddaughter's communion is on Sunday.

444
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:12,212
I even have relatives
coming from Asiago!

445
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:14,382
Excuse me,
where is your husband?

446
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,584
Here, this is
the advance you gave me,

447
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,628
and this is for your trouble.

448
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:19,957
You'd better look
for someone else.

449
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,022
What are you doing?
You're dumping me like garbage?

450
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:25,693
What can I do in two days?

451
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,431
You're very rude.
I'll report you!

452
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,941
Don't you have
anything to tell me?

453
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:47,717
All right. Good luck
with your interview then.

454
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:05,665
Yes?

455
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,371
Hello?

456
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,948
# 10 seconds ago #

457
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:24,960
# I closed a contract
with Hong Kong. #

458
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:26,552
Congratulations!

459
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,791
I've been working on it
for eight months.

460
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:31,060
Eight months is a long time.
We must celebrate.

461
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:33,967
- Shall we go drink to that?
- But I haven't finished.

462
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:36,267
That's enough for tonight.
I give you permission.

463
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:39,467
Let's have a toast
and then I'll take you home.

464
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:40,804
Okay?

465
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,976
Okay.

466
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:46,879
- Where's your coat?
- Here.

467
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:54,586
- My coat's there.
- Yes.

468
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,631
I shouldn't?

469
00:35:57,087 --> 00:36:00,784
- Hello.
- Hello.

470
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:02,620
What's that?

471
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:05,183
It squashes bottles.

472
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:17,801
- What for?
- To save space.

473
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,301
Didn't you go
to the interview this morning?

474
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,401
No.

475
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:03,850
- Are you going to keep on doing this?
- Why?

476
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:27,971
- Michele, this isn't right.
- What?

477
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:30,604
Nothing.
Even the bathtub's disgusting.

478
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,615
- You were the last to use it.
- I really don't think so.

479
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:35,742
You don't believe
anything I say anymore!

480
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:37,912
If I say that's what it is,
you'd better fucking believe it!

481
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:39,716
Will you stop yelling at me?

482
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:42,587
I'm out all day,
I come home dead tired. Do l...

483
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:44,627
Do you want me
to welcome you with applause?

484
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:47,527
- Asshole!
- Sure, you're the one who works.

485
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:49,963
You now support the family.
It's you now!

486
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:53,799
Have you looked at yourself?
You don't give a damn about anything!

487
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,464
The house is disgusting!
You don't make the slightest effort!

488
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:58,200
You don't even
go to interviews anymore!

489
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,708
Can I decide if it's worthwhile
going to an interview?

490
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:03,302
All you can do is lie
on the fucking couch and sleep!

491
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:06,371
- You're ridiculous.
- What do you think you are?

492
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,440
Can't you see
what you've become?

493
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,577
You're like an amoeba, spineless.

494
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,890
Do you want to hit me
like you did with Alice?

495
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,220
Fuck off.
Do you want me to hit you?

496
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,487
- Is that what you want?
- Let me go!

497
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,119
Nobody's forcing us
to stay together!

498
00:38:20,196 --> 00:38:22,426
Couples separate for a lot less.

499
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:24,899
I feel your relief
when you leave the house.

500
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:27,766
And I stay here jerking off
like when I was 15!

501
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,737
But I don't think of you.

502
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:32,673
If I did, I'd lose my hard-on!

503
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,670
Good morning.

504
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:44,713
- Passable night?
- Yes, fine.

505
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,377
If you need the bathroom,
you'd better wait a minute.

506
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:51,284
Anyhow, I left you a clean towel.

507
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:54,378
Is Alice asleep?

508
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,652
Yes, she came home at 2:00.

509
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:59,490
She said we should've called her,
but I think we did the right thing not to.

510
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:05,092
Riki, thanks for not asking too many
questions. I appreciate the discretion.

511
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:07,636
I never liked poking
my nose in other people's shit.

512
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,935
I bought croissants,
but you'll need to make the coffee.

513
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,270
I have to go.

514
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:15,208
Okay, thanks.

515
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:17,712
Have a nice day.

516
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,510
If you happen to come this way again,
you're welcome.

517
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,313
- Bye.
- Bye.

518
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:50,107
Hi, Dad.

519
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:54,911
Is breakfast included?

520
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:57,350
Sure, bed and breakfast.

521
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:05,526
Not much fun
to come home dead tired

522
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:08,723
and find your asshole
of a father on the couch.

523
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:11,333
Did you fight?

524
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:14,302
Yes. Where are the cups?

525
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,134
Is it serious, Dad?

526
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,838
Yes.

527
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,038
Sit down,
I'll get the cups.

528
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,650
Where were you, in Sardinia?

529
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,517
No, in Corsica, near Ajaccio.

530
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:36,115
- Beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

531
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:45,990
Now tell me,
does he bring them every morning?

532
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:49,004
More or less. Why?

533
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:50,972
No, nothing.

534
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,838
He's nice.

535
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,571
Who would have thought, huh?

536
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:45,877
Nadia, hi. Forgive me.

537
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:48,389
I didn't call you.

538
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:51,791
I disappeared again,

539
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:55,297
but I'd be really glad
to see you.

540
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:57,423
Will you call me
when you can?

541
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:00,762
Bye.

542
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:21,381
Yes? Good morning.

543
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:23,425
Good morning, ma'am.
Your husband?

544
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:25,358
He isn't in.

545
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,589
- Did he find a job?
- No no no.

546
00:44:27,663 --> 00:44:30,291
I'm sorry.
I'll come back tomorrow.

547
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:33,995
- For a second, I thought that...
- I wish.

548
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,834
You see, ma'am,

549
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:39,067
I've lived here for 10 years.

550
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:41,075
My washing machine's broken

551
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:43,611
and your husband is
the only person

552
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,046
I could ask a favor of.

553
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:53,786
If you want, I can do it.

554
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:56,051
No, don't worry about it.

555
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,958
Could I have the... back?

556
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:01,724
What? Oh, this? Sure.

557
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:03,788
Thank you.

558
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:06,733
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye.

559
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:16,042
Dad, leave it!

560
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:17,943
Oh, I see.

561
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:23,281
- How pretty you are.
- Thanks.

562
00:45:23,352 --> 00:45:25,980
I'm going to the accountant
this afternoon.

563
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:27,750
We have to make
some decisions.

564
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:31,384
They say we should invest
because of taxation problems.

565
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,360
I don't envy you.

566
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:36,591
Dad...

567
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,691
why don't you give us a hand?

568
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:40,702
I've never been
a genius at accounting.

569
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,295
Neither have we.

570
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:49,338
- Will you drive?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,022
- Michele. Hi.
- Hi.

572
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:09,656
- How are you?
- Fine.

573
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:15,064
- Hi, Adele.
- Hi.

574
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:18,765
- Hi.
- Hi.

575
00:46:24,046 --> 00:46:26,173
Minestrone tonight too?

576
00:46:26,248 --> 00:46:28,375
- I think so.
- Can't you smell it?

577
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:33,678
- Is he cooking some fried stuff tonight?
- I hope not.

578
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:37,123
- I need a hand.
- Here.

579
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:44,625
Dad, I'm sorry,
but we need to set the table.

580
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,258
It's a mess, right?

581
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:48,200
It's gratifying.

582
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,171
In this chaos,
I almost feel like a genius.

583
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,003
We really suck at this, huh?

584
00:46:53,075 --> 00:46:55,168
I think you've had
some bad advice.

585
00:46:55,244 --> 00:46:56,302
Why?

586
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:58,006
Before investing
without a reason,

587
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,379
you could do simpler things.

588
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,248
Anyway, I've made a little
financial plan for you.

589
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,754
I'm leaving it here for you.
We can discuss it later.

590
00:47:06,822 --> 00:47:08,050
Of course, with pleasure.

591
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:10,649
Would you like to come
to the accountant's with us?

592
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:13,661
Yes, but not today.

593
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:38,542
Just one?

594
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:43,645
Now we'll see him again.

595
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,744
Where is he going?

596
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:53,653
- Hello?
- Did you call him?

597
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:17,412
Nicola...

598
00:49:17,486 --> 00:49:18,851
Gagliano!

599
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:21,014
That was the name
of my second mate on the Victoria.

600
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,958
Nicola Gagliano.

601
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:51,112
That's fine. If that's okay,
I'll give them a call.

602
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:53,587
Yes, don't worry.

603
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:56,181
You too, thanks.

604
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:58,021
Goodbye for now.

605
00:49:58,093 --> 00:50:00,118
Mr. Rinaldi called.

606
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:02,824
He wants you to call
him back. It's urgent.

607
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:06,390
Rinaldi, what a fucking bore!
Okay, I'll call him,

608
00:50:06,468 --> 00:50:10,131
then if you like
we can go for a drink.

609
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:12,640
I can't this evening.
I have to go somewhere.

610
00:50:15,411 --> 00:50:16,901
I'll take you if you like.

611
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:19,140
No, thanks. Really.

612
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:23,013
All right,
see you tomorrow then.

613
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:25,349
Tomorrow is Saturday.

614
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:27,252
You're right.

615
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:31,049
You're free to go then.

616
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,253
Thanks.
Have a nice evening.

617
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,249
Good evening.
Banchi Square.

618
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:24,474
We thought the color
had faded completely,

619
00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:28,448
but actually
it's been left in sinopia.

620
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:31,884
It's as if he had to stop
at a certain point.

621
00:51:31,954 --> 00:51:33,615
Maybe his illness.

622
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:35,350
Elsa, you're back!

623
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:37,688
- Professor.
- Good evening, Elsa.

624
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,321
Look! Isn't it marvelous?

625
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:54,206
Congratulations.
Wonderful intuition.

626
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:56,744
The brushwork
and the colors,

627
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:58,837
even the angel's face
has a lot in common

628
00:51:58,914 --> 00:52:00,848
with his female figures.

629
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,441
But I think it's really the landscape

630
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,113
- that eliminates all doubt.
- It's the light, isn't it?

631
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:11,252
It's the light of your Boniforte.

632
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:13,625
Good job.

633
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:17,223
Elsa, we're going to have a drink,

634
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:19,494
and we've convinced
the professor to join us.

635
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:21,160
What are you doing?

636
00:52:21,236 --> 00:52:23,204
I'd like to stay
for a moment.

637
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,763
- Are you going
to the usual bar?
- Come on, will you join us?

638
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:28,867
Will you lock up?
You have the keys, anyway.

639
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:31,412
- Yes.
- Enjoy this moment. You deserve it.

640
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:23,087
I'm really ashamed
of what happened yesterday.

641
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,223
Me too.

642
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,595
I thought things could go back
to the way they were,

643
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:34,534
but it's not true.
I realized it's a mistake to look back.

644
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:40,034
I don't even know
how we got where we are.

645
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:46,107
I thought nothing
could separate us.

646
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:48,615
It's not true.

647
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,116
I can't lose you, Elsa.

648
00:54:57,192 --> 00:54:59,319
When I look ahead lately,
I only see endless strain,

649
00:54:59,394 --> 00:55:01,555
an unbelievable strain.

650
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,598
We have to take it from here.

651
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:06,395
I'll come up with something.
I'll start from scratch...

652
00:55:06,468 --> 00:55:08,732
I don't care...
but not without you.

653
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:10,567
Without you,
I'm going nowhere.

654
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:29,717
You arrived right
when I was thinking

655
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,589
that the only thing I wanted
was to have you here.

656
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:37,088
It is you, right?

657
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,827
It's me, Elsa.

658
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,563
Unfortunately, it's really me.

659
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:47,405
Me too.
